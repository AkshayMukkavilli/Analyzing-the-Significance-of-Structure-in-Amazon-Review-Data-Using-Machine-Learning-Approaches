 I hate to do it. Honestly, I do. The case was great and fit my Toshiba Satellite snug and securely. Plenty of pockets for the mouse, USB cords, the charger, etc. Plenty of room. Life was good.<br/><br/>Then it happened. The strap unclipped itself while I was leaving my office this afternoon. You see, they are intended to be free spinning, typical straps. Except when it doesn't twist, it will come off. Another review I read mentioned this. "Nah, that's just a once in a blue moon scenario" I told myself after reading it. I shuddered the same phrase as I watched the case fall corner first. Not even enough time to realize what had happened, as it was only hanging from my shoulder....<br/><br/>Opened the bag to find my 850 dollar laptop with a dented frame and shattered screen. That was hours ago, and now here I am. Return processed and a backpack ordered. Just get a backpack, It's not worth the risk to your electronics. There isn't enough padding. Learn from my mistakes! Look at the carnage and don't let it happen to yours!!
 At first it seemed to be amazing . So thought wow amazon great job , full of padding and somewhat full of protection. well to my surprise as i was walking with my laptop on campus the strap broke off and the bag fell on the floor . damaging badly my new laptop. i can say i was very upset. its a good bag but Amazon please make a better job with the strap
 I bought this about a year ago but only used it for probably the equivalent of 3 months before the strap broke. I was using it to carry a laptop weighing 2.62 pounds, an iPad 2, and occasionally an iPad mini.  I only carried the bag to and from the car at home or at work, so never a long distance. Yet despite limited use the strap still broke. Fortunately the laptop and tablets did not seem to have any damage, and it helped  that the bag fell on carpet when I was bending over, but I wouldn't expect the strap to break at all given the limited use. The quality seemed better at first, and indeed it's fine with everything else, but the strap didn't hold up well.<br/><br/>I suggesting checking the strap endpoints on a regular basis if you buy Amazon bags.
 I haven't had much real world usage for the bag yet but here are my preliminary thoughts.<br/><br/>I purchased this for my 15" Acer Chromebook.  The size if perfect for the Chromebook.  The zippers appear relatively sturdy enough for the purpose and the extra pockets are nicely size for carrying documents, smaller items, etc...  The strap also appears to be sturdy enough and the plastic clips look like they hold up.<br/><br/>Padding - here is why I am only giving 4 stars.<br/><br/>The size padding is good but the bottom padding is a bit lacking.  This is really the only fault I see is the lack of padding on the bottom and bottom\sides.<br/><br/>I had a piece of foam I cut down, placed at the bottom and now I think the Chromebook will be a bit better protected.<br/><br/>Overall I think that the bag is very good and just a bit more padding would give it the extra star.
 The shoulder strap on the bag simply popped loose one day, causing my laptop to make fast friends with the concrete and breaking the laptop.
 This bag has two significant problems that really should be addressed.<br/><br/>Firstly, the padding is insufficient in the bottom corners.  There is enough padding at the bottom and sides, but almost no padding at the corners, which are the most vulnerable points on your laptop.<br/><br/>Secondly, the shoulder strap attaches to the bag with two plastic clips, and they can let go when least expected, especially when the strap was a little twisted before picking it up.  This has happened to me on multiple occasions.<br/><br/>The combination of these two problems has led to my laptop suffering corner damage from falling onto pavement when I picked up my bag by the strap, and it decided to let go.<br/><br/>If you have a nice laptop, this is an accident waiting to happen.
 This review is about the 14 Inch AmazonBasics Laptop Bag<br/>This is a good budget laptop case. The Toshiba Chromebook 2 fits perfectly along with the computer charger and extra phone chargers. It does what I need with a price tag I like.<br/><br/>PROS: For carrying around and storing a feather weight Chromebook, a couple chargers, and sometimes my Kindle, it gets the job done. It has a ton of pockets and the bag itself is really lightweight. It's inexpensive. It's simple.<br/><br/>CONS: This doesn't feel like the most expensive bag on the market, and as other reviewers stated, it could have some more padding. This would not be a good choice for someone who travels for work, the plastic clips and minimal padding simply won't stand up against baggage claim on a regular basis. This would also be a poor choice a Macbook Pro or any other fancy laptop. Just use good judgement-- if you plan on spending 1K+ on a laptop, prepare on spending more than $16 on a laptop bag.
 I LOVE this bag.  Right now I keep my MacBook Pro, 2nd gen iPad, a kindle touch, all the charging gear, and still have room to throw in my bulky planner when I need it. With all that, it's still sleek and lightweight. I bought a little case for my wireless ear buds so I can clip it to the side and it's the perfect setup. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JB1LGTI/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_19
 Nice basic bag, I think the only thing I wish it had was a padded slot for the laptop to fit in.  As it is, in the main compartment, there are 2 compartments made of a thinner fabric, so the laptop (or mine, anyway since it's a bit wider than normal) has to go in the middle with your power cord and accessories next to it.<br/><br/>Edit: So this bag didn't last past 2 months.  The shoulder pad thing on the strap started fraying and falling off after 1 month of use and the no padding inside really didn't make me feel comfortable using to carry my laptop.  I only ever carried the laptop in the bag, so I guess it can't hold up to the weight of a laptop.
 I just realized I've been using this laptop bag for over 3 years and have a love hate relationship with it.  I hate certain things about it, but still find it useful enough to keep, but I admit I've been shopping around for a new bag.  I initially bought this as a cheap and light bag to hold my 15" MacBook pro.  I didn't think I would be carrying it around too often, so I didn't care much about aesthetics and function.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-The bag has held up pretty well over 3.5 years.  I haven't had any rips or issues with the zippers.<br/>-It's small and light-weight, but surprising can hold quite a bit because the material can expand.  I can carry a laptop, tablet, notepad, chargers, headphones and even a bottle of water.<br/>-It's inexpensive.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-I absolutely hate the shoulder strap.  The padding shifts around and is uncomfortable to carry around for more than a minute or two.<br/>-The small inside pockets have no zippers or velcro and my accessories and business cards are always falling out.<br/>-I've grown to be embarrassed of how this bag looks.  I didn't plan on bringing it on business meetings as much as I have, but feel it's not professional looking enough for the line of work I do.  I'm looking to upgrade to something that looks better as well as has the other features I want:  more comfortable shoulder strap, better pockets for accessories.
 What can I say? These Amazon basic products are fabulous deals. I purchased the amazon Basic bluetooth receiver, a mere $20,  some months back to use with Alexa and my vintage stereo system and I am very pleased. I had low expectations and it is everything I need and want flawlessly. So with that experience, I decided to order this Amazon Basics 11-inch laptop case for my new Asus Chromebook.  I was not expecting much for $10, but got much more than I expected! This case checks all the boxes and is everything you need. It is well padded all the way around, sides, edges, everything. It has the big main opening with zipper closure, which also has two fabric dividers or pockets if you will on both sides. One slips their laptop or Chromebook in between I assume. On the outside on one side it has two zippered pockets. One pocket (the larger one) has padding on both sides and slots for pens and two small inner pockets on one side. The smaller zippered pocket outside the larger one is not padded in front and is just a plain pocket. The back of the bag has a large strap and two small straps on either side. The handles for this bag are also well made. It also comes with a stout removable shoulder strap.<br/>This is much more bag than $10 would normally get you. Well done Amazon!
 Fits the 2018 3rd gen iPad 12.9" VERY well (including with Smart Folio/keyboard), just a TINY smidge too long to qualify for bonefide "glove" fit, but darn near close.<br/><br/>Bag is a phenomenal value for the price. Excellent quality and construction. Way above average on the Chinese goods scale.<br/>Incredible amount of storage/pockets-compartments. Room to keep lots of things, and keep them separated to boot .<br/><br/>Only cons I can find is I do agree to some extent what other reviewer's have said about the low padding amount at the bottom, but there is some padding ( I have seen other Chinese manufactured bags with NONE ). Shoulder strap looks a bit on the cheap side, so I am not completely shocked  at the negative reviews regarding it breaking/failing and causing expensive damage to enclosed tablets/laptops; this is a nice quality bag, but it is on the soft side and not meant for hard core protection from a fall/drop. If you travel a lot (airport security for one), or tend to drop things, a more expensive bag much more geared toward shock resistance is probably warranted. But for most of us casual users, carrying this bag by the briefcase style handles, this is a great utilitarian bag with classic looks and materials that will work wonderfully at an incredible bargain price. Highly recommend.
 This is a great bag and if you consider its low price, it is an unbelievably great bag.<br/><br/>Black fabric is durable and would be easy to clean if you will need to. It is not one to attract dirt to begin with.<br/>There is a padding in it to protect main compartment.<br/><br/>That main compartment divided into 2 sections, one of which easily fits a 14 inch laptop, Amazon Kindle and a large phone if needed. Second section can be used to keep a notepad or stack of Letter-format papers without folding those sheets.<br/>There is also a smaller pocket in that main compartment, where you can store keys, small mirror, memory sticks, documents etc.<br/><br/>No, I would not advise to put an apple or a sandwich there. Banana, at most.<br/><br/>The front compartment can hold notepad, multiple pen, keys, passes, and earphones. It has 3 dedicated small pockets and holders for 2 pens.<br/><br/>And there is a third area - a front pocket, where for your stuff you want to have handy.<br/><br/>Both compartments and a front pocket are protected by plastic zippers of a good quality.<br/><br/>On the back side of the bag there is a strap to help you to put it in the handle of your travel luggage bag.<br/><br/>Bag has handles and comes with the shoulder strap with a shoulder pad on it. Shoulder strap has plastic latches to attach to the plastic rings of the bag.<br/><br/>And this bag is very light.<br/><br/>When I think of what would be changed in that bag to make it much better, I can not find anything.<br/>Slightly softer shoulder pad, metallic latches and metallic zippers instead of plastic ones would not make it MUCH better, but that would make it to join the crowd of the very expensive bags. No, thank you. It is a perfect bag as it is.
 i don't understand the negative reviews of the 11.6 inch size.  They must have changed the design.<br/><br/>IMO, if the carrying strap is fastened properly with the hook facing outward (the listing photo and most people hook it backward,) that hook won't become detached without breaking it.  If you are still concerned, get a strap at Goodwill for an old time 10# laptop carrying case.<br/><br/>Swing the case by the straps with a 5 pound load inside, or drop it without the laptop properly inserted, and the impact with wall or ground could be substantial.  No soft side case can absorb a point impact.  It has no way to distribute them, so I don't recommend this case for expensive contents or that weighs more than 3 pounds.  A $300 or less Chromebook should be ok.<br/><br/>There is 1/2 of padding on the pocket side and 1/4 over the rest of the case. Insert a laptop hinge side first with the display side facing the front. Put the laptop in the center section of the largest compartment and there's room to insert a magazine or paper pad on either side for more impact resistance. A child could fit homework in those side sections.<br/><br/>I'm happy with what I got today,  but will amend this review if anything changes after a few months of abuse.<br/><br/>Here's a comparison of the plastic hook, one from an old $120 Dell Laptop case, and one from a new $85 messenger bag.
 This bag has an extra zippered pocket for the "Aibocn Upgraded Multi-Angle Aluminum Stand for Tablets" I just also purchased.  You really can't go wrong with items that are marked with "Amazon's Choice". I plan to place this case in my carry-on luggage during flights and I tend to pamper my electronic devices so this case will likely never see harsh treatment from me. The orange interior is pure genius as it make finding small items very easy.  I also want to point out that my Amazon Fire HD 10 (7th Generation) fits comfortably in this case.  Full disclosure:  My Fire HD 10 is in the Amazon Fire HD 10 Tablet Case.  The tablet in the case fits comfortable in this bag. I'd say a few inches of extra room in the height, length and width of this bag when the Fire HD 10 in its case is zipped into this bag.
 One the worst purchase I made in Amazon. I regret buying this. Bought this for a family member who had purchased new laptop and was leaving out of the country. The bag came on the day of leaving. As they were walking out of security check the shoulder strap came off the laptop fell on the ground and the brand new laptop is broken (DVD not working, big dents). They are in a different country with a broken laptop and this crappy bag with no way to return the laptop or the bag. This was the only 17 in bag that was available on prime and now I know it's a bad mistake. I hope no one would buy this and go through what we went through.
 Be aware that the strap on this bag can get bound up and unhook causing the bag to fall from your shoulder. This has now happened to me twice and one laptop has been damaged do to this poor design. Its a nice bag beside the poor quality of the over the shoulder carry strap.
 I thought this bag was a great deal when I got it.  A few weeks after I got it, I was carrying it over my shoulder when one end of the strap disconnected from the loop on the bag and it fell to the ground.  My laptop wasn't actually in it at the time, and I figured maybe I had somehow not made sure the strap was firmly connected.  So I put it back on, making sure it was totally secure.<br/><br/>So today I get out of my car, put the bag over my shoulder, and the strap disconnects again on the same side.  My bag fell to the ground in the parking lot.  My 1 week old MacBook Pro now has two dents and several scratches on the back corner, and flickers when starting up (though it does appear to work).  I'd like to say I'll never buy from Amazon again but that's not true; I will, however, never buy anything Amazon-branded again.
 I bought both this, and the Targus Intellect Slipcase for 12.1-inch Laptops at the same time (http://amzn.com/B00BZC09KS), because I wanted to test them both for my Microsoft Surface Pro 3. The Targus was very nice also, and it was a tough decision.  But I ended up keeping the Amazon bag and sending the Targus back.  I have posted the same review for both items.<br/><br/>Here are the reasons I liked the Amazon bag.<br/><br/>- Fit my Microsoft Surface Pro 3 perfectly.  The Targus is slightly bigger, so the Pro fits in there nicely as well, but I was going for the smallest fit possible that still held my desired items.<br/><br/>- Better made than the Targus. Nice shoulder strap, and the zippers are solid metal and zip/unzip very smooth.  The Targus felt cheaper, though it is more expensive.<br/><br/>- Strap on the back that allows you to slide it over the handles of a rolling overhead luggage bag.  (The Targus listing, as well as the instructions that came with the Targus claims it has this feature as well, but inexplicably, the bag I received does *not* have these straps.)<br/><br/>- The Amazon bag is half the price as the Targus bag.<br/><br/>Now, regarding fit.  I won't say that it is a tight fit, because everything I need fits into the Amazon bag perfectly.  But if you have a large amount of extra travel items, this may not work for you.  I will list the items that I have fit into the Amazon bag comfortably:<br/><br/>Main pocket:<br/>- Surface Pro 3<br/>- Small writing notebook<br/>- Kindle paperwhite<br/><br/>Big side pocket:<br/>- HDMI adapter<br/>- Two pens (include the touch pen)<br/>- Stack of business cards<br/>- Flash drive<br/>- USB adapter for multiple USB ports<br/>- Small battery backup for my pone<br/><br/>Small side pocket:<br/>- Surface power cord<br/><br/>It seems like a lot, but most of those items are pretty small, so take that into consideration.  For instance, I probably wouldn't be able to get my USB mouse into the bag easily. It is the small side pocket where I place the power cord that is the tightest fit.  I can't just shove the power cord into the pocket, I have to wrap up the cable nicely and then slide it into the pocket.<br/><br/>So, if you are worried about space, take this into consideration.  In that case, I would strongly recommend the Targus bag.  Even though I sent it back, I would have been happy with that one as well.  The way the side pocket of the Targus is designed, you could fit significantly more into the side pocket than you can with the Amazon bag, at only slightly more bulk overall.<br/><br/>If you have a Surface Pro 3, I think you will be happy with either bag.  But for me, the Amazon bag gets 5 stars, the Targus 4.
 I was able to fit everything I need for my Surface Pro 3 in this bag, however it's a very tight fit. If the front pocket were slightly bigger, I'd give it a full 5 stars, but its just small enough to be inconveniently snug when anything thicker than a 1/4 to 1/2 inch is put in there. Nonetheless, I managed to fit all of the following in this bag:<br/>- Microsoft Surface Pro 3 with Type Cover, in an Incipio folio case<br/>- Microsoft Surface Pro 3 power cord<br/>- Portable USB 3.0 Blu-ray burner with integrated USB cable<br/>- Anker portable cell phone charger, 3.2Ah model (extra USB power for the Blu-ray burner)<br/>- USB Y cable (for whenever extra USB power is needed for other devices)<br/>- AmazonBasics USB 3.0 4-port hub (to connect multiple devices to the Surface)<br/>- Power cord for Amazon Basics USB 3.0 hub (again, for USB power since the Surface's USB port can't handle multiple high power USB devices)<br/>- 5 foot USB extension cord (to use the Surface Pro 3 power cord's auxiliary USB power port)<br/>- Surface Pro USB Ethernet adapter<br/>- Microfiber screen cleaning cloth<br/><br/>By the time I get through packing the Surface Pro 3 and all the accessories needed to make its USB port perform like a normal laptop, the case bulges a bit and it's not terribly small compared with a normal laptop, but I guess in reality most people (including myself) don't need that many USB connectivity options at all times. If you are just storing a Surface Pro 3 and power cord in this case it's really a great snug fit.
 I've been using this to carry books to and from my college classes. There are some nice internal pockets which I use for decks of cards and packs of gum. The bag has been working well for this purpose, but if you load it up too full it can be bad for your back (if you carry it on the same shoulder every time).<br/><br/>When I carry my laptop, it holds it well; there's plenty of room for my mouse and power supply.<br/><br/>The quality is good, but could be better: some of the the fabric behind the back handle is tearing. So is some of the fabric on the shoulder pad. This has not affected the function, however. The damage is only cosmetic.
 I bought a  14" portable DVD player and this bag was listed to buy along with it.  Well, I got them both and there is NO WAY that this bag can fit that.  It was way to small.  I made sure and I looked at the box that had the description of the bag and it states 14.1" Laptop and Tablet Bag.<br/><br/>It does fit a 10" tablet though that already has a protective case so I told my daughter to use it for our trip.  The bag has little padding, I don't trust the shoulder strap and would only use the carrying handles.  If my daughter's tablet wasn't already protected I would have probably resend this back to them.  If it doesn't hold up for a week on vacation then I will.<br/><br/>This 14.1' bag would not take the 14"  portable DVD player it was portrayed as being a companion piece.
 I was having a hard time finding a bag for my laptop since they don't really make laptops in that size now a days. But I was glad to find this on Amazon for a great price. It's sturdy and not not bulky. It's padded fairly enough to sustain it and feels light.<br/>Has 3 pockets:<br/>Laptop along with a notebook or two<br/>A medium size that has a pencil section.<br/>A small front pocket<br/><br/>Strap is nice. It can be adjusted and the pad is shaped as a curve for a comfortable hold.<br/><br/>I do not recommend STUFFING it. If you plan to use it as a backpack or briefcase, this is not the bag to use for. Its light to medium use.<br/><br/>I only plan to only carry the laptop, a couple of cords, external hard drive, a small portable charger, a couple of pens and a small notepad. And take it to school twice a week.<br/><br/>Very happy to upgrade from a backpack to a real laptop bag.
 I thought this bag was a good deal.  Cheap, clean, and fits my Dell XPS 15. But now I hate it and will be looking for something else.  This bag is short on padding.  I put my laptop in it one morning on my way out the door to work.  As I reached for my car door I heard a click and felt the shoulder strap come loos.  I tried to stop it from falling but it landed on the corner.  My laptop which is just 4 months old is severely dented.  I can't tell you how disappointed I am in this bag.  I would NOT recommend this to anyone for anything of value.
 Great bag, excellent value for the price.  This turned out to be a little smaller than I'd hoped, though.  I had just come back from a trip, where I'd used my trusty old clutch bag with shoulder strap to carry a couple of tablets, some chargers and cables, and a magazine or two.  The old bag had seen better days, so I looked on Amazon and found this bag, which I thought was about the same size as my old one.  It was delivered promptly with Prime, and although it was well-constructed and had more compartments than my old bag, it was just about an inch too short if I ever wanted to put my HP laptop in it.<br/><br/>Here's where the story gets weird, and where I learned a valuable lesson.  I decided to buy the same basic bag in the 15.6 inch size, and then return this 14 inch one.  The 15.6 arrived and was perfect in every way.  So I got back on Amazon and prepared to return the 14 inch model, only to find that I would be charged return shipping (unlike the free Prime shipping to send it to me).  The shipping charge would be $6.38, for an item that only cost $13 and change!!  Needless to say, I kept both bags.  The 15.6 is now my favorite travel bag, and I use the 14 inch as a general purpose bag to carry documents, folders, and a few pens for meetings.
 This is, hands down, probably one of the best laptop bags you can buy for under $100. The 15" version has sufficient interior space in the divided main compartment to comfortably carry a 13" laptop, an iPad Air, and several books or notebooks. The smaller tablet pocket in the main compartment is perfectly sized to completely contain the Air, and there's enough padding along the bottom for peace of mind. The two exterior compartments are exceptionally useful as well, and the larger compartment has three pockets that are perfectly sized for chargers, cables, headphones, or whatever you need to take with you.<br/><br/>For the price, I wasn't expecting much, but this little bag has replaced a much more expensive Timbuk2 messenger bag for day-to-day use and it's simple and unassuming enough that I feel comfortable using it in more professional settings. The overall fit and finish is easily up to par with anything you'll find for double or even triple the price and, while it's not going to match high-end bags, it's good enough to not look or feel cheap. The size also bears note - I ordered the 15" bag for a 13" laptop because I knew I'd need the extra space, but I was concerned about the bag feeling too large. It's not. The 15" version is extremely slim and much, much smaller than most messenger bags or backpacks designed to carry large laptops.<br/><br/>This bag is good enough that I'd still be giving it 5-stars at $40 or $50. For under $20, there's just nothing even comparable.<br/><br/>ONE YEAR UPDATE: A few build quality issues have popped up after a year or so of daily use. The interior tablet pocket is beginning to rip where it's attached to the interior lining, and the shoulder strap pad is tearing. Aside from these two problems, the case bag has held up remarkably well to being thrown and dragged around five to six days per week. Given how cheap these things are, I'll probably just buy another to replace it.
 I've only just now slipped my Surface Pro 4 into the bag, and already I'm ecstatic.  I've been looking for something more than a sleeve, but less bulky than most business cases I see at Staples or Home Depot.  This is that bag.  I wish the front zippered pocket was about an inch wider.  I have all my accessories, including the AC Adaptor, in a nylon pencil case.  It doesn't fit in that front pocket, which otherwise seems perfect for what I want.<br/><br/>HOWEVER!  The bigger zippered pocket includes slots for things like my wireless mouse (DAMN YOU LOGITECH FOR DESTROYING THE TRACKMAN MARBLE!).  I'm going to play around with alternate carrying options that may fit the case and see if they might actually be more convenient.<br/><br/>Either way, this is the simple, utilitarian, easy to carry bag I've been looking for.  If it lasts at least two years, I'll be completely happy with it.<br/><br/>Oh, the shoulder strap.  REMOVABLE!  I have been getting progressively more angry at all the cases that come with a shoulder strap that cannot be removed.  I want a strap.  But for longer trips, the Surface is going in a backpack, case and all.  So I normally have it tucked at the bottom of the main compartment.  So the ability to keep that thing out of my way is mucho importante.
 I transport my 13" MacBook Pro in a sleeve <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Inateck-13-13-3-Inch-MacBook-Air-Pro-Retina-Sleeve-Carrying-Case-Cover-Protective-Bag-Black-LC1300B/dp/B00XJBCPY6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Inateck 13-13.3 Inch MacBook Air/ Pro Retina Sleeve Carrying Case Cover Protective Bag, Black (LC1300B)</a>, which I then put in the AmazonBasics 14" Laptop Bag. The dual layers of protection might be overkill, but the sleeve fits perfectly in the bag, and adds minimal weight. The bag feels well-constructed and reflects a good balance between durability/security versus weight/cost. There is padding around on all sides of the main compartment, including corners, except over the zipper. The larger of the two front pockets is also padded front &amp; back, but not on the sides or bottom. It's deep enough to fit a power supply brick without showing a bulge. The shallow frontmost pocket is unpadded.The zippers are plastic, with metal pull tabs. The strap hardware is plastic, similar to what you'd find on a backpack. The strap comes with a stiff but useable shoulder pad (which is the only part that actually feels cheap). The pad limits how short you can adjust the strap, which might be an issue if you're short-statured and like to hang the bag off a shoulder instead of across the chest.
 It's basic all right - but that's not entirely bad.  It gets the job done carrying around my new super thin and lightweight ASUS Flip Chromebook and a modest amount of gear (wall charger, earphones, bluetooth send/receive audio hub, external hard drive, cables).  The handles and shoulder strap are okay, but as noted by other reviewers the strap might find a way to detach itself while you are wearing it, potentially causing a catastrophic drop.  Some electrical tape applied strategically to the clasps will prevent that without making the bag unsightly.<br/><br/>But there are some obvious disappointments. The interior pockets are flimsy and lack velcro tabs and seals, which shouldn't have run up the cost very much if at all to add in.  Protective padding is pretty much nonexistent, and that is the primary reason to get a special laptop bag in the first place.  I ended up putting a few little plastic inflated bags widely used for shipping in the interior pockets to make up for that.  At least I finally found a use for these little bags besides sending defective items back!
 EDIT: 7/01/16<br/><br/>So I decided to keep the bag, and after carrying the bag around with my through two airports...the lining on the handle ripped. I'll upload pictures when I can. I would LOVE to return this bag, but now I'm in Australia for a year! Thanks a lot Amazon!<br/><br/>I read the reviews of the clips randomly un-clipping causing the bag to fall from ones shoulder. I hoped that maybe Amazon had seen the reviews and had tried to resolve it - they did not. I just got out of my car, slung the bag over my shoulder, and five seconds later the bag and my laptop were on the pavement.<br/>I just opened up my laptop and the frame came unlatched  from my laptop.<br/><br/>Now I need to decide if I want to return the bag and buy a different - better bag - or buy carabiner clips.<br/><br/>If you want this bag I strongly urge you to buy the clips as well, buy them on eBay or Walmart, they'll be a lot cheaper.<br/><br/>EDIT: AUGUST  13TH<br/><br/>Due to the fact that I am abroad, Amazon refunded my money and allowed me to keep the bag. It has not un-clipped since the first and only time. The bag has held up great other than the strap.
 This bag is excellent for the price, but as with most things, you get what you pay for. I toted my Dell G5 in this bag for over a month while visiting Korea, and it held up fine.<br/><br/>Fabric is sewn and finished properly, and the zipper action is smooth. I appreciate the choice to utilize zippers everywhere as opposed to the velcro pouch that many bags have. Bear in mind that peripheral storage space is limited as the bag itself is modestly sized.<br/><br/>The shoulder strap is not adequately padded for my taste, and was uncomfortable during long rides on the bus and train. Protective padding on the interior of the bag is present, but lackluster. I would not feel comfortable dropping or tossing the bag any real distance, and I was mindfully cautious as a result. That being said, my laptop computer held up fine in spite of the many encounters it had with walls, floors, and railings over the course of my travels.<br/><br/>I struggle to think of any 15 inch laptops that are larger than a Dell G5, but be aware that my laptop fits tight around the edges inside of the bag. Anything larger simply won't fit.<br/><br/>All in all it's a great bag for the money. So if your budget is tight, the AmazonBasics 15.6-Inch Laptop and Tablet Bag is a great option. I wouldn't trust it with a MacBook Pro though!
 Great price - with shipping included! - and lots of storage space, surprisingly. Feels durable all around, EXCEPT for the one thing that bothers me, which is the strap/clips, as it squeaks often when walking (annoying), being made of plastic, and that makes me worry for its durability (dangerous) since it sees the most stress at those points and is a rather vital component that probably should've been metal. Especially after reading some horror stories in reviews...<br/><br/>So I don't carry my laptop in it too often, which sort of defeats the purpose of a "laptop bag", but it serves me well enough for school with textbooks/snacks/thermos and it's cheap enough to be totally serviceable in this regard. I can't speak to its survival against the elements as it hasn't been snowed on or rained on yet.<br/><br/>Edit: Alright, I'm dropping another star because the creaking noises this thing makes with every step are just insanely annoying, and the shoulder pad on the strap is coming apart. Probably will not last two semesters but I'm hoping it makes it to the end of this one.
 hello at first it seemed a good product but after a few weeks of use I had problems since this opened part of attachment webbing photos to see hope this feedback reaches the seller so you can help me
 Absolutely perfect bag for my application-. I wanted something that would protect my 13-inch MacBook Pro but would also fit in my larger wheeled business case- the 14-inch version of this pack fits the bill and then some. My MacBook fits with room to spare, which makes it nice for adding in the overly large charger- as well as an iPad, a couple notepads, pens, cell phone, and a paperback book for reading at the airport. It's got a strap on the back so I can slide it over the handle of my suitcase or another wheeled bag. The fact that this Amazon bag is so inexpensive is icing on the cake. The ballistic material should hold up as well as any similar type of bag and the stitches and zippers seem of durable quality. The shoulder strap that comes with the bag has plastic clips that attach to the plastic clips on the bag- I wouldn't overload the bag with a lot of weight, but I ultimately the bag is designed to be minimalistic in nature. Buy this bag with confidence.
 Bought this to go with my new 17 inch laptop.  Didn't want to spend a lot of money on a big bulky bag, so I picked this because it looked simple and I thought it would do the job well.<br/><br/>The bag is pretty slim, seems well made.  The laptop fits in very snugly, in fact, almost TOO much such that I have to make an effort to close the zipper around the corners of the laptop.  It could stand to be maybe 1" inch bigger.  The other thing that's sort of an issue is that with the big laptop in there, there's not a lot of room for expansion width-wise.  I put in the power brick and a USB mouse, and things start getting tight.  There's not much room for carrying anything else in the bag without putting stress on the seams.<br/><br/>Overall, it's good for the price, and it's serving the purpose of protecting the computer.  If you are looking for something more heavy duty with extra space for storage or something that would stand up to a little more travel, I would not look at this bag.  This is an inexpensive cover for light duty use.
 I love this bag. I used to take a big satchel/courier bag to work everyday and realized I didn't need to take everything I had back and forth and so I decided to weed out everything and it left me with like 6-7 things. My wallet (keeping it in my back pocket was messing up my back), my writing instruments, business cards, and my Ipod. But now my bag was took bulky so I downsized to a small slingbag. This worked ok, until those days I had to carry some documents. No problem, I put them in an accordion wallet, but now I was carrying two things and it didn't make sense. So I needed a small bag, just large enough to carry a few unfolded letter size papers and my other stuff. I came across this beauty(the 11.6" one) and took a chance and I'm glad I did. It's just what I needed. Now I can carry everything in one shot yet it's about the size of a lunch box.
 Great price and nicely constructed, but huge design flaw in lack of padding for the corners of your laptop.  I bought this (17 inch version) for an Alienware laptop because I don't want to pack around a flashy Alienware case that announces to everyone that I play video games.  But this case will not fit the Alienware 17R4.  It will slide in, but you can't zip up the case because it is a little too short.  It is wide enough, but not tall enough.
 Very nice travel bag for device protection and for the price, you cannot beat it.  Fairly well made single sewn seams and zippers.  Feels sturdy enough when carrying it loaded, by the handles.  In an office traveling environment or somewhere without harsh conditions, it is perfect.  Plenty of padding to protect what's inside.  However, I don't recommend dropping any electronics. If you are paranoid, add a layer of foam rubber to the bottom of the bag.  One inner large compartment, large enough for a 15.6" business laptop with some room left over.  Two outer zippered pockets big enough for most accessories.  Has a nice adjustable strap if you need one.  This travel/protection bag that is compact enough to keep you on the go and not too bulky that you'll get neck strain carrying it for a day or more.  Never leave your bag unattended! I recommend this product!
 Amazon has done it again. I've purchased quite a few of the "AmazonBasics" line and have never been disappointed. The streak continues. I picked up this bag for my new Dell XPS 13 (2015) laptop. As you may know, the XPS is a 13" screen laptop in a 11" chassis. After researching the dimensions of the new XPS and seeing may users have bought this bag for the MB Air 11 (similar size to XPS), I figured to give it a shot. My laptop fits comfortably in the bag. I'm currently carrying a Nexus 7 (2013), XPS 13, Samsung Galaxy s4, laptop charger, Microsoft wireless mouse and a WD 2TB portable HD. The bag holds everything nicely and nothing feels squished. There's nice padding in each pocket that helps absorb shock. I have confidence that my electronics are safe and sound in this bag. As you can see, this bag can hold quite a bit of things. I originally was going to use my old Dell laptop bag (15.3 in laptop bag) to carry my new laptop but I wanted something slimmer that matches the true size of my new laptop. I've been using it for around two months now and have not come into any issues I can think of. Go ahead and buy with confidence.
 Great quality bag for my new 15.6" laptop.  I got this larger bag so I would have room to include magazines or a book as I use this to take my computer with me to work.  The 1st extra pocket in the front is the perfect size for my a/c adaptor and is positioned so it doesn't sit right up against the computer.  The 2nd full-sized pocket helps me keep my office-type accessories organized (pens, post-its, tape, etc.).  Then there are the 2 handy interior pockets, one large, one medium, that I use for magazines, books, papers.  The computer sits comfy between all of this.  The only thing I can't figure out is on the back side of the bag is a wide strap sewn to the bag with an open area.  Probably for something I don't use.  Neck strap is pretty stiff but just takes some breaking in.  Amazing quality!
 I got this for my husband to use as a work bag after his well loved Eddie Bauer messenger bag finally broke in two places. We really weren't expecting much, maybe just something to use while we looked for a better replacement for the Eddie Bauer bag, but he actually really likes this. We both like the fact that there are no huge logos or garishly patterned linings; it is a nice, plain, solidly constructed bag to use for carrying work papers and a laptop. So far so good, it looks like it is well constructed so hopefully it will hold up well. Seems like an amazing deal for under twenty dollars. I've actually bought a few of the "Amazon Basics" items over the years and they've all been of surprisingly good quality.
 I never thought that Amazon Products would actually be this high quality.  I was first hesitant to believe that I could get a long lasting Laptop Bag that would actually last me more than a few months for the price.  I was quite shocked and surprised at the durability of this bag after every day usage being in the IT department.  The only thing that has actually reduced in quality after months of wear and tear is the amazon logo because it is beginning to fade away, but the item remains useful and fully functional and it retains its  black color even after several washings. My pictures have some lighting issues but the item has retained its quality.
 For all good reviews I really thought it would be slightly better, I was expecting it to be more padded, at least in the corners; I think it would resist some knocks but definitely not a fall. Also the hook of the strap shouldn't be plastic, it should be metallic; I have read some reviews about how they broke, everything fell and the laptop inside suffered terrible damages, so I definitely won't use that.<br/>If they can fix that, I think they would deserve 5 stars. I also be willing to pay like 5$ more for these improvements.<br/>Anyway, it's good for the price.<br/><br/>PD: Remember to look at internal dimensions it the product description.
 Unlike most people, I didn't buy this bag for a laptop, so please keep that in mind as you're reading this. I needed a bag to stow gear for work. Mainly, my tablet, 3ds, arm/leg braces, aspirin, tweezers and chargers for the devices. I was lugging around a backpack for all these things, but it didn't make sense to have such a large bag for a small amount of supplies. So I bought this for cheap. I was not disappointed. Everything fits well. The bag has a strong build. The strap is a little worrisome, but I haven't had any of the issues others have so far. I can definitely tell the bottom of the bag isn't really cushioned at all, which would definitely be an issue if I ever chose to carry a laptop. i would recommend maybe placing a small towel or something in the bottom to help absorb the shock from drops. That's the main reason I'm only giving this 4 stars instead of 5. Other than that, it's a great little bag for the price.
 I bought this bag in March, 2017 and it is now the very end of December, 2018 so I can say honestly that I know how it holds up over the long run. Mine has been fine. I use it a lot, keeping my larger laptop inside as well as a smaller tablet and the accessories. It could use a bit more padding, especially at the bottom, but I have not had any issues with the strap like so many others. It has never been a problem and my nag is heavy! This is a simple, cost effective laptop bag. If I were going to travel a lot with it or carry it every single day. I probably would have gone with something a bit better in quality. Bit the price was good and it fits my needs. I am still using the bag and will continue to.<br/><br/>Great for storing your laptops and tables and for taking them on the go. If you are VERY rough with your computer bags, you may want to opt for a padded backpack or a higher quality laptop bag. Otherwise, this is a very good deal and I have gotten plenty of use from the bag and continue to.
 This is an inexpensive and inexpensively constructed case. It is exactly what I would expect to get from Amazon for ONLY $15. For my use, I don't care if it gets beat up or some fabric tears, as other reviewers have commented. After being able to touch this case, I am certain those things will happen, unless you are very careful with it.<br/><br/>My purpose for purchasing this is to carry Boy Scout binders and books in it. I will throw this in the grass, dirt or on top of a picnic bench at some camp-out. This is NOT the case I would carry my personal laptop in or use for business purposes. If I wanted to do that, I would spend more and expect something of better quality.<br/><br/>If I am happy with it, why only 3 stars... In my opinion, this bag does not meet the quality or protection needed for the purpose it was designed for. Venturing a pure guess... If you were to use this as a laptop bag on a daily basis, it would be ready for replacement in 6 months. You would be far better off spending $30 up front and getting something that may last 3 or 4 years.
 The material and construction of the bag are very good.  The problem lies in the interior of the bag.  There are two side pouches that run the full internal length of the bag.  When you go to put a tablet in the bag it always catches on one of the side pockets.  The large side zipper is acceptable.in design.  I have been tempted to cut out one of the side pouches inside.  One is perfect.  Two are very annoying .
 I was a little reluctant as to what I was going to receive especially at this price. I was absolutely blown away at the quality of this case. Excellent padding (without being to bulky) several zipper compartments to hold my; Laptop, tablet, Bluetooth mouse, power cords, etc...and still plenty for room for other things without making the case large and cumbersome to carry. I also like the fact the caring strap is optional. Most other cases one end is permanently attached, so you'll need to cut the other end off the case OR tuck it in the case.  This case is just a hand carry and it works perfectly for that purpose.
 A very marginal laptop case.  It has plenty of room for a laptop computer and has fabric pockets you can put papers in to keep them out of the rain.  End of what is good.  On the negative side:  it has virtually no cushioning so you probably don't want to take it on a plane where it can wind up under the seat or especially in an overhead bin.  You can't use those interior pockets for storing mouse, backup drive, power supply, etc., because the thin fabric allows them to rub up against the laptop and everything gets scratched up.  You can't use the front pouch for your mouse, power supply, and backup hard drive because it doesn't "pooch out" (you can put in one of those but not all three).  So the advertisement "Accessory storage pockets for portable mouse, iPod, cell phone and pens" is simply not true.  For a bag of this size it makes very poor use of space.
 not too shabby!<br/>a great price. honestly case logic brand is much sturdier construction but this is a good case for the price. I was looking for a bag that had stiff, thick, protective fabric/construction and this bag is a bit soft and bendable for my needs, but it's so big I can put my very wide 15.6 laptop (lenovo leigion which has sort of an odd shape) into a chunky laptop sleeve and still cram it into this bag with plenty of room for other things.<br/>i think the strap feels a bit cheap, the plastic on the clips particularly, but it should hold up to everyday use.<br/><br/>Overall the best part of this bag is the price.
 I have had about 6 work laptops over the last 12 years and have tried bags, backpacks, and pretty much anything that can hold laptops to keep them safe and sound (which can be pretty difficult being a field technician and all).  The last 2 were from Case Logic, which was always my go-to for my cassette tapes and CD's, so I felt pretty confident in the durability and quality of their products.  This time I decided to try out the Amazon Basics version of essentially the same bag.  I am EXTREMELY happy with this bag.  It is about 3/4 inch wider than the Case Logic one, which might not seem like much, but it feels like a mile.  I have only had the bag for a few months, but I use my laptop every day and the materials feel as if they'll last for at least as long as the other ones I've tried.  The zippers have a good feel to them and I haven't noticed any hiccups while using them.  If I have any complaints, it would be with the interior pockets on the main compartment.  They do not have any support along the top edge, so they tend to sag inward, which can make putting the laptop in challenging if only using one hand.  I highly recommend this bag and I will be buying it again if I need another one in the future.
 Let me tell you: I’ve had this bag for 4 good years, don’t know why I waited to long to write a review but I guess it’s to y’alls advantage! Now you can get a legit review worth 4 years of use. Ok. First, this bag is sturdy and strong. The straps are strong and the bag overall is well made.<br/> It has a lot of space inside, with the main compartment and a smaller partition in the main part. On the outer side are two compartments, zipped and of good size each. So overall a good number of compartments other than the main laptop area.<br/><br/>Now, the cons is that if you overfill it (like I did mine when I was traveling), the seam on the outer pocket came off and the bag now looks torn up. Despite this, I won’t give it less than 5 stars simply because it stood the test of time and use over the years I’ve used it. I’d recommend you get two laptop bags so you don’t overuse one.
 This is a fantastic bag for the iPad or any other tablet. My family each has one because it is just so convenient! I bought my mother one first because she likes having an over the shoulder strap, which this comes with as well as handles. We went on a vacation to Georgia in the summer. It was really warm and my mom left her iPad in the car. I was worried about it because leaving electronics in the heat like that isn’t great. However, when we came back I checked the iPad and it was cool to the touch after having been in this case. It completely insulated the device. After that incident we all bought one for our tablets.<br/><br/>This also has a convenient zip pocket on the outside to store whatever you want. I usually keep a set of ear buds, a power cable, a thumb drive and anything else I need to carry in a pinch. I also like the look of the bag because I don’t like ostentatious stuff. This is subtle and elegant, which I appreciate. It is a soft material (neoprene) that has really held up over the years. It still looks new even though it is 5 years old! Great product and I would definitely buy another one.
 This review is for the 11.6" Amazon Basics bag.<br/><br/>The main compartment fits an 11" HP Stream Cloudbook.  An Asus 10" Flip Chromebook fits with plenty of room to spare.<br/><br/>The front zipper compartment can hold the charger for either one of those machines, but the Stream charger is bulky and creates a bit of a bump, more so than the Chromebook charger.<br/><br/>The middle compartment can also hold the chargers, of course, along with having dedicated loops for pens, pencils, stylus, etc. and a couple of small pockets for smartphone or notepad.<br/><br/>Fit and finish is very good, the zippers work smoothly and I see no evidence of loose stitching, inside the bag or out.<br/><br/>For those who may not wish to advertise that it's an Amazon Basics bag, the logo can be easily blocked out by using a black Sharpie or other permanent marker.<br/><br/>The bag I received was made in China.<br/><br/>HTH<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Jim
 I bought this bag for an 11.6" Asus X205TA netbook 4+ years ago and still use both regularly.<br/>Pros:<br/>  * Durability, it's endured 4+ years of use and abuse.<br/>  * The front pocket is handy for pens, screwdriver pens, passports, mouse, cables.<br/>  * The padding has allowed me to regularly sling, throw, lop my bag (with computer inside) without worrying about damaging the computer.<br/>  * Zippers work great. Shoulder strap is still intact.<br/>Cons:<br/>  * It's a little dirty and is all function-over-form. No sex appeal.<br/>  * There are no other varieties. It looks government-issued or something.<br/>  * I have no idea how to wash it.
 Really like having a small laptop bag that lessens my air travel luggage load. Large enough for my needs, but beware you cannot carry a legal sized manila folder; however, a 10x13 document envelop or letter sized manila folder will fit but not without dog-earing its corners. Four stars because it could use more padding in the laptop compartment, especially on the bottom and sides. I downsized from a larger Targus bag and was initially fearful, but I've easily adapted to the smaller size. I would buy this bag again and pay a little more for a padding upgrade.
 I really like this case. I got it for my Microsoft Surface Book which is 13". I got it because it was cheap. Initially I wanted something more flashy but I ordered two different bags and both had soft plush lining which I didn't like. So I bought this one and I'm very very happy with it. It's very nondescript which is great especially when walking around with an expensive laptop. It holds my laptop plus a notebook, and pens, an outside pocket that holds the charging plug with room for headphones or a phone charger. I can probably fit a book in there as well. Overall, really happy with this and thank you to Amazon for making quality products. Would recommend.
 The bag itself is great. Very compact which is exactly what I wanted. I can carry my laptop, its c power cable, and a couple of small personal items. Just what I need going to and from work.<br/><br/>However the strap it comes with is garbage. It's got a very uncomfortable shoulder pad and there are other reviews saying it can unclip itself.<br/><br/>So I'm going to order a replacement strap. Looks like a good strap costs as much as the bag itself! Which I'm fine with, since the bag costs next to nothing.<br/><br/>But really, it would be better to raise the price a few dollars and include a good strap.
 I just got it, and so far I give it 4 1/2 stars. The Surface Pro tablet fits comfortably in the 14-inch bag with room to spare. I was very happy with my previous bag - an old one from pre-tablet days that came with an AlphaSmart I bought a long time ago. That bag was incredibly durable and lasted a lot longer than the device that came with it, but the zipper finally broke. So, I was looking for a new bag that didn't unzip all the way down. If the zipper breaks apart suddenly on a bag that unzips all the way to the bottom, your computer might hit the floor.<br/><br/>Pros about this bag:<br/>1. It only zips along the top, so nothing is going to fall out the bottom if the zipper breaks.<br/>2. Lots of nice pockets. I can separate all the cords now.<br/>3. The material is slightly slick - not too much, but just enough that pet fur doesn't seem to cling to it as much. My cat loves snuggling up with a warm computer bag, and it doesn't seem to show as much on this one as on my old one.<br/>4. It's lightweight and affordable.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The only con I've found so far is the shoulder strap. The clasps are made of plastic and look pretty breakable. Also, the padding part is ridiculously wide. It doesn't lie flat against my shoulder. I guess it's made for a giant football player or something. I removed the shoulder strap entirely and replaced it with an old one I had that has metal clasps and a shorter shoulder pad.<br/><br/>If the strap was better, this bag would be a 5. The price is great, and I'm happy with it.<br/><br/>UPDATE JULY 2017: This bag is still holding up.
 I purchased this laptop bag for my Dell XPS 13 for transport purchase and not for the purpose of protecting the laptop from a high-altitude drop. As such, I cannot attest for that purpose. There are three zippered pockets for this bag. The main opening on the top of the bag is secured by double zippers, the other two openings on the front of the bag are secured by single zippers. Inside the main opening a laptop fits neatly into the middle and it has side pockets on either side which could be used for flat objects. I am not using these pockets for anything. The next opening on the front is where I keep my main accessories. Inside this opening there are three open pockets on the side closest to the laptop. This is where I keep my bluetooth mouse, the AC power cord, and the power brick. In front of the three pockets is a larger pocket, this is where I keep my cables, currently, and miniHD to HDMI cable, a USB to mini-USB cable and some earbuds. At the very front of the bag is the smaller zippered opening which is currently used to carry the over-the-shoulder strap that comes with the bag. The bag is of very good quality with adequate stitching. At top are two handstraps situated on either side of the main opening which appear to be strongly attached to provide secure carrying when loaded with laptop and accessories. The bag works really well for the Dell XPS 13 and I strongly recommend it for that other similar sized ( 8"x12"x11/16") laptops or notebooks.
 This is a great bag, especially for lower-end laptops that you may not need the extra padding for (or for lower use). The laptop I am using this for (the Acer Chromebook 14) does not specifically fit in the little sleeves on the sides, but I am not sure if it is really supposed to (see screenshot below)? This still works out fine for my purposes, but may be different from what you expect.<br/><br/>The bag feels nicer that a $15 bag in most cases. The only thing that seems a bit weak are the plastic clips for the shoulder strap-- it would have been nice if these were metal instead.<br/><br/>All things considered, this is a good bag and great for the money. If you have a $2000 laptop, I would probably recommend getting a slightly more solid bag.
 I have a Microsoft Surface 3, and I was using an old ipad case that had only handles.  I wanted to add a shoulder strap, so I found this case.  It was inexpensive and had handles AND a strap.  When I received it, I was pleasantly surprised.  The inside has a 3 compartments....the middle for my computer and two others to separate papers or other items from the computer.  It also has a front zippered pocket for small thing and a larger zippered area for larger things.  This is my favorite computer bag, and I especially like that I can carry it hands-free too.  I highly recommend it!
 I bought this bag for my iPad mini and am left needing to continue my search for a rare 7-8" tablet bag with handles, not sleeve only.<br/>I bought this bag thinking it would fit the iPad mini nicely with SOME extra room..... The description said this bag is for 7-10" tablets, thus I thought the 8" iPad mini would be a good fit. I am disappointed that the bag was HUGE.... I didn't even attempt to see how the iPad mini would fit. At first I was convinced they sent the wrong size but the box was clearly labeled for 7-10" tablets. It looks even a bit too big for 10" tablets for at a glance it seems 10-14" would be a better rating, but this "7-10" tablet" bag is the smallest available in the Amazon Basics line.<br/><br/>This poor rating is exclusively due to my utter disappointment  with the size, doesn't match word description and even the picture makes it look much much much smaller than it is.... Quality seems ok but I didn't have time to really test it as a packaged it right back up for return to Amazon. If you have a huge tablet, this may be a good bag.
 I got this for a Lenovo G50 15.6 inch laptop. Dimensions are 10.43 x 0.98 x 15.12 inches. I went with the 17.3 inch bag because I figured that a little more room all around couldn't be a bad idea. So far I'm very happy with the product and feel it is good value.<br/><br/>With the laptop tucked away inside, (there is an internal fabric divider that snugs the laptop in on one side), there is a lot of room left over for anything else you might want to carry. Even with two Kindles and assorted cable and power cord hardware there's probably enough room for half a dozen magazines or a few file folders. Biggest problem is going to be being tempted to put too much weight in the bag.<br/><br/>Zippers are substantial. Seams are tough and well sewn. Material also feels fairly heavy duty. I thought I might need to put some filler in the bottom to absorb impact, but there is padding there. The padding generally feels adequate to protect against normal insults, but I wouldn't toss the bag around.<br/><br/>All in all, as a means to transport the laptop, secure reasonable protection, and carry accessories, (with room left over), this was a nice choice at a low price and a good option.
 I'd say this one fits the "Basics" moniker very well, for better and for worse (though the worse isn't so bad at all).<br/><br/>I've been using this for a few months now, and it has been holding up perfectly well. Construction seems very solid all around, padding is minimal but firm and sufficient, straps seem durable. Lots of different pockets on the inside (including three interior pockets in the larger front compartment, as per the photo) and three separate compartments overall, so there are many ways to separate your stuff and room for all the essentials. The overall look is trim and attractive, the zippers and smooth and seem sturdy, and it's a nice light weight.<br/><br/>Downsides? No dealbreakers, just lack of refinements or niceties. There are no feet on the bottom of the case, so it's just resting on the same material as the rest of the exterior. So far it's holding up fine, but it is more slippery than rubber feet would be, so it tends to slide down and lay flat on its back if you rest it at an angle. The relatively narrow thickness of the case magnifies this effect. The shoulder strap seems fine, but the plastic hooks at either end don't rotate quite as smoothly as metal would, so the strap tends to get twisted pretty easily. The interior fabric has held up well for me, but it is fairly thin and makes a bit of a pronounced crinkly sound when you access the interior pockets. The aforementioned relative thinness of the case back to front does limit what you can stuff into the bag - I've had a laptop, file folder, phone/wallet/etc, and not overly thick book all layered inside, and that fills up its thickness pretty well. Definitely on the narrow side of cases, but then again that's part of why I bought it. Wanted something trim and efficient, not heavy and bulky.<br/><br/>Overall, very satisfied with it and glad I got it. If I could change one thing, it would be to have rubber feet or some other kind of protective traction on the bottom. Apart from that, the "basics" in this bag are acceptable and make it a great deal.
 I've only used this bag for a couple of weeks now, but I will say that it has held up well this far.<br/><br/>I use my work laptop every day and I carry it from store to store. It has handled the transporting very well. It fits my laptop and provides enough cushioning to not feel as if my laptop could break.<br/><br/>In terms of price, this bag is half the price of major brand laptop bags and that's music to my ears. As I've grown older, I've found that name brand doesn't always mean quality. This bag has God quality for a fraction of the price.<br/><br/>The additional zipper pockets is great for the power cord, mouse, cables and papers.<br/><br/>If I ever need a another laptop bag, I'll definitely buy this bag again!
 Review for 17.3 inch bag. Great bag especially for the price. I use it with along with a pelican 1070 hard case so padding is not an issue although the bag does have some padding on the bottom and not just the material the bag is made from. Not sure how the clips for the strap could come loose as mentioned by another reviewer; perhaps it was a different bag in their review or the clips have been improved on the one I bought. Paid less than $20.00 so for that price this is a great bag to have that is more compact then some of the other message or back packs out there. Last thing to mention the main compartment the one where a laptop could go has 2 zippers in case you want to use a lock; while the other 2 pockets only have one but you could probably use the side ring (even though it is plastic) to lock those pockets to it using a small cable type lock. All in all a great bag that allows one to carry the essentials without having a lot of bulk.
 This is a good basic bag for a medium laptop. My 14" laptop with an extended battery barely fits, but it does fit without any trouble. The outside pockets are small, but they have enough storage space for a power supply, a mouse, and some assorted cables. The laptop bag doesn't have much padding, either for the laptop to protect it from bumps or on the shoulder strap to make it more comfortable, but that does keep it smaller and lighter. However, because of the lack of padding, I wouldn't recommend this laptop bag for airline travel or for a daily commute. However, for a basic bag that will see light duty, this laptop bag works just fine.<br/><br/>I am currently using this laptop bag to hold an older laptop that I keep as a backup, and it is working just fine for keeping all my accessories together with the laptop. It’s better than the giant ziplock bag I had been using.<br/><br/>After reading some of the other reviews that complained about the clips on the shoulder strap coming loose, I tried as hard as I could to get the strap to twist in such a way that it would pop off. However, despite my best efforts, I was unable to make it come loose on its own. However, just to be safe, I tied a piece of paracord through both the loop on the ends of the shoulder strap and the loop on the bag as a backup. With the paracord, I feel confident that the shoulder strap is secure.
 My laptop sits primarily on my desk.  But I take it home on the weekends.  I take an occasional business or personal trip with it.  And on occasion I leave the office to go visit a customer, so I need a professional bag to carry it (rather than my military style backpack that I use every day).  Out of the box, this really nice.  Simple, elegant, black nylon fabric.  Functional pockets for my mouse and other accessories like cables, hub, charger, flash drives, etc.  Plenty of space for my Lenovo T460 14" laptop and a few file folders.  The actual width of my laptop is just under 13.5" so I ordered the 15.6" bag to give me a little extra room for other stuff in the bag (like an Oakley Large Carbon Fiber Eyewear Case for my shades or reading glasses).  Shoulder strap for easy carry.  And a nice added feature of a side strap to slide over the handles of a roll-on suitcase.  And it looks like it has plenty of padding too.  No, it’s not going to protect your laptop if the briefcase falls off the desk or out of the overhead compartment on the airplane.  For general use, there is plenty of padding.  This looks to be just what I need.  And for the price I paid for it, you can’t beat it.  No I can keep all my laptop supplies in one bag at the ready.  And when I need to bug out, I simply eject the laptop of my desktop top, drop it in this bag, and I am ready to bug out.
 I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this laptop attaché, but it has met and exceeded my expectations. I wanted something that would hold the bare minimum of what I wanted to carry with me, with a bit of room for some extras. I'd gotten in a bad habit of carrying way too much with me when I was going to work off-site, and this bag keeps me focused on what's essential and what isn't. I can easily fit my MacBook Air 13" in the main compartment, along with an iPad Mini and a Moleskine journal. There's room for my wallet, a pair of gloves, an accessories bag (earbuds, USB cables, USB drives, etc.), a small kitchen timer (pomodoro!), a pair of computer glasses, business cards, a glue stick, and a Streetwise map of Dublin. If I'm feeling ambitious, I can just barely squeeze a 1.5" three-ring binder in there, too, but it's a very tight fit.<br/><br/>The only change I made was to switch out the bag's strap. The strap that came with the bag was sturdy and sufficient, but it had a tendency to squeak when I was walking with the bag slung across my body like a messenger bag, so I switched it out for a similar strap with metal hardware (instead of plastic clasps). I'll also be looking to personalize the bag, hopefully without having to resort to bedazzling.
 It's a great travel bag for my chromebook.  It fits it well and doesn't feel like I'm dropping it into a huge empty space.  So far it's holding up well and it's getting a lot of use.  Addendum(8/23/2018)... I've now purchased a second one of these for my Mother in Law.  It seem to be just what she's looking for and she's got the slightly larger Chromebook.  It provides just enough space to hold a few things in addition to the laptop itself and the power supply.  Not enough to get really heavy but enough to feel like you have what you need.
 I love this item! It perfectly holds my Samsung Tab A 10.1 tablet that I've fitted with a cover with pop up stand. I also carry a folding Bluetooth keypad, and mouse. There's extra room for pens, markers, small notepads, my reading glasses with case, and 3 charging accessories plus a phone - and it's very comfortable to carry with the shoulder strap or just grab the handles like a purse. The adjustable shoulder strap has an adjustable, curved shoulder pad attached with a rubber-like underside that inhibits the bag from sliding off. The curve of the pad is convenient to ensure it's in position. The dual zippered device compartment has two cloth dividers for papers or a notepad. While my tablet is only 10.1-inches, this bag will easily hold a larger device as noted in the product description. Well made and serviceable! The front accessory pocket and smaller front pocket both have single zippers.
 I have been shopping 17 inch laptops cases around town. Basically what I found were expensive and "meh" for the money.  This one was only $16.99!!! I thought why not try this one for giggles, and ordered it for a new laptop I'd just bought.  I would have paid $79 or so for around the same feature set in a store in my city (top 10 usa metro area so lots of places to buy this kind of stuff).  I wish it had o-n-e more divider for all the various papers and stuff I have to carry around but It isn't bad at all.  Going to buy another for my 15 inch laptop as well.
 Just what I needed to replace and old brief case with a broken lock. When my old brief broke a lock, I had to come up with a replacement. I wasn't sure about a soft sided bag but this has proved to do really well. The quality is very good as with all Amazon branded items and I was able to move all of my usual carry item into the new bag with ease. Best is that I now realize how limited I was in space with the old hard sided "suitcase" style unit. This is just what I was looking for and at this price, it's worth trying.
 First off, yes, the price is very low so everyone needs to take that into consideration. You aren't getting a $100 bag for thirteen bucks. That said, this is probably the first Amazon Basic item I've bought that really is "Basic". This thing has cheap all over it. Loose threads all over inside to the point I'm wondering if 10 year olds made this. No QA stamps on this one. I really don't like the loosy goosy pockets inside the main compartment as every time I reach in to pull out my laptop I inadvertently grab the pockets along with the laptop and I can't pull it out. I am planning on cutting those pockets completely out. Other than that it's ok. I like the price so 3-stars.
 I have now bought 2 of these.  One for a Chromebook, and another for an ASUS T100.  For the price ($13) this case more than exceeds my expectations.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>Inexpensive (Feels like its a $25 case)<br/>Durable case. I have traveled with this case (But not on a daily basis) and it shows no signs of breaking.<br/>Pockets!  You have the main sleeve where the computer goes, then a medium sized and a small sized pocket.  Perfect for cables, pens, pencils, etc etc.<br/>Handles and shoulder straps<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>If you keep your charger in the side pocket, you don't have that much room left without over-stuffing the case.<br/>If you want to use this for school, you wont be able to bring much more with you.  But then again, you should be looking at a backpack with a laptop sleeve anyhow.<br/><br/>Overall a great value.  I have not seen any better at this price.
 I bought an Acer V17 Nitro, Black Edition. I figured it would fit in my existing bag. It did not. I bought this bag. I suspect my laptop may in fact be overkill, because it barely fits in this bag (as in I can JUST BARELY get the zippers to close). Nothing against the bag, it's well put together, sturdy, I can tell it's going to serve me well with all the travel I'm doing nowadays. I just wish it was a liiiiiittle bit bigger. Fractions of an inch would go a long way in helping accommodate the magnum laptop I apparently bought.<br/><br/>Also, if you think you need a 17" laptop, you are probably wrong. 17" is way too much laptop.
 I bought this for my 11" MacBook Air. For the previous year or so I've been using the very nice, and very expensive leather Twelve South Book Book case. While it's a very classy looking case, its functionality is pretty much limited to being a leather zippered sleeve; an expensive leather sleeve that ended up being useless because the zippers on each side broke rendering it impossible to close. When I received this bag the other day it reminded me of why I never buy super expensive luggage. One reason is that more often than not it's a brand name that's causing the price to be premium and they generally don't last longer than smart luggage purchases that sell for often 1/10th or 1/8th the price.  This bag represents a perfect analogy to that.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly this bag is made in China but guess what? More often than not, the real expensive ones are too. This bag appears to be made of high quality ballistic nylon. The zippers are thick and seem as though they'll last a lifetime but even if they last only a year it's still a great bag. In addition to the main zippered section for the laptop there are two additional zippered sections one is ideal for storing a standard sized external hard drive. The other,larger pouch Is perfect  for storing the laptop's power cord.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the handles make it one of the most comfortable bags to carry I've ever owned they're thick and soft, and seem sturdy. There's also a padded shoulder strap! It's simply remarkable for the price!<br/><br/>Finally, I like buying new things. I'd prefer to buy a great quality bag like this for $10 to $13, use the heck out of it for a year or so, then buy another one. It's sort of like why I never bought one of those ridiculously priced vacuums that are sold door to door and you can paint your house or wash your car with. When one spends big bucks on an item like that, or like this, one is inclined to use it until it's just no good anymore, which may be a lifetime but will still require costly maintenance. Who wants to never get a new vacuum cleaner and deny themselves of the latest and greatest technology? The person who spends $1,000 or more on something they think is great because of all the bells and whistles. That's who. However, in a few years there's better bells and whistles but people don't buy what they'd prefer to have because they paid for a product they thought they wanted to last their lifetime.<br/><br/>So, after a year of traveling with this and getting it all scuffed up, I'll have no concern about buying a new one and I'll experience the enjoyment of getting a new one, that will likely have a few better design items.<br/><br/>For my purposes and lifestyle, this is about as close to the perfect purchase as it gets.<br/><br/>In summary, I think you can buy this product with the utmost of confidence.
 Fits a Surface Pro 4 like a glove, with a second pocket for the power supply, pen and other accessories.  I like a small case for my computers.  I’m not a fan of backpacks or bulky bags.  I buy a small, light, thin computer, and I want my bag to be small and light too.  I wish it was just a tad larger though, as the power supply is kinda bulky, so some added slack would allow for that bulge a little better.  Still, a great small case for a SP4.  Recommended!
 I ordered this bag in February of this year, so I've been throwing this bag over my shoulder every weekday for the past 7 months. The shoulder padding on the strap is worn out and about to come off. All other pieces of the bag seem fine, the strap does tend to twist but that's ok. It was affordable and it holds the laptop + charger and other periphery. Overall it's held up well for how little it costs, even if the shoulder pad is basically useless now. It just needs to survive from my cube to the car trunk.
 I have purchased two of these bags-one in 2017 and one in 2015. Overall, this is a solid bag and it does the job. The bag feels sturdy and has plenty of space for a 14" laptop, the power charger, a wireless mouse, and a variety of additional peripherals.<br/><br/>The reason for the three-star review is the material. The 2015 bag is a 5-star product, the material feels soft and is quiet if I am rooting around for something; however, the 2017 material feels very plasticky and makes quite a bit of noise when I am digging through looking. Granted, this is minor, but I am a bit disappointed to see the same product decrease in quality over just two years. While I wouldn't dissuade anyone from purchasing the bag, I would recommend looking around a bit more before making a decision.
 Perfectly adequate. No whistles and bells but very well priced. Some reviewers have said the plastic snaps break on the shoulder strap, so I don't know if I'd carry my heavy 17" laptop in it, but as a briefcase it seems sturdy enough if not overloaded. Backpacks aren't allowed through security in government buildings in my area, so I needed something that would pass muster as a "briefcase".
 I bought the 7-10" bag for my uncle to use with his 9.7" iPad and it works perfectly. This one does not have a strap--just handles for carrying. I'm guessing the larger sizes have the shoulder strap as some reviewers have said that the strap may come undone. I just want to point out that there is no strap for the small size and the handles are firmly sewn into the bag. There is a roomy pocket that can hold quite a lot. What would make this product even more awesome is if it came in different colors. I'm hoping Amazon takes that into consideration as not everyone wants basic black.
 This is a great bag for a smaller laptop. It holds the laptop, charger, bluetooth mouse and a myfi without feeling bulky and getting excessively large. My only issue is that the rear suitcase strap is just slightly too small to fit over the handle of a rolling suitcase, same for the hand straps on top. You can work it on to the suitcase but it is not a quick procedure and I worry I'm going to tear the bag in the process. Beyond this minor annoyance, I have been very pleased with the purchase.
 After having multiple backpacks including multiple Swissgear, and OGIO I was on a hunt for the perfect compact bag for my Surface Pro 3. I searched on Amazon and came across this 11.6" AmazonBasics Laptop and Tablet Bag, I checked into the dimensions of the Surface Pro 3 (8"x11.5"x0.36") it seemed there was just enough room for a nice snug fit so I ordered it knowing Amazon's awesome return policy. Upon receiving it today (nice simple boxed package) I immediately opened it up, checked it out nice solid construction with great material, simple design and overall great looking. I proceeded to take the Surface out of my oversized, overweight SwissGear, and tried sliding it into the padded pocket on the new bag, like a glove the Surface including the type cover attached slid right in like it was designed specifically for it! The bonus is everything that was in my previous bag fit into this bag like it was custom tailored for all my gadgets and accessories all while being 1/10 the size of my old backpack!!! Unfortunately I don't usually have a great deal of time to write as many reviews as I'd like too on Amazon however this product truly warranted the time, hopefully someone on here looking for a perfect bag for Surface Pro 3 (or the recently announced Surface Pro 4) will utilize it. I'll update if the product doesn't stand up to the daily abuse of commuting daily on the MBTA, however even if I had to replace it every other year for $13 bucks it truly is outstanding!!
 This bag is wonderful and seems to be well made.  The little pocket in the front is perfect for chargers or various electronic products (it is nice and roomy).  The second pocket in the front has pockets on the interior wall (that seem to be the same size) that allow you to place a phone, headphones, plugs, a small external hard drive, batteries, etc, inside and keep them nice and organized (this pocket is also roomy so you definitely could place a decent sized novel inside it.  Then the main pocket has a pocket on the exterior wall (that would be nice for an ebook reader or small tablet), the main compartment (that can fit 3-7 legal sized notepads... this depends on the depth of your computer of course), and there is a nice pocket on the interior wall of the main compartment that fits my 13.3 macbook pro with retina display  early 2015] perfectly.... if your computer is thicker, you might want to put the notebooks in the interior pocket and the computer in the main compartment.  Basically, this bag is perfect to carry all your stuff (besides just your computer and technology).  This bag also comes with a nice shoulder strap which helps immensely when carrying this around, I've literally filled this thing to capacity (over 40 pounds) and this bag held up all day  12 hours]  and the shoulder strap made it a lot less painful to carry around.  This bag is a wonderful carry on for airplanes.  The fabric on the front of the bag is stain-proof (to coffee, tea, ink)... but that may be due to the fact that it is black.  I love this bag because everything inside it feels protected... it is awesome.
 This bag is AWESOME!!  I bought a protective case, the Amazonbasic sleeve, Amazonbasic mouse &amp; all for my 13.3" Macbook Pro.  All of it fits in this laptop bag including the power cord &amp; then some.  Because I bought the Amazonbasic sleeve, it adds protection for my Mac in this bag.  This is the smartest buys I've done for my expensive Mac.  If you don't think this bag is protection enough for your 13.3" Mac, buy the AmazonBasic sleeve.  This bag has more than enough room for it.  And yet this bag is not overly huge.  Yes the shoulder strap is stiff but I'm sure with time it will soften up.  I took a pic of the laptop bag.  You can see the pink, that's the color of my case that's on the laptop.  The gray is the Amazonbasic sleeve with foam the Mac is in.  The Amazonbasic mouse &amp; the power cord is in the side bigger pocket.  I definitely recommend this bag for anybody who wants extra protection on their tablets, 13.3" Macbook Pro or any laptop of that size, &amp; don't want to spend tons of money on a laptop bag.  Amazon pricing is so reasonable &amp; this laptop bag is very well made, with stitching &amp; details very well thought of.  The pricing is cheap but the quality into this bag is top notch, a well deserved 5 star rating!!
 I have now purchased two of these exact bags for two different Apple laptop computers. Both are 13 inch Apple laptop computers. These bags are completely awesome! They are perfectly functional and I believe the best value on the market. They have a no-frills appearance, which I happen to like, and they have a high level of functionality. I can’t imagine you will be disappointed with the performance and durability of these bags. One of them I have had now for over two years.
 This is a rather affordable, USABLE bag for hefty 17.3" inch laptops. There's plenty of pocket to carry the indispensable companions (power brick, mouse, notes binder, pens and business cards in their respective pockets.<br/><br/>The handles are very comfortable and there's an outside front pocket were you can offload your cell phone and other pant pocket EDCs.The shoulder strap is somewhat short, aching to a "metro man-bag" position. If you're not comfortable with that, you had been warned (personally I don't mind more than the savings from otherwise buying "premium" alternatives.)
 I like it a lot; it's the second best bag like it I've found, and they don't make the best one anymore.  If you use it every other day, like I do, it will wear out in less than 9 months.  Thus one star down.  Also I'm not a fan of the orange Amazon-ish stitches.  Really lowers the classiness in a business setting.  But in general, it's been a great bag, and I'm sorry it is dying (the interior stitching has come all apart and the shoulder protector came off months ago).  And I guess I'm buying another one now.
 Editing my comment 6 months in. The bag works well, but I have had one glaring problem with it. The clip for the bag's strap cut a hole in the bag's fabric. This hole exposes the laptop compartment to air, moisture, all the things I want the bag to protect it from. This is an inexpensive bag, I wasn't expecting it to last forever. I was hoping to get more than 6 months out of it, and I am particularly annoyed that the bag's own hardware caused the hole the in bag. This is why I'm bringing my rating down to 2 stars.<br/><br/>My original 4-star review, written when I'd been using the bag for less than a week, follows:<br/><br/>This is a good quality bag, with padding to protect a laptop. This has enough pockets and room to carry your everyday items without being bulky. (I can carry a large file folder, a pencil case, a pad, and some cables/plugs etc, along with a 15" laptop.) I've only had it a few days now, so I can't speak to its long-term durability. But it feels solid and well-constructed. The padded shoulder strap and handles are a nice touch.<br/><br/>There are two things I wish were a little different. One, I wish the laptop section were separate from the main section. The whole compartment is padded, but anything in that compartment can bang against the laptop. (The very delicate retina displays on current Mac laptops make me worried about this.) Two, I wish the bag had one or two outside pockets for storing an umbrella and water bottle. Those are two everyday items I often want to carry with me. Aside from that, I'm happy with this bag.
 If you're looking for an inexpensive, compact case for your computer that's bigger than a sleeve but not as big as a full blown briefcase, this is a great choice!  This case is nearly perfect for my needs, especially considering the price.  I have a Toshiba 13.3" Chromebook2 and am a B2C sales professional.  Here are my observations.  Construction quality is good.  Main pocket is roomy enough for a laptop, a couple file folders, notebook and power cord and HDMI cable but not overly bulky.  Larger side pocket hold 2 pens, business cards and has enough space to hold a small notebook.  Smaller side pocket is good for letters or other small items you don't want crushed in the other two pockets.  My only complaint about the bag is that the pad on the shoulder strap that came with it was ridiculously cheap; it's way too stiff to be useful, but because of the incredible price, I couldn't bring myself to deduct a star.  Plus, workaround is super easy:  (a) remove pad or (b) use a different strap.  I opted for (b).  I just took the one from my old Trager bag.  BTW, the construction of this bag--admitted after only a few weeks of use--is probably better than the Trager.
 I bought this for two things, and it does both of them well:<br/><br/>1) I have a Surface Pro 2 and wanted to tote the Surface, a small Bluetooth mouse, and the power adapter around<br/>2) My daughter has an iPad Air and a Wacom Creative Bluetooth stylus, and I bought her this bag to haul the iPad, stylus, power adapter and cables around<br/><br/>I bought the 7-10 inch version, and it serves both purposes just fine.  This bag is simple, but the details are well done.  For example, the zipper is sturdy and its tab easy to grip.  It slides open easily.  The neoprene feel of the bag is stretchy but doesn't feel cheap.  It's interesting that the liner is bright orange, but I agree with other reviewers that this makes it very easy to see down into it when you're wondering where a cable or memory card or stylus got to.<br/><br/>One big thing for me is handles--I hate when they're cheap and they come apart.  These handles have an extra layer of material wrapped around the grips and they appear to be firmly attached to the bag--given its size, it would be hard to overload this bag with weight that might break them.<br/><br/>Given the price of this bag, it's an incredible bargain due to its quality.  If you want a simple carrier, Amazon has done a good job with this AmazonBasics bag.
 I was wary of buying a bag like this thinking they may be cheaply made at such a price, but I've been using mine for a little over a month and it has held up perfect for heavy daily use, even carrying around a heavy laptop and several books/folders. I haven't had any strap issues at all (as some have complained) and maintains weight far better than backpacks, which is what I previously used for daily carry.  I suppose the only issue I can see is the structuring of the bag. It could indeed use more padding, and it would be nice if it could stand up on its own without leaning on something. But for the price, it isn't a big deal. Overall, I do recommend it.
 For the price, you really can't beat it.  However, I was a little disappointed with how floppy it is. It is padded well and would probably protect your laptop, but not quite as well as if it were more rigid.  My laptop is a 15.6" widescreen and I got this bag because I thought it would fit better due to the widescreen.  I believe I was correct as my laptop fits perfectly width-wise. The bag is a little tall for my laptop, but that's fine. Overall it seems like a decent bag and good quality for the price. I would recommend this to anyone on a budget that just wants something more than a sleeve to protect their equipment.
 Exactly what I needed, a simple carry bag for my old-ish refurb laptop. I'm not one for all the newest tech or gadgetry, nor do I need a logo on my soft goods, so this fit the bill. Feels durable, well-padded, zippers feel tight and easy.<br/><br/>Only thing preventing five stars is the carry strap - it's awkward, all plastic connections, and the pad for the shoulder doesn't fit correctly. But since my unit doesn't weigh a ton, the bag is perfectly serviceable. I like the pockets both inside and out, plenty of stashing places for peripherals.
 Before I ordered this item, I was sort of skeptical about purchasing it because of what I'd read from the reviews.  So, I gave it a try, and purchased this item for my Lenovo Ideapad 330 laptop, and I have to say when I received this item most of the reviews that I'd saw about the smell of the bag was definitely true. When I received the bag, it had that funky smell that most the reviews had mentioned,  but overall I thought the bag was very well manufactured, and durable. A big plus about this bag is that it's very spacious, and it can fit a lot of like books, notebooks, chargers, and  you name it.  I personally think it's perfect for school, or business type of bag, but I would preferably purchase a laptop sleeve just in case to have that extra protection for your laptop.
 A nice basic inexpensive bag to tote your laptop or possibly also your tablet.  Bare bone basic.  Many people like to trick out their computer bags.  Why go to the trouble and expense if basic black will do?  Henry Ford once quipped of the first mass manufactured car the model T that it was available in any color you want as long as it was black.  He also made automobiles accessible to very many more Americans theretofore.  He also automated the car manufacturing business here in America in the early 20th Century.  Henry Ford was one sharp cookie and did to automobile manufacturing in the United States what the Chinese did to the Fortune cookie.  Does your fortune cookie say buy AmazonBasics 15.6-Inch Laptop and Tablet Bag?
 I bought this for my son to carry his art pad and art supplies in since he was lugging them everywhere he goes. I didn't have high expectations due to the very low price, but I must say that it's held up surprisingly well. He carries it to junior high and back home five days a week with no problems. The first thing that I thought would break were the clips that attach to the shoulder strap because they're made of plastic, but to my surprise they haven't broken yet and he's going on two months of almost daily back and forth use. I would recommend this product and would purchase another one in the future. We have NOT tried this product with a computer or tablet in it, but it has served our purposes well, and even exceeded my expectations.
 It is what it is. Very cheaply priced and very cheaply made. I use it to store a laptop, but I would not trust this flimsy poopster to safely transport a laptop that I valued. There is virtually no padding in this thing and the handles are so cheap. I actually use the Amazon Basics foam laptop sleeve first (which is also a cheap piece of poo) before sliding the laptop into this bag. As I said, I use this more as a dust cover, than an actual means to safely transport a computer. The pockets are so small I can just fit a corded mouse and power brick inside. I understand the idea of the Basics brand, but this product makes me have second thoughts about purchasing more items from the Basics line. I like my phone charging cables.<br/>But, I dunno. Not recommended.
 I got this for my Lenovo Yoga 3 14".  It fit the laptop and a few accessories very well.  The shoulder pad is clunky and poorly designed so I got rid of it.  The clips are also a little awkward, and were partially responsible for the accident that broke my laptop screen.<br/><br/>I was reaching to adjust the clip while the bag was on my shoulder.  The clip had twisted upside down.  It came undone after very little pressure and the bag fell from my shoulder.  It landed on fairly soft dirt, but the bag has almost no padding--particularly on the corners.  It fell not very far, and I assumed it was fine.  However when I got to work and pulled it out the corner of my touchscreen had cracked pretty badly.<br/><br/>The bag is pretty good for carrying if you are careful of the clips, and it is a good slim size.  However it is not helpful for protecting your laptop.
 This product is much more than what I expected! It is nice and roomy, fits my iPad Air 2 along with 2 cases that I switch between, it has a nice side pocket too for chargers, headphones, etc. The quality of it is perfect, it is very soft and nice feeling, and the handle is great! I would recommend this product along with several others I bought for my new iPad Air 2
 I am really starting to love AmazonBasics. First the charging cables, then the laptop sleeve, and now the messenger bag!  I had been looking for a new bag for my laptop and most of the models i was considering were &gt;$50 until I ran across the AmazonBasics bag.<br/><br/>The 14-inch version fits my 13" MacBook Air in a laptop sleeve PERFECTLY. There is also room for the charger, but beyond that it does get a little tight. The bag itself is lightweight, made of sturdy nylon with nice heavy duty zippers. The front pocket has smaller compartments for pens/phones/etc. The adjustable shoulder strap is nice and wide with a padded piece to go on your shoulder. My only worry is the strap clips that are plastic (especially when carrying relatively heavy electronics) but so far they're doing the job just fine.<br/><br/>All in all, a great purchase...and for the price, you'd be hard pressed to beat it!<br/><br/>******Edit*****<br/>It's two and a half years later and the bag is still going strong. No rips, no tears, no fuss. Have never once had the clips unhook as a few reviews have mentioned. This remains the bag I take absolutely everywhere: work everyday, coffeeshops, conferences and even on vacations!
 This is a great tech bag! I was using a basic cotton purse/bag for a long while and finally realized I needed something with more padding and better pockets.<br/>This bag satisfies all of what I need for carrying our tech about with us. Which is usually 2 tablets, a mobile hotspot device, cell phone and miscellaneous cords and chargers.<br/>Enough room for paperwork and some granola bars too but still not feel like I am lugging a suitcase about.<br/>I like the two different straps as well. Long one for cross body wear is my favorite but the short handles I use more than I expected for just grabbing the bag out of the car etc.<br/>It's a narrow bag, which is why it's so great for tablets etc, but that also means if you stuff something big in the front pocket it makes it difficult to pull things out of the main pocket. "Then dear self don't stuff something big into the front pocket! Problem solved!"<br/>Haha well it's not a problem, just mentioning it becaussssse I was tickled I can even stuff our big camera in the front pocket just to have everything all in one bag on the go. It's not meant for that but kind of cool to have the option. A beautiful upgrade for the bag in the future would be one of those expandable pockets in the front for bulky item storage options.<br/>The price, ridiculously good for such a handy bag.<br/>Oh and it's padded enough I feel good about the tablets being protected when setting the bag down etc.<br/>So, great bag. Both myself and my husband use it. Very pleased with the purchase.
 College Student:<br/>I purchased a laptop around the same time this bag was purchased! It is important to me to keep my laptop as safe as possible in order to keep it from breaking down on me. I took the risk on purchasing this laptop bag because it was at a VERY CHEAP PRICE. In my family we have a saying where we shouldn’t purchase cheap things unless you want to regret it when it breaks or rips easily. However, this laptop bag has proved our saying wrong! First I was so happy to purchase this bag at an affordable price! Second I know have options between having to carry my backpack and laptop case to school or just laptop case! Why? Well this laptop bag has two outer pockets! It fits my pencils and pens! The other pocket carries my charger, mini mouse and mouse pad! On the inside it has 3 pouches! Where the biggest you obviously put your laptop in and the other two I use for school papers or other random things. The strap is also very comfortable because it has support for your shoulder and you also have the option to keep the straps on and carry it on your shoulder or take them off where you can carry it by the small straps like a small briefcase.<br/><br/>Recommended for everyone in need of a laptop carrying bag!
 Just wanted to comment here on long term durability. 3.5 years, going strong as a daily user.<br/>And that is saying something since I abuse the crap out of things. I don't always just use this for my work laptop, that I usually only bring home on weekends. During the week it gets my lunch, tools, anything I need to throw in there. So it does not live a gentle life.<br/>So it dawned on me today after all these years, not a thing has gone wrong with it. The zippers all still work fine, pull tabs still on there, the inside has no tears. I mean it is just a well made laptop bag.
 Nice inexpensive bag. Holds my Kindle, 13-in convertible Dell laptop, a magazine or 2 or 3, and room for extra stuff like my wallet, western digital hard drive, Windows Nokia 1020 phone, charge brick and cord for laptop, charge adapter &amp; usb cord for Kindle &amp; phone and reading glasses case plus more.<br/><br/>The only real negatives I've noticed is plastic strap clip connects to plastic D ring when hanging from shoulder makes an annoying squeaking noise!  Also, the nylon piece holding the D ring allows the ring to turn in circle so that instead of flat part of ring staying in down position it turns. The piece holding the D ring should have been sewn tightly around flat part of ring to prevent movement. Only last issue which really isn't detrimental is the lack of something to carry a water bottle or travel coffee tumbler. All that said the bag does what it's designed for and I guess that's all one can ask.
 I have the 11.6 inch version.  This is an excellent bag, especially for the price.  From reading the other reviews, it looks like the 7-10 inch model is different from the others.  The 7-10 inch model appears to be made of a soft neoprene material, but the others (including the 11.6 model that I have) are constructed with a much more durable nylon.  I bought it to carry my Acer C720 Chromebook, which fits perfectly in this bag.  The main compartment is large enough to fit my Chromebook with room to spare.  I could probably stack two of them in there if I wanted to.<br/><br/>So far I have used this bag to carry the Chromebook in the main section, a Kindle Paperwhite (inside a case) in the secondary pocket, and earphones in one of the little pockets.  The third pocket would be good for my phone and/or wallet, if needed.<br/><br/>Overall, this is bag is very well designed and solidly constructed.  I expect to use it for years, as long as I keep having devices that fit it.  If you replaced the Amazon logo with any number of other brand names, it would probably sell for double or triple the price.
 Probably the only problem I've got now, is I've outgrown the smaller size.. but I'm moving up to a 17" one I think..<br/><br/>This bag holds quite a bit for me. the outer small pouch (that can be reversed to get most things out), holds all my thumbdrives, usb wifi and bluetooth adapters, and has room for my gigabit usb network adapter, and some usb power adapters. Inside, I have a tablet pen and a permanent marker, in the center pocket, some reimaging thumb drives, 3 usb micro wires, and the right pocket, 2 more usb power wires. in front of the pockets, I have 2 very large portable battery chargers, both 15Ah and up which can power laptops as well as quick charge phones with 2.5A ports. including a smaller charger for others, 2 otg cables (1 with power), and a few other adapters. Inside the main zipped area, I have a Toshiba Windows 8 tablet, a Samsung Galaxy 10" tablet, a bluetooth keyboard/mouse combo and some extra paper.<br/><br/>One side pocket in the big section will hold the tablet, but not the other.. but the samsung galaxy fits in the other one just fine. The larger is 10.25" wide, the tablet is just short of that, and 7" tall. the tablet is x 9½" x 7", and fits very snugly. the keyboard is the Generic IOS IBK-02 (for less than $30), fits left to right very snugly.. and a great bluetooth keyboard/mouse/TV Remote/tablet stand combo. battery lasts a very long time.<br/><br/>Yes, this thing holds a lot.. but be careful how it's arranged.. the sides of the sections are fabric and if someone sits on it, could crack the screens. Handles weight very nicely, and with it's small size, can fit almost anywhere. Great fabric. Got mine almost a year ago, and still looks new.<br/>VERY HAPPY, and getting another one soon.
 I've already ordered a second one of these.  It is made of strong fabric, good design, well stitched, and will easily accommodate my new 15.6" Asus NoteBook/Laptop - and with plenty room for accessories such as my external Hard Drive and my external Optical Drive.<br/><br/>The reason I ordered a second one is because it's also a good fit for my Canon iP100 Mobile Printer.  Again with plenty room to spare - even for a tablet.  I saw one similar bag made especially for this Canon printer, but I think they wanted something like $70.00 for it.  It may be worth that  price but it didn't look any better than this one.  And they cost me $14.99 each, and both came with fast free delivery - thanks to my Prime Membership.  .<br/><br/>And also (about  that Prime Membership), I have been ordering lots of products I normally purchase locally because of the Amazon prices and frequency of free shipping.  This only scratches the surface of the benefits Prime Membership gives me. If you don't already have a membership., you might want to check it out.<br/><br/>Yes, I'm excited.  And yes, I'm getting carried away.  Sorry.  Its just that, with my Canon Rebel on my neck strap, my very adequate  computer in one carry bag, and my excellent Canon Printer in the other, I'm set to go anywhere on any photo assignment.  Bring it on!.
 This AmazonBasics 11.6 laptop and tablet bag is very well constructed. The zippers are very solid and open and close easily.<br/><br/>The interior of the case is padded well enough and it protects my 10 inch tablet (with a cover on it) well.<br/><br/>This case is large enough for me to fit my large tablet, my large cellphone and even my wallet and keys....this way I use it like a purse.<br/><br/>This case looks very professional and I like it over tablet bags I have carried in the past. The padding could be a little thicker, yet it works great for me.<br/>***The strap, I found plenty sturdy enough, and easy to remove. I use it with the strap on it and carry it often with no problems.
 Well made bag.  Good amount of pockets without adding unnecessary bulk.  It is a good size, I ordered the 11.6 inch version for my Surface Pro 3, works great!  Plenty of room in the main pocket to hold the Surface snugly, but not so tight that it is difficult to get in and out.Main pocket also includes a small slot for a tablet or eReader and a full-width divider that allows you to carry letter papers or folders.  Two smaller pockets on the front are great for a notepad and pens, and any accessories like a power brick or display adapters.<br/><br/>Interior padding in the laptop\main compartment is sufficient, but padding could be better in the bottom corners. Still, it is as good as most bags that cost slightly more.  Zippers and seams seem very sturdy.  I did read in some reviews that people experienced the strap coming unclipped, I have not had this happen and the clips seem very sturdy and the gate is stiff enough that I don't worry about it coming open.<br/>Overall I am very happy
 Update: I did get my refund  from Amazon so hats off to them for great customer service as always but I leave my review at two stars.<br/><br/>I am big fan of Amazon basics products specifically their cables. I thought from the amazing reviews (rated 4.7) was enough to believe I would not have any issues with this case.<br/>At first this seemed to be very well built. Other than stitching coming apart, this case has very good amount of padding. You can feel very confident that your laptop is well protected if you accidentally bump into something while carrying it in your hand.<br/>there is good storage for all accessories for your laptop as well.<br/>The issue with the case is the stitching for mine around the handle has begun to come apart and around the zipper area on the very front pocket. I have not put anything other than my laptop and it's charger in it and a wireless mouse. The stitching on the handle is bad enough to where I believe it will  barely be hanging on a thread, two weeks from now.<br/>the good thing is it has a one year warranty on it from Amazon so I will see if I can return it for a full refund and knowing the great customer service they have provided me before, I'm confident they will. But there is always that small possibility and will update my review and rating once I check if I can get a refund
 I like the bag, its of the quality i expected, its easy to dust and clean and have enough pockets to put all your stuff. I put my external HDD, external CD-rom, flashdrive, and even a medium sized book in it, the only problem is the shoulder belt is fixed to the bag with a plastic clip on both edges of the bag, not a metal one. But it is perfect. I have taken a shot of that.
 This bag is perfect for many things. I have a bunch of clothes without pockets and needed something that didn't look like what I've been told are "man purses", which upset me. This laptop bag looks more "masculine" and serious, even if I'm just hauling a wallet, keys, cellphone, and spare change. I've even started carrying spare contacts, a little first aid stuff, and a spare battery/cable for my phone. Since I don't use the handles, I carefully cut the short handles off to simplify it. Wow - this bag is so nice. I'm very happy with it and will certainly get a larger one later for my actual laptop. Thank you, Amazon Basics, for your whole line of stuff. I've bought a bunch of it and saved even more money than usual doing so. Highly recommend this product - and I am not a paid reviewer or anything - genuine customer.
 Great fit for my new Acer CB3-131  11.6" Chromebook with enough room around the computer to make it easy to insert in the bag without being too tight or too loose. Bag is well padded and exterior fabric is sturdy and easy to clean with a damp cloth.  Outside zip closure pockets allow for storage of the power brick/cord and a small mouse should you need one.  Quality of workmanship is good and the shoulder strap is comfortable -- the fact that it's easily removable is a nice touch as well.  This bag would be a great deal even if it cost half-again as much, and at this price point, it's a steal of a buy!
 This bag is pretty fantastic! I bought an Amazon Basics tablet bag for my fiance's 11.6 inch laptop, he loves it and I loved it so much I bought this 14 inch bag for my 13.3 inch Chromebook. It fits nicely with lots of room for chargers, tablets, and a bunch of other stuff. It truly feels like really good quality and I'm sure it'll last for a good long while. I'm not quite sure why it's called a tablet bag, but it's perfect for my laptop. The amazon basics tags and emblems used to bother me a little bit, but now I just feel like they make really good stuff that's far cheaper than big name brand items and I'm proud to tell people about their products! I'm officially a huge fan of Amazon Basics stuff, it started with a wall charger to a GPS mount to tablet/laptop bags and soon I'll be buying a camera bag! I highly recommend this bag!
 This is a nice laptop bag that is just the right size for my 11 inch laptop. It has a couple of extra pockets to store things and a nice handle. The only small issue I have is that it bulges a bit when I try to put the power adapter in the front pocket, but that's not too big an issue. If you are looking for a small bag to protect or carry your laptop, this one seems to be a good deal. Some people have reported issues with the shoulder strap. I don't use it so I can't comment much on that.
 I especially like the roominess of this laptop bag.  It fits a 15.6" laptop, mouse, and power adapter, leaving room for lots more. And yet, it doesn't seem over-large.  I have another laptop bag that is more of a sleeve which I would not buy again.  A laptop bag is useless if it doesn't allow room to carry at least the power cord.<br/><br/>The quality of this bag seems good for the occasional user.  I don't travel with my laptop a lot but need a decent bag for it when I do.  I wish it came in other colors, though.
 Excellent padding, and storage amount is just right for an 11" laptop - enough room for a paper back tech book, a few papers or a folder or 2, the laptop power cord (8' thin cord w/ smallish wall-wart).<br/><br/>I wanted the smallest possible case, and I was looking at sleeves at first, but realized I would need to carry the power adapter as well, so I needed a pocket.<br/><br/>In fact the storage is extremely useful in this case without adding unwanted bulk:<br/>Main Pocket: center area for laptop, padded bottom and sides, 2 outer-side fabric dividers - perfect for 1 medium-thick tech book ("Mastering Bitcoin" is in there at present).<br/><br/>Outer Large Pocket: just large enough for the power cord and wall-wart-style transformer integrated in to the plug,  Also includes 2 inner fabric pockets - good for slim things like a stack of business cards, 2 pen holder loops, room enough for a USB cable or thumb drives, etc.<br/><br/>Outer Small Pocket: great for cell phone, keys or key fobs, USB cable or spare cell battery pack.<br/><br/>I even took this on vacation, keeping my wallet cellphone, laptop, and keys always together.<br/><br/>Zippers are sturdy and coarse enough to work very easily, stitching appears to be rugged.<br/><br/>I've had this bag about 4 months, and I am very satisfied with it.<br/><br/>I purchased this specifically for my Asus X205T 11" Win8.1 laptop.  I hesitated to purchase this case at first, because I thought it would be too much case for the sleek and tiny Asus X205T, however it has worked out to just the right size for utility and comfort.<br/><br/>Comes with removable should strap - I don't use the shoulder strap, but could easily see how if one wanted that it would likely work well.
 Amazing case! Very durable, well designed, I bought it for personal use, so I'm not trying to cram a lot of extra devices in, just the laptop itself and the cord.  I can use it to carry both laptop and iPad, there are enough compartments.  I could not believe how light it is!  I had to weigh it on my little kitchen scale, and it weighed only 1 pound!  I bought a new case for my new laptop, because the case I had is so old, beat-up, and HEAVY.  I am absolutely delighted with this case!
 I got the 11.6” size for my daughter tonsafely transport her school issued chromebook to/from school after the (junky) one the school provided completely fell apart over the last 2 months. Because her chromebook has a snap on case, it was a very tight squeeze to get it into this size bag and not practical at all. I measured her chromebook as it is and the interior dimensions for the bag should have given enough space but there is barely enough to finagle getting it in so I will be returning it for the next larger size. The bag itself does seem to be well made, good padding/cushion and has extra storage inside and outside.
 There are some pros and cons of this bag.  For me, so far the pros outweigh the cons, but here they are:<br/>Pro<br/>The bag is very nicely constructed.  Zippers are heavy but not loud and I like that there are two zipper pulls, which are pretty large and rubbery, so they are easy to grab.<br/>The neoprene cloth is good quality.  I haven't had any snags, rips or seams coming unravelled.<br/>The zipper pocket on the front is a nice size. It can hold my charger and my little stand with plenty of room to spare.<br/>The bag is small enough to fit easily in my briefcase, while the handles make it easy to grab as I toss my briefcase in the overhead compartment on the plane.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Not a biggie, but the inside of this bag is an orange so bright that it makes your eyes hurt, and diminishes the otherwise professional look of the bag.<br/>There is no shoulder strap.  This is my main reason for the 4 vs 5 stars.  The handles on this are very awkward.  Not quite big enough to slip over your wrists to carry something else (like say, a tray of food at the airport,) and curiously thick for a bag that is holding a fairly lightweight object, which makes it hard to hang off another bag with a carabiner, as I have done with other small bags.  A detachable should strap added would definitely have made this a 5 star review.
 This is my go-to bag for work due to it's stylish look, lightweight feel, durable construction, and storage capacity. Great for laptops and smartbooks, separate inside storage pockets allow several devices room without scratching each other. It is not waterproof, but light rain will not harm your goods inside. I love that I can be hands free at meetings and events, yet still have all my things close as the carrying strap allows for the bag to be worn on the shoulder or across the body for easy maneuvering. This is a necessity for the student or professional.
 The Bad:<br/>As a few other reviewers mentioned, the shoulder strap WILL unclip when just the right orientation of the clip hook to the bail it attaches to occurs. What happens is that the clip hook doesn't always swivel freely, especially if the strap has twisted itself across the side of the bag. When you lift it up, the clip doesn't swivel and all the weight of the bag deflects the flexible part of the clip sideways, out of the hook body and the hook pops off of the bail. I think the only way to fix this would be with a metal clip body. You can avoid this if you wiggle the strap a bit before you pick up the bag to make sure the strap extends straight up and the clips aren't jacked sideways.<br/>A smaller issue is that the length of the strap material is such that the adjustment slider is in the exact spot you would want the should pad to be when set to the average person's size.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/>This is a really nice bag for $14. I got the 11" version and it feels durable and well padded. The padding seems fine for the weight of a typical 11" Chromebook but I suspect there is too little in the corners for larger, heavier laptops. The zippers seem tough and the straps are well sewn and durable. The pockets are nice though it's too bad the pocket that has the sleeves for a wallet, pens, etc. is also the only pocket big enough for a power supply. So you can't easily get at your pens, etc. if the power supply is in there. All in all, a really nice bag. I would say it can't be touched for under $20
 Pros:<br/>I was looking for a simple bag to put my Acer netbook in with a  charger pouch. Believe it or not this is not easy to find in Amazon because some of these bags only hold the netbook without the charger, and has all kinds of designer fluff that I did not want. I did manage to find a reasonable priced bag with a clam-shelled design from a warehouse deal, but the zipper was broken and I had to return it. Also there was no pouch for holding the charger.<br/><br/>I was worried that I would not like the material or the bag since Amazon sells goods and does not design them, but my worries were put to rest my 11.6 inch Acer netbook would fit like a glove inside, and there was even ample room to put  spare earphones which I did put inside with the charger. I also can put a spare mouse inside If I decide to do prolong travelling. The zippers and orange tags on the front adds a professional touch. The pouch has ample room to put in accessories and other important things like pens and small notepads.<br/><br/>Zippers have not succumbed to failure or normal wear like other bags.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The shoulder strap is not attached and is inside the bag it only takes a little technical know-how to put it on, but I can understand why someone would be upset when they saw the picture and unwrapped the box without the strap being attached.<br/><br/>Like all bags the bag does cling to dirt, but I have another sleeve from another company that stains as well and believe it or not that bag has more dirt than this Amazon Bag. I suggest you buy a bag that is made out of leather skin, and to pay more for that specific piece of luxury.<br/><br/>Some people might be put off by the Amazon logo, but not me I am actually proud to own this product.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts:<br/><br/>I am more than impressed with this bag and I have waited a few months to give it a review because I wanted to see how it holds up to the daily grind and I'm glad I did, so I can give an objective review. It does stain a little easy because after I left it out for a few months  I can see little white stains by  the front pouch and dust clinging to the bag. I haven't tested the bag to normal wear and haven't traveled much with it, but it will stain easy from the outside from normal use. This is the only reason I haven't given a 5 star rating. I wish I can give it a 4.5 out of the price and features alone, but it is the little things of the strap and staining  which might put some people off including myself.<br/><br/>Since it is a polyester nylon fabric it is understandable why it would stain but it does not matter to me I am more impressed with this product compared to  the other bags I have seen here which are overpriced and shoddy. If that is a major issue I would of just paid more and found a leather product substitute.<br/><br/>The inside is well regulated and padded so the netbook and accessories will stay safe. It is definitely a product to be considered if you are looking for a budget traveling bag.
 The case seems to be fairly well made and it'll do the job.  My biggest problem is that the thing is absolutely huge!  I bought the correct side, and not all 15.6" laptops are exactly the same size, but I could fit five of my laptops next to each other inside this thing.  The description says "Slim, compact case".  In what universe is this "slim"???  Look at the photo.  Does that look slim?  Most modern laptops are less than an inch thick.<br/><br/>This will suffice, but I'd really rather one that has about 1/4 the internal width.
 I really like these Amazon Basics cases.  I have a few different sizes now for my iPad, my club treasurer's laptop, my own laptop, and even my husband has one for his iPad. They are durable, well made and have just enough pockets to organized everything you need without getting heavy and bulky.  I think a lot of thought of R&amp;D went into the design.  I bought this case for my club's laptop now that I'm using it as treasurer.  The price was so low I'm not going to bother getting reimbursed.  I have used a different strap, I wanted one with some padding.  So I have no experience with the durability of the strap.
 Believe it or not, Amazon has made a better computer case than all the computer makers or case makers.  Everything fits in neatly and it is rather compact.  The cases available from computer case makers are WAY TOO TIGHT and squeeze the computer and transformer to the point that the case bulges out.  The Amazon case is much better.  It fits everything neatly but does not squeeze the computer, transformer, and cord too tightly.  I think Amazon could have made this case more compact but as it is, it is compact enough.
 I bought this because it is super inexpensive. It DOES NOT fit the Alienware 17” laptops. The corner of my laptop pokes out and one zipper cannot zip, and the other zipper handle ring is broken. Also a heavier laptop makes the shoulder strap feel like it is cutting into you skin which is rough with constant airport travel and walking.
 For the price, you can't beat this bag. It has four large pockets: one main pocket that has two sleeves inside for laptops, a second large pocket that is perfecting for storing flash drives, mice, adapters, power cords, etc. and a smaller pocket on the front that is handy for storing small cables or documents such as a passport.<br/><br/>The bag is super light. When I'm carrying my 15 inch Macbook Pro, it's power cord, an iPhone power cord, and a few other accessories, it feels like the bag is barely there. That aspect is awesome when walking around with the bag. Only con is that it makes the bag feel a little cheap and like there isn't much padding, but at the price you can't complain much.<br/><br/>Only major downside is the clips used to secure the strap are plastic and seem a little cheap, but I haven't had any issues with them yet.<br/><br/>tl;dr: great bag for the price. light, but feels a little cheap. Plastic clips for the straps may not last very long
 PERFECT fit for Surface Pro 4, although it has to go in the center of, not inside, one of the two "side pockets" of the center compartment. I believe those two side pockets give you pretty much a universal fit for a variety of size devices, however. The Surface Pro 4 is just slightly too big to fit in one, whereas a smaller device would fit in one and thus flop around less.<br/><br/>I have several flash drives, a couple Active Mini-DisplayPort to HDMI and DVI adapters http://amzn.to/1O8hAaU and http://amzn.to/1PFOvts , the Surface Pen, a real Pen, in the next-middle zipper compartment. The only thing I would (and plan to) add is some velcro closures on the pockets in this compartment so the flash drives will stay in them if the case gets turned upside-down. Those Active adapters work perfectly with the Surface Pro 4 Dock, by the way, which MUST have Active adapters.<br/><br/>In the front-most zipper compartment, I have a Mouse, http://amzn.to/1PFPpGs USB 3.0 Hub + Ethernet Adapter, the Surface Pro 4 power supply/cord, ... my point is this holds quite a bit of items including some bulkier ones like the mouse and power brick.
 I really like this case. I bought it for my Chromebook. It's large enough to hold the Chromebook, charger, cables, dongle and power bank. I've even tossed in a tablet from time to time. Today I noticed the stitching for the zipper is coming apart along the corner of the main compartment. I've had this for a couple of years but have only used it twice a week the last two years and not at all the first year. So I don't feel that I have that much use in it yet. I expect better from Amazon Basics products.
 Was looking for a cary case for a recently purchased 10" Lenovo Yoga  Tablet 2.  This cary case appealed to me because at would accommodate my tablet  and had compartments so that I could store it with the keyboard detached in one and the tablet in the other or store attached in a single compartment.  It's also possible to store a few sheets of 8.5 X 11.0 inch paper, although this is pushing it, because you are at the limit of the interior available space.  It differed from the product described on the Amazon site in 2 regards. First, I had been concedrfned about the stated interior width measurement, 0.84." Tme example I received is considerable wider than that.  The thickness of my Tablet 2 is greater than 0.8" and it easily fit with perhaps 1/2" to spare.  The site depicted a "day glow orange interior.  Mine came with a much more pleasing medium gray lining. There are two zippered pouches (in addition to the compartment for the tablet).  These seem designed to hold ancillary tablet pieces such as adaptors, cables, your cell phone etc. Unless you have a very thin "wall wart" I would not recommend putting this in the case as a bump might crack the screen of your tablet. I wish case manufacturers would append a pouch for these at one of the ends of the case, like camera bags have.  This would be a safe wall wart location. This is a well made, utilitarian tablet case.  You could make it fancier, but hard to make it more functional. My only gripe is that the starp it came witrh seems out of scale with this deminutive case- it's too wide.  But that's a minor gripe.  I love this case and will be ordering another for my Win 8 Lenovo tab 2.
 Great bag for my 12" surface pro 4.  Spacious with different pockets to hold at the same time:<br/>a) mouse, pointer, ac charger, calculator (in the expandable pocket)<br/>b) Surface Pro with plenty room<br/>c) several folders with many 8.5x11 pages<br/>d) tablet galaxy with bulky case for kids<br/>e) keys, pencils other small stuff.<br/>It is also lightweight, sturdy enough to  hold easily more weight than the one i have used.  And it is cheaper than any other bag in the market.  The strap is confortable.  I bought it jan 2017 and I've used it for 2 months.
 I rec'vd my order and went to attach the long shoulder strap, however, only one side of the shoulder strap had a latch on it to connect to the bag. The other side had absolutely nothing! I looked and looked and examined the bag very carefully to be sure I wasn't missing a way to connect the other side of the long strap. However, it was very obvious after about 30 minutes that this was a malfunctioned product. Very disappointed.
 I bought this bag for my <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Acer-C720P-Chromebook-11-6-Inch-Touchscreen-2GB-Moonstone-White/dp/B00H7WF22K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Acer C720P Chromebook (11.6-Inch Touchscreen, 2GB) Moonstone White</a>, which replaced a sluggish ASUS TF700 and an even slower Dell Inspiron N4010.

 I bought this bag to hold a tablet I got from an employer. The 11.6" size was exactly what I needed to fit my tablet. I have used the crap out of this bag. It has three zippered pockets. A large one for your tablet with or without a keyboard. This pocket also has two individual pockets inside for paperwork, pens, etc. A medium sized one for the charger and mouse if you have one. And finally a small one, which I use for my headphones. This pocket works perfect for them. This bag has the two regular carry handles as well as the shoulder strap. I found my son using it to carry his action figures around the yard. After I got his stuff out of it I was expecting to find some tears or rips inside it, but to my surprise it had no damage. This bag is easy to clean as well. I had to give it a good cleaning inside and out after my son's little adventure with it. Very easy to wipe out the inside of it. I took a little plastic bristle brush to get the dirt off the outside and it looked like new. I plan on getting a better tablet soon, so I will be buying another one of these bags.
 Perfect size for 11.6 inch Chromebook.  This is well built and offers extra pockets for accessories such as a charger and other items.  There are 2 zippered pockets on the outside, the larger one has 2 pockets for additional organization.  The main center zippered area, which holds the computer, has large pocket dividers on both sides.  I was able to carry both the Chromebook and my 7 inch Kindle Fire HD.  This case is padded and offers good protection.  I can put this in the car trunk and know that my Chromebook is well protected.
 I was looking for a basic, lightweight bag to carry my 15-inch Dell laptop to and from my office. The bag I had was much too large and actually weighed more than the computer itself. All I wanted was a bag that would hold the computer, power supply, mouse and and a folder or two of papers. After several trips to the big box and office supply stores, I came up empty. All the bags they had were too large, had too many storage compartments and pockets and were too heavy. To make it worse, the bags I did not like ranged in price from $50 to $150. That's too much to spend for a bag that would not meet my needs.<br/><br/>I was looking at bags on Amazon and came across this bag. It appeared to be just what I wanted and at less than $17, the price was right. I was a bit concerned about the quality of the bag at that price, but I decided to order it and give it a try. When the bag arrived, I was very pleasantly surprised. The build quality was excellent and the materials used are top notch. Everything fits with room to spare and the bag loaded with my computer and accessories weighs just a bit more than my old bag.<br/><br/>This is, as the name suggests, a basic bag. It does not have a lot of room for papers, a lot of accessories and more. The padding on the bag is sufficient for my use, which consists of traveling in a car from my home to my office and back. However, if you want a bag that you can use for frequent travel in airplanes, trains, etc., or if you need to carry a lot of equipment and papers, this may not be the bag for you. But if you, as I did, need a basic bag for local travel, this bag would be a great choice.
 I've had the 11.6 inch version for almost three years and I love it. Originally I purchased it to carry a Kindle Fire and accessories and it worked fine for that purpose. Then I moved to an iPad and started using this bag to carry it around. It's plenty big enough for an iPad plus a Kindle or a book. It's tall enough to include a magazine or a stack of papers. Really, lots of room on the inside. I also love the two exterior zippered pockets which provide plenty of room for cables, cell phones, pens, memo pads, thumb drives, or whatever miscellaneous items you need to take around with you. My iPad is equipped with its own case, so it feels plenty safe inside - I'm not really relying on the bag to provide protection for my electronics. I've never used the shoulder strap, I just carry it around by the handles. I mainly use it back and forth from the office, and it has been plenty durable for that purpose. It still looks good, and the zippers are in good condition. I would recommend this product as long as you are not relying on it to do things it's not built to do, i.e. act as the first line of defense against laptop or tablet breakage.
 Amazing quality for the price. Really. I have a lot of respect for fellow Amazon reviewers, but I confess to being just a tad bit skeptical that this little bag could be that good for that low a price. Especially when much more basic sleeves or bags this size are running two to five times the price. But...well, wow!  Yes, the lining fabric is a cheap nylon, but it's sturdy and will do the job. Yes, the stitching may be a little longer (been a long time since I sewed, so...8 stitches to the inch instead of 12? I'm too lazy to measure because it doesn't matter.) The bag is still well made, with sturdy seams, excellent padding--including on the bottom, where even some high-end sleeves and totes really skimp. The layout of the bag with its choice of interior and exterior pockets is far better than any other I've looked at--I can carry my 11" laptop, my kindle, the charger, a portable surge protector, a smaller spiral notebook, pens, my phone, and some of the miscellaneous junk that always seems to accumulate--and with the options even I can find whatever I'm looking for.  Zippers are good quality heavy duty and the main zip has two pulls so you can open from the center. Zippers go far enough to provide easy access (not always guaranteed even on the more expensive ones I looked at), and there's a baffle under both sides of the main zipper that protects your computer from getting scratched by the zipper. Padding on the handles is comfortable. The shoulder strap is wide, well made, with good hardware and a decent pad. Exterior nylon is durable and should take a lot of use. Next laptop bag I have to buy, I plan on going straight to Amazon Basics....'cause all those other reviewers really weren't fibbing. It really is excellent value for the money.
 A good bag, that holds my laptop and some accessories well, but is not bulky with dozens of compartments I don't want. It has a few, sufficient to my needs, and some of them have inner pouches for holding such things as wireless mice. My laptop has a big screen and this fits it well. It lacks heavy padding; I would be careful using it anywhere you weren't in control of how it's treated, such as in a cargo container or checked baggage - but I would never check a laptop, so that wasn't an issue for me.
 Amazon making their own products? It's a no brainer. Let me start by saying I bought the 11.6 variant of this case for my Asus t100 tablet and its attached keyboard. I am very satisfied with this purchase and this product. I'm surprised at how good it is considering its price. Some cases can go upwards of 30+ dollars. Are they any better? No, not really. This case is very impressive. One of my main needs for a case was protection. My previous case was pathetic in terms of how well it protected my devices. This Amazon case on the other hand is excellent. It's abundance of pockets and having a strap is a fantastic plus.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Quality - You are getting the same quality of more expensive cases at a fraction of the price.<br/>-Value - This is priced very competitively and undercuts other products<br/>-Has a strap - This is very handy if you want to carry this as a regular laptop case. It's also quite long too<br/>-Pockets - This provides so many pockets that you can place all your accessories and chargers in and not worry about hurting your device.<br/>-Protection - I am so pleased with how well this protects my device. I no longer need to worry about accidentally dropping this or placing something on top of it.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-The logo - You're either going to love or hate having that Amazon logo. I personally think it's kind of cool but I can see how others could dislike having it.<br/>-Size - Can be considered big or bulgy if all you were looking for a simple sleeve.<br/><br/>Bottom Line:<br/>This is an excellent product. There really isn't any better product for this price. It checks off the needs of a case and more. Quality and features are not lost for its low price. I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend anyone in need of a case to go with this one.<br/><br/>If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know!
 I was excited about this inexpensive bag. It has okay padding and is feather light. This is not the heavy duty bad you would use for traveling. I will probably use it for a month or two and then buy another, more durable, bag.<br/><br/>If you want a heavy duty, durable bag, this is not your bag. If you want something light and you are careful with your expensive 17" laptop like me, you should be fine...probably.
 Did much research to find a player our "smart" 3 yr old great grandson could operate. Didn't take long for him to thoroughly enjoy his player. Controls are easy. Joystick games great. Swivel screen one of the best I've seen. Added feature by turning it 180 degrees and laying it flat on the control panel....easily held in his lap. Sound good, video excellent, battery better than most. Highly recommend....Oh by the way their customer service is terrific. (asking questions).....
 Needed a good, padded bag for a 15" portable dvd player we take camping and this 17.3" bag is perfect! Didn't know if I should order the 15" bag but based on the interior dimensions provided in the description, I went with the larger bag. Glad I did!. Roomy enough that it's not a struggle to get the player in and out, but fits nice enough to provide adequate protection. Also has enough room and pockets for accessories, power cords, a couple of dvds, etc. Perfect for my purposes.
 Great bag for a Chromebook. In fact there are two vinyl dividers that you can store a second and a third Chromebook and keep the whole family happy. Or you can use the extra divisions for papers or spiral pads or probably 3 inches of materials. Material feels supple and able to absord shock. In addition to the carry handle, there's a detachable strap that is nice and wide so it doesn't gouge into your shoulder. Plenty of room for my mouse, charger and cables. Really nice bag. I like it.
 Laptop review first, Tablet + Laptop review 2nd:<br/><br/>Laptop Only:<br/>This Amazon Basic 14.1" laptop case is an excellent value at such a low price. This case works perfectly with the Asus X401A 14" laptop with a nano USB wireless mouse receiver left in the port at all time. And just the right amount of room for the mouse pad, wireless Logitech M325 or MS 3000 mobile mouse, plus the Asus laptop AC adapter. Plus a little more room for other small items lke USB flash drive and card reader, etc.<br/><br/>This is NOT for major road warriors that need briefcase sized room for papers, etc. Nor does the product listing try to give that illusion. This is a perfect value priced case for anyone with a 14" laptop that simply needs a low cost, light weight case to store and carry the basics.<br/><br/>Laptop plus 10" tablet:<br/>When I am using the case for just my 14" laptop, the tablet section is used for the mousepad, mouse, AC adapter, etc. As the accessories section in front is pretty small. It becomes a tight fit if you want to also carry a tablet in this case.<br/><br/>Based on other cases I have tried for a 14" laptop PLUS 10" Tablet, I would still give this case 5 stars for value and function. Though, again, it is a tight fit. But if you increase the size, the weight and cost go up more than I think is of value. Given that I don't tend to carry both around at the same time other than long distance travel, I am ok with it being a little tight for those times.<br/><br/>Overall, excellent case and I really wish Amazon Basic had a 17" laptop case in this line up as most cases for 17" models are road warrior style, which generally means much higher cost and much larger and heavier for items like papers, etc.
 I bought this to use with my surface pro 3. I checked around Best Buy and this is better than anything they had available. Inside the main compartment, there is a pocket in the front and one in back. I think those are designed to hold the computer(s) but the surface will not fit in those. However it will fit perfectly in between them with the smart type cover on. I use one of the pockets to hold my iPad mini. I typically carry both because there are apps I need and programs I need, depending what I'm trying to accomplish. There are 2 other zippered compartments on the front outside. One has 3 pen holders and a small pocket. I'm able to easily carry all chargers, cables, a small travel projector, etc. The case has all that and keeps a very small form factor.  I could probably squeeze a small notebook in it as well, but there isn't much room for too much more than a candy bar or pack of gum. No water bottles, lunches, etc.  This case does not open like a clamshell, so you can't work from a computer sitting in the case. The handles, zippers, and shoulder strap are very well made and the fabric is high quality. I'm shocked at the low price.
 This bag is a purchase that I made, prior to creating an account for our office.<br/>This bag was purchased to hold a laptop that would go with multiple plumbers to a construction site. I should make clear that this is the carrying case for a $1500+ mobile 3D model viewing workstation. This workstation is a tool. The plumbers treat this workstation as a tool... in exactly the same way that they treat a wrench as a tool.<br/>More than a year later, the laptop is still in service and in usable condition, as is the bag. This is a testament to the quality of a bag that cost just $16.49. The bag is durable and well padded. This bag is also simple enough that there are no unused pockets; the mouse has a home, the power supply has a home, and the computer has a home. Period.<br/>Well played, Amazon. Well played.
 I used the case yesterday when I took a friend to the doctor's office and had to sit and wait three hours  there's a reason they call it a waiting room!]. The main compartment is plenty big for my tablet in its MoKo cover along with my hotspot in its case. In the secondary section, I was able to carry a workbook for a Bible study I'm doing along with a slender Bible and pencil. In the front zipper section, I carried a micro fiber cloth for wiping the screen. Everything fit very well without a lot of extra room on the ends that would have made them slide around a lot. All items went into the openings with no trouble. The padding is sufficient that I had no worries about bumping the case into anything.<br/>There are smaller and larger versions of the cases, but this one gave me lots of room without being so large that it would be cumbersome. I also carried a small purse, but one could conceivably use the case for a comb, lipstick, small wallet, keys and a cell phone along with what I had in there..........or without the Bible a large wallet would fit nicely or a book  but who needs a book when you have your tablet with dozens of books in it?].<br/>Passing the time was no problem at all with what I was able to have with me...........all in a neat little package that I could sit on the floor next to my chair.<br/>Seeing it's sturdy construction and stitching, I expect to get a lot of use from this case. I did not use the strap, and because it is light to carry, I doubt I will use that unless on a trip.  I highly recommend this case.
 I love this laptop bag! I had purchase a different amazon basic bag and the first day I got it the zipper would always get stuck at a certain spot and it was very frustrating but I got over it pretty quickly. One day the bag just got really bad and so I decided to order this one from amazon basic since the price was good. I tried all the zippers and they worked properly. There's enough room in two of its compartments for my laptop and iPad Pro 12.9! It even comes with a strap invade you want to have your hands free. The inside has pencil holders and holders for your charger and mouse. I recommend this laptop if you are in the market of looking for one.
 I have bought two of these for different devices. The 15.6 fits my mid-2015 15" Macbook Pro with a little room to spare. I usually carry my laptop, Galaxy Tab A with keyboard cover, spiral notebook, client files, external hard drive, chargers, cords, headphones, highlighters, wallet, etc etc etc. I've had no problems with this one.<br/><br/>The smaller bag I carried only my 13" laptop and one file with three sheets of paper in it. The lining tore away from the seams like it hadn't quite been sewn together right after two uses. I returned it and got a new one that's held together much better.
 This a typical Amazon Basics item. It is made of durable materials. It offers the right amount of protection for my Lenovo notebook. The sizing is accurate, therefore I would recommend ordering a size larger than the size of your computer. My 11" notebook fits well in this 14" bag and I have room for a couple of legal size file folders as well as pens and smartphone. My opinion is that these are sized to fit a device as a large padded "case" that conveniently features a couple of zipper compartments with organizational pockets inside.
 I love this laptop case. It was just what I was looking for and was a great price! I usually just carry my laptop loose in my backpack for school, but I needed something smaller to carry it in for work and this is perfect. It fits my 11.6 inch laptop like a glove yet still has space to carry other essentials. The main compartment fits my laptop and some papers in the separated sleeves if need be. The second compartment holds small things like my pens, flashdrive, and car keys. The pocket in the front holds *either my charger or my usb mouse. It doesn't quite fit both very well but if I cram them it will, so if I need both with me, it can work. I don't use the shoulder strap so I can't really speak for that but it fits and feels comfortable, if that is important to you.<br/><br/>The only thing I wish was different about this bag is that the dividers/sleeves in the main compartment were a bit more snug. I like the inclusion of dividers in the main compartment as it works well for storing papers, I just wish they were not quite as saggy because it makes it a bit harder to slide my laptop in in a hurry.<br/><br/>Overall I would highly recommend this product, especially for the price! Simply can't beat it for under $15!
 I bought this bag for my ASUS X200CA notebook.  Perfect fit and a top quality bag.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>1. Excellent fit with plenty of room to hold memory cards, hard drives, and even a small camera.  Actually the storage space is nice to have and the real plus with this item.<br/><br/>2. Quality of materials is first rate. I've used this bag on and off for months and there is no sign of wear, and trust.me I don't 'baby' stuff like this. (the computer yes, the bag, no).<br/><br/>Con:<br/><br/>1. The only negative I could find, which is only IF I HAD to, is the small amount of padding at the corners.  I don't think this would be an easy thing to remedy, and therefore don't find much fault.<br/><br/>I did drop this bag with my ASUS in it onto cement from about chest high and it suffered no damage (bag or ASUS), but it sounded like it hit hard and I count myself lucky.<br/><br/>Five stars, because I can't give the manufacturer a hard time about giving up the slightest amount of padding in order to accommodate for the practicality of storage space.
 I was really surprised by the quality of this case! I recently upgraded an old 13" white Macbook to try and get a couple more years out of it (SSD, maxed out RAM, etc) and needed a case and wireless mouse. This is going to a new employee, and I didn't want to just hand them a computer and hope they'd take care of it, I wanted to be sure they had a case.<br/><br/>But at the same time, I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a case for a laptop that might be taken home once or twice a week. I decided to get the cheapest case I could find that looked decent, and that happened to be the AmazonBasics 14.1 Laptop Case.<br/><br/>I was REALLY surprised by the construction and build quality. I've owned a lot of REALLY expensive laptop cases, including several Booq cases that were in the $200-300 range. This case seems to be made of very similar ballistic nylon - it's thick and feels like it will protect your laptop.<br/><br/>The zipper hardware, shoulder strap, and handles also seem to be made very well. I really just can't get over how nice this case is for $15! I might buy one of these for myself for when I travel.<br/><br/>I couldn't be happier with the AmazonBasics laptop case. A++++
 Order this 12/25/15 for my son, Since he got a nice Toshiba Laptop 15" for xmas from a good friend:), after searching and reading reviews of the many bags I was not looking to spend a whole lot however I wanted quality , He needed a bag that would hold not just the laptop but the fan as well. I also order Tenswall 15''-17'' Laptop Cooling Pad and few other misc things which has not arrived yet, The bag came fairly quick 12/28/15. It is a nice size and im sure it will fit the fan and the laptop nicely. We will see once the fan comes/ UPDATE 1/3/16 just got the fan and both fits inside this bag along with others stuff fit,
 I purchased an inexpensive Windows 8.1 based Nextbook 10.1" tablet and bought this bag for it and accessories. The hefty tablet and pogo keyboard fit inside the bag easily.<br/><br/>In the smaller side pocket I have the wall charger (wart/cable combo), OTG host adapter cable, micro SD card adapter, a bootable recovery flash drive, a Microsoft Mobile 4000 mouse and a folded AmazonBasics Adjustable Tablet Stand.  There's still room for a couple flash drives or something of equivalent size but it's probably stuffed enough as is. The zippers are not strained so it's not that stuffed.<br/><br/>I don't really believe this bag is going to save everything if I drop the heavily loaded bag on a hard surface from a good height, but it should prevent some damage.  My purpose was to keep things clean and all in one place so it's easy to pick up and go with them; this bag is just right for that. There's some nice large zipper pulls on this bag. Very pleased with the design and quality of this bag.  It is much more than I expected.
 First off, at the price point of under thirteen dollars, the value proposition here can't be doubted. Take a look around at possible protection/carry solutions for your &lt; 12" tablet/netbook/laptop and you'll find pretty much nothing else that can compete.<br/><br/>So this is assuredly a good deal.<br/><br/>But how good a deal? That is, how good is this bag?<br/><br/>In terms of ergonomics, I'd give it an A: it's JUST big enough to do the job, and not too big. It has three compartments inside--although they're separated by thin plastic dividers. Outside, you have two zippered pockets. The strap this comes with is good enough. The handle is fine.<br/><br/>Construction seems OK. The stitching appears a little "on the cheap" and I'm not entirely convinced that either a road warrior would want this for full-time travel or that a student would want this bag for day-in-day-out travel to-and-from class. But for the casual user, it seems fine.<br/><br/>Now the Achilles heel: Protection. The padding at the bottom of the bag which will keep your tablet/laptop safe in the case where you drop it seems pretty minimal. There is SOME protection, so this isn't worthless in that regard. But they could assuredly have included a bit more cushion at the bottom. I would NOT trust my tablet/laptop to survive a few foot fall in this bag, if you should be unlucky, drop the bag, and have the bag hit near the bottom (and Murphy's law asserts that if you drop the bag, it WILL hit near the bottom). I have more expensive, higher end, bags and they are definitely more satisfactory in this regard.<br/><br/>But, provided you don't actually drop the bag from several feet, this bag should be fine for everyday use.<br/><br/>On the whole, you're not going to find anything better at anywhere near the price. If you want a bag that can hold your tablet/laptop AND the standard accessories (including a power cord), and you want a deal on that bag, get this. Just be aware that your may be getting more bag for your money than you expected, but you're not getting a BMW/Rolex/YourFavoriteLuxuryBrandHere for a pauper's price.
 Actually, it is a very nice item for the price. However, I purchased it as it was recommended with Lenovo Yoga 11e, and it does not come close to fitting. Well, it comes close, but you CAN NOT slide laptop itself into bag. No way, no how.
 The 17.3 in laptop case is a perfect fit for my large Alienware 15 R3 laptop.  There is plenty of room in the side pocket for the charger, pens, mouse and a few folders can be placed in the inner pocket.  I was looking for something larger than a sleeve to carry to the laptop, charger and a few items and this case is perfect!<br/><br/>FYI, I did go ahead and swap out the shoulder strap with one from an old laptop case.  The older strap had metal hardware which eliminates the concern about the plastic clips breaking.
 I got this bag for my Razer Blade Stealth and it's perfect!<br/>I put the laptop in it's neoprene sleeve and it still fits perfectly in the pocket of the main compartment (double protection)<br/>Charger and Razer Orochi wireless mouse go in the front pouch, along with the AmazonBasic USB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet adapter in one of the organizer sections<br/>Finally, a 6 foot CAT 6 flat ethernet cable in the outermost pocket to compete the bundle.<br/>I don't use the shoulder strap and have heard bad things about them in the reviews, but the handle straps are nice enough to carry from car to office and back. Even has a built in "slide down the roller bag handle" strap across the back for airline travels.<br/><br/>The AmazonBasics logo with hints of orange accents across the bag look slick.<br/>Can't ask for much more. 11/10
 This is a very good and durable bag. I've previously had other laptop bags, including a $70 laptop bag I got from my local supply depot store and the part where the strap is attached to the bag got ripped out. I've been using this bag almost daily for the last 6 months and it is still holding strong. My bag currently consist of a 12 inch Macbook that is inside an Incase Neoprene. This fits comfortably inside this 14-inch laptop bag, with room for magazines in the same zipper compartment, and plenty of room for chargers, phone, mouse, and other small stuff.<br/><br/>The available pockets are nice. I like to travel light when I can, and this bag helps me with that. It's very light when I just have my laptop and chargers.
 Yesterday was the second time in a year the shoulder strap has come off as I was putting the bag on my shoulder. Both times, the laptop bag hit the ground and damaged my laptop. The clips on the bag seem fine, but they disconnect from the bag on their own occasionally. There is NO padding in this bag, so your laptop has no protection other than the cloth of the bag as it falls to the ground.<br/><br/>Next time I'll spend more than 1% of the price of the laptop on the bag I use to carry it.
 I love this laptop bag. It fits my work laptop perfectly. It is not bulky, quite streamlined, light weight, and lays well against body while carrying using strap crisscross over shoulder. Also fits my power cord without looking bulky. It is well padded to protect computer. I use metro transit to work in downtown Houston. I see others having trouble maneuvering their bags down the aisle, I don't have this problem at all. It makes bringing my computer home regularly not a hassle.
 We were looking for a slim bag in which to fit a 9" portable DVD player. Only problem was that all the bags came with huge handles and fancy hookups for attaching the DVD player to the back of a car seat. Those were details we didn't need, especially when traveling on a plane and trying to carry as little as possible. Enter this bag. The handles are soft and squashable, so they don't get in the way. The neoprene is thick, but it has some nice give to it -- unlike many of the harder cases I compared it with. Again, that keeps it from getting in the way when trying to fill your carryon with as much other stuff as possible. The extra pocket works perfectly for storing earbuds plus the charging cord or a slim DVD wallet. If you want room for cord and wallet, the cord nestles right into the main pocket next to the DVD player itself. As for quality, the neoprene feels sturdy cushy enough to protect against reasonable wear and tear, and the zippers are thick and solid. All in all a great buy, and exactly what we needed for our frills-free traveling.
 When my AmazonBasics 15.6-Inch Laptop bag arrived I was a bit worried that my new Dell Computer would not fit inside, but I was mistaken. Not only does my 15.6" Dell laptop fit, but there is plenty of room for the power cord and any other stuff I need to tote with me during the semester. It appears to be well stitched and fashioned with quality materials and workmanship. Update 11/14/2017 - This Laptop and Tablet Bag is well made. I am using the bag often, carrying my laptop, papers, pens, student i.d.s and cords. It is in as good shape today as when I purchased it.
 For $15, you can't get a better bag than this. Fits my 15" macbook pro comfortably, with additional pockets for my tablet, cellphone, notepad, office supplies etc. Simple black fits into any professional environment. If I had one complaint, it's that the padded shoulder strap could be more padded and have used softer material so that it doesn't chafe against the skin. The bag itself is not very well padded either so be careful thumping your equipment down on hard surfaces. But like I said, a great bargain.
 I've used a Wenger laptop bag since 2006. It's big, bulky, and has finally bit the dust. I'm in love with this case. It's light, sleek, and I absolutely love being able to slide the laptop, an ACER E-15 15.6" with the 15.6" case, into the laptop and have it secured without having to unzip three sides, lift the top, strap it in, close the lid, and zip it up. It fits my Nook tablet in another spot and has plenty of space for document folders and the laptop cord and power brick. I wish I'd have had this years ago.
 Very high quality, lots of pockets, not to mention a GREAT value.  I got the 11.6 inch bag for a Thinkpad x140e.  This laptop is built a little bit thicker than most 11.6 inch laptops, but it fits like a glove. Padding on both sides of the laptop with internal pockets, then there is a second zippered pocket with padding both sides of it.  the visible 3rd pocket on the very outside doesn't have padding on the very outside, but this isn't necessary and would just add bulkiness.  The ends of the zippers are reinforced, the strap has a good sized pad on it as well.  Both armstrap and armstrap pad are removable. The side of the bag without the pocket has a strap to slide onto the handle of a rolling suitcase.  This thing was about 11 dollars with prime and is just as good or better than any I have seen at any price.  Holds all accessories plus more. I can fit a large textbook in it along with the laptop with no problem.  I could use this instead of a backpack if I only have one class that needs a book, or put it in my backpack with other stuff.  My backpack isn't even that large, but this thing is compact even when full.  Would be a great carryon or inside of a larger carryon.  I don't know why it's so affordable, but Amazon could charge a lot more.  Great purchase.  Would definitely buy again if it's stolen.  It won't wear out soon if ever.  The only people that should buy another bag are people obsessed with name brands.  This is top of the line and a designer label can only match the quality, if they even could.  This is better built than some purses I've seen sold for thousands of dollars.  BUY THIS BAG.
 I bought this for my Surface Pro 2 expecting to carry the computer in the main compartment, but I was pleasantly surprised to find the Surface fits snugly, but comfortably in the large outer pocket even with the Type Cover 2 attached.  There is also a convenient pen loop for the stylus in that large pocket and I can keep my SD cards and USB thumb drives in the smaller outside pocket.  This leaves plenty of room in the main compartment for all my accessories for an extended trip, e.g. power supply, car adapter, USB DVD and backup hard drives, miscellaneous cables and adapters, etc. with room to spare, yet the case is reasonably compact.  If I am going light and I want extra padding and/or more convenience I can easily place the Surface in any of the three partitions of the main compartment and still have room for the charger and several accessories.  The shoulder strap is handy for standing in buffet or cafeteria lines and adds a bit of extra security in a crowd.  The case seems exceptionally well built for the price, cleanly finished with bar tacking at several stress points.<br/><br/>I am very well pleased.
 This is a Great little bag Perfect for ASUS Chromebook C100PA 10"- The Handles are perfect- One person complained about the Strap- This doesn't have any strap to come- loose- The Handle is great well sewn in &amp; the lining is nice &amp; soft to protect your device- The stitching is fantastic &amp; the Sippers are really nice they aren't the cheap little ones &amp; they have nice rubber handle's on them easy to get your fingers on- Perfect &amp; good price!! &amp; has little side pocket with sipper- perfect for cable's &amp; stuff!!
 Although this is advertised for IPADs, it works great with my Samsung Galaxy Tab E even with a fold over cover on it. This foam lined case is done very well. The zippers are some of the best I've seen on this type of product. The accessories pouch is a useful addition. I can even store my portable power supply in it if need be. Of course it doesn't offer the same protection as a hard case but it is better than no case at all. The way this case is built, I expect it to last for years.
 I love it. It's brand new. I can smell the new product feel. Comes in with a super beautiful fit box, that was really neat. The bag itself is wonderful. As I expected from Amazon. Design of the bag is very nice. No extra/ unnecessary space in the bag so it holds the  14' laptop perfectly. Literally fits. Unlike other bags you buy for 14' laptops, they say it's for 14' but there's always that little bag between the bag and where the laptop fits and when you walk or carry it the laptop always bam into the bag empty area because it was not designed accurately. But this, just perfect. It's beautiful. It comes with extra little pockets inside and also outside that you can put your tablet or notebook any other thing you would like to bring along with your laptop. About 7 pockets. Two thin ones inside the bag. One big ones with ziplock on the outside also a medium one with ziplock on the big one. Inside the big zip lock pocket it has three extra tiny pockets you can put your ID cards, cellphone, pencils etc little things to hold in place. Very nicely and neat designed. I love it, nothing unnecessary and professional looking, it is just what I need and want :) Thank you Amazon!
 Amazing bag.<br/>I didn't think Amazon would have such a high quality brand.  But this bag has proved me wrong on so many levels!<br/>I initially bought this for my 15-in Lenovo.  It fit perfectly with space left for accessories, notebooks, and even my water bottle.<br/>Shortly after, I had to change my work laptop to a Windows Surface.  I thought I wouldn't be needing this bag anymore, but I am still using it! Now, I put my Surface and have lots of room for my work related papers, notebook, books, and of course water bottle :-)<br/><br/>The bag is lightweight and yet does not have a cheap feel to the texture.  The zippers are smooth and very functional.  The padding offers complete protection for any electronics inside and the handle and shoulder strap are also nice.  I think the strap could have been more "high-end" but it would've defeated the purpose for a lightweight bag.<br/>Perhaps my favorite part is that it expands.  The bag expands to hold many things and yet it doesn't seem shaggy when you have only a few things to fill in.<br/>I recommend this bag to anyone with laptops, netbooks, or even only tablets.  Works well in the business environment and is ideal for travel.
 I have had this bag for about a month to carry my iPad Pro.  It is a really good bag for the price.  Now I already have an otter box symmetry case on my iPad Pro, so I am not looking at this case to provide enough padding to do the job.  It has some padding, but not enough like a really good otter box case would provide.  Also, if you want a case for your laptop, you probably want something with straps inside to hold the device securely or if you already have your tablet in a case or your laptop in a tight fitting case, then put it inside this bag to carry around.  I like this bag over many others because of all the separate compartments it has.  I can carry a portable wireless keyboard, a book or two, pens ,pencils, a charger and with plenty of room left over.  It has held up well and has a carry strap that you can attach if you want to throw it over your shoulder.  This is a great buy for the price and it looks really good.
 It's a inexpensive bag that gets the job done. However the entire thing is made out of plastic, even the fabric, so it feels cheap overall. The strap didn't really stay at the length I set and the plastic buckles seem flimsy and squeak while I walk. Particularly the squeaking made me stop using the bag as a daily carry. It will likely end up donated.
 It fits my chromebook perfectly. Not so tight that it's squishing it and not loose enough for it to slide around inside.<br/>The other storage pocket fits the ChromeBook charger, reading glasses, a few USB drives cellphone charger &amp; cable, external HDD, and has room left to spare.<br/>Exceptional build quality, and good looks top off the great functionality of this bag and I am more than satisfied with my purchase.
 I bought this bag for my Fire Kindle(possibly with keyboard and optionally my reader) and wanted to make sure it was large enough. This one is actually larger than needed.<br/><br/>The material used seems to be roughly similar to that used in diving suits though maybe not as rubberized. So I expect it's rather water resistant. It is also well padded. The zippers are large and easily noticable., it looks well constructed and sewn.<br/><br/>The external pocket is actually large enough to hold my reader seperately if so desired. Or plenty of room for a charger and cables or both.<br/><br/>The only complaint such as it is is that maybe a couple of net compartments within the main bag would have been nice for memory cards or such.<br/>.<br/>If you are not going to carry much, you might opt for a smaller version.
 We live in the border town of Fargo, North Dakota. In the winter it is VERY cold and often slippery. Not only is it important to have a sturdy bag to keep your laptop safe in case of falls, but also protecting against the elements in often -30 degree weather. I purchased a similar bag at office max for $59.99- after being appalled at all the expensive options, I found this on Amazon for $13.99. This bag has plenty of cushion on the bottom and exterior to protect your tablet or mini computer- which is stored in the center compartment that zips close. There are two other compartments on the front of the bag. The first compartment is good sized for calculators, pens and pencils. The second compartment is large and would be adequate for storing chargers, USB flash drives, and a cell phone. Both of the secondary compartments zip close. The interior of this bag is light grey, it also comes with a shoulder strap. Previous reviews noted the shoulder strap was flimsy and broke easily, however I do not find the shoulder strap to be flimsy at all. If I do find my shoulder strap to break I will update my review to reflect that concern. A tremendous bag for the price.
 This was by far one of my best purchases this year. I bought a small 2 in 1 computer a couple weeks before I bought this bag. I was looking for a way to carry my essentials without having to be burdened down with a huge bag. This was definitely the answer.<br/><br/>First let's start with the construction. It is well put together. The bag has three pockets, two exterior on the front and one main for the laptop. Inside the laptop compartment there are 3 dividers. I found that these are great for a small book and a notebook besides your computer. The outside pockets I use for pens or stylus and a portable mouse. The smallest pocket I don't use. The strap is full adjustable and I have found it to be very reliable opposed to some reviewers. When I am carrying my computer it feels well protected and enough has enough padding to take some bumps and bruises without damaging the inside valuables.<br/><br/>On to use, I typically am pretty hard on things and I have already caught myself throwing this bag inside my car or in the back. Obviously my computer still functions so it definitely protects my things. I love the fact is small and I can carry it just about anywhere. I've had 2 books a notebook and my computer plus two pens and an optical wireless mouse (may have stretched it just a bit) but it still was able to fit in this tiny bag. This has been a great purchase and I would have no problems purchasing amazon brand in the future. They're super affordable and function just as they say.
 Perfect for my Chromebook.  Thin profile storage so better than just a sleeve case. Front pocket will fit wallet, keys like, mouse, voice recorder and a few small things. I could not get the block charger in.  Thank goodness for a 10+ he battery life. Wellade and has held up to daily use without wear.  Some people have had issues with the shoulder strap clasps but that's a user issue.  I don't use the strap myself.
 I needed a smaller case for my ThinkPad x140e so it would be less clumsy when flying.  Perfect.  Just big enough for the laptop and a spare battery. An external zipped pocket for the mouse, and an unzipped pocket the right size for boarding passes.  Seems well made, nice strap for over the shoulder.<br/><br/>What I thought was an unzipped pocket on the back is actually a strap door attaching it to your suitcase drag handle.  Another picket would have been nice,  but this is a very handy feature.
 Unlike several Amazon reviewers of this product, I measured my stuff and then ordered a bag that would accomodate all that stuff.  Amazingly it all fit.  The bag is of good quality, but won’t last if you are intent on dragging it across rough concrete surfaces or dropping it out of your car door in a privately conducted stress test.  I use it to hold music books, song sheets, glasses and a tuner; no seams have burst, no zipper has failed, no strap has squeaked, and the sky has not fallen.  Really nice bag, glad I bought it, it's perfect for my needs.
 Typically I hate buying tablet/laptop bags and cases online. It's just too difficult to find exactly what I need with a good fit. That all changed when I found this bag.<br/><br/>I recently purchased a surface pro 3 for work and needed a case for it. So far there aren't a lot of choices so my options were limited. This bag fits the SP3 perfectly, even with the portfolio case that I have on it.<br/><br/>There are plenty of pockets and room for all accessories including the power cable, USB 3.0 hub, and some other little things necessary for the SP3 to be totally useful in my line of work.<br/><br/>The only thing I do not like so much about this bag is the sound of the inside dividers... it sounds like paper being crinkled inside constantly. Otherwise everything is extremely well built and put together. Looks great.
 This bag fits the HP Stream 11, the Lenovo 11E, and the (now outdated) Lenovo X131E perfectly.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>a)For the machine models cited above (and likely others) it fits perfectly without wasted space or unnecessary bulk.<br/>b)Padded on all sides.<br/>c)Zippers slide very easily and smoothly.<br/>d)Comes with shoulder strap.<br/>e)Well made.<br/>f)Great price.  (You could easily pay double or triple for an inferior product.)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>a)The bag has three pockets--the one intended for the notebook computer(*), the one intended for paperwork (**), and the one intended (I think) for computer accessories (***).  (***) isn't big enough to hold my power adapter and wireless mouse, so I have to put these items in (**), meaning that it isn't easy to carry papers in the same bag (along with the notebook computer and power adapter and wireless mouse).  In my opinion, (***) is a little smaller than it should be.  However, this is only a statement that the product pockets aren't the same size that I personally would prefer--it may work very well for a user who doesn't carry certain accessories or doesn't wish to carry papers in the same bag.
 I use this for flying. I store in either on it's own in the overhead or under the seat in front of me and it's perfect but know that it's not heavily padded and has no stiff materials to protect the laptop within so I wouldn't put a suitcase on top of it. This is for gentle use and not to be thrown around in a cargo hold so if that's your intent than this inexpensive, well made for the price, carrier is fine.
 Super nice case for the price! Way more protection then a flimsy sleeve . I definitely don't trust a sleeve when for this price my daughter has protection for her iPad and laptop . I make her keep her laptop in the case in house even when not in use. The padding is thick and there's plenty of room for accessories and an iPad plus mouse and charger. Room to spare. Comfortable strap as well. Great purchase 👍🏻
 I specifically purchased this bag to use for my Microsoft Surface 3 (not the pro version). I place my surface into a leather pouch and then insert it into this bag which is a perfect fit..<br/>I think the size is ideal for your compact laptops, chromebooks, macbook airs, but not anything bigger than those products. The pockets in the main compartment are big enough to fit my surface and a few notebooks.<br/>The front pocket is perfect for my phone chargers, pens, and any other small equipment. The small front pocket ideal for your phone and other miscellaneous items that have the same size.
 Does the job I need for my almost seven-pound laptop. The clips are a little questionable, but from my experience, they should be fine if you're careful. As with anything of low-cost, be careful. Don't go throwing your laptop around like a football or kicking it like a soccer ball. Don't go beating people over the head with it or seeing how far it can slide across a freshly waxed floor. I needed a bad to hold my laptop, cords, and mouse. Nothing more, nothing less. This does the job with plenty of room to spare.
 I have been a reluctant convert to Amazon branded products, but I am now the pleased owner of several... including this little bag.  I use it mostly for travel.  I can throw my iPad, phone, ear buds, charger, etc. in one compact, easy-to-carry bag.  There's even a small zip pocket on the side to hold boarding passes, a pack of gum, charger, etc.  It's a great option if you want to keep basic travel essentials at hand without the need for a backpack or larger bag.  I usually put this in a backpack or carry-on until I board the plane then remove this and stow the backpack or carry-on roller bag.  It's neoprene, so it has a distinct petroleum smell right out of the package, but it dissipates quickly.  Also, being neoprene, it is not going to offer substantial protection to your tablet if dropped.  I keep my iPad in a protective case and use this for transport, not real protection.  It seems to be of good-quality and has held up well so far.  I'd recommend this bag as a simple, inexpensive and effective option for travel / transport of your iPad and supporting devices.  I would not recommend it for protecting your device.
 So I have been eyeing a Case Logic laptop case and on their website it is about $55.00 at least this is the largest one they have because I have a 17" laptop and in the past Case Logic had taking really good care of mean especially since I purchased a medium camera case and three years later the zipper tore off and they replaced it without any questions and when the package came in the mail there was two camera cases.  Now, I have been buying Amazon Brand Basics for some time and I have no complaints but you do get what you pay for meaning the material on this laptop bag feels like it could be very easy to get torn.  I love the price and the two day shipping (free) but so far among Amazon Basics I purchased the best is a 7-port USB hub and it still works and going strong.
 This is a nice small computer bag, but there is still room for everything I need. I am using this for the computer I take on the road to do presentations. I have room for the power cable, all my wireless accessories like headphones, mouse, pointer and backup battery to charge all this stuff, and I still have room for wired backups of everything, just in case. This case allows me to keep everything in one place and just grab and go when I need to.
 My goodness, what an awesome case/bag for the price. I don't use it for a laptop, but I certainly will by one for the next laptop bag I need. it is sturdy, well padded and carries a lot. And the price is really right.<br/><br/>I've read  some reviews where people indicate that the shoulder strap can slip off and drop your laptop to the hard ground. I cannot speak to that because I do not use that strap. That aside, this is a surprisingly sturdy case at an outstanding price.
 As a basic bag, it's OK. I did not find it to be as impressive as the pictures and top reviews had me believing. For the price, it seems generally well made and has numerous pockets and pouches that could be useful. However, the padding is not very substantial and the shoulder strap clips and rings are soft plastic. Also, the size is smaller than what would be expected - I got a 17.3 inch-rated bag for a 15.4 inch laptop and it was a "comfortable" fit. My conclusion, though, was that the laptop investment was too much to risk it with this bag and decided to return the bag and look for something more substantial. For periodic, low-risk use, this bag would work but for everyday use in situations of higher damage risk, I have concerns.
 It's soft, lightweight, and holds a lot. I bought this to carry around a tablet, Bluetooth keyboard, and tablet stand back-and-forth from work/school. Handles are a nice feature. I think it would make a great carry-on tech case for travel. Could probably squeeze a phone and charging cable or two in there as well.<br/>Would recommend to others looking for a reasonably-priced and practical tablet bag.
 I just bougth this one to carry easily my new azus laptop but unfortunately it came broken, one of its pockets came damaged so I really felt disapointed with this product, maybe I should spend a bit more money and get a better one.
 This bag was a good deal when I purchased it, and I don't regret the purchase much. I do think the reviews are a bit misleading and unclear because this item's page features reviews of many different bags and sleeves. The bag I'm reviewing is the 14" bag. It does not have a contrast interior which I had hoped for. They really help a lot and are a feature for which I'd pay a little more.<br/><br/>My 14" Acer just fits in the bag, which I consider a plus. The adapter fits well in the front. The handles are thin and could use padding. The zippers are beefy and feel like they will hold up.<br/><br/>I'll be writing a 4 star review for the 11.6" bag. The difference in my opinion is that I've never seen a better bag that size but I've seen better 14" bags. They're exceptionally similar bags other than size.
 Late last year, I purchased an ASUS ROG 750 model laptop, which might be the largest 17.3 machine available.  With power brick and accessories, you're carrying about 15 pounds.  The ROG 750 is half an inch too wide to fit my favorite bag, the Think Tank Artificial Intelligence 17.  I was using a Swiss Army messenger style laptop bag for a few months, but the weight of the laptop was enough to make the flap clips fail.  I almost purchased a $150 bag, then I spotted this AmazonBasics bag for  $17.  Now that I've used it for a week, I really love it!<br/>Pros<br/>- Compact, yet rooming.  The ROG 750 fits snugly, but easily.  I also carry an iPad, paper, pens, cables, power bring, mouse, etc.<br/>- Lightweight, about the same as the Think Tank bag.<br/>- Overall, feels sturdy<br/>- Good zippers<br/>- Top loading is great for a heavy laptop<br/>Cons<br/>- Maybe a little light on the padding.<br/>- The shoulder pad is a bit thin and stiff, but can't complain for $17
 This bag is an incredible deal! While it comes in different sizes, the one I bought was for the 11 inch MacBook Air. It is neat, compact, well-made, padded and yet has enough space for all the accessories in different pockets. These include the apple charger with extension, a VHS dongle, an iPhone charger and an SD card reader. Also holds reading glasses and a few other essentials including a check book. All this for less than $10!
 This bag is a little large for my iPad mini, but I expected that. It does not offer the utmost in protection, but is a relatively inexpensive way to carry an iPad, other tablet, or very small notebook computer. Seems to be well-made with stout zippers, strong material, and a handy side compartment for accessories. The stated measurements seem accurate. I would recommend this bag if you are careful not to drop it and its contents onto a hard floor - the unit inside may not be unscathed afterward.
 My 17.3" laptop (the System76 Kudu) fits perfectly in this bag. It is ok for light duty use, as I mainly use it to store my laptop when I'm not using it. However, I do agree with all the reviewers who say you should not use the shoulder strap that comes with this bag. I ended up just throwing it away because it was very flimsy and this bag has very minimal padding. Don't take the chance. Carry it like a briefcase!
 Please ignore the dog hair that are on the bags. Our Sebi decided that he wanted to lay on my laptop bag as well as the laptop before I wrote this review. Despite the fact that the bag has some dog hair on it's still truly a great bag. My spouse takes his to work and finds it rather comfortable to care in addition to the bag holding his phone, psvita etc. I use the bag mainly to carry all my work from up stairs and down stairs while taking care of our bouncy baby. It's a great descreet laptop bag that is modestly design and easy to clean, orgianize your wires with the pockets on the inside with your option of either using it as a breifcase aka the handle or a shoulder bag aka using the straps. This is just simply a great laptop bag.
 I have a 15.6 inch Toshiba satellite and I needed a new bag to take it places since my last bag was to fit my 13.3 inch mac book pro. I decided to get the 17.3 inch bag because I thought it would be nice to have a bit more room for my things. Was I correct!!!! I hate the idea of ever damaging my computer so I always put it first in a sleeve then my bag. I am glad I got the 17.3 inch bag because it fits with the sleeve!!!! :D I thought I was going to have an issue with it or something but no it fit. If anyone is interested to know which sleeve I got for size measurements I decided to go with the case logic laps-116 because it promises a 15-16 inch computer while the amazon basics sleeve promises 15-15.6 inch. Yes I have a 15.6 inch computer but they are not all the same size so I decided to take the safe side. If you have this sleeve I recommend the 17.3 inch bag :D The bag is a simple designed (well it is called amazon basics),but it will get through your daily tasks. It has a very nice feel to it and the internal space is not too bad. You could fit a few notebooks, a tablet, and other things. Very nice bag, this is my first amazon basic purchase and I am very pleased with it thank you amazon for bringing out great products for cheap prices :)
 I purchased my current AB laptop bag back in August 15, 2014.  It replaced Deuter Giga Laptop, which as it turns, is ok for heavy school and work loads,  but AmazonBasic is much lighter and portable for my most casual needs.  It fits a MacBook Pro, a small notebook and it still has some room for gym sweat shorts.  It started falling apart after 3 years of extensive use.  First, the zipper on my bag broke, but continued to carry it for another year.  Now there are other visible wear and tear.
 I bought this to carry and protect my new Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2 - 2014 Edition tablet. Although I also purchased a Poetic Slimline stand case for the tablet, that doesn't protect it during transporting from location to location (only for holding and actually using it).<br/><br/>This AmazonBasics case is super soft and impact absorbent. The material is very similar to a diver's wetsuit, only thicker. It's a bit larger than my tablet, but I'd prefer it to be a little too big than a little too small. The side pocket holds the charger and cable easily. I can fit a lot more stuff in there if I wanted too.<br/><br/>The handle is very durable, as are the zippers. In fact, the zippers are about as hefty as I've ever seen. They ain't breakin'!<br/><br/>For the price, you can't go wrong with this little case. My only complaint is that the "AmazonBasics" logo is emblazoned on the zipper handles, and I really don't like the orange interior (or orange logo on the zippers). Yes, I know this is Amazon's color, but I just don't like it. I'd prefer to have all black. But that's me.
  AmazonBasics iPad Air and Netbook Bag with Handle Fits 7 to 10-Inch Tablets (Black)] I bought this for use with my iPad Mini knowing it would be large for the device. The extra room allows a small notebook, other electronics, accessories (flashdrives, small headphones, cable) to all easily fit without distorting the bag. The product appears durable (I've only used it three months but I've used it daily) and I'm very pleased. Previous iPad Mini travel cases were tight and more compact but I need the extra room for the previous listed items as well as pens, papers, and misc.<br/><br/>However, it should be noted this bag is not as 'protective' as one might think from the photo: It is not padded. It will likely not provide much damage protection if dropped; virtually none, I'd say. I carry a small towel around the iPad Mini to cushion it and a microfiber cloth to clean it. Also the black cover picks up dust and lint more easily than I'd like.
 Bought this to have something to throw my MacBook into. Works great, and fits my iPad and Kindle all at the same time (iPad Pro does *not* fit, BTW). It's a "man purse" without looking like a purse. Love that I can put my wallet and keys in here and not have them weighing down my pants. The price and value is phenomenal. Amazon hits a home run with this one.<br/><br/>EDIT: I've now had this bag nearly a year and still love it. It really holds up over time and the price is absolutely amazing. I actually *can* fit my big iPad Pro in it, but it's a bit of a stretch and wouldn't recommend it.
 Doesn't protect laptop on all sides.  Been using case for 4 months now, opened it today to find major dent on the corner of the lid affecting the screen. The bottom of the carry case is unprotected, now I may be out a $1000 laptop.<br/><br/>Edit: had another minor drop again, this time tons if damage to the corner of the laptop. This bag does NOT PROTECT YOUR LAPTOP.
 This is the perfect solution to all my carrying bag needs. This bag can fit my HP Envy 15, my clipboard with all my papers, pens, laptop and cell phone charger, all my adapters and cables, and my Bluetooth speaker. It could still fit more, but I don't ever need anything else. I use this for all my meetings, school, and debate. This bag is extremely solid and well constructed. And considering that it was only $15, this bag is well worth it. It blows competition out of the water<br/>Pros:<br/>Huge. I can fit everything in here<br/>Very sturdy. VERY good build quality<br/>Super low price<br/>Comes with shoulder strap<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>I seriously can't find a fault with this bag
 I get it, what were you expecting for the price? But come on, it's Amazon. The fabric looks so cheap, the moment I put my laptop in it, it looses it shape and it looks like a super market plastic bag. Also, the straps started to unpick inmediately. Just crap.
 Excellent, love it. Just the right size for my SurfaceBook and accessories that I need to take with me. I replaced the strap with one with better connectors due to reviews about that, but I actually rarely use the shoulder strap and have it removed most the time. It rides on my suit case pull handle well with the strap on the back. Very happy to retire my older and bigger bag that only had velcro fasteners on outer pockets that always seemed to find themselves open when shoved under the airplane seat (crap falling out).
 This is a great bag for the money. I do wish it was a little roomier, I usually carry my laptop with the charger, which is a bit bulky for a laptop charger. Also, my Akai MPK mini  MIDI controller, my slimline dvd writer, and a few cords and headphones. While it all fits, it's kinda tight, and I guess it's more than it was really designed for.<br/><br/>My 15.6 inch Dell I7559-2512BLK fits, but just fits. any bigger and it probably wouldn't<br/><br/>It's made with what feels like ballistic nylon. Definitely tough and durable. Zippers seem to be good and sturdy, and the strap feels very secure to me. I've seen a few reviewers had trouble with theirs coming off or breaking, mine my be an updated design possibly, because it doesn't seem like it could come off, unless it got damaged.
 I just got my bag this morning and it seems to be pretty great so far. the bag has one large pocket with 3 dividers that got long ways, which are perfect for my 2 kindle fires, and my other larger tablet. the middle zipper pocket is perfect for smaller things. i use the middle pocket for my wifi hot spot and power bank. it has 2 sleeves which fit them both perfectly. you can also fit an additional smaller tablet or android in there too if you wanted. the last and smallest pocket is good for wires and pens, not much else. All in all if your looking for a smaller travel bag for your tablet or kindle,  then this bag will probaly work for  you. just make sure you know what size screen you have before you but this. the title says laptop, but i think its more of a tablet bag . a small thin laptop will fit but the battery charger might not.
 This is a great little case at a fantastic price. I bought it for a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 computer with the Surface Pro Type cover. The stylus is mounted on the right side of the cover and everything fits inside the case perfectly. The fit is almost snug but I don't have to fight to get the computer into the case. I also was able to fit a 12" Toshiba Portegé R600 in it.<br/><br/>The big pockets on either side of the main compartment are in the way for me but I can see how they might be useful for many people. There's room in the larger zippered side pocket for the video adapter dongle and USB SD card reader I'll carry. I haven't decided whether the power cord will go in that pocket or in the smaller zippered pocket.<br/><br/>I have a slightly larger case with metal snap hooks and rings for the shoulder strap and I like the metal hardware on it better than the plastic hardware on this case. However, that case has only one zippered side compartment and there aren't any pockets in that compartment. I'm keeping this case and letting the other case go with the computer I'm giving to my niece.
 I had to spend a fair amount of time finding just the perfect interior dimensions for a bag to carry my Dell XPS 15 laptop, but finally found this AmazonBasics bag that fits absolutely perfectly for a very reasonable price.  The amount of additional storage available with this bag is also very impressive.  Very highly recommended!
 How often do you find a high quality laptop bag for only $15.61?  There have been over 7,700 reviews with an average rating of 4.7 stars for this bag.  After receiving and using this bag I can tell you that the rating is well-deserved.<br/><br/>Every possible aspect of this bag has been included in prior reviews so there is no need to rehash all of the details. If you place any reliability in high ratings and thousands of purchases -- like I do -- then you can pretty well depend on this being the solution you need to safely and conveniently transport your laptop.<br/><br/>What are you waiting for?  You can buy this bag with confidence.
 I like the design of this bag and the size is what I expected. It "appears" that it is sturdy however the one I received had a problem with the stitching. The inside flap appears to have been cut a bit short so it did not catch the stitching an came open. Fortunately it was easy to return and I will try again to see if I can get a good one and update the review appropriately.
 I usually like AmazonBasics products, but this is indeed a very basic case. It's a perfect fit, but it has minimal padding and it looks and feels a bit cheap. I think it's ok for the price, but after what I spent on my laptop I'm going to want a case that provides more protection and is more aesthetically pleasing. I also purchased the Case Logic version and posted a review on that, but it's not flattering either. My laptop doesn't really even fit into that one.<br/>https://www.amazon.com/review/R2NRUKHQI0T9ZM/ref=pe_1098610_137716200_cm_rv_eml_rv0_rv
 I read the reviews before purchasing this bag, as the sleeve that my Eeee 1000HE came in was big, and didn't have a handle. This seemed perfect, but I was a bit concerned when one review said their 10" notebook was moving inside it. I purchased it anyway, and well, the reviewer must have gotten a defect item, because it fit my 10.1" like a glove. There is maybe 1/2-1/3 of an inch space at the TOP of the bag, but the netbook slides nicely into this bag. It fits snugly.<br/><br/>I also decided to not put the cables inside the bag itself, as it's so snug, I am afraid it would stretch the bag or scratch the computer. However, the front pocket is ample enough to hold the power chord, a mouse and a network cable, and maybe even more, I haven't tried.<br/><br/>The one thing I wasn't so pleased with was the orange contract colour. I never wear orange myself, and this colour will clash with everything I own. I wish it came in multiple colours so one could choose which one wanted. It is a bright and cheerful orange, though, and it's not _that_ offensive.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this for anyone with a 10" notebook.
 Why do I want a bag for my ultrabook?  For protection and convenience, of course!  But I paid extra to shave off a pound, giving up a DVD drive and sound quality.  Do I want a two-pound leather bag to shlep around between the office and home?  No, I'll take this Amazon Basic (I would rename it Amazon Ultimate) and increase the price to its real value) which weighs only 11 onces (without the 3-ounce strap,) provides superior cushioning, has durable woven material, strong comfortable handles and three zipper compartments.  Now my filled case weighs less than 6 pounds with smartphone, mouse, tablet, pens and papers!<br/><br/>Yet when needed, I can cram in 30 pounds of stuff without tearing the handle or the strap. I even carried two 15.6" ultrabooks easily in the center compartment one day.  The silk-like interior allows easy insertion and removal of laptops, tablets and phones, and the zippers are secure.<br/><br/>This case does not add much to your load, and it looks sleek--although not leather.  If you have a 15.6" laptop, this is the bag for you!<br/><br/>I looked at several leather bags, and although they may
 Nice case.  I bought it to carry my 14" portable DVD player.  Unfortunately, the DVD player did not fit in the case although the case was pictured as something you may want to add when I bought the DVD player. As always, AMAZON was amazing about helping me to return the case.  I selected a larger case that was on backorder.  I recently received the replacement case and it fits perfectly!  Thank you, AMAZON!
 I really could hardly make myself buy this at such a low price.  I figured it must be a piece of garbage at such a low price.  Then I decided oh well I wont be out much money if it is no good.<br/>As far as style goes; I think it is not going to win any fashion shows.  It is not ugly at all just kind of bland.<br/><br/>As far as function WOW<br/>This style of bag is ten times easier than a messenger bag.  Everything so easily accessible without flipping open the messenger bag flap.<br/><br/>Plenty of padding and just the right amount of pockets.  Don't let the low price fool you.  This is a GREAT bag
 My Surface Pro fits perfectly in it. It is well made with plenty of padding around and in between compartments. The strap has a comfortable shoulder pad. The zipper work great and the main compartment one starts and ends below the corners so it can really open up.. It's light weight. Love the bag, and it was so inexpensive! My only complaint which earned it a 1 star deduction is that while the bag is tall and wide enough for letter size papers I need to carry sometimes for meetings, the corners on the top are too rounded. Thus all the top corners of my papers get crimped if I want to zip the bag up. If I carry a file folder, I have to leave it unzipped because their tabs are 1/4 inch too tall. Amazon should been thinking about the business person who still has to carry papers sometimes and have made it with squarer corners on top and 1/4 taller for files. That would have totally solved the problem and made the bag perfect.
 A really nice bag! I got this for my small laptop (11.6 inch display) my seven inch tablet and needed to carry some 8.5 x11 legal pads and notebook folders, along with my cell phone, headphones, pens, charge cords etc. It holds all of this well. I even load a few books in it once in a while too! The material seems very sturdy, the zippers all work really effortlessly, which is wonderful. I really like the lager outer pocket that holds all my smaller items, phone, wallet, headphones,pens etc. Once unzipped everything you need is right there organized and waiting for your...super! The main compartment has a pocket for the pc, and a separate pocket for the tablet on the opposite side, which will hold a tablet as big as a full size ipad. the middle then holds full size 8.5 x11 items without having to fold anything. It is not a huge bag, so you will not stuff too much in it, but I was not wanting a huge bag to lug around....this is perfect and the price was amazing! Way to go Amazon basics
 I recently purchased a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and a Logitech 810 keyboard. I have a cover for the Kindle and the keyboard was an afterthought. I realized since I purchased a keyboard that didn't bundle itself with a Kindle case (after reading reviews, I decided against that) I still needed something that would hold both things together.<br/><br/>This case was very inexpensive. The neoprene stretches so there was no problem putting the keyboard and Kindle in its case in the bag. The handles are soft and stretchy, I can put them over my wrist if I'm carrying a lot of things and it's no bother at all. Along with the Kindle/case and keyboard, I use the outside pocket. In THAT, I fit the Kindle rapid charger, the keyboard charger, screen cleaner and cloth, and my earphones.<br/><br/>Even if I didn't have the keyboard, I can see the value in having one central place to put everything and I can also see the value in having it not be related to the Kindle cover itself.  While the price wasn't 100% what swayed me toward this bag, I really can't see how you can go wrong with it especially because it is less expensive than anything else out there.
 Went with this bag for the price and mostly positive reviews.  I've found most AB items to be of average or better quality.<br/><br/>This is a pretty basic bag with two zippers for the large top pocket and one zipper for the front pocket.  Front pocket measures 6"x7"; I throw in a 4x6 notepad and a few stationary supplies with no problem.  Top pocket can easily fit older iPads even with a bluetooth keyboard case.  The bag provides minimal drop protection around the corners.<br/><br/>Two things I don't like:<br/>1. The exterior material is a lint magnet.  I've only had the bag a few days and have already used masking tape three times to take off lint, pet hair, etc.  If this is important to you, look elsewhere for a better bag or different color.<br/>2.  The front pocket could have easily been extended another inch or two.  That would have made it easier for a larger note pad or even something like a Kindle or Nexus 7 to slip into and then be able to use the top pocket for a larger note pad, etc.  It's a minor quibble but thought I'd mention it.<br/><br/>Overall I'm okay with this purchase and can recommend it for what it is: a cheap bag that does its job, but could have been better.
 I was actually quite surprised at the quality of this case.<br/><br/>At $16.49 I didn't expect much from this case, but I was pleasantly surprised. The zipper tabs are meta, It has accented cross stitching for break points at the ends of the zippers to keep them in their places. You won't over zip or over unzip and have to try and get them back on track. The inside is made of that easy to clean gray nylon material you see in most luggage. The arm strap has a pad on it for comfort. There are lots of pockets both inside and on the outside to organize things and use it as a briefcase as well.<br/><br/>This is made in China, which is why the price is so low, but quality wise it is on par with what I've come to expect from the Amazon Basics line.<br/><br/>I you are looking for a cheap case with functionality this is it.
 Great little case. I had a kind of retro canvas bag before, which was a bit small for the 15" MBP I got, so I figured I'd try this out. The price is unbeatable, but what I really appreciate is how light the bag is empty. Switching from a 13" MBP in the old canvas bag to the 15" MBP in this bag the weight feels exactly the same! Since I'm prone to back problems, that's a huge benefit.<br/><br/>If there is one minor complaint I could make, it's that since I don't use the two regular 'handles' on the top of the bag, they lay down across one of the three zippered compartments - and every time I go to zip that middle compartment back up, the zipper snags on the handle, which has flipped itself inside the compartment. Like I said, minor.
 I own about a dozen laptop and tablet bags, including some name brands. This is the first AmazonBasics I have ever bought. I hesitated because some reviewers complained about insufficient padding. Since it is so inexpensive, I decided to give it a try.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the padding is not thin at all. It is actually among the best in its category. I own virtually every kind of laptop bags. Only suitcase style laptop cases have thicker padding than this, if you don't mind carrying that weight.<br/><br/>I am very satisfied. I am sure I will buy more AmaxonBasics products in the future.<br/><br/>Update on 1/2/2016<br/><br/>Downgraded from 5 stars. The shoulder pad is broken.<br/><br/>The shoulder pad is designed to have problem. The cloth on one side is too thin. The strap keeps cutting the edges of the curved pad In only a little more than two months, the pad is broken.
 I've used this laptop bag for almost a year now traveling everywhere from three hours away from my family's place to across the world to see friends and relatives in South Korea.<br/>It holds my 17inch gaming laptop perfectly as well as my mousepad, mouse, controller, charger, headphones and external hard drive without looking too bulgy. The material is good quality and can definitely hold up to carrying everything I listed. The thin cushion on the shoulder strap could be a little softer, but does the job. I have yet to experience the clips from becoming undone (*knock on wood*) that I've seen a couple reviewers state even though I've twisted and pulled the strap many ways. The bag is cushioned sufficiently enough to not cause harm to the laptop when placing it down normally on the ground/desk. Just don't carelessly drop it since it isn't exactly a tank. Overall it's a great bag for a nice low price that you can't beat.
 This bag is sturdy with seemingly strong stitching. It has adequate cushioning. It has a soft-ish interior, such that I don't feel it would ever scratch the screen of my tablet. The price is rock-bottom, especially for the quality you get. But the real kicker is the over all dimensions and the exterior pockets. I tried no fewer than four bags before this one, trying to find something to work as a carrying case for my Windows Surface Pro 2--all to no avail. Other cases were either hopelessly and annoyingly too large, or just enough too tight to make it too unpleasant ever to take my Surface anywhere. With this bag, it's a whole 'nother world of convenience and practicality. I can fit in this bag not only my Surface Pro 2 (with type cover keyboard attached), but also the power brick, a miniature USB hub, stylus, several small flash drives, mouse pad, mini-travel mouse, miniature surge protector, VGA connector, retractable Ethernet cable, etc., etc. I *love* this bag!!!!
 I bought this case to house my Ipad Mini 4 with a snap on Bluetooth keyboard.<br/>It is way too big for the Mini even with attached keyboard, but that is OK with me.<br/>Lots of room for accessories. Cables and such.<br/>I went with this one vs another that was more scaled to the Mini because I wanted handles and the other<br/>did not.<br/>Has a small zippered pocket on the front too.
 I've been using this case for a while now. I travel a great deal and the case has been through a lot and still looks almost brand new. I don't tend to carry many papers, so there are plenty of pockets for what I need them for...though I'll admit to wishing there were just a few more small pockets and straps for carrying the accessories that go with my other electronics. Other than that one little "wish", I will recommend the case.
 Pretty average for what you pay for. This bag is by no means soft and luxurious, however it still handles pretty well and it will do it's job.<br/><br/>There are 2 thin separators for documents in the main compartment (laptop located in the center), but I don't expect to use them much. The 11.6-inch version of this bag has 2 pockets in the storage compartment, not the 3 as pictured in the stock photos (with the pens, pencils, etc). Many have described their bags as having an orange interior, which in my case is false since I have grey (or I've received a lower quality product, just something to note). This may also be due to the fact that Amazon clumps all these reviews across different product types together. The bag has just enough room for the laptop, power adapter and maybe a cell phone, which is enough, so don't expect to fit much else in the storage compartment as you'll be cramped for space and things will start getting bulky. Finally, one smaller zipper compartment on the front, which can store something like a USB drive or notes without sacrificing any additional space.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this bag feels like it was made out of cheaper synthetic materials, but it's put together in a way that I feel will last; if that makes any sense. The zippers are metal, but the latches for the shoulder strap are completely plastic moulded. The outer materials aren't that bad, but the inside could use better and softer padding. Overall, it's very compact for organizing and carrying around; it'll definitely get it's use.
 I have been using this bag for about 3 hours and I am absolutely in love. It is the perfect size to carry a 13 inch MacBook pro, iPad Air, and a spiral notebook. It also has two external pockets that will fit pens and pencils, as well as charging bricks, and calculators. A common complaint I saw about this bag is that the shoulder strap would come undone. I have not had a problem with this yet and at least on my unit, don't see a problem with it in the future. It is a standard d-ring with a plastic clip. As long as you don't put a ridiculous amount of weight in the bag I would imagine it's fine. Also, on the back of the bag there is a strap that allows the bag to be attached to a suitcase handle. So if you need a bag that is small, slim, and holds just the right amount of stuff, this bag is definitely your best choice.
 It worked for its purpose: a cheap laptop messenger bag (or suitcase if you don't use the shoulder strap).<br/><br/>If you're purely concerned about function, then rest assured that this works great and was up to par with at least my personal standards of padding and whatnot. My laptop's only a few months old so I'm really careful with it, and I'm confident that this bag will protect it from handling and minor abuse.<br/><br/>That said, with all the great reviews of it, I was admittedly somewhat disappointed. I got this bag to replace this bag (http://amzn.to/1qyTujY) which was great and sturdy, but broke at the strap in less than 6 months (I should have heeded the reviewers that warned of that). The reason the other bag broke was because there was too much stress where the strap and bag were connected. This bag solves that by making that connection more of a hinge, so the strap can just move around instead of being stationary and tearing from stress.<br/><br/>Except, that connection is really squeaky when it moves around. Like when you're walking. I couldn't find a way around it so I figured that's just how it's going to be.<br/><br/>Also, there's a slimmer pocket within the main bag that seems like it was meant to secure the actual laptop so it's not jostled around in the bag, which is a great idea, except that my laptop can barely fit in it, which is concerning because I always thought my laptop was fairly small/thin for a 15.6" laptop. That said, it fits and does its job; it's just a little annoying to have to fit it carefully into that tight pocket every time.<br/><br/>The material of the bag seems pretty cheap too. By cheap, I don't mean flimsy, because I'm sure it can withstand reasonable wear and tear, but it just doesn't have the nicer feel or appearance of other messenger bags.<br/><br/>It feels more like a somewhat thicker-than-usual laptop sleeve, though with an extra pocket (which is nice for cables and power bricks) and a shoulder strap. Which is perfectly fine and functional. Just don't expect a very professional looking messenger bag.

 I love this bag. It is very sturdy and fits my larger laptop along with the mouse and cords. Measure your laptop first, just to make sure it will fit. Dimensions are given. It had a great shoulder strap, which I prefer, but also a hand strap, so you can use either. It is basic and does what I ask of it. Can't ask for more,
 Mine is the 14-Inch.  This is a great little case, which I'm using for a new Dell XPS-13.  It seemed rather silly to carry my new slim and light laptop in my old huge bag - if doing that what's the point of slim and light?  There's enough padding that I feel OK carrying the laptop without a sleeve, though obviously I'd still rather not drop it.  I may pick up a thin neoprene sleeve anyway.  The shoulder strap is long enough that, as a 6-1 guy I can carry it at my waist and not under my armpit.  My one wish would be for an ID window on the outside that one could put a business card in.  I've only had it for a few days so can't speak to the durability from experience, though it looks well made, with bar tacks in places where it looks like they should be.
 Despite the "Amazon" brand, your results will not be any better than if you bought a similarly priced bag from Walmart. Within the first month of use, one of the plastic clips broke, leaving me with basically the handles to carry it around. Beyond that it was fine, well, until a soda cup broke apart while I was carrying it. Well, the good news is, that it was waterproof *enough* to only require me to wipe off the top of my laptop. The bad news is, well - the washing instructions.<br/><br/>Or, should I say, the washing symbols, which basically translate to the only way you're ever going to clean it, is by hand. And I'm assuming the main reason you can't just toss it in the washing machine, is for the same reason hand washing isn't going do do much - the padding.<br/><br/>In the end, it was alright for what it cost, but I think I'm going to look for something a bit better.
 This is a well-made bag with two interior, pockets for holding files and notebooks. It's very well-padded, both for a laptop inside and tablet on the outside. (There are two outside, zipped pockets) It's very durable--I live in the Alaskan wilderness and take it with me on walks. It's been parked on rough granite, tree roots, gravel, etc. I'm very impressed with the way it's held up over the last few months of constant rough use.<br/><br/>It has handles and a shoulderstrap. The shoulderstrap is a little too long, I feel, making the pad on it not sit right, but other than that I like everything about this lightweight but strong and useful bag.
 Bought this bag for my MacBook Air 11.6 inch. It fits the laptop perfectly with enough pockets and space to hold my basic adapters (video, network, USB) and charger. It's a very nice well-made bag that fits everything I need, but will prevent me from loading up the bag too full, which is exactly why I bought it. I only wish it had the option to join the two handles together into one, but that's definitely not a deal breaker. Very pleased!
 There are no paddings inside to protect your laptop from accidental falls.<br/>I chose the AmazonBasics not only because of the good reviews, but because it was within my price range at the time.<br/><br/>Just yesterday afternoon as I was ready to leave work, I picked up my laptop bag and placed it over my shoulder. As I was reaching for my sunglasses on my desk, for some stupid reason, the clip to the shoulder wrap swung around me and my laptop fell hard on its side to the ground. I panicked, looked at the clip to see if it had broken. It was not broken. It had somehow just un-clipped itself. I did not touch my laptop bag all day, it was just sitting under my desk behind me so I honestly don't know how this could have happened, unless, as someone mentioned in a review stated before that if you swing it the bag unclips itself.<br/><br/>I've never had this problem with any other bags so I went to reread some of the reviews here and I see that some people have this issue as well.<br/>I won't recommend this bag to anyone else.
 I sure wish I had broken down and gotten a case like this one for my computer before I dropped it, not after.  It cost me $175 to correct the issues that resulted after my "drop".  Recommend you get one, if you don't already.  I was fortunate not to lose my writings due to my mishap.  I have an Acer Aspire which measures exactly 15 inches from outside to outside and it fits just fine.  The tree sections inside and the outside large pocket are ideal for carrying the extras.  I have not used the carrying case, as the handles are good enough for me.
 The bag itself is great! There is padding all around even the corners which was a concern. Bought it for my Dell g7, went with the 17.3 since it's not the slimmest laptop. Glad I did, bag fits the laptop with cooling pad, mouse and charger! Only complaint is the strap to bag is plastic clips so hopefully they hold up, otherwise it looks to be a decent bad for the price.
 Bought this bag for my new Asus laptop ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CGGOUJM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 ) which fits perfectly.  This is a pretty slim, minimal bag, but after using it for over a month, I am thrilled with it, especially given the price point.<br/><br/>I carry my charger in the front small pocket.  The bigger front pocket holds pens, a notepad, my thumb drives, snacks, and my wireless mouse (in one of the three perfectly sized inner pouches).  The main compartment holds the laptop securely, with leftover space for paperwork or another notebook or two.<br/><br/>This isn't ideal for someone who carries giant binders and hundreds of pages alongside their computer.  But for a laptop, plus basic accessories and peripherals, this thing is PERFECT.
 This is a pretty nice bag which I bought to store, and carry, my Samsung Chromebook.  I really like it because it has some room inside of the main area, where I am able to also store the charger.  The outer pocket is large enough to store a mouse, and a few other smaller items, like USB sticks, cables, etc.  The bag seems to be well made and I hope that it will last for a while.  Also, it's a compact size so it's pretty easy to carry around.
 Good "basic" bag.<br/><br/>Nice slim laptop bag without too much extra pockets and features.  Main compartment fits laptop, with little extra room for power cable/brick. First side compartment holds mouse, ID card, keys and some pen loops. Second side area is great for phone or plane tickets, something you want to access quickly. Strap is fine, handles are nice; appreciate it has both.<br/><br/>Be sure to check the dimensions of your laptop! Turns out the ASUS ROG 752VT (12.7 x 16.4 x 1.5 inches) is just a little too tall/deep for this bag; it won't zip up. Will keep for use as business bag, may get a backpack to hold that monster. You win again, AMAZON!
 Case has plenty of room for the Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-111-C670, two front horizontal pockets up front. If you have a Chromebook and an iPad, you could put an iPad in the outside pocket, the one that is between the main case and the smaller zipper that you see in the picture. Padded inside, zipper slides well and feels sturdy. Shoulder strap removable and has a metal ring where the shoulder strap hooks and I think that is more sturdy than the Case Logic version, The carry handles like the car seat belt material but has padding, so it seems comfortable. You cannot retract the handles. It has similar features to the Case Logic but costs less.
 I bought this bag for a Lenovo 14" flex, but it is an exact tight fit, the zippers would scratch the corners or the wide side up if you are not careful, the Lenovo 14" flex's four corners are way up to the edge of each corner of the bag.  But it is good for the 14" size Asus laptop, since it's 1/2 inch smaller than the 14" Lenovo.  the bag is not really padded compared to other ones I have.  So you would rather pay more and get another bag where you can transport your laptop with extra dropping protection.<br/><br/>I'm giving the 3 star rating based on the poor padding issue
 Good case for the money. Quite thin padding, especially on back of case. My Lenovo T61 14.1 inch Thinkpad with extended battery did fit, but was tight. Case has lots of pockets for storage of mouse, power cords, etc. Even enough room for my calculator and a book. Updated April 4, 2015. The previous 2 bags I bought were for 14 inch Lenovo T61 and T420 computers. I  just now purchased the 17.3 inch bag and it fits perfectly for my Lenovo W530 laptop with 15.6 inch screen. The 15.6 inch version of this bag was too tight with the wireless USB mouse receiver installed and with extended battery.
 Nice effective bag, I was looking for a simple bag without the extra pockets and size of my bigger bags for those occasions when I wanted to travel light and only need some papers, a couple note pads and my power adapter. .  This bag more than satisfies my needs to all those times when I don't need to carry a lot of extra items such  as external hard drives, projector cables, etc.
 I ready many reviews and personally I think some of the previous purchasers out there are a little dopey.  The bag fits my 16" laptop.  My iPad 2, four file folders about a half inch thick each.  AS WELL AS the charging cords for both above items., a cellular modem, misc other cables.  a legal tablet.  pens pencils, etc.  Would the product save your electronics from a drop kick, No.  would it save them from a 5' fall maybe.  Of course if you are careful with the $1000 worth of equipment in the bag then clearly you will be fine.  If you take care of your things like a five year old....
 This bag was the least expensive bag that I considered for my lap top. I compared this bag to some that cost $50 and more at a local office supply store.. and also on line units that cost $25-$35... ultimately this is the one I chose. I chose this one because it described where and how you can store accessories like the power cord  headphones etc....For some of the slimmer models I considered there was no mention of storing the power cord, accessories etc and the thin bags look so tight I was not sure they had made adequate provisions for accessories...I am very happy with the quality and price of this item..it seems to be well made and of quality materials far more than the price would suggest. The only criticism I have is that I wish they would have included a velcro strip that could be used to hold the two handles together, other than that the size fit and storage available is excellent. I purchased this as an accessory for an HP Pavillion 14.1 Lap top....
 Awesome bag with plenty of pockets for cords and accessories.  Accommodates my mid-2014 MacBook Retina 15" perfectly...and there's even room for paperwork, power adapter, cables, and all sorts of other things.  The case is MUCH more spacious than you'd probably guess from looking...I'm not sure how, but they seem to have defied the laws of physics or Banach-Tarski'ed it or something.  Love it.  It also does a great job protecting what's inside, and the make is clearly high quality, so I'm betting it will last.  Incidentally, speaking of space, the shoulder strap is tucked away in a rather obscure pocket, so that's a good way to learn your way around the case, I suppose.  :)
 I was tired of using bags that were too large and had way too many pockets and things. I needed something more compact. This holds my macbook, charger, and accessories without any extra bloat. The material is strong and the zippers feel like high quality. They don't snag when you open or close them quickly. 100% satisfied with this bag.
 I have a 10.1 inch tablet with keyboard &amp; its fits nicely in this zippered bag with room to spare toward the zipper. The Bag also has a zippered pocket for accessories, I put my charger cord in it but the pocket is very roomy leingth &amp; width wise, maybe 1" depth wise. For the pricepoint I was surprised with the fit/finish of this item.
 Well, it's definitely basic.  I have an Acer Aspire R3 that measures 11.7 in. (29.7 cm) by 8.3 in. (21.1 cm).  My laptop fits securely and is effortless to remove when needed.  Unfortunately, you compromise space for that secure fit.  I read a lot of the reviews that said it easily held a laptop and a notebook and some papers, but in my experience a standard 5-star, college ruled, single subject notebook BARELY fits.  I usually have to push down the notebook to get the zipper around the corners.<br/>Overall, the zippers and materials feel solid.  It's a convenient and secure way of carrying your laptop.  Just don't anticipate carrying much more than the laptop, charger, a few pens and pencils, maybe a calculator, and a small notebook.
 This is a nice, simple, lightweight laptop bag. I'd prefer that it had a few more pockets, but I love pockets. This one has enough and covers most of the bases for such an inexpensive product. I really like the strap quality and the only thing that I might complain about is the joints squeak a little when it swings, but that can be remedied with a tiny bit of grease.
 This is my second bag for my new Samsung Note 101. 2014.  Perfect size.  Lightweight and sturdy.  I feel that my precious tablet is well protected in it.  The tablet fits perfectly inside with room so that you are not squeezing it in, but not so much room that it is sliding around.  I recently washed my first bag after years of use and it came out of the washing machine looking brand new!  Looks barely used and has held up with with two young boys handling it, and sometimes, not so delicately, over the years!  As I indicated earlier, I liked it so much I bought a second bag and anticipate that it will last many years without showing any wear and tear!  Great price for a high quality bag!  Amazon rocked this one!
 After about a year of owning this and giving it minimal use I used it about 4 times the inside stitching is coming out and t is starting to fall apart<br/>it loks great and works for my use but it falls apart quickly. I have had other bags from targus and others that have lasted many many years with no issues like this
 Basic &amp; simple, non-descript but still nice looking, well made and seems fairly durable. I bought it for an ASUS X205 eeebook &amp; it fits just fine. But, as anyone w/ good sense would realize PRIOR to buying, there is very little room left over. There is room for pencils, the charger, a mouse (kind of) &amp; a very slim book and a few magazines. Not much else. When I bought this, I thought I would use it solely for the ASUS but it just wasn't convinient for what I normally do (student). I ended up buying the Amazon Basics 15.6" Laptop bag which suits my needs much better. BUT, jsuk-I liked this bag enough that I kept it.  I keep it handy jic I'm taking ONLY my ebook or tablet somewhere. For the price (maybe $11 shipped), I don't mind having it sitting around just to use a few times a month.  It really is quite handy &amp; VERY portable if all you need is your small laptop &amp;/or tablet &amp; very little else.
 This bag has been amazing for the price.  I have no complaints and it fits my small laptop perfectly in the large pocket built into the main compartment while the other pocket holds my small form amazon tablet and mouse.  There is still plenty of room in the main compartment to stow a Nintendo 3DS XL, charging cables for Nintendo 3DS XL, fire tablet, and laptop.  The outside zip pocket offers plenty of room headphones and other smaller cable adapters.
 I am genuinely surprised that an Amazon-made bag outdid actual bag companies. I wanted a computer bag for my new macbook air and this was like the most/best reviewed laptop bag. At first, I was skeptical because the price seemed to good to be true. In addition, it's designed for men. I ultimately decided to purchase it because I just couldn't pass up the affordable price. This is the best bag decision I've made as shocking as it is for a girly girl like me. The bag feels really sturdy and has many pockets which I love! So glad I made this purchase!
 Not enough protection, The description of this item describes that it is for the Amazon Basics case for 7 to 10 in tablets, however the bag is way to large for the Amazon Fire. Its way to big, does not even lay vertical when held by the handles,Tour tablet flops and bangs around. The outer pocket is small, unfastened and not padded and will not hold anything securely. . You will brake your 7-9" tablet in this loose fitting brief case.  Although there is room, you would not want to put anything else like a power adapter in bad with tablet because there is no interior protection.  I think this was designed for something else other than tablets frankly - seems like a tradeshow "chachkies" bag really.  2 Stars for quality and price, zero for description.  UPDATE:  I found the zipper (tucked) for the outer pocket tucked inside. I was also able to jam the Kindle Fire into the side pocket, sideways and it seems a bit more secure.  Its definitely not perfect, but may be good for something else  raised to ***.
 Love this case. It is well made from good materials with enough space for my 14" hp, mouse pad, mouse, power supply, cords, portable storage drive, earbuds, USB card reader.<br/>Just enough room, not overly large. I like keeping it small, particularly when I travel.<br/>This case is enough and the price makes it a great choice.
 Its a case for my MacBook, what else can be said? Ok, a bit! The quality is really good for this case and the price, well, exceptional value. The only issue I can say there is with it is the shoulder strap having plastic clasps, but its a case for my 13" MacBook so it will suffice as it is not that heavy. The details are great, the pad for the shoulder strap has a contoured design so that it does not dig into you neck. Stitching is excellent and the zippers are great. It has way more room than I thought it would have. Things like that you would expect to find in cases 2 to 3 times this price. Now, the brand name, its branded AmazonBasics, and honestly, I am fine with that. If you want a Gucci (if they exist) case or a big branded case, then by all means, pass this one up and go spend 3-5 times the price. I am satisfied with this case and highly recommend it!
 Great bags for the price. Hold up well, pretty standard of pockets and pen holders.  Black with orange stitching and Amazon branding on the bag and zippers.<br/>By these for our service team.  They have had for a few years and so far held up to everyday use and abuse.<br/><br/>Not super padded, so would use caution if buying for  a child's laptop or an Executive who is exceptionally rough on gear.
 This is an excellent bag. FYI: Barely fits a 17" laptop in the pocket. The small usb connector for my mouse catches on the pocket and so I have to be very careful or it gets hung up. If your laptop isn't super skinny, it probably won't fit well. Other than that, it has enough pockets and an adjustable strap. What more could you need?
 Description and reviews made it seem like a standard folder would fit along with my tablet.  It doesn't.  A standard spiral bound notebook BARELY gets into the sleeve without needing to manipulate so zipper will zip.<br/><br/>This is exactly what I was looking for for work to include a folder or 2 for a few paper documents and my tablet for project instructions.  Lightweight and simple, not a bulky laptop bag and/or briefcase/binder with handles.  And the price was extremely acceptable!!  Unfortunately, I am now stuck with a tiny bag that nothing will fit in other than just my tablet (which already has a case and sleeve).  I literally only needed an extra inch or 2 width and length for a folder, but thickness was ideal.
 I looked around for a long time for a simple, affordable but well made laptop bag and this was the one.  Not only was it a great price it suits my needs perfectly, is well made, has enough room for the laptop, cords and some other things as well.  I just needed a simple case for basic travel that wasn't heavy but would allow me to bring the necessities with me.  This case was perfect.  I know some people have complained about the orange interior however Amazon apparently has changed that since the case I received was totally black except for the very bottom of the interior of the bag.  Also, one other reviewer has said that he had concerns about the lack of padding at the bottom of the bag and I feel the same way.  I put some microfiber towels in the bottom just for extra cushioning to be safe.  Overall, I would definitely purchase this bag again and recommend to others.
 I bought this bag to carry my new 17" laptop around the house. Dropping that large, awkward and delicate piece of electronics would be a horrible disaster!  However, if I were to take the laptop traveling, this bag would be perfect. Padded, with several pockets, comfortable and adjustable shoulder strap, and very sturdy, the laptop would be well protected. A very nice purchase. Thanks so much.
 great bag at a great price, plus free shipping!  I looked through several big box stores and couldn't find anything worthwhile that had any padding for less then $20.  This fits my Toshiba 505 mini-laptop perfectly perfectly (10.1" screen) and as the others said, enough room in the front pocket for the electrical cord.  Handles are padded, as well as the inside to protect against "bumps"....not drops!  (Its cloth, not a plastic hard case.)  The feel is soft, feels good in your hand holding the padded handles, and the zipper is large and only zips down on 1/3 of each side, so the laptop can't ever fall out if you walk away holding the handles,.......but forgot to zip it closed.  The zipper pulls are soft plastic, and I'm sure they will wear out first, especially if you really "horse" the zipper around. Treat them with a bit of care and they'll stay in place much longer.  When they do wear through, a looped piece of nylon cord will be a fine replacement for pennies. Not a deal breaker by any stretch. It's a bargain at the price and not many other products at that price are made as well.  I think it will suit my purpose of an easy to carry mini-laptop/notebook bag to put in my motorcycle saddlebag, or carry on the truck seat next to me. Go on, get it! you won't regret it.  Thanks Amazon, you got it right with this one.
 It' s just a darned good thing that the laptop isn't 15.7 - instead of 15.6".  It BARELY fits and does not have near the padding that a bit more expensive case has.  I'll keep it for 14" and do as I normally do ... put craft-store flat foam (e.g. seat cushion) inside as well.  I'm keeping them; but reluctantly.... Just don't have the desire to 'fight yet something else in life'.
 I'm quite happy with this bag. It is nice and compact, unlike the previous bag I'd been using. My 15-inch laptop fits snugly inside (anything bigger won't fit) and my tablet has plenty of room in the side pouch.  The AC adaptor and mouse have to be stuffed in the side. The handles have a good feel and I haven't tried out the strap yet.
 The best features off the top of my head are the high quality construction, lots of on board storage options for accessories, and it offers excellent protection without a lot of bulk or weight.  My system consists of this 11.6 inch bag coupled with the Amazon Basics 7-10 inch neoprene tablet case.  I typically put my 10 inch tablet in the Amazon Basics neoprene case then drop it effortlessly inside this case.  It is a perfect fit and gives me lots of options for protection and carrying of my 10.1 inch tablet.  I can't believe how many cables, adapters, and charging systems, ect. fit in here easily.  I'm sure it could even fit a mini projector if you have a small tablet in there like I do.  Best small tablet case for the money, no question.
 So I got caught in the rain with this bag.  Well I was outside for maybe 1 minute and had my umbrella.  Everything in the bag got at least a bit wet.  WTF?? What cheap porous fake material is this made from?  Terrible.
 I've been using this bag since 2014 to carry my 15-inch MacBook Pro back and forth to work. In the main bag I carry the MacBook, and any papers or files I have. It has a couple of dividers to keep the paper separate and protected. In the large outside pocket I carry small tools, various adapters for the MacBook, flash drives, and a mouse. In the small outside pocket I manage to fit in the power adapter and cord for the Mac.<br/><br/>Despite almost daily use, there are no visible signs of wear, and all the zippers still work. It's held up much better than a Targus bag costing considerably more that I had used for a similar period of time. And you can't beat the price. I've just ordered another one to carry a recently purchased 15-inch Dell.
 It's fine, I purchased this for a 7th grade boy who carries his school-issued Chromebook in this everyday back and forth from school so it does suffer daily heavy (ab)use.  It has been approximately 2 months in use and the top zipper gave out and then the plastic broke on the shoulder strap so it doesn't connect to the bag anymore.  I will look to see if there is something even sturdier, though this was fine for the low price.
 I don't use this as a laptop bag but instead for carrying around my files, papers, and general detritous.  It is nothing fancy - really the definition of form follows function - I don't even think there is a decoration of any kind on it.  But really I don't need that.  I've used it in heat, cold, and rainy weather and it has hung together well.  For the price it can't be beat.
 The laptop fits in the medium side pocket. There's also a smaller side pocket for the laptop power cord or what not. The main zipper pouch is really big and I can store a portable optical drive, DVD movie case and full size paper tablet with room to spare. Construction is good with quality zippers and no loose threads.
 I love this item. I have an HP 11 Stream laptop and it fits inside perfectly with room left over for my Kindle Fire HDX, my mouse, and USB cords. It comes with a shoulder strap or you can carry it without straps. It's reasonably priced compared to other more expensive laptop bags and the design of it makes it easier on the eyes. It fits all of my items perfectly with room left over for keys, pens and miscellaneous items. There is one deep pocket in the front, and two smaller compartments with little pockets on the inside as well. The laptop bag zips up which keeps my items secure. I recommend this product.
 Got this 11.6" version to hold my 10.1" Acer netbook with extended battery, and it fits in here perfectly. This bag also holds the charging cord, external USB powered DVD drive (and cords), small 4 port USB hub, wireless mouse, AND can also hold my 8" tablet in its case with its charger at the same time. It's unbelievable how roomy this case really is. I sometimes wonder if it has a bottom.<br/><br/>It has lots of pockets (both internal and external) to store and stash everything you can throw at it. The padded strap is excellent and just long enough. The material is of good quality and feels more expensive than it is.<br/><br/>As with all the Amazon Basics products that I have purchased, they have been of very high quality and lasted well. They do make a great value.
 Really good, well made but on the cheaper end of the spectrum as far as quality of material, case which fits our Surface Book Microsoft laptop inside.  We have a Samsonite sleeve that goes around the laptop and it fits like a glove inside this case.  I am a tech geek and I must say I don't feel comfortable with too many extra gadgets inside this with the laptop.  Power cord, a few external hard drives, a couple other nic naks and that is about it.<br/><br/>This case is a must have if you like traveling light.  I feel it will last more then a few years and it really fit our needs.
 I'm very impressed with Amazon's line of cases.  I bought this to replace a Case Logic sleeve that I bought for my Lenovo 11.6" Yoga.  The sleeve was so tight the zipper marred the outside of my brand new device!!  I used to love Case Logic products, but they've gone the way of cheap and lacking in design.  Fortunately, Amazon has picked up the ball, where Case Logic dropped it, and run with it!  This case is designed with quality in mind.  It has enough room for my device to keep it from moving around (with good padding to protect it), but I don't need a shoe horn to get the tablet into the case!  The extra pockets allow for just enough stuff I might need to take with my tablet.  Way to go Amazon!
 I saw another review saying the inside was orange, mine was not. I guess they ditched the orange inside....I wish I got that! it would of been a nice change from "boring black"  I am in love with case anyways, Im using this for an Acer Aspire netbook. it is small and very roomy and they seem to have now added more cushioning to the bottom (from older review I read, it was lacking?).<br/><br/>I can fit my netbook, My ID cards, and my clutch along with my notebook and some pens and the power adapter all without making the bag look like it swallowed a cow so I am very happy about it.<br/><br/>I dont mind rocking the amazonbasics logo, this bag is way better and 1/6th the price of the ones I saw at my local stores and college bookstore aimed at the "average student" and it is hefty enough to not spend your time worrying if you broke your netbook or tablet if you accidentally knocked it against a wall or door frame on your way out.
 I bought this bag for my Surface RT.  I have a Manvex folio Case on the Surface, and the Microsoft Touch Keyboard, and that extra thickness makes for a very tight fit. But I like this bag, its well made, and is well padded all around.  It stretches just enough to get the Surface in the bag, well protected and the dual zippers are very strong.  Without the Manvex case and keyboard, the surface pops right in loosely, no problem.  But I use it all the time with the case and keyboard, so its not a big deal when I lug it around in this bag.  The zipper pocket on the outside of the case is solid too, and although it is just a flat pocket, its about the same size as the case.  I can hold the surface charger, and misc flash drives, pens, etc in there without too much crowding.  Its a nice bag.
 I bought this to store my Mac book and also to store my small 13 inch toshiba . It has more than enough room and a good amount of compartments for chargers, usbs, mouse, etc. Its actually bigger than I expected it to be but just the right size. The main reason why I bought this is because I got tired of going through TSA security  check outs without a laptop bag. I got tired of taking it out my laptop backpack because as most of you know, you have to put your laptop in a separate container than your carry on luggage. I travel to Asia every year and it's a pain to having to keep taking my laptop out my backpack and putting it back in so now I will have my laptop In this bag and my carry on backpack. The case protects your laptop very well and the inside feels great and full of protection. I would highly recommend this if you travel a lot or if your always on the go. This far exceeds my expectations
 Been using this bag for about 2 years and it is fantastic!! It fits my 13 inch MBP perfect with room to spare for folders and papers. Side pockets hold laptop accessories and writing utensils comfortably.<br/><br/>My only gripes are that after 2 years, the bottom of the bag where the two corners of the laptop rests  have noticibly thinned out and the plastic buckles of the shoulder straps creak against the D-ring when walking.<br/><br/>Besides that it has been a fantastic companion for my precious laptop and has protected it from all the dangerous elements. It worked flawlessly in the school and professional environment.<br/><br/>Get this bag. You won't regret it.
 For a laptop bag what much can be said that hasn't already, only this one has room for a laptop,a tablet,documents,charger, and a mouse, and maybe a few other things. That's just the first zippered compartment, the smaller front pocket has room for pens, notepads, phones, passports, etc.; and then there's the final smaller front pocket which could really hold any number of different things.. It's fairly padded along the bottom of the bag and comes with a shoulder strap but I recommend using the hand grips. Overall worth the wait knowing my laptop will have a soft safe place to nest while not being used. Would definitely recommend for the price.
 I bought this for my portable DVD player. It’s the perfect size and fits all the accessories plus a lead cord. This sturdy bag is nice looking and I love how it feels to carry!
 This Laptop Bag is terrific. It is large enough for my 15.6" laptop and has pockets all over the place for battery wires, etc. I read where one person used the shoulder strap and it broke. I'd rather use the handles and take no chances.<br/><br/>All in all I am very pleased. This bag is well made and just what you need for everything and anything!!
 Just wanted a basic laptop case for my mom. Didn't want anything too bulky and overpriced. This fit the bill quite nicely and am pleased. Enough room for a 15.6" laptop and charger a well as some paper pads and other small items. Material seems like it should be durable however won't know until time passes. Overall, pretty nice if you just want a basic laptop bag.
 Good so far.<br/>I wish they made a version this without all the padding to protect tablets.  It's just the right size to haul paperwork between home and the office--much more convenient than a full briefcase.  The padding (front, back, middle) might be useful for tablets but is overkill for my purposes.  It seems like half of its bulk is from the padding.
 I got this Amazon Basics Netbook Bag for my Asus 10.1 inch EEE PC Netbook. It is a great fit. It has plenty of room for my netook, but not to big at all. It has a outside second zipper pocket that has room for the battery charger cord and any extra flash drives. It is well protected neoprene and extra padded that feels like it will be a little extra safe for any knock abouts that could happen in daily use traveling around from place to place. I also really like the handles to carry it. Sometimes I throw it into my bag, but sometimes I just take it along with my purse, and then the handles really come in handy. I like to take my netbook with me to my favorite coffee shop and even to the park to do my work on it. All in all, I think I got a very good deal for a nice netbook cover, at a great price. I got a Roo bag cover, but did not feel that it protected my netbook nearly as well, from all those bumps and such while I take it around with me, and returned the Roo for this bag. I only wish it came in more colors. I would love it to be a nice bright color. I give it a full 5 Stars.
 I see lots of complaints about this bag, and they may be valid except for one thing. It costs $13.99. You may be expecting too much. For myself, I've been using this bag every day for about 15 months, and I couldn't be happier with it. I can carry my small laptop and a tablet with ease. And as mentioned by many others there are ample pockets for storage. If you really have to have more protection, buy a piece of thin foam. I do wish, however that the hardware was metal instead of plastic, but then again, $13.99. Can't be beat for the price.
 Bought this case to carry my small laptop plus full size keyboard.  The keyboard has to be stored as a slant since it's 17 1/4" and the inside dimension of the bag is only 16 1/2", but I expected that.  Zippers are smooth and the stitching job is good with enough pockets to accommodate my needs.  Quality item at a reasonable price
 Good bad, lots of pockets to put stuff. I actually lost a flash drive for months in here once. I placed it in one of the pockets, and it seemed to have fallen into a void of no return.<br/>I bought a labtop at the same time as I purchased this bad over a year ago. I might have used the bad a handful of times, but realized my computer fit in my backpack and now I never use this. This bad sits under my bed now collecting dust.<br/>I suppose if you were to travel a lot this bad would be helpful, but the only travelling I do is from one classroom to another.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Very light weight<br/>-Many pockets<br/>-Nice detachable strap<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Backpack proved more useful than this bad<br/>-Each pocket is a void that will take your things and only give them back after months of searching
 I love Amazon and now they even make basic products! This laptop bag fits my 15.6 in laptop perfectly. It is a little on the bigger side of what I am used to since I mainly use my 14in ultrabook. However, for my other laptops, this bag is perfect. There is enough room for me to put my laptop, my charger, and an extra mouse. Even with all those, there is still room for me to put in a notebook or thin book. The bag features many pockets so it is very easy to be organized and store all of my stuff. Compared to other products, this product is cheaper and does the job equally as well! Overall, I would recommend this product.
 This product  is very nice and very well padded. My tablet fits in it perfectly, however, if you want to pack a lot of things in it besides your tablet, and perhaps a backup drive you will be disappointed. There are lots of pockets, but not a lot of room. For a tablet and a few (non bulky) accessories it is perfect.
 Great for the price.<br/>I read the other reviews where folks had the strap disconnect itself, so I replaced the strap right off the bat. I would suggest that you do that same; the clips on the included strap do seem really cheap.<br/>Strap aside, the bag is great for such a low price, just don't expect it to match the quality of a $75+ bag.
 Purchased this bag for my IPad Air with Zagg keyboard.  Fits perfectly with room left over for smaller items.  I liked the idea of having a Handbag/IPad bag to be able to carry my personal items when I need my IPad.  It's well padded and not too heavy with the IPad.  Handles are well padded also, as is the shoulder strap.  My keyboard is silver &amp; matches the IPad which makes the whole thing slippery and hard to carry.  If anyone knows of a silicone cover for the whole thing would like to know about it. I can't find one that covers IPad &amp; keyboard.
 Oh my goodness the is the very best bag for carrying your laptop. My 15 inch MacBook Pro fits perfectly inside this bag and there is so much more room for all of your accessories. The outside fabric is extremely durable. The strap is long and adjustable.<br/><br/>On a normal day, I carry my sleeved 15 inch MacBook Pro, my sleeved iPad 1, writing notebook, chargers , cords and removable DVD player and there is still lots more room for stuff.<br/><br/>I love the additional outside zippered pocket.<br/><br/>Amazon, I love you for making a great bag and selling it for a very reasonable price.<br/><br/>The only thing cheap about this bag is the price.<br/><br/>Amazon did an amazing job with the bag and the price.
 Works great with a Dell Latitude.  Plenty of compartments to hold most of what you're going to need.<br/><br/>I have NOT had the problem with the shoulder strap clip coming off, but I'm wary of this and check each time I pick the bag up.<br/><br/>4 stars for "versatility" because I don't think that this laptop bag does anything more in life than being a laptop bag.
 This is a nice quality bag at a cheap price.  The only thing I didn't really like were the rubber grip zippers with the Amazon Basics logos on them.  It would have looked a little more professional without that and I'm curious to see the durability of the rubber grips versus a conventional full-metal zipper grip.  I read other reviews complaining of a "chemical" smell but I think they have probably never smelled neoprene before.  Some people were also complaining about it being a little over-sized for the iPad but I disagree.  This is not an iPad case, it's universal netbook case.  I think it's a nice size, especially if you have a case on your iPad as well.  You can also fit a few accessories in the separate front pocket without worry about it scratching up your device.
 As with all my reviews:<br/>1= Worst product ever, does not even come close to description<br/>2= Bad, breaks easy, something along those lines<br/>3= Meets expectations with a minor flaw of some type.<br/>4= Meets expectations, no issues. As Described.<br/>5= Exceeds expectations in some way or another.<br/><br/>I am actually amazed at how well the bag is designed. It is light weight, appears sturdy, and the pockets are just what you need. There is room for the PC, a folder or notebook or something in the main hold. There is a charger and other equipment holder pocket, and a smaller from pocket for your "whatever". I really like it.
 Ive had this bag for 3 months and, surprisingly it hasnt fallen apart yet.  I say Im surprised because the zipper work on it feels quite cheap and Im not sure how long it will really last.  Overall though the bag has decent variation in compartments to store whatever it is you might need and is well thought out.  For a cheap bag I should probably give it 4 stars but I would have wanted to know going in how cheap the zippers were.  Overall, given the price, its OK.<br/><br/>UPDATE 10-20-16.<br/>Well over 2 years later I am still using this bag.  The zippers still work fine, the fabric is intact (no peeling or fraying), and Ive been pretty happy with it.  I increased my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars because its a very inexpensive bag, which indeed does feel cheap, but which is also quite durable and has stood the test of time.
 Took it out of the box and was instantly disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much for $15.00 but once again you get what you pay for. I had a promo so it was not too bad but here goes; I have an old laptop bag I bought at SAM's a time ago. I just looked it's made by Totes. Oh my compare the two laptop bags. One is the Amazon smaller zippers, nylon canvas is thin as if someone said in the design, "how thin a fabric can we get buy with". The Totes is heavy enough to be considered military grade or heavier! I paid about the same price for both bags. Oh how times have changed. Amazon bag is good short term bag, feels cheap do not think its a good investment! I would have given it three stars instead of two but three is "ok", and its really not. Amazon seems to be selling many of these. Makes me wonder why so many like this bag but not me? Guess I am hard core..
 Since airlines are now starting to aggressively weigh carryon bags, I originally purchased this as a lighter weight travel solution for the Samsung NC10 netbook, which fit perfectly. This bag has one 6 inch tall by 7 inch deep external compartment which is adequate for the travel peripherals. The zipper pulls are big and rubbery, providing a good grip.<br/>The foam padding inside offers pretty good protection for the computer, but there's not much extra room inside, except maybe for a mousepad.<br/>Since then, we have acquired an ASUS T100TA "Transformer", as our new travel computer, and it too fits perfectly inside the bag.<br/>The only improvement I can suggest would be the integration of two d rings along the top to facilitate the use of a shoulder strap.<br/>All in all, an excellent lightweight travel bag for the netbook class computer.
 I run an after school program and we have a few PS4s that we bring out a couple times a week.  We bought these to hold those, and they work great!  The only criticism I have is that the bottom seems a little under-padded.  We just cut a but of the packaging the PS4s came in and layered it on the bottom, so they still work for us just fine, but it IS something to be aware of.<br/><br/>A lot of people say the straps pop off.  We haven't had this problem, but they do seem a little flimsy.  As a precaution I've removed the shoulder straps from the bags so that they can only be picked up and carried by the handles.
 7000+ reviews and somehow I felt you all needed another one.  I like the bag but it's a little snug for my 17 inch laptop - in spite of a description that says it fits 17.3 inches and my laptop doesn't have the extra .3 inch. Considering the reviews about lack of padding, ripped seams, ripped handles, and separating shoulder straps, I'll stick to to my original thoughts: I'm going to use this to carry my 13.3 inch laptop in it's sleeve.  I bought this just in the hopes it would work for my 17 incher but had I known it wouldn't fit, I would have gotten the 14 or 15.6 inch versions instead.  Well, I'm going to keep it loose and keep it light and hope it lasts a long time.
 Simple. Solid value. It works. It's reasonably priced. Quality construction. What's not to love?<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>UPDATE Two Years Later<br/><br/>This bag is an incredible value. I got it as a computer bag, but have ended up carrying it every day like a messenger bag, even whem I'm not using a computer. I've been looking for something more trendy, in canvas or leather, but this bag is just so functional and high quality, that I haven't been able to ditch it.<br/><br/>One little feature I've come to especially appreciate is the swivels on the shoulder strap... so, the strap never gets twisted.<br/><br/>I've looked at canvas messenger bags, but most don't have any padding... which I do want for when carrying a computer and this has it.<br/><br/>And it's $14.99! Incredible!
 My wife and I both have tablets; when I saw these available for a really great price, I got one for each of us.  They are a great size, seem to offer decent protection and convenience, and the price was phenomenal.  Unless I was getting some fancy leather thing, I wouldn't spend any more on something like this.
 The bag itself is durable and has held my laptop, tablet, and other school materials for the few weeks I used it. The clasps in the straps have gotten increasing squeaky everytime I move with it on my shoulder, seemingly due to the plastic retracting. I hope it's just mine, but if yours gets squeaky, you can always replace it with another strap or hold it by the handles. Other then that, solid bag for a good price.
 I purchased this item with the intent to limit the amount of extra "stuff" I carried with me on a daily basis. It accomplishes this task with aplomb; there is enough space for me to carry my tablet, charger, phone, pens, two notebooks, calculator, keys, earbuds, portable battery and a very slim textbook (albeit without being zippered).<br/><br/>The material choices and finish are excellent. The seams are well aligned, the pockets evenly spaced, and zippers firmly secured. I find it lightweight, easy to carry, and stylistically minimalist. The internal padding is thin, but feels to be a fairly shock absorbent foam that covers most of the critical areas of the bag (there is a slight gap at the seams, but the faces are covered) . A pleasant surprise was the inclusion of a luggage loop for those who carry their laptop cases on a telescoping wheeled case. In my use, I have added some velcro looped items to this side, which allows ease of access without having to dig into the bag.<br/><br/>My only critical observation is that the shoulder strap may be slightly large as compared to the bag itself, as it is likely standardized across the line, but it is easy to manipulate and adjust.<br/><br/>And, for those men who are concerned with carrying a "man purse," I will say that this looks like a downsized laptop case, rather than a lady's handbag, so there is a unisex application.<br/><br/>All in all, I believe this will be a constant companion for the the foreseeable future, and I highly recommend anyone looking for a tablet or slim laptop case give this serious consideration as compared to other competitors.
 I needed something to use on a daily basis for my new Verizon Ellipsis 10, and took a gamble on this. Very pleased. Fits perfect. The length or width is a tiny bit bigger, and the height leaves me with about an inch and half to spare which works out great so the zipper doesn't contact the tablet. The front pocket is great for the charger, so the tablet itself does not get scratched by any part of the charger. Lined with a nice soft fabric. I use this in combination with a tablet folio case also purchased on Amazon. Great for everyday use back and forth to the office, and when visiting friends and family so as not to worry about damage.
 I LOVE Amazon Basics! They have the best stuff. Simple, clean, practical and user friendly. I use this bag daily for my work laptop. Lots of pockets and useful slots. Definitely recommend.
 To help folks with a couple important issues:<br/><br/>Pro: The bottom of the bag is padded. Not just with the padding of the front and back coming together (as with comparably priced bag). No, this bag has significant padding (perhaps 1/3 or 1/3 inch thick) across the nearly two inches of the bottom of the case. This makes the case vastly more protective when setting it down (or, heaven forfend, dropping it).<br/><br/>Con: As many have remarked, the entire strap mechanism, including the clips and rings, is plastic. It seems like good plastic, but it's still plastic. How long until it fails? Who knows. One thing, though: on my last bag, it wasn't the strap that failed but the nylon loop on which it fastened. Perhaps the sewing is more important than the fasteners.<br/><br/>On balance, remarkable for the price.
 This bag that I bought to utilize for my new Kindle Fire HD 10 is a perfect fit for an affordable price.  It fits my tablet inside it's own protective case, the charger cable accessory, my headphones, screen cleaning cloth and leaves ample room for other odds and ends in the future.  It seems durable enough for my use, has extra pockets, and even comes with a shoulder strap that is detachable. I recommend if you are looking for an affordable tablet bag with decent enough protection.  Granted, you can't throw this bag around and onto the ground and expect nothing to happen,  but it fits my needs perfectly. Thanks Amazon!
 Got the 17.3" to fit my 17.3" Laptop. The fit is too snug and leaves no room for anything else. The pockets are next to useless, and it is a chore to store the laptop in the bag and pull it out. I was expecting something that would fit a 17.3" laptop with room to spare, not something that would wrap around it like a used piece of gum clinging to the bottom of a shoe.
 Snugged nicely for my Dell Venue 11 Pro 7140. I was trying my luck to fit a 10.8" tablet into a 10" bag. But it works!!! I even included the Mobile Keyboard for my 7140, mind you, it is not the Slim Keyboard. Gotta snug in but need no force. All in all, this bag is now a darn good carrier for my Dell 7140 11" tablet(with mounted keyboard), additional pocket to house my Logitech ultra thin mouse + Dell active stylus. Just love the slickness and cuteness of this 10" bag, therefore did not like to get the slightly bulkier and typical-laptop-kind 11.6" version. Very satisfied :)
 Was hoping that for this price, I could replace a broken laptop bag. However, this bag ripped within the first month of use and was not able to stand up to the daily use of a commuter and business traveler.
 Does what I need it to do, which is to safely take my chromebook from point A to point B. Common complaints I read were the clips for the straps breaking, causing damage to the laptops inside them. Yes, the clips are very very flimsy, but I also keep good care not to tangle them, plus it is only carrying an 11.6 inch chrombook, there's no weight to it.
 Have had this bag a few weeks now and use it daily.  This bag is extremely well designed and the quality is excellent.  When I first took it out of the packaging, it appeared so trim that I did not think my laptop would even fit in it.  But it fits perfectly and there are so many other well designed compartments that I am able to carry everything to the office that I need.  The front pocket holds a very small clutch, the middle compartment has my charger, pencils/pens, and various other items and the main compartment holds the computer and some light paperwork.  All zippers work perfectly and do not snag.  I do not use the shoulder belt which others have mentioned may be an issue.<br/><br/>Highly recommend!  And can't beat the price.
 Got this bag for a Galaxy Note Pro Tablet, and it fits perfectly with just a little room to spare. Only down fall I see are the zippers on the 2 main pockets aren't deep enough and do not let you open the case more then half of the way. But, that's just my opinion.<br/>Excellent quality for a cheap little bag.<br/><br/>UPDATE :<br/>I've been using this bag for at least a year now and have no issues. I carry 2 tablets in it, a planner, and other odds and ends. It has held up nicely.  In fact, I've ordered a 15.6" one for my new laptop. Very happy with it
 I love it, I have read all types of bad reviews about straps and padding.<br/>We had went to best buy and got a cheapo non name brand case and the register showed $89.<br/>Quickly came to amazon and found the cheapest.<br/>I will Not be using the straps.<br/>The padding is enough for basic pick up and set down.<br/><br/>Great storage spaces and slots. The padding is just a separation between your laptop and the floor. Don't drop it..<br/><br/>For $15, you should invest in a $10 laptop sleeve as well. Great basic case to keep laptop ,mouse,flash drives,charger,stylus,cords, all in one.<br/><br/>I
 I used this new bag as my carry on for a cross country flight and it worked perfectly. I was not only able to carry my 17" laptop and its charging accessories, but due to all of its pockets, I was able to carry a number of personal items, including a lightweight jacket. The bag itself is lightweight but is sturdy in its materials. Great design allowing for its versatility. Very simple in design but yet very practical and functional in its use. I am extremely pleased with this purchase and it was only 20 bucks.
 I was pleasantly surprised when I started using this netbook bag. Admittedly, I was a skeptic when I first purchased it - after all, what do you expect for twelve bucks? Then the package came in the mail, and Amazon proved why sometimes, basic really is better.<br/><br/>First off, the body is solid. The stitches are all tight and hidden instead of falling apart (a problem with a prettier and less functional bag that I had purchased/returned earlier). The handles are sturdy, as are the zippers, and the interior pocket was roomy enough for me to fit an Asus EEE PC, my wallet, and a Kindle (with lighted cover) inside, while leaving enough stretch to stuff a few cables and my Droid in the mini pocket in front. Not bad!<br/><br/>I toted the whole thing from Detroit to DC to NYC and back to Detroit again this past weekend, and it more than held its own. The small size made it easy to carry around, while the solid construction meant that I wasn't worried about damage to my electronics as I traveled. Overall, a worthy purchase, and one that I would recommend to anyone in need of something inexpensive that gets the job done.<br/><br/>Now, if only it came in color... ;)
 This bag looks like the kid-sized version of a real computer bag but it's the real deal....it's small size just makes it soooo cute!  My 11.6 inch Dell laptop fits perfectly in the bag along with Kensington lock, mini-mouse, DVD player, and charging cables although it's pretty stuffed with the charging cables.  It has 2 outside zippered pockets, one with organizing pockets (cell phone would fit), and the main padded compartment has full length pockets on each side that would hold papers.  No pockets on the back, but it does have a webbed strap to slip over a luggage handle.  It also comes with a padded shoulder strap.  My only complaint is that the hardware for the shoulder strap is plastic.  It shouldn't be a problem though because the bag isn't big enough to hold that much weight.  Great quality product for the price.
 My 'go to' is case logic, JMO has best overall value going for a pc bag. the laptop I bought L440 Lenovo did not fit my existing CL bag...sure I could stuff it in but felt I'd wreck the zippers. So began the quest for the replacement. The next CL bag larger size was WAY too big, so that went back, I figured I'd try the Amazon bags, heck I can always send it back. SUPER happy with the price, value &amp; quality. While it is no CL by any means I have gotten used to it and would recommend it to anyone with a T/L440 looking for a good bag. FYI the dimension sizes seem to be very accurate, I found this not to be the case with the CL cases listed here on Amazon.
 This bad did what the more expensive Case Logic equivalent failed to do -- it fit my 15.1-inch HD laptop.  The new 16x9-formatted laptops are almost as wide as the diagonal measurement and older-design bags fail to take this into account.  The CL bag had the zipper pressing hard against the laptop inside and that's just not right or protective.  Very tight.  The Amazon Basics bag had just an extra inch or two, so the laptop fit easily, but without falling around in there. It will also hold a tablet and the charger, no problem, along with peripherals.  Very practical.  Maybe not quite as classy looking as the pricier bags, but it looks fine, does the job well, and protects my investment. And it was a great price.  Thanks, Amazon.
 I cannot rave enough about this bag!  My son's school recently implemented an IPAD program for the students.  The students were to have IPADS to take the place of books...great news...no more heavy books to carry.  One small problem.  Although the IPAD fit in the 10 inch bag I purchased for him to carry from class to class fit the IPAD perfectly, it did not fit the 12. 5 inch keyboard that they ultimately decided to require the students to use.  I searched online for a bag that fit my exacting requirements, since I wanted something durable, black, thickly padded, adjustable strap since my son is very tall, and most bags I looked at did not have this capability to adjust to the appropriate length to be comfortable for him.  I wanted something that zippered securely since I did not want the ipad or keyboard to slide out.  I was BEYOND pleased with this.  This not only fits his IPAD, the keyboard, but his phone, headphones, flash drive and mouse for computer class, writing implements, adapter, TI 84 calculator, a spiral notebook, and stylus.  Best of all, it is padded thickly!  There are 2 large zippered pockets, and one smaller zippered pocket, several varying sized interior organizing pockets which are smartly placed on opposite sides of the bag, giving him a place to store the keyboard and accessories in an organized manner so items can be located quickly.  The zippers seem very durable, and move back and forth easily.  He likes that it is solid black ("looks cooler" he said!)  We have 4 cats and cat fur does not seem to stick to this bag...which was actually another concern because some bags tend to attract fur.  The material seems sturdy as it almost has a woven texture.  The straps are removable, although I don't see my son planning on removing them, and the strap actually rotates easily to avoid tangling...a feature I did not see on any of the other bags I had considered...a nice surprise!  The strap is thick, but lightweight.  The bag also has two handles if you prefer to just carry it by hand without the strap.  The lining on ours is a medium grey, which he observed makes it easier to find items at a glance.  There is also some reinforced stitching on the front zipper compartment which also gives the bag some character.  He has used the bag for several months and has not had any issues with wear and tear on it.  The 14.1 inch Laptop and Tablet Bag is an amazing price for such a quality item!  I would definitely highly recommend this bag!  : )
 My take on this laptop bag is that it's a very good basic bag.  I recently purchased a Dell Inspiron 17R which is a much larger device than an Ipad, which some users bought the bag for.  My Inspiron 17R fits nicely in this bag - not a lot of room left on each end, but it's not a struggle to stuff it in the bag.  The material the bag is made of seems protective enough and while it has no plastic protective corners or floor pegs to protect it while sitting on the floor, I doubt it would stand on its own anyway, and it has enough padding in the sides to provide adequate protection for the contents.  One reviewer appeared to have an issue with inner pockets - mine came with a large pocket on one side that's the same width as the side and about 7.5" in depth.  On the other side is a pocket that's 9" in width and almost 9" in depth.  The interior fabric appears to be nylon or nylon-like.  Both pockets are large enough to hold ample related supplies.  I believe I could get an external keyboard in this thing if I wanted.  In addition there's a zippered exterior pocket that has a 10.5" usable opening with 6.5" depth in which I'm carrying a bag of accessories including a mini-mouse, a multi-usb adapter, and a couple other small accessories.  There's loads of room to spare.  The handles have some type of padding that makes it comfortable to carry.  The shoulder strap was packed in the larger internal pocket and appears sturdy and had a nicely over-sized and padded shoulder pad for comfort.  While the clips appear to be made of plastic, they are not unlike other strap clips I have used and I've never had a problem overloading them or having one break or even come unclipped accidentally.  Altogether, I'm very impressed with the bag.  It's just what I needed and has ample extra storage capability.  In any event, what's not to like about it for only about $17???  At that price I don't expect a top-end bag.  I'm only interested in a utilitarian bag that fits my oversized laptop and this fits the bill nicely.  I'm not even bothered by the small, rubber 'Amazon basics' branded logo in white/orange sewn above the exterior pocket.  Who cares that's its an Amazon basics bag?  If that bothered me I would have searched for a Vitton bag for $17!!
 I ordered this bag to have something for my small laptop computer. The material is light, but sturdy with lots of pockets and two main compartments with zippered access. The strap is sturdy and can be easily adjusted.<br/>I like the size and convenience of it also. Would recommend this for anyone! Great price too!
 First off, is this a really goid deal for the money.  Inside the rear zippered compartment there is actally three sleeves of different sizes. Why is that important?  If your are putting in a 7-8 inch tablet it should slide in and be nice and secure.  I have a 10.1" Acer Aspire One Switch that fits in one of those three sleeves securely.  The largest sleeve now holds my tablet's power adapter.<br/><br/>The other zippered compartment is adequate for whatever, but I wish it opened more down the side.  Two-three more inches per side would be better.  A deal breaker?  Absolutely not.<br/><br/>The front compartment is good enough to slide your boading pass in and maybe a smaller paperback.<br/><br/>Also has adjustable shoulder strap and a rear band that allows you to place the bag over the handle of your luggage.<br/><br/>I am happy with it and recommend to anyone wishing to get a good deal on an 11.6" laptop bag that appears well made.
 Perfect For My Needs!!!<br/><br/>I'm a pilot and I use this to store my iPad Air 2 for my Electronic Flight Bag. It fits the I Pad, Ram Mount Cradle (minus the mount and suction cups), spare battery (about 3/4"x4"), charging cable, and two paper checklists. The case bulges out with the Ram Mount Cradle and battery, but does fit nicely. I also use this case with my iPad for personal use when I go on road trips, or when I'm on an overnight and I want to bring my iPad to dinner. The handles make the bag easy to carry, vs some protectors that don't have handles.<br/><br/>I think most people that want a generic case to protect their iPad Air will be satisfied with this bag.
 Would not recommend this.  Could use more sturdy dividers and actual zippered interior compartments.  Without a zippered compartment inside the bag, there is no way to securely store small items inside the bag, such as a thumb drive or personal items.  Only positives is that external material appears to be tough and its really a cheap price.  However, as they say you get what you pay for.
 The bag is great for everything you need in a laptop holder. There's plenty of space and the bag is very well made.<br/><br/>However, the problem is the zipper for the main laptop compartment. One day I was looking at my laptop and a small stripe of the metal finish was scrapped off. This is a very expensive laptop so I was very mad. If you zip it up all the way to either side of the bag, the flat end of the zipper inside it will slide up and down against your laptop as you walk around with it. I'm guessing this only happens to laptops that have a metal or some kind of paint finish. Needless to say, I now zip it where it closes towards the middle.
 DON'T BUY this product. Today after one month of light use (I leave my computer at the office all week, so I basically use the bag Monday and Friday), the shoulder strap failed and my new computer fell into the parking lot floor, producing heavy damage to the aluminium case. This pruduct is unreliable, don't buy it.
 This is a great bag for the price.  I purchased for $15.99.  It's better than most higher priced bags.  It's roomy enough for my 17.3 inch laptop.  I was worried it might not fit.  There is plenty of cushion on the bottom and sides of this bag and has room to carry my extra mouse, 4 port USB hub and AC adaptor/charger without bulging.  There is definitely room for a few extra cd/dvd, a 5 x 8 note pad and pen/draft pencil.  I don't care that the zipper pulls or tags say "Amazon Basics".  Who cares?  Really, I want a bag that works and looks good, without paying for a name brand.  I'm happy with this purchase.
 After getting a new job in which I need to be more "dressy" I decided it was time to retire my old Fox brand backpack and bough this lap top bag. I felt this looks more professional and is cleaner. The fabric is sturdy and seem as though it will last a while. This bag is simple to clean if anything is spilled on it, the material does not stain easily. The compartments are large enough to fit my laptop, charger, mouse, and mouse pad without having to squish them in to zip it up. It is padded enough so that my laptop stays nice and safe. Great buy!
 Bought this as a gift for my brother. He called to let me know it was exactly what he needed. Looks professional and just the right amount of space for laptop, tablet, and bare necessities (pen, pad, and wires).  Goal was a practical bag but looked nice and NOT big &amp; bulky.  Nailed it!
 Meh, for the price it's alright. Seam on the inside ripped within a 2 days of very minimal use. I walk 2 blocks to work, i take this with me 3 days a week. It took just two trips to work for the seam to split inside. It's not a BIG deal, no, it doesn't impede the functionality at all. It does however speak to me about the build quality, and raises concerns about future use.
 Great bag for the low cost. You can fit a lot of stuff in this bag and that includes a 17" laptop. The pros are it's cheap and functional. The cons are it's a bit flimsy and doesn't offer a lot of padding for a laptop or tablet. Not much pen storage either so you'll have to tell yourself that you bought a bag for $17 and not to expect much. It can take a beating and still look good as it was used for work and ended up on the floor of every coffee shop I worked out of.
 Great bag. Use it everyday with my Lenovo Yoga Pro 2.<br/><br/>My Lenovo fits perfect in here. The front compartments are able to store my charging cable and a few other cables I have and I am able to zip it shut with no problem. The small front compartment I use to hold smaller cables USB cables.<br/><br/>I do not use the arm strap so I cannot really comment on that. The handles feel just fine in my hand and I do not feel worried about the ripping.<br/><br/>It does not have a ton of padding on the bottom. I don't consider this a con as I was expecting this. I don't slam or toss my laptop around. I wanted a simple bag that could carry around my light Ultrabook easily and this does just that.
 Hey guys! Real quick review here:<br/><br/>Pros<br/>-superb padding for laptop<br/>-fits 15.7 inch very nicely<br/>-handles at top are very useful<br/>-may pockets in main and secondary compartments<br/>-suitcase holder on back<br/>-subtle black<br/>-nice shoulder piece for moderate comfort<br/><br/>Cons<br/>-the logo and loud orange stitching<br/>-strap holders are hard plastic not metal<br/>-zippers are loud<br/><br/>Overall: this bag is absolutely wonderful. It provides this college student with adequate space for a laptop, books, wallet, pens, chargers, etc.
 I love Amazon Basics stuff and figured this cheap bag would be perfect as a stand in for some music charts once a week to drag to class with me rather than a full size briefcase.  Forget it.  This thing is small, cheap and sad imitation of a computer bag.  Too small for most anything significant.  If you want to put only one table in it, preferably a iPad Mini or smaller you might get by.  Want to add a small binder with a few sheets of paper in it ? Not happening.
 i got this as a secondary bag to transport my laptop to and from work. i set up a charger mouse at work and they stay there. i have a second larger bag that has everything i could need in it but that bag weighs a ton this bag is very light and small it makes my dayly laptop transport a breeze. i game on mmy lunch hour so my laptop is pretty big and this bag does a great job. i can put the charger in it if i wanted but it would be a tight fit. but for just transporting a laptop and some papers its great i am very happy with it. especialy at the price. did i mention its light. if your planning on carrying a bunch of stuff then this is probably not the bag you need. but its perfect for my use.
 I purchased this bag for my laptop while going back for college courses fornonline classes. It’s really great, has some light padding for protection, anfew lrgenpickets and it’s quite nicely made. I’ve had it for well over a year and carted it all over between work, the library, on trips and ya held up really well.
 I purchased this bag in April and am disappointed to say that it only lasted 7 months before it tore and I was no longer able to zip it completely. The styrofoam is sticking out, the threads from the torn fabric get caught in the zipper, and I'm extremely disappointed that I'm shopping for a new bag so quickly.  It looks spacious and is the right price but truly think twice before purchasing this laptop bag.
 Mixed feelings here. We bought this with the purchase of our Sylvania 13inch portable DVD player - because it was a recommended purchase to carry it in. WELL, do NOT buy it to carry your 13inch DVD player in - because it won't fit! Very disappointed with that.<br/>However, it's a nice little case. We actually use it for carrying files and documents when we go to appointments and such. And I'm sure it'd be great for carrying smaller DVD players.<br/>So, over all - we're happy with what we're using it for. But disappointed that it couldn't be used with the purchase of our 13inch DVD player. Even more frustrated that it was "recommended" to us. But, oh well - live and learn!
 Extremely nice case/bag. My HP 15 inch laptop fits perfectly. Nice to have the extra compartments for accessories, especially the various pockets to hold loose items. Not only is it a laptop bag, but a great briefcase, too. Now I only have to carry one item. Heavy duty material should last for years. Cost less than a fast food lunch. Great value.
 I got this to fit my 14" hp laptop into my motorcycle saddle bags.  it's hard to find a tight fitting bag that has just a little storage.  Lots of sleeves work, but I only had a little clearance beyond my laptop to fit.  The price is great too!  I am so pleased to be able to fit this in the saddle bag instead of strapping a larger bag or backpack on the rear seat.  Totally pleased.
 Not only is there room for my laptop, I can also add a mouse, my charger, at least two Xbox controllers, my earbuds and more. This purchase was a great decision that I have made. There is even a shoulder strap so you have extra hands for other objects that you need to move at the same time.
 I've been looking for a handle/carry case to take my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 to/from work.  I finally found a winner.  My Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is inside a Maxboost case, which both fit perfectly inside the case with room to spare.  I'm also able to fit my Kindle Keyboard housed in it's case along with the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 inside this AmazonBasics Netbook Bag.  Also, for a snugger fit by itself, I'm able to place my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 in it's Maxboost case inside a Vera Bradley padded tablet sleeve for added protection.  It all fits inside this AmazonBasics bag.<br/><br/>The AmazonBasics case is light weight, and I'm able to fit the handle over my wrist while carrying my lunch tote.  Perfect!  I only wish this case was offered in different colors besides black.  The outside zipper pocket is large enough to hold a charger, earbuds, and other items.  Hope this review helps.
 This 14" laptop bag fits Dell Latitude 7280 perfectly. I was looking for a compact bag to travel with just enough storage space to carry the essentials. I like that the bag has a strap for my travel luggage handle. I don't like how the shoulder strap D-ring on the bag sometimes flip upside down and squeezes the strap. Aside from that, the bag is a great value.
 Not much to say. This is sold as a basic bargain bag and that's what it is. No more, no less. We ordered them for some used laptops going to a non-profit agency. The laptops weren't leaving the office. Personally, I would only use this for bringing a laptop to and from the office, protection around the house, and light travel. I wouldn't use this bag for road warriors and heavy business use - but then, that's not who they are selling it to.
 I love this laptop bag.  I had bought a separate one prior to this purchase that I am not to thrilled about using since its too big for my needs.  This AmazonBasics bag is perfect for my Ipad Pro 12.9 inch.  You can also store many files, folders, and even add two additional laptops if necessary. This bag is not big and bulky or akward carrying.  Its like carrying a briefcase around.
 I use this for my Super Giant Print bible.  It also holds a Sunday school book, a three brad folder and my Samsung 10.1" tablet.  In the pouch up front, I keep my reading glasses and a good supply of wintergreen lifesavers.  It's great size and very durable design.  It is my genuine belief that any of these Amazon Basics bags would be great quality.  In fact, I've had great success with the whole family of Amazon Basics products, from HDMI cables, computer cables and now bags. Good deal, solid product.
 The bag is very lightweight and attractive in appearance. The little pockets in the front compartment do not have any kind of close mechanism and things can fall out if you’re not careful. This is the only issue I have with it and it’s minor. I have not encountered the strap issues other reviewers noted in the couple of months I’ve had it.
 I bought this laptop and tablet bag on 15.6 Inches because I wanted to just the right size. This well build bag have linen dividers inside and few zippers. Great construction.<br/><br/>01/02/2018 Update: unfortunately I had to change the star rating from 5 to 4 because the shoulder pad started to break after 1.5 weeks of use.
 Amazon logo is a little annoying, other than that it's a great bag for the price and holds more than you'd think it could. Strap is comfortable too and I don't see any issue with the clips coming loose like other reviewers have mentioned. Unsure about the durability but it feels well stitched together on the important parts, but the bottom of the bag is a bit thin and offers no protection if bag is dropped (though you could add something down there to absorb some drops)<br/><br/>(Review not written by above account name)
 Size is perfect for both MacBook and Dell XPS 15.  Pretty good pocket arrangement.  Not super well padded, so if dropped from more than a couple feet and you might see damage.  The material is fairly tough, but being a fabric it tends to pick up dirt and it's not too easy getting it looking clean again.
 When this arrived it in no way looked big enough to hold my laptop. Even after seeing my laptop fit inside multiple times, I still don't believe it. Obviously Amazon Basics is based on Gallifrey.<br/><br/>The bag itself is sturdy, well made, and has more pockets than an entire rack of cargo pants. Despite obviously being too small to fit my laptop, it fits my laptop, wireless mouse, Kindle Fire, power cords for both, notebook, pens, documents, assault rifle, magazines, space wheel for my truck, and an entire branch of RadioShack for emergencies. I've yet to find them, but I remain convinced that there is a library and swimming pool tucked away inside somewhere.<br/><br/>The only downside is the interior fabric, which feels a bit cheap and cheerful. Still, for the price, and for the fact that you could probably fit your entire wardrobe inside, this is a minor point.
 Works well. Great sizing for a 17" ASUS. I waited a bit to see how well it held up before writing this. I am happy to report that it is a sturdy well constructed bag with several convenient pockets. It will serve me well. My only issue is a desire for more padding in the bottom. If it had more, I would feel more comfortable with it's ability to protect. As it stands, I feel the need to be cautious when setting it down. Kudos to Amazon. This product has made me willing to buy more branded by you!
 I got this to use with my Epson projector which is pretty big (L: 13 , W: 10 , H: 4)<br/><br/>I can easily fit the projector, a few cables, and still have about 4 inches to spare in the height of the bag.<br/><br/>It cones very well padded and it makes carrying my projector less of a hastle, I highly recommend<br/><br/>PS: I got the 17.3 inch version
 Do not go by the cost of an item to determine the quality of workmanship.  To me, Amazon produces some very fine inexpensive items.  My wife uses the case for her Microsoft Surface Pro 3 which is a 12 inch tablet.  It has space for the tablet plus two side pockets ( one on each side of the Tablet).  There is also a zippered pocket on the outside of the case.  You could put padding in the inner pockets next to your Tablet for extra protection against possible bumps.  If your Tablet is very expensive then I would recommend the extra padding.  The case is very well made and is the usual high quality of AmazonBasics.  If you take reasonable care of the case will last for many years.
 This review is based on "what you get" for "what you pay". I have an almost identical clone to it from Briggs and Riley (which was over $100 as I recall.) The FIRST difference you notice is the weight when they're empty. This bag barely hangs from the straps because it's so light (which might be a selling point since why would you haul around an empty bag?) There isn't much in the way of dividers for business cards or pens etc, just three pouches. It's a perfect "second" bag for a tablet and a sketchbook. Not sure I'd trust it to hold a $1200 laptop; the padding on the bottom is pretty minimal.
 For the price it's a good laptop bag. As other reviews have mentioned, it does lack superior padding. Pretty thin padding, about as much protection as a thin cardboard box... would be surprised if a laptop survived being dropped in this bag.<br/>But again for under $20, decent purchase.
 After using it for a year I'm still pretty happy with it, especially for the price.<br/><br/>Pockets are great, carrying it is comfortable, perfect size for computer, notepad, small binder and file folders.<br/><br/>Two issues that bring down the rating are:<br/><br/>1) The pad that comes with the shoulder strap is falling apart after a year of medium use.<br/><br/>2) The plastic clips squeak as you walk. Not a big issue, but it feels awkward walking across a silent cubical farm.
 It easily fits my laptop and charger and random other things I throw into it. I used it as a personal item on a plane and it fit under the seat perfectly. I have my laptop in a cover and then in a padded sleeve and then in the bag because I got a new laptop and am paranoid about it breaking. It uses up most of the space to get all that padding but you can still fit a notebook or something if you want to. The shoulder pad has been ripping off since I got it but it didn't do much anyway so I'm happy with it as is
 Stunning quality, can't find a single flaw with this product.  Don't possess an 11" laptop for which this bag was designed but it holds my fat old iPad clad in its bulky Otterbox Defender case in the middle compartment with just enough play that I can draw the zipper closed around it without snag and gently nudge my lovely new Logitech Easy-Switch Keyboard into a sleeve in the larger main compartment. Enough room in the small pocket in front for phone, charger, cable, and wallet. Generous padding throughout so no worries. Padded shoulder strap alone is worth price of entry. Only wish Amazon made a larger assortment, a deeper one would make a great carry all/travel bag. But for my most "basic" needs, this one is poifect.
 Unsure how to rate this because I recieved the wrong product. Got a red laptop case that is not how it’s pictured. I’m sure it’s just a mistake.
 Fits my 17" laptop! Lots of pockets, inside and out. Has a handle to hook over extended luggage handle and comfy long shoulder strap with pad. My other 17" case is the size of a suitcase! This is much nicer for shorter trips.
 As a consultant for another bag company, I tend to be picky about my selection; however, I needed a simple, sturdy, inexpensive laptop bag--and that is exactly what you get with this bag. The material is extremely durable and easy to clean. The zipper closure and hoops for attaching the strap ends are strong and work smoothly. There are ample pockets for organizing your mouse, wallet, papers, phone, tablet, and laptop. Overall this is a great bag for great value.
 Love this case can carry my new iPad Air 2 and my old iPad mini with case both fit within the main<br/>compartment. Also has another compartment that I put my note 4 inside a,long with the cords, perfect!<br/>If you are buying this for a iPad without a case you will have lots of room and it will move around but still<br/>in my opinion be protected. The longer handles are perfect for me using a cane and walker to know get<br/>around this is wonderful For me. Will it last for ever probably not for the price for me I am very happy. Some people<br/>Say this smells, you are correct, after being opened for a few weeks I don't notice the smell<br/>Anymore just enjoy this case!!!!
 I don't use the bag to carry my laptop a long distance. For my purposes, it meets my needs. It has more than enough room and zipper compartments to store papers and a mouse. The laptop is cushioned enough to avoid damage from minor collisions. Secure at home when not in use.
 I wanted a protective travel bag for my husband's Samsung Note 10.1 that he could use if he ever needed to take it out of the house.  Since this was for my husband, I wanted to make sure that I picked an item that in no way resembled any type of purse.  This works nicely.  My husband keeps his Samsung Note 10.1 in the Samsung case.  I was worried that his tablet would not fit inside this bag with the cover on.  I was relieved when the item arrived and the tablet fits inside while in the Samsung case nicely.<br/><br/>The price is excellent.  The bag seems to be made well.  It really will not get a whole lot of use since we usually use our tablets at home and rarely take them anywhere but it is a nice item to have when those occasions come up.
 I have simply been on the look-out for a lightweight, simple carrying case for when I am taking my iPad out and about, and want a little more protection than its daily cover. I wanted to be able to fit it with its cover on (the Apple standard one) and not spend a lot of money for it. I thought this should be easy . . . . . well, it wasn't so easy. I love having the daily cover for my electronics be something great to look at, but just to transport it around, fashion wasn't worth it for me. Anyway, I stumbled on this great little carrycase, an Amazon "Basic", and it is perfect. My iPad slips in great with no extra bulk, and the best part is that my Kindle fits right into the front pouch. Now I can carry my two favorite pieces without worrying about them. I also think that the basic black may be a smarter choice for when you MUST leave your iPad in the car; it just doesn't draw as much attention. And in case you're wondering, the quality appears to be top-notch, also.
 This is a really nice case and it's perfect for my grandson's tablet. It also fits his Bluetooth headphones. And I can actually put his Grandpa's tablet in it too if we go someplace. An average size laptop won't fit in here though unless it's a real small one.
 I have had this laptop bag for going on 3 months now and it has really exceeded my expectations. For the price, a mere fraction of other bags, this is everything I wanted. It gives me ample room for cell phone chargers, laptop chargers, business cards, full laptop, notebook, pens, power bank, gum, laser pointer, and other odds and need for my job that requires significant travel out of the office.<br/><br/>It also looks great and feels well-made. All around I think one of my best amazon basics purchases.
 I absolutely love this travel case. I use it as kind of a man purse. Or a briefcase sounds better. I carry my I-Pad, charging cord, sunglasses, cell phone and other sundry items that I need on a daily basis. I have a concealed carry permit also and there is plenty of room for my weapon. Can’t say enough good about this product. Well made, quality material and lots of zippered pockets. I highly recommend.
 I bought this bag to fit my iPad mini and my wireless keyboard in it. I LOVE that it stretches! My keyboard and iPad both fit inside with PLENTY of room left over for maybe books or a mouse or whatever else you wanna put in there. I use the outside pocket to store the charging cords, extra batteries and a MiFi device.<br/><br/>I was concerned that my keyboard wasn't going to fit, the dimensions of the keyboard are: 11.2 x 0.2 x 4.7 inches and I had answered questions before I bought it and some said yes and some said no, but my specific keyboard fits good ONLY because the material stretches. The keyboard is just sliiiiightly bigger than the bag, but because the fabric is stretchy, it fits great and doesn't bulge out all weird.<br/><br/>Love this bag!
 I have used this bag daily on my bus commute for five years and it is good as new, save for a slight purpling/fading of the black material. Zippers &amp; handles take a beating and haven't failed. Thoughtful layout of compartments and pockets, just the right amount of pockets to organize without being too complex.
 Nice bag. My only complaint is that is needs more padding on the bottom for protecting a laptop, but overall its great. Has lots of space, and can even fit the amazon basics wired keyboard in shift (although it slightly stretched the ends a bit). Overall, this is a nice bag, and unless you want more bells and whistles, then go with this one. As someone who used to go through bags like crazy and tear them to shyte, I love this bag. I have a swiss gear 100 dollar backpack that I have been using for years, but needed a messenger bag for when I needed to take my laptops and tablets to an appointment and would be too bulky to carry my backpack. this is nice.
 Bag is decent size and fits my 15.6" laptop with the battery installed nice and snug. Don't expect a large amount of protection on the inside with the  separate sleeves. If you carry your power adapter I recommend carrying it in the outside pouch as I'm afraid it will rub the laptop when I'm traveling. Nice small size altogether and weighs next to nothing. Good all around bag for everyday use but I would recommend going with a more protective case for traveling needs myself. For the price its a hands down winner for sure.
 These are wonderful protection covers for my tablet, and netbook.  The stretch material allows me to toss in extras like a cord or other bitty things, and the front pocket allows even more bitty things.  They're getting a LOT of use and absolutely no signs of breaking down.  I use one for an ASUS Transformer.  Another for an Aspire Netbook.  A third one holds various other electronic pieces, a Kindle, etc.<br/><br/>Nov 2013 update:<br/>Still getting lots of use with no sign of wear/tear.  The handle is also very handy, by the way.  I noticed other covers with no handle and that would be not be nearly as useful to me.  Also there was no cutting corners with the zippers.  They're tough, and there is one on each side which makes it quicker and easier to open close no matter which end you've handled.
 Nice case, but a bit too thin for a 11.6 inch laptop. I got it for a Lenovo X131E which fits only after some effort due to its girth. The big pouch I use for the power plug and it too is too thin and has no give at all. Same with the accessory pouch -- a full size wireless mouse only just fits (I guess its crowded by the laptop and power plug). If I got this for a new chromebook or big tablet, it would have been OK (I think). The shoulder pad kinda sucks too, since the adjustment buckle has to slide into it which is also a very tight squeeze. But it was inexpensive and actually does work (with the extra effort). Hopefully its life won't be foreshortened with all the squeezing.
 Great case that protects my computer. Great for those who travel often or need a solid case for work or school. Detachable shoulder strap is a lifesaver when carrying multiple bags on the go. Plethora of pockets makes for easy storage of flashdrives, chargers, etc. Only complaint is one of the handles is already beginning to fray at the seam, but should be easy enough to fix
 I saw negative reviews on this product that it didn't have enough pockets or the padding was insufficient etc. Now that I have it myself those reviews are unbelievable. For this price the quality construction and amount of storage and the size are all absolutely fantastic. Geez, it's not leather. It is however basically durable and very attractive and there are dividers within the main compartment and a couple of outside zipper pouches. For a basic laptop case you can not do better than this for the price.
 This is a great case with plenty of room. I use it for my 10.5 cd player and my tablet. Comfortably compact with lots of padding, compartments, plus two more zippered compartments so there is more than enough room for the charger, dvd's and all misc. stuff.<br/>My only wish (thus the four stars) is that it would be available in colors other than black. All in all a great case for the price.
 Carrying a tablet and accessories around is easier with this. With a 7" tablet, it's easy to have things inside the bag itself with the device, but only if you're intent to be extremely careful. There's also a small area in the front that unzips for items such as charger, or small accessories like extra stylus, etc.<br/><br/> Don't expect it to do much protecting of the devices inside though, as it's essentially just a bag. It seems to be lined (thinly) with some sort of foam material. Devices with cases, and even inside folios (with a flip to cover/uncover the screen) are perfectly fine for a bag like this, but I'd never put something inside it that wasn't already protected.
 Got the 17.3 model. I was worried it might not fit the old 16.9" HP business laptop I'd bought the case for when I first saw the case out of box, but said 9-pound monster actually fits perfectly. Solidly constructed bag for the money, reasonably protective / well-padded, not a whole lot of room left over for much else besides the machine but that's not the point. There's plenty of room for a power supply brick, cables / flash drives, and maybe a spiral notebook or two in the middle pocket. Strap is comfortable on the shoulder. Based on this, in terms of value for money, I sure wish Amazon would get into making their own rebranded line of guitar gig bags.
 I purchased a combination of the Cosmos Sleeve + Logitech K810 + AmazonBasics 11.6" Laptop Case. The keyboard + sleeve fit perfectly in the laptop case in a discrete section (divided by fabric separator) in the main zippered storage area. I was able to fit my Note 8 in a leather case in the other discrete section of that storage area, while leaving the case shoulder strap in the middle. My USB charging cords and tablet stand go in the secondary zippered storage area and my Galaxy SIII, in its protective cover fits snugly in the tertiary zippered storage area. By having my devices properly organized and protected, I expect to save many tens of hours not having to search for lost/misplaced devices or worse, having to purchase a replacement.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have already commented on the quality of build and ergonomics of the AmazonBasics Case which is excellent.<br/><br/>To sum up, the AmazonBasics 11.6" Laptop/Case is an excellent value for $12.5. Highly recommended.
 Perfect for what I wanted to use it for.  Needed to be able to fit a thin (1/2 inch thick) standard 8 1/2 x 11 inch binder in and it does.  Construction seems good, and the compartments help keep things a little more organized.  The compartment for a tablet works great for mine.  I didn't want a huge case that would be too heavy with paperwork, this does the job for me and looks pretty good too.  Didn't need a ton of padding, this case has enough for my use.  Can't beat the price.  Would recommend it for anyone with a similar need.
 I ordered this as others have said because of so many 5 star reviews. It was packaged great and looked well made from the outside. The inside however is so noisy when trying to put anything inside the bag or when taking anything out.  It's like the padded lining is filled with that brown packing paper places use instead of packing peanuts and etc. now.<br/><br/>When taking things out of a bag like this, a purse or anything else similar I prefer to do so without bringing attention my way. It could just be me but if I went out anywhere with this bag I'd be a tad self conscious when putting anything in it or taking anything out which didn't do either of those things easily.
 I was looking for a replacement laptop carrier and this is perfect!  I was torn between purchasing an expensive bag but then decided on this one.  I am really glad I did!  It holds my 15" computer and a few folders which is exactly what I needed.  It also has a nice strap on the back to be able to slide on the handle of a suitcase.  I also really like the fact it has the strap to put over your shoulder and the hand straps.  I would recommend this product.
 Bought in the concept of AmazonBasics as presented by Amazon which value and function over hype.  Only the value and function was not built into this product.  Did not feel price met the value in this case.  Sent is back bought a used targus for $10, great buy.
 I purchased this laptop bag for my 11 inch MacBook Air.  I wanted a bag that would provide an adequate fit, meaning not so big that the laptop would slide around inside or so small it would be a tight fit to get the laptop in and out.  Also a bag that would provide adequate padding and protection while traveling and being subjected to typical bumps and bruises.  And finally a bag that was well constructed and would last for years to come.  I was concerned that given the lower price of this AmazonBasics bag and that it was not a more well known brand that it wouldn't measure up and provide the protection for my laptop.  Actually I was fairly skeptical.  However after having received it and having used it on several trips my verdict is that this laptop bag meets all of my requirements.  I am very pleased with the overall construction, the appearance, and the quality.  As far as the features you can read about them in the product description, I'll just say that if you are looking for a laptop bag this one should more than meet your needs.  Everything from the carrying strap to the zippers to the sewing of the material and the material itself says quality and durability.
 Already broken. Strap broke after a couple of uses.
 Perfect for my needs.  My 15" laptop fits perfectly, plus I even had room for the Officemate Slim Clipboard Storage Box, Charcoal (83303). There is also a handy internal pocket for files, and two other compartments for office supplies.<br/><br/>The material seems to be hardy and the workmanship is fine.<br/><br/>The only thing that would have made it better would have been an additional pocket on the backside.
 Nice bag. I got it for my new ipad pro 12.9 3rd gen and it fits. I used the Fentie composition book case on it and it does in the bag. Wish it had more padding around the perimeter of the bag for more edge protection on my device. Im most likely going to get a new strap that I won't have to worry about coming off like the reviews say. I hope it's durable, but I have no plans on using it to beat a rock with it.
 I bought this bag for my iPad mini, my scientific calculator, and some pens and pencils. All of it fits in there with room to spare and it’s the perfect size for carrying to school, putting in my book bag for air travel, etc. I love the fabric. The zippers feel like good quality. I’ve had it for a little while and no complaints! Definitely recommend.
 The 14-inch laptop bag was a perfect size for my Macbook pro 13inch retina late 2015 because I keep it in a semi hard case for protection called "Unik" that semi hard case fits PERFECTLY in the bag and adds extra protection. So if you want another bag, just make sure the internal dimensions match this AmazonBasics bag. I can already see that the hooks on the straps and the ring you hook them in are plastic and will probably not last long. That's the only downside.
 *So far I've been very happy with every Amazon Basics product I have purchased and this case is no exception. I bought the 11.5" case for my Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 and it's a really nice fit. It also has plenty of room for a full sized bluetooth keyboard and pockets for a bluetooth mouse, five port charger, two styli, all my cables, paper tablet, pens and pencils, and anything else I my need. It seems to be a very well made, rugged, well thought out design. A real little workhorse of a case. I don't see how anyone could complain, especially at this price. It's just as nice if not better than anything available locally. Trust Amazon!
 Like any other AmazonBasics, don't expect frills with this case.  It is just a mean tough nylon computer case, well built and stitched.  The case is not heavy at all, at 1.1 lb, so my ultralight is still an ultralight.<br/>The only thing is that I would suggest to add padding around the edges (not the large 2 sides, but just the small ones and the edges).  My laptop did chip a corner inside this case when it fell off my hand once.<br/>My laptop is a 14" ultralight, but I bought this 17.3" size when I buy a much larger and powerful one.  The extra space was unexpectedly useful, though.
 I was surprised and pleased at the quality of the bag I received. I did read some very negative reviews, and it is not necessarily the case that they are wrong, given the number of the. Rather, companies like Amazon or Target which do not have manufacturing facilities create specs and submit them to other firms (usually in China these days) for bids. They do not necessarily put in details such as zipper quality. I will revise my review if the bag shows an inappropriate decline in quality over time, but for now, I am enjoying having a thickly-padded bag with three full-length zippered compartments and a multitude of pockets to corral my laptop, tablet, and peripherals.
 I bought the 11.6" and it fits my Dell XPS 13 (2015 model) perfect. I also tried fitting an iPad along with it and it is still roomy enough.<br/>There is adequate padding on all four sides to support bumps and possible a short fall. The thinnest padding is on the sides but it is still good enough to protect your laptop.<br/><br/>It does have a strap on the back for you to slide over your rollaboard/carry-on handle. However, if your bag's handle width is greater than 7" wide, it will not fit. Go measure it if this is important to you. I removed the stitching on the strap which gave me more room to work with. I have a Luggageworks 22" Stealth bag and the handle was too wide for this 11.6" bag.<br/><br/>Overall, a great buy and highly recommend it.
 Not a lot of cushion and padding, but perfect for my use, I would be hesitant using as luggage at the airport, but since I do not fly, it is enough for my uses, in the car and home storage, plenty of space and pockets for accessories, heavy duty zippers, strong handle, should work for most uses...
 This is the generic (Amazon brand) version of a bag I have for another of my laptops. It's a bit bulky, and it's missing the wide pocket I like on other bags, but it's good quality and certainly an excellent price. I recommend it for carrying full-size laptops from place to place.
 I ordered this as a case for my ASUS 12" chromebook, it fits great with plenty of room left to hold my Ipad 2 in it's silicone sleeve, both chargers and cables, and assorted other small things. This bag is terrific!
 While I still use this every day, I am very disappointed in the space it has to offer. My 15.6 inch laptop barely fits in the large section. With the laptop in I can no longer fit other documents of files in the large section. I just have use of the two smaller front pockets for cables, pens, etc..
 Happy Happy:  Appears well made, plenty of storage options.  I got a bigger size to store my tablet, Kindle, electronic stuff, and papers when we travel. I would have room for a laptop too if I had one. 3 separate zippered areas help the organization.  Can't go wrong with the price either!<br/><br/>That said:  2 minor drawbacks:  no business card holder (can't see at a glance its your bag), and the pad on the shoulder strap is a bit big and curved (shaped kind of like a banana), but you can easily swap out to any other strap you like, or you can just remove the strap pad.
 Great affordable option for carrying around your computer. I have a Dell Inspiron 11 series that I use for seminars, meetings, and keeping up on research. The computer fits perfectly along with the charger in the front pocket, pens, USB cable (to charge phone), wireless mouse, and presentation clicker in the middle organizer pocket. I even have room for a legal pad to fit in with the computer. The bag seems well made and time will tell. My son has a smaller version for his school-issued I-pad mini, and it has held up perfectly. I have always had good luck with Amazon products, and have recommended this to my department heads as a great bag to issue with new laptops.
 I have a Chromebook that I tote around simply for casual use, and this bag is perfect. It seems very well made with good padding and good straps/zippers. I'm giving it 4 stars since I've only had it a month,  so I can't vouch for the long term durability.
 I needed a bag for a new, larger laptop. Many bags are available on Amazon, and quite a few at a considerably higher price than this one. The AmazonBasics bag had good reviews, so I decided to order one, and am very satisfied. Not only does the laptop fit well, there is ample room for lots of other things: interior pockets to store folders (so I can keep all the related paperwork in one place for easy access instead of hunting for it a year done the road), room for the charger and other equipment, and a large outside zippered pocket. The case is nicely padded and has sturdy handles and an adjustable shoulder strap. This bag is a great value.
 got it as a gift for friend and he's very pleased with it. I wanted a bag that had room for his tablet and other items that he carries so that all he had to hold by hand were the bag handles.  nice size, compartments, cool bag!!!  I feel confident when I purchase anything made by Amazon.  I love their products and the way they stand by them.
 This is an excellent option for someone that doesn't need a super tough case.  I don't take my laptop with me everyday, so I did not feel the need for one of the much more expensive bags. This bag is made well and serves my needs. I have ordered other Amazon Basics products and found them all to be satisfactory, value products.
 It does the trick and was priced right. I have a large HP laptop that doesn't leave the house often...and, when it does I don't shove tons of other stuff in the bag with it. I need SOMETHING to carry the laptop out of the house - it doesn't have to be a lifetime purchase. I did see other buyers disliked the clip and other hardware.
 My seven year old son just started cyber school this year. He was given a laptop, but no case. We needed something inexpensive to suit his needs, but sturdy enough to protect the laptop. This case could not be more perfect. His 15" laptop, power cord, headset and wireless mouse fit in it like this bag was designed specifically for them. There is enough room for some folders and pencils, as well. He loves the look of the case and feels very cool carrying it around. I am please with the quality of the bag and it looks like it will hold up through years of use. Fantastic basic, but well made, product for those on a budget or needing something for a child.
 This is simple but durable and just what I needed. There are two zippered pockets in the front, one with two pen slots and three cellphone-sized slots. The main part has a slot on each side, one fits papers or files and the other fits a tablet or kindle. You can carry it by the handles or adjustable strap. My 17-inch laptop fits perfectly, along with files and the charger.
 When I recently purchased a new laptop, I discovered it was too big for my current case so I logged on to Amazon (naturally) to search for a bigger one. That's when I discovered this one. The description met all of my expectations. It was large enough and had ample storage. As the name suggests, it is "basic", and for me that's just fine. I'm not trying to impress anyone. What I want is something that will protect my laptop and provide sufficient storage. This case does just that. A reviewer mentioned that the only thing he didn't like was the lack of a shoulder strap. Guess what. Amazon listened. It now comes with one!
 As I buy more and more AmazonBasics products, the more I appreciate the product line. As with everything else that I've bought from them, it's simple, well made, cheap and interesting. While this case is very simple, it does have the feeling of being high quality with good construction and materials, a heavy duty zipper with rubberized tabs and a bright orange lining to make it interesting.<br/><br/>I purchased mine to hold my dell venue 8 pro, and while it is a bit large for such a small tablet, it does have lots of room for accessories. If I had to nitpick, I would suggest having the front pocket separated to give more separated storage, but for a small tablet, one pocket works for most times I carry it.
 Bought this to use in combination with : <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Evecase-Dell-Inspiron-11-3000-Sleeve-Premium-Neoprene-Sleeve-Case-Travel-Carrying-Storage-Computer-Bag-for-Dell-Inspiron-11-3000-i3148-6840sLV-i3147-3750sLV-i3137-5003sLV-3751sLV-11-6-Inch-2-in-1-Convertible-Touchscreen-Laptop-Ulrtabook-Black/dp/B00EN89Y7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Evecase Dell Inspiron 11 3000 Sleeve, Premium Neoprene Sleeve Case Travel Carrying Storage Computer Bag for Dell Inspiron 11 3000 i3148-6840sLV/ i3147-3750sLV / i3137-5003sLV, 3751sLV 11.6-Inch 2 in 1 Convertible Touchscreen Laptop Ulrtabook (Black)</a><br/>Perfect combination for carrying and protecting the Inspiron 11 2 in 1 ( 11.6").

 I read the recent reviews and it all looked great but again you pay for you get and not even within the first week this bag held up. I didn't even put my work laptop in it most time, only used it for documents and pens. One of the inner liner pocket seams split open and the threading came undone. I am no longer going to buy any products that will display the amazon logo. They are too cheaply made, probably from under age kids making only penny profits. Returning!!
 I am a PTA student. I purchased this bag for storing and carrying my equipment. Everything fits perfectly into this bag! I like the long shoulder strap--it allows me to wear the bag across my body so as to free up both of my hands. I also like that there are multiple compartments in the bag, and pockets on the inside. Easy to organize my stuff!
 This case has protected my Lenovo Thinkpad almost everyday for two school years. It has 2 inside pockets, which I use to store a mouse and charger, as well as zip pockets on the the outside. This case is lightweight and compact enough to fit in my average sized backpack even when I have other books in there. Sometimes, I forget that my laptop is in my backpack, so I haphazardly throw the backpack on the ground or kick it around, and yet, my laptop is still unharmed within the case.
 This is a very nice bag (surprisingly so, given its low price), and works perfectly to contain the <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Pelican-1070CC-Carrying-Case-for-13-34-Notebook-Black-1070-023-110/dp/B00DGHSUB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pelican 1070CC Carrying Case for 13" Notebook - Black 1070-023-110</a> in which I lock up my 13" MacBook Pro. The Pelican provides a very secure way to travel with the MBP (which has no Kensington lock slot) but contains only the MBP, but using the AmazonBasics bag allows me to carry power brick and cord, adapters, extension cord, MiFi hot spot, mouse, and disk drive, with room left over for other odd items. It appears to be very well-made, so I hope it will last for years.
 I use it for school.<br/><br/>whats really nice about it is the many pockets it actually has, although sorta flimsy, it kind of feels like its plastiky from the interior.<br/>the pockets have yet broken with heavy usage.<br/><br/>I do actually fill this bag than is actually recommended. I have a surface pro (1st gen) with power cover, a nomad 13 solar panel, a Sherpa 50, (both of those from goal zero if anyone's wondering), plenty of USB cables and a few chargers plus some school papers, of course. that would technically add some bulk to the bag but this thing does handle pretty well for being such a small bag.<br/><br/>Overall, for the price i really like it!
 It came in the other day and was what I expected. It is a nice soft case for my laptop.<br/>Be aware that this is not a hard-shell case. It will NOT PROTECT your laptop IF YOU BANG IT AROUND! No soft case will....<br/><br/>If you want a soft case for your laptop, then this should do nicely.
 I've bought several tablet/laptop cases from Amazon Basics and they work fine. I'm not out to see how much abuse my laptop case can take -- some people are just brutal/abusive/careless with them and then post "they suck" but not me. Good daily carriers for my Surface / MacAir / reg. laptop in general, though this one was a Secret Santa thing.
 I just bought my first laptop, so I spent a lot of time look for a carrying case for it. I was willing to spend more money, up to $35 or $40, but this was the best bag I saw for the price. I am amazed at the quality for the price, and while it's not leather or cloth, it is definitely built well. The only bad thing is that the bottom isn't padded, so I will roll up a towel to put padding on the bottom where the laptop rests. The interior is a light grey color, so it is easy to find things, and there are lots of pockets for cords and other accessories. I will also be able to fit my kindle in it, so all is well in my electronic world. This is an excellent buy!
 It's a great back for a laptop small than 11.6 Should be perfect for anything under 11. But 11 will be cutting it short.<br/>I got this for a Lenovo Flex 3 11.6 inch.  The bag is of great quality no doubt. It was just too small.<br/>The laptop fit snug and I could only get 2 pens, the laptop and 1 small notepad in there and that's it,  I couldn't fit the charger in the bag with the laptop... I feared that my machine could get damaged.  But hey it was worth a shot...<br/><br/>Using my CaseCrown bag now.
 I originally purchased this product last year and, as an extensive business traveler with a slimmed down laptop, this case works perfect for me. I also love the lightweight design and the zippers work excellent for being an inexpensive bag. On my original bag, one of the handles broke, to which I was noticeably upset by this. However, after contacting amazon on the web via their warranty detail in the "Your Orders" section of their site, they shipped me a new bag and I returned the old bag upon arrival and it could not have been easier. I don't expect companies to make flawless products, especially at this price, but to know Amazon stands behind their products provides a sense of relief and appreciation for how Amazon operates. Would buy it again and I did and still do recommend it to all of my colleagues.
 Great little bag for the price. Pockets and compartments are well sized and placed. Seems pretty tough too. In the main pocket there's a spot for a netbook/tablet, a pocket for a folder, and a pocket that would fit a standard paperback book. The smaller compartment will hold pens, business cards, power cord and mouse for your notebook, etc. Then the smallest compartment would be good for keys, an altoid tin, headphones, etc. Can't go wrong for the price. The back of the bag has a strap that enables you to slip this over your carry on handle for hands free movement around the airport.
 The size is best for a 10.1" tablet.  Smaller items will seem like they have been swallowed up.  I bought 3 for my Windows tablets.  The bag cushions the tablets adequately when they are stacked together, which is why I wanted them.  Pull tabs seem nice and sturdy.  Handles feel good, but not obviously double-reinforced.  I'll see if I can give an update after a year.  The pouch will accommodate an 8 1/2 x 11" paper folded in half and should take most accessories, which is the other main reason I selected this bag.  Strap loops would be nice, but remember you are only paying $10 for a great bag!
 I've had the same rolling bag that I bought 10 years ago for 200.00. It's still great but I am tired of rolling that and my suitcase on business trips. I needed something light that could just attach to my suitcase and then carry across my shoulders after I check my bag. I put it to the test and it is great.
 I love this bag! This thing is so well made, I could probably carry around multiple bowling balls in it! But you will want it for your laptop. I got a new laptop and needed something to carry and store it in. Along comes Amazon Basics. What a really well made bag! It looks nice and the quality of the cuttings and stitching are very obvious. Plenty of room is available for all your extras, papers, pens, pencils, mouse, track ball, power supply, that little gift for your sweetheart. It all fits in here. You will like this bag, maybe even more that I do.
 Nice bag that replaces another one the same.  It holds a lot, aside from my laptop, like folders, and flash drives that I use for school.  I ordered another bag because the 1st one started to fray on the shoulder after about a year.  I can still use it, but I figured I'd order a new one for the coming school year plus, its not expensive so I thought I'd replace the first one.
 I was worried because the bag was so inexpensive, but it's fantastic.  I've had it about 6 months now and it is incredibly sturdy and durable.  I carry 2 external hard drives, a 15" laptop, and my iPad in mine with no problems.  The padding on the should strap is very nice as well; I would highly recommend the product.
 I love these little bags. I use them almost exclusively to hold external 5.25' drive bays with all the cables, power bricks and accessories. I have 2 of them and would buy more if I needed. The construction on these is pretty good for what they cost and they have held up for years.
 Simply put, this bag is an excellent value.  I use the bag with my Acer C720 Chromebook when I have to travel, and it's perfect because it has plenty of space for my charging brick and cords  There's also room for my Icon uDAC 3/headphone amp, my Koss PortaPros, and even a travel mouse.  The bag is made very well and while I don't feel it would offer serious protection from drops or things being knocked against it it is a great way to haul around my computer  I am extremely glad I didn't spend a lot of extra cash on a more "name-brand" bag.
 After purchasing a new laptop, I wanted to make sure I could transport it and store it while keeping it safe and secure. I figured to I would go the budget route and pick up this case, after seeing all of the reviews and positive feedback. Everything from the simple packaging to the surprising quality, it was the best choice for me.<br/><br/>Opening up the main pocket, you've got two pockets facing each other, plus a larger area in between. It comes complete with multiple pockets for all of the accessories and peripherals you can stuff in it, and it has a very rugged, well built feel to it. Some have complained about the Amazon logos adorning it, but to be honest, if they keep putting out budget friendly, sturdy items, I will continue to purchase those specifically.
 Perfect bag for my nexus 7 and accessories!  This bag has everything you need, several compartments, pockets a plenty and is of great durable quality.  I'm finally reviewing this after owning it for over a year and this bag is still in great condition without any tears or rips.  Perfect for flying also, perfect small size for a small netbook or tablet.  Holds everything and anything you need along with it.  Great price too! I'm a believe in AmazonBasics line of products.  Everything is just a great price and value.  Highly recommended!
 I have a nice leather case for my Note that provides some protection and allows easy access to the stylus, but I wanted a bit more protection for the corners and ability to carry the charger.  My tablet with case fits perfectly in this Netbook bag and the pouch on the front is large enough that it holds the charger without putting pressure on the tablet inside.<br/> I like that it has double zippers for the top opening and the case unzips not only at the top but also down 2 inches on each side, making it easy to put the tablet in and get it out.  I also like the fact that the inside of the bag is dayglow orange...makes a somewhat dull black bag have a bit more pizazz.  Highly recommend.<br/>Note: if you want something for carrying a Note 10.1 without a case, this bag is a little on the large side but would still be ok.
 It's relatively thin and plush. This is by no means a shock absorber, but you shouldn't be in the market for a neoprene sleeve if you're looking for drop protection.<br/><br/>It's nice and spacious. My Surface Pro fits with plenty of space left over in the main compartment. In fact, it's big enough to fit a 10'' ultrabook (which are only a little thicker than the Surface Pro). The front pocket lays relatively flat when not in use, but can hold a surprising amount. Enough for all my accessories. I thought the handles were a bit excessive,but I found myself actually using them from time to time. I'm pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a sleeve/neoprene bag.
 This ipad bag is great. My ipad is 9 1/2 x 7 and it fits good with a little room. The conpartments are handy, i can put my ipad in one and writing tablet paper 6x9 in the other. In front pockets i have a small 3x5 memo book in one pocket, pen and penciles in another. Them pockets are handy. I look up things on line and i carry pencles and paper and etc to write trhings down.It is ruged, sturdy put together well. I find no falt with it.
 Super purchase . This bag is well made, great fabric, holds laptop, mouse and cord with no difficulty . It is light weight , sturdy but not bulky . It seems to be water resistant , keeps my laptop safe from rain . My only negative is the color, I wish there were other choices .
 This ;laptop was a gift for my daughter who foes not live with me.  She says it ooks nice, but she has no idea of how to use it.  It came with NO documentation - not even an intro "quick start.  There was NO paper accompanying the machine.  Poor form on your part.<br/>Gerrold Adler.
 Love this bag for my 14.1" Dell. It's actually my work computer - I used to lug around a 17" heavy beast of a laptop with a bulky bag. This baby is made of great material, packs light, has the option to sling it over your shoulder or (more likely) carry it by a couple of simple handles, and has enough pockets to hold your plug, mouse and other accessories comfortably - moreso than I'd expected compared to other similar "sleeves+" I've used in the past. Good protection and very convenient. Simple. Great case.
 Good quality. I like the compartments, zippers, material, etc. I do wish the clasps were not plastic though. Its good for a tablet and a couple folders but I would not put a laptop in it because of the weight. As pictured, it shows that it stands up on its own, it does not. That was my biggest disappointment, its too narrow on the bottom to stand up on its own.<br/><br/>+Good quality and use of the size.<br/>-plastic clasps<br/>-doesn't stand up on its own
 Bought this for my new 15" laptop.  Laptop  fits snugly and appears well protected from padding in sides of bag.  I also like the  zippered pocket for my mouse and charger.  It has a strap so it can be carried on my shoulder.  Very pleased with this purchase!
 I bought this for my grand-daughter who has a laptop and a drawing tablet accessory. She is able to carry her cables and drawing utensils and it keeps everything neatly within reach. It has a removable shoulder strap for extra safety in carrying and it looks nice.  She's 13 and didn't want anything too childish. This suits her just fine.
 Just the right size for my Surface Pro 2 &amp; power cord, mouse, usb port.  But, I wish all three zipper pull tabs did not have "Amazon Basics" prominently written in white and orange type on both sides of all three tabs.  And I would prefer an all black bag without the orange interior.  But, this was the best sized bag with handles I could find for my Surface Pro 2.
 A good small laptop bag that can also hold plenty of junk. The side pockets inside are not deep enough to hold pens, and all of the zippers are quite sloppy, i.e. they're very loose. It does the job. My preference is for stronger zippers.
 This bag is exactly what I needed. Using it as both a daily carry bag and a travel case for airline flights. Works very well and has been very sturdy. No problems with the handle or straps coming off despite hauling it through airports and train stations.<br/>Some reviews make it seem like there is no padding in the corners. The padding wraps all the way around the bottom.<br/><br/>Using with a Surface 3 tablet - it's the perfect size. Also carry mini mouse and video adapter for presentations.
 For the price of this product, it's absolutely worth it. Not only can I carry my 13 inch macbook pro but I can also fit in a few pads of paper, my charger in the front, pencils, pens, a calculator, my phone charger, and my kindle. I've had it for a while and use it every day. There is currently no damage or zipper problems. I don't use the shoulder strap because I haven't found a need to. You won't look like a hot shot professional but it looks more professional than a backpack and it gets the job done.
 Pros: Seems well made, looks like it would last.<br/><br/>Cons: 17.3" laptop only fits in the center pocket. This means that two corners of the laptop will be up against the zipper, with zero padding to protect it. There is no padding that overlaps with the zipper, so the laptop's corners ride on bare metal. As this bag will be protecting a fairly expensive laptop, the wear against the metal zipper and the lack of proper padded protection defeats the purpose of a laptop bag.<br/><br/>We will be returning this product.
 I bought these for my 2 sons and could not possibly be more pleased. I read the reviews on Amazon prior to purchasing and decided it was worth trying. These bags were surprisingly very cushioning and look as though they might last a while. I was not expecting much due to the low price but you definitely get yours money's worth and will not be disappointed. In fact, I spent twice as much on my laptop bag and it is no where near as cushiony. My sons' laptops are each 13.3" and I purchased the 15.6 inch bags which gave them plenty of room for their kindles and charges. There is also a pocket inside that would fit a tablet.
 Seems sturdy and has lots of compartments for storage.  I bought a larger size for my 15" laptop and am glad to have the extra room.  Material is nice and the price is great.  Wish it came in cool colors, but otherwise it's a win!
 For the money, an absolute bargain.  High quality, compact and perfect for a 11.6 tablet or netbook.  Has two side pouches and the center<br/>pouch has two dividers.  Also comes with a shoulder strap.  One of the side pouches has additional pouches which are perfect for storing a slim bluetooth mouse (B&amp;N makes a great one) and the other for usb drives and bluetooth headset.<br/><br/>If I had know about this earlier, I would have bought a bunch for gifts this past Christmas.<br/><br/>Perfect mouse for this case <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/B-N-Wireless-Bluetooth-Mouse-Ergonomic-Optical-Mouse-for-Tablet-Laptop-PC-Black/dp/B00JEYQI8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">B&amp;N Wireless Bluetooth Mouse, Ergonomic Optical Mouse for Tablet / Laptop / PC - Black</a>
 Perfect!  Fits my new 15.6 inch laptop and has plenty of room for charging cord, converter, and cordless mouse with pad.  Am sure I could put more things into this spacious case.  It appears to be well made, in addition.  The price was VERY reasonable, as well!
 The is my everyday ManBag. Usually it holds an Amazon Fire 8.9" Kindle tablet and my everyday stuff. I keep a pair of headphones &amp; an AC USB charger with a 10" cable, spare Samsung phone batteries, biz cards, pen, a few pics of the grandkids in case of Pulse Bomb attack, etc. That kind of stuff.<br/><br/>The tablet fits in the internal side pouch and I toss my reading &amp; sunglasses in &amp; on occasion, a point &amp; shoot camera. Still enough room for things I need to pickup, documents, a water bottle, etc. 8 1/2 x 11 sheets need to be folded, so this is not my bag for serious business meetings. I have larger bags for those times.
 Arrived on time in good condition. Fits the laptop. has adequate storage for accessories.  Has multiple handles and straps for carrying over the shoulder or in hand. Appears to be made of durable material and is of quality construction. I carried my laptop across the conntry in the trunk of my car and used it every day.  No complainta.
 This product did not fulfill my needs for a laptop bag, however, Amazon's amazing customer service and the value of the bag still merit 5 stars.<br/>I have started to hate carrying all of my books around my university everywhere with me, so I have began using a locker instead. I used this bag daily for about a month and a half to carry my laptop, charger, lunch, and a book or two. The bag did fail (at the shoulder straps), but I realize that the bag wasn't intended to be as heavy duty as the load I was putting on it. I spoke to Amazon's customer service and they were very understanding and issued a refund within minutes.<br/>If you are looking to load down this bag, I would recommend buying another product. If you are looking for a stylish and durable bag for just a laptop and maybe a notebook, this will certainly fit your needs.
 Great laptop case at an even better price! I can fit my 17” laptop, my 9.5 iPad and my 8” Kindle Fire tablet in this case and there is still room enough that I could throw in a few travel brochures with no problem. I like it so much I ordered a second one for my hubs to use.
 This would be a five star winner if not for the very poor quality stitching on the shoulder strap's 'cushion pad.'  The threads were already unraveling when I opened the package.<br/><br/>The good news is that this case looks like a much more expensive case and I do not hesitate to bring it to every meeting I attend for work.  The unraveling threads are only visible up close.<br/><br/>My mini-iPad fits comfortably with my Bluetooth keyboard in the center section.  I also use that area for a folder to store the paperwork I need for meetings.  There is room for my charger in one of the side pockets and I use the larger side pocket for notebook, business cards, pens, and flash drives.<br/><br/>If Amazon could fix the stitching this would have been a definite five star review.
 I've gotten several compliments on this laptop bag. I use it daily and work on forklifts in warehouses and out in the elements. It is holding up nicely and seems better than others I considered purchasing for 3 times the price.
 have had 2 sizes tables and they both fit in this bag with room for storing other components like thumb drives, cables, etc.  the front pocket is great for storing my phone cables, phone, and transportable WiFi unit.  Made very well and not bulky at all.
 This replaced a bag I bought Amazon six months ago, supposedly a closeout at a terrific price.  If this had been available then, I would have bought it.  The difference is astounding.  For sure, when Amazon puts something out as an AmazonBasics, you can be sure that you are getting a quality product.  This one is first-class, from the material, to the stiching, to the length of the shoulder strap, to the movable shoulder pad, to the zippers, etc.
 I required a soft-sided compact briefcase for carrying several 8.5"x11" documents and could also carry a Kindle Paperwhite and a compact mp3 player with a mini portable speaker for small Bible study and evangelization meetings. This bag proved perfect for my needs. It's a quality constructed bargain and I'm quite well pleased with it. AmazonBasics products usually satisfy quite well.
 I want to love this bag - it fits an iPad, headphones (bigger ones not simply earbuds), iPod shuffle, and still has room for more. It's pretty durable and easy for the kids to pack up and carry. The only bad thing, and this seems to have gotten worse instead of better, is that the neoprene puts off an awful smell. I have a lunch bag made of the stuff and it's not an issue. I don't know what it is about this bag but both kids say they feel sick if their bag is too close to them for too long.
 Great for the money. Like most buyers I was skeptical. "This thing is 12 bucks, it can't be that good." But, when I got it I was surprised. It has three pockets. It has one for small devices (I put my iPod inside), one for bigger devices, and the main one for a laptop or iPad. It has plenty of padding to protect your electronic devices. I read some reviews on how some people were not satisfied with the padding on the corner, but it is fully adequate. Another thing, the Amazon basic logo is not gaudy and not very noticeable. This is one thing that I was worried about but the name is black on the zippers so you cannot see it and the name on the bag is small and not really noticable. Hope this helps the sceptics. I tried to answer all the questions I asked myself
 I have had this bag for a few years now and it has held up wonderfully to daily hard use. The bag is still intact and works great. The only issue I had is that the amazon logo on the front fell off a couple of years ago but thats it. Solid budget choice.
 I waited a while before posting this review because I wanted to see how well this bag held up to the "ware and tare".<br/>I have had the bag for a few months now and it has no issues at all.  I use the bad daily (travel...) and it has held up very well so far.  I have to admit, I thought for sure this bag would start to tear or the zipper would break or something...  So far so good!<br/>For the price, I am very happy with this bag!
 Overall liked the size and look of this bag, and the low, low price. One of the first things I did after purchasing this was cut off the Amazon logo, because it is embarassing. Unfortunately the zipper pulls on the laptop bag compartment fell apart after about four months of use. So I threw the bag in the garbage after only using it for a short while. I am not really angry about this because the price was so low, but I won't buy another one of these again.<br/><br/>Today I went ahead and purchased a small Case Logic bag for about $3 more than this Amazon bag. I hope it lasts longer.
 We ordered this case on Amazon for my Acer Chromebook, I love it! My Acer Chromebook fits in the case will good I would buy this case again it got here will fast it was in the same package with my Acer Chromebook it was brand new I love it I gave it 5 stars because it is easy to use plus I can take it on a  air plane, train, or even a car when ever I travel I will use my case again and again best lap top case ever!!!
 I'm not a fan of the bag tipping over toward the front pockets all time, whether the bag is empty or not. The inside pockets also always get in the way when I'm trying to put my laptop in the bag and that is really annoying. Other than those annoying issues I feel that it is a solid bag.
 On the plus side, it is big enough to hold my laptop and a laptop cooler.  Pocket on the outside holds the charger, and the inner pockets all my accessories (although I wish they were zippered).<br/><br/>The downside to there being plenty of room inside is that there is less padding than I was hoping for.  Fortunately, I do not travel (nor get out of my house) much :)<br/><br/>The two zipper do-dads on the case do not have holes to put a lock through, and I feel they should.<br/><br/>Overall, I dont totally regret the purchase, but I should have saved up for something better like a backpack.
 Purchased for a 12" Macbook. For less than $14, it's quite a deal.  The padding in the main compartment is sufficient to protect the laptop from dings and scratches.  The outside pockets are roomy enough to store a charger, cables, a couple of USB-C adapters, and even more.  The quality of the materials used and the overall construction are very good.  Hard to find much fault in this "basic" bag.
 This has been a great laptop case for the price. I have used it with a 15' laptop and now with my Surface Pro 4. The 15' Lenovo fit well and was snug in the bag. The bag still works with my Surface but is not necessarily built for the Surface. There is plenty of extra room when carrying my Surface so I am able to carry extra papers and manilla folders which works well for me and adds a little extra padding for the Surface. Bag has plenty of pockets and extra storage compartments. Great bag, great durability, great price
 I ordered this Amazon Basics 11.6" Laptop case thinking it was 'basic', but it's honestly a winner! The Lenovo 11.6" Thinkpad X131 fits great, it has enough padding in all the right places, and it's TSA approved.<br/> For years I would get a company laptop- only to have a 'laptop-brand' bag because no one offered a better alternative. These AmazonBasic bags are top-notch, great stitching and a great value all around.<br/> I'd highly recommend anyone needing a Quality Bag for their Laptop- to consider this line of bags!
 This bag has been squeeky when carrying on my shoulder since I got it.  Unfortunately, the durability is just not there.  The shoulder pad is all frayed and the zipper detached from the bag.  My Timbuktu lasted for at least 5 years of daily use.  This bag didn't make it a year.
 I own an ASUS ROG 17" G73JHA1 gaming laptop I bought in 2010. It had came with an ASUS laptop book bag, but that got stolen. My laptop is PRETTY BIG, and I expected this to hold the laptop and conceal it perfectly. However, this laptop bag does not fully conceal my laptop, as the top protrudes from the zipper line, and I can not close the zipper. I can not even fit my charger and mouse WITH the laptop. Terrible buy. It is a paperweight essentially. My Herschel book bag can carry my laptop, charger and mouse, while this cant. STEER CLEAR
 This is the perfect size for my iPad and everything I need to keep with me. Lots of pockets for all that you have to carry with you. I thought that it was flimsy, was I surprised! It’s very strong material that will hold up for the long term. Comfortable to wear through the day. The price was so good I just had to get it. I’m so glad that I did!
 Wow!  I love this bag.  It's the perfect size for my 15" laptop and all the other "stuff" I need to haul around each day.  And the price is right!  Love all the compartments and the fact that there's enough room for cords, cables, and files to be separate.  It's light weight, too!
 I bought this to replace the bag that my company gives to new employees which is just a sad sack of Chinese crap.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the Amazon bag and found it to be of really decent quality and finish. I've been using the AmazonBasics bag as my daily driver for the past three weeks and I have little to no compliants about it.<br/><br/>I am very impressed.
 I got this to contain a new 10' tablet when I want extra protection - in addition to the wrap around cover/key board.  It fit the tablet and key board / cover perfectly.  The material feels strong but not overly heavy, stitching looks good, hefty zippers and the side padding offers good protection. The side pocket with a zipper in really handy to stuff with accessories.  Overall this does the job exactly as I was looking for a tablet bag.  Finally it is offered at one of or the most reasonable - i.e. lowest - price points I could find in comparative shopping.  So for all you Kindle folks - which actually  is not the tablet type I have - this is your basic carry all.
 This is a very nicely made basic bag for a small laptop. It fits my 11-inch Lenovo Yoga perfectly, with plenty of room for the mouse, power supply, USB drives, etc. The pad on the shoulder strap was not great, but I don't use it, so that didn't matter to me. The price was right, too.
 I'm sing this with my MacMini.  Works great and fits without un-plugging the power cord from the machine.  The material is soft, and I wouldn't drop it from a big height, but it's great for making the MacMini a bit more portable and safe in my backpack.  Side pocket is a nice addition for storing headphones, USBs, and other small stuff.
 Using with my Acer Chromebook C720 (11.6-Inch laptop)<br/><br/>Fits perfect, lots of pockets and space for other peripherals.<br/><br/>Quality build (will update if there is considerable wear in the future, does not see heavy use right now).<br/><br/>At this price i didn't even expect it to be this nice, but it is!<br/><br/>Have also purchased an AmazonBasics camera backpack, the build materials and quality are the same.<br/>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VPE1WK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1
 I was pleasantly surprised by the fit, finish and overall quality of this bag.  My oversize ASUS gaming laptop fits perfectly, the shoulder strap is more comfortable than most, and the outer pouch is the perfect place to carry a passport and e-ticket.  There are four pockets inside the outer pocket that are perfect for mobile phones and iPods.  Since I carry two phones and an iPod when I travel, I found these to be extremely helpful in staying organized and keeping everything in reach.<br/><br/>Quiet possibly the best laptop bag I have ever owned.
 I love this laptop case. It is very well made with three separate pockets. The largest pocket holds my Asus Zenbook, and I-Pad. The middle pocket has three small pouches to hold various chargers, mouse, etc. The smallest pocket is large enough to hold my cell phone and I-pod. I travel a great deal and this case allows me to keep all of my devices in one place. The zippers are sturdy, and handle is firmly stiched. The shoulder strap is adjustable, and can easily be removed and reinstalled quickly when needed. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. The price is a bargain when you look at the quality of the materials and construction.
 This cover makes a wonderful Bible Book cover! My full-size Schuyler Quentel Bible fits just fine.
 Just the ticket for my 11 inch air. Pouch for charger, pouch for shoulder strip.<br/>Carrie handle whats not to love?<br/>I did remove the two thin dividers in the main chambers  Got in the way of trying to slide the book in. No biggie.
 Dammm I LOVE this bag!! The 7-10 version. It has two compartments. My apt is right outside the pool area where I have coffee every morning and I use this bag to bring my book in the large compartment and my iPod &amp; earphones in the small one. The compartments are very well padded and treat your stuff like it's holy! My paperback hasn't even gotten dog-eared in the slightest! The zippers are big and awesome. Every morning when I open it up I get so impressed. One of the 'little things' that always puts a smile on my face. The 7-10 is the perfect size. I'm going to get about 2-3 more just to have a lifetime supply of back ups. I was not paid to write this, I really am in love with this little bag.
 Just got this to use with my ipad2 . Wanted a little more protection than the smart cover offers. Don't get me wrong I love the smart cover just wanted additional padding. The netbook bag is perfect. The inside even matches my smart cover. Has a very generous outside pocket for USB cord,charger ear buds,etc. Love it so much I've order 2 more for my son and daughters iPads I've ordered for their birthdays. Seems to be well made with dual zippers for the bag and a zipper for the accessories pouch. Since my initial review I have purchased another one for a co-worker. These bags are perfect. I've also recommended the bag to my sister-in-law and a friend. Both have purchased them and love them (or so they told me.) We have had our bags for about 6 months and they look like new. Very Very well made.
 I purchased these bags for the library where I work. We lend laptops to our patrons and needed basic, affordable bags to hold them. These worked great with our MacBook Airs. The bag is lightweight but sufficiently padded to protect the equipment. There's enough space to hold the laptop charger, mouse, extra cables and papers or whatever else the user may need to carry around . The bags feel sturdy without being bulky. Great if you're short on storage space like we are. If you're looking for a no-frills, reliable, and affordable laptop bag, this is it!
 I don't need to take my laptop out and about too often, just weekend car traveling.  I wanted an inexpensive bag for infrequent use.  This is perfect for that.  Plenty of room to store laptop, power cord, mouse, a few files and accessories.  I like all the extra pockets and that if I do travel it has a slot on the backside to slip over your suitcase handle  Sufficient padding for my use, but if you need serious edge protection this probably isn't suited to your use.  It was packaged well and arrived quickly with Prime.  I'm very satisfied.
 Just bought the HP X2 laptop which has a detachable screen that can be used as a tablet. The local office supply stores don't carry a decent case for transport. I could purchase either a tablet case which is just a sleeve designed to prevent the screen from getting scratched, or a regular (large) laptop bag that all seemed to cost around $70. This 14.1 inch bag is perfect. It has a well-padded center pocket secured with a heavy duty zipper. There are also two other zippered pockets on the front side of the bag to store power cables or whatever you want. Cost? About half of what I would have spent if I didn’t check Amazon. I am learning to check Amazon “first” when I need to purchase just about anything.
 Very nice for the price. I shopped for hours and nothing compares to this bag for the price. It is very well built and plenty protective. The zippers work great unlike other cheap knockoffs. This bag is most likely a name brand that made a deal with Amazon to re-brand and sell.
 You definitely get what you pay for. This laptop bag does its job, but it does feel like its made from cheap materials. I have not had it long enough to comment on the durability. I bought this to have a place to store my personal laptop. I would not recommend it for someones laptop for work.
 Actually I'm not fond of amazon basics products, but this bag has changed my mind. I like the quality of the material. Comfortable to carry around. Fits my 13' macbook air, a book, cahrger, mouse and some pend and pencils perfectly.
 We bought a couple of these to store our portable DVD player and little LED TV and associated cords and adapters. Both the DVD and TV were purchased for use during power outages, and getting these to keep everything organized eliminates the frustration of looking for the necessary accessories when they are finally called into service. The padding keeps everything safe in the drawr where they are stored, and the nice zippers keep everything securely contained. We have not used them for their intended purpose, but they are well built and constructed, and would definitely do the job for which they were intended.
 I was looking for a bag that could hold my tablet, some papers and some office supply so I didn't have to lug my larger bag that I use for my laptop.  I bought the small and it was way too small - not that everything didn't fit, it just looked like a "murse" (man purse).  I'm going to try the larger size and see if it's a bit more masculine.
 Have used it for some time now. carried my amazon kindle and surface pro tablet in it. Have not had any problem with the straps coming off<br/>I use it everyday to take my kindle fire  8.9 with me. Have also used it for travel on airplane to carry items .
 My dell G5 15" laptop can only squeeze into the main middle pocket, and not the inner sleeved area for it. The laptop must be firmly pushed to the bottom of the case, so the fabric can be stretched around the corners in order to zip the case closed. The zipper slides over the corners of my laptop and may scratch it because of how tight a fit it is.<br/><br/>There is also very little padding (perhaps 1/4" thick), i highly dought this case would offer much protection at all.
 I wasn't certain what to expect with this bag since it had been a lightening deal for several days, but when it arrived, I was highly delighted.  There was enough room in it for my laptop, my Note 10 tablet, a good sized book, and the power cords.  As we were packing on our return from vacation, I needed a place to store my husbands Note 10 as well, and I was able to easily  add it to the front sipper partition.  Well worth the money for what I needed.
 The 15.6 size also is a good fit for a Playstation 4 (PS4) game machine, with only a little extra room (length).  Thus there's room for one or two cords in addition.  One might also fit a controller in either exterior pocket, but that bulges and would not afford the controller much protection against getting bumped.  Ideal as a bit of padding for the machine, when then placing it inside a bit larger hard-shell attache case.  Cheers
 This Amazon Basic notebook computer bag is what I needed. I did not want to spend $80 on a bag and have to replace it in 6 months.  I am rough on bags for my notebook computer so going this route works for me. First time purchasing Amazon essential products
 I love my Amazon Bag, anything that Amazon makes is pretty awesome. I was looking for a nice and decently price bag  for my new mac book pro 13.5," I was about to buy another bag when I saw this one. This bag was a lot cheaper then the one I was going to buy. I am able to put 2 graphic design books in the bag, charger, and the laptop itself. There is just enough room and it comes with a shoulder strap which is why I bought this bag. I absolutely love this bag, and I highly recommend buying it!
 It is exactly as described.  I felt it needed a bit more padding on the bottom and a strip of foam fixed that; that is a user thing not a product thing.  For the price, an excellent purchase.
 Love it! Just large enough to hold everything I need, but light and streamlined. Great for traveling with laptop on a plane. I carry a 15" MacBook Pro, An iPad Mini, AC adapter, 4 port USB hub, card reader, and a folder full of travel and work docs with no problem. I appreciate the smaller pouches for pens, markers, etc. The front two zipper area are great for the accessories leaving a clean compartment for the computer, tablet and paperwork.
 I just learned about Amazon basics and was unsure what the quality would be like, but so far I'm very happy! for the price, the laptop case is remarkable. Nice roomy pockets, interior sections and pockets for organization. The straps, clips, zippers, and fabric all look very good quality. It is basic yes, but very good basic. I purchased it as a gift for my Mother-in-Law and so far she's thrilled!
 Great bag. I call this my man bag. I carry my phone, iPad, Bluetooth keyboard, wallet, reading glasses, and a few small electronic items in this bag most of the time. Mint has great organizational features and it's the perfect size for my needs. It's also very durable, yet lightweight. I don't use the included shoulder strap, but I guess that would be nice if you carried heavier items. If your ready for a man bag, or you are a lady that wants some things more organized than a purse, then this may be right for you.
 I must have got the new and improved product? It has corner padding except at the top where the zipper is. The hooks that snap on the D rings are pretty stiff. Stitching is good. If I needed better protection than this I would buy a gun case with egg crate foam.
 You can't go wrong with this netbook case.<br/><br/>My wife's new Acer Aspire One fits perfectly in here, and the outer pocket is much more versatile than I expected.  The AC charger and cable fit with plenty of room left over for flash drives.  We even fit an external DVD drive in there no problem.<br/><br/>The fabric is built to last and there is a fair amount of padding for peace of mind.  That padding doesn't make it bulky, though.<br/><br/>A reviewer said there was too much space in the main compartment.  I don't see how.  Maybe a 1/2 inch around the sides at most.  I can't see how that could be a negative.  The neoprene is still designed to grip around it without having to be squeezed tight.<br/><br/>Let the 5 Star reviews speak for themselves.
 I have been using this laptop bag for like a year and a half and it’s great. It’s easy to travel with because you can easily take the laptop out for scanning. I use it to carry my laptop and a couple of notebooks or books around my university campus and to work. When it rains, I don’t really notice things inside getting soaked, but sometimes there are some drops.
 Bought it for a friend, together with a HP Laptop and an Android Tablet (7 inch). Fitted his computer right, the charger, the tablet, tablet charger, and there is still plenty of room for books and other small devices, feels of a good quality, and feels good to the touch.<br/><br/>Pretty content with the product, and I would definitely recommend it to anybody.
 I love this bag. it's got many different built-in features to keep things organized in different section. It has three sew in sleeves that organizes into three section, I use them for my lap top, to do files, and done files. There are three small pockets for items like mobile iron, jet pack or air cards and you can put chargers or extra work related mobile device on the bottom. Then I keep a few of my personal items or office items in the front like cell phone, paper clips, posts, pen highlighters..etc.
 Great bag for the price and what a great price!  This is an Amazon product and really first rate! It comes with a detachable shoulder strap, 2 outside zip pockets (one smaller...that's it in the picture and above it another outside pocket with small sleeve pockets for cell phone and such) Zip top with  2 big inside pockets to put laptop and store books, charts whatever and a side sleeve for books or pamphlets, lots of padding for your laptop and my 17" fits perfect. Took it to Florida without a hitch, very safe and sound. And it's very light weight...highly recommend!
 I bought this item for when I buy a proper laptop for it. I'm currently using it with my Kindle hd 10. It's the perfect size for me. I like the amount of pockets and additional sleeves inside the main compartment to separate tablets/laptops. The quality feels good too. No complaints from me!
 Great value. I bought this for my new Acer c720 chromebook (11.6").  It comfortably holds what I need and the bag's size is not bulky or too tight. The canvas, zipper and stitching are good quality.  The inside material feels a bit 'crunchy'  - but I think this will go away as it breaks in and I think I will get used to it.  Overall I love having a light weight bag that holds everything I need - and I am pleased about not having to pay much for this one!
 When I first opened it, it had a really chemical smell. I spayed a little Febreze on it and let it air out. In after a few hours, the smell diminished quite a bit. The double zippers are great for getting things in and out and seem like they'll last a long time. It's a little oversized for my iPad Air, which is great as it gives me room for my keyboard. The pocket on the front is great. Love the handles. I have my iPad in a protective case but I wanted something that would allow me to keep my charger, pen and keyboard together. They all fit.
 I picked this up for a church laptop that would rarely leave the building. This bag surprised me in that it's nicer than I thought; it's a decent quality bag. Personally, I use a Case Logic bag of similar style (see link below), but if you want to save some cash try this one out. It isn't as durable or as well padded as the Case Logic, but it's a good value for the price.<br/><br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Case-Logic-MLA-116-15-6-Inch-Laptop-and-iPad®-Attaché-Gray/dp/B005QXX35K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Case Logic MLA-116 15.6-Inch Laptop and iPad® Attaché (Gray)</a>
 I couldn't imagine how it could be any better !  It fits my 15.6 inch screen Toshiba laptop like it was just made for it !  Plus plenty extra room for power supply, mouse,  etc. Then there is more nice compartments for my 7 inch tablet and other extras. It is beautifully made , and looks like a $60 carrying case.
 This laptop bag has performed its intended task and is certainly nice if you're on a budget. I work on a campus and use this bag at work every day when I'm traveling between buildings. The two zippered pouches in the front are nice and provide enough room to store a laptop charger, pens, markers, laser pointer, etc. The large pouch has a flimsy plastic separator that tends to just get in the way when I'm trying to put in my laptop or notebook. There's no easy way to remove it as the separator is stitched into the seams. Also, the plastic pieces that connect the strap to the bag rub together when I walk and make an awful noise that reverberates in my ear. To avoid this embarrassing sound that I know others can hear, I just carry the bag by the handles. I wasn't ready to spend a lot of money for a laptop bag, but I will in the future.
 Bought it for work now I love it use it everyday I have a laptop two phones my wallet 2 wireless mouse a pair of wire cutters a pair of wire strippers a knife a flashlight my I pad a keyboard for my iPad headphones for the iPad and a set for my laptop car and house keys gas credit card and little stuff like heart burn meds and chap stick all in the bag so I don’t have to carry anything in my pocket all day
 It holds just what I need with a little room to spare. I'm very glad I chose this "mini briefcase-laptop bag". As far as durability goes... while I've only had it for a short time, I'm expecting the best.
 I Love this for my 12 inch laptop, everything fits perfectly, material quality and finish is first class,  and i love that a full size 8 1/2 x 11 size paper will fit in without folding.  i gave it minus one star for versatility because the there is just no  place to hold a mouse/ charging brick inside without worrying about damaging the laptop .  i would rather have the front pocket outside split into 2 smaller secure pockets to hold  the thicker, bulkier  odds and ends.  if you make that, i will get it in a heartbeat!
 First the price can't be beat!  Then add the quality and space and the choice is a no brainier.  I use the case to carry my Acer Chrombook c720 and a small Kindle.  Usually I also include my Amazon wireless mouse as I am not use to the Acer touch pad.  addition, I could add more padding if I believe that is needed.<br/><br/>I was hesitant to order the case as I had concerns the Acer Chrombook might be a very tight fit.  But know Amazon's great return policies, I went ahead and ordered the 11.6 inch case.  The Acer fits and even has a little wiggle room - great buy.
 Nice number of compartments. Holds my Surface Pro 3, it's charger, an Amazon USB 3 hub and other flash drives without it all being cramped. I don't use the clip strap, just the sewn handles on the top of the bag. I don't trust the plastic clips. Yes, I'm using a $13 bag to carry a $1,400 computer. It seems tough enough and provides enough protection. I care for the computer like it's a baby anyway.
 For the 17.3 Inch Laptop Bag<br/>Nice bag for the price but has it downsides. Shipping and packing was great and no issue with the quality. Downside of the bag is the interior pockets for accessories are flimsy and small. Since they are flimsy and small they don't hold anything. Would be nice if at least one or two of the pockets could be larger and closed by either zipper or Velcro. This would really help with items like a wallet, business cards, pens and pencils, etc. I placed a picture of these pockets with a pen in one of the pockets. As you can see, the pen protrudes out and reaches the top of the bag. When items are placed in these pockets they fall out of their pockets when bag is upside down or on its side.<br/>Overall the bag is well made and of simple design. For carry your laptop, some files, a tablet and some accessories it will suit my needs well. For some who needs something that has more durability due to heavier use, I would look at a different bag then this one.
 I bought this a little bigger than my laptop and it fits great! I have plenty of room for extra thing like the charging cord, mouse, books, etc. It seems pretty durable and the material is decent quality. Would recommend.
 I have to take a new laptop to my brother in Mexico and I certainly don't want to check it in my suitcase or carry-on bag which will already be full.  So I bought this laptop bag and for the price it cannot be beat!  I know he will be using it a lot and I am so very happy I found a quality product, delivered on time, which saves me a lot of headache.  AmazonBasics wins again!
 I used this bag to put a guitar multi-effect pedal into. The side pocket was large enough to put the power supply and cords into. The material is rugged and the zippers are sturdy. I'm pleased with it.
 This is a really nice bag, esp for the price.  I bought this for my 11 year old grandson.  His mom bought him a 15 inch laptop for Christmas with a sleeve to put it in.  I really didn't like the sleeve and felt a bag would be much better.  He has the sleeve stuffed with his laptop, mouse, charging cord and cellphone.  This bag has room for all that plus the sleeve fits inside also.  He includes a nice padded strap and seems very well made.  I have no negative points.
 Nice size. Gives a little padding to protect iPad. Front zippered compartment is nice size for holding your charger. Although I must admit, it would be nice if it had even a short shoulder strap for when you have multiple items to carry. Most of the time this will work well just the way it is.<br/><br/>Update: Used this case on a trip. Put iPad in the large section &amp; in the front zippered compartment I was able to put my small reading glasses, few sticks of gum &amp; my earphones. Once I got on the plane, I pulled this out of my carryon luggage &amp; I was set for the flight. Also kept my iPad safe during a lot of jostling during my entire trip.
 Amazon basics is a great product line. This is no exception.<br/><br/>The 14.1" bag is large enough to fit my Dell XPS13 (A very small 13.3" ultrabook), charging cable, mouse, Nintendo 3DS, External hard drive, External phone battery, some pens, etc. It's roomy.<br/><br/>The padding is sufficient.  Don't chuck it across the room and your stuff will be protected from minor bumps and impacts.  That said, it's only 1/4" thick on the panels.<br/><br/>The strap is pretty basic, but seems sturdy.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that this is a great value for the money and I'm glad I bought it
 Really like the bag.  Got 1 for me and hubby.  However the shoulder strap pad is made of a hard inflexible material that squeaks when we both put it on our shoulders and walk.  You can hear it, but others may not. A bit of an annoyance.  However, keeping it and dealing with the squeak.
 This sturdy case is EXACTLY what I needed. I put my iPad in it, along with a wireless keyboard (Anker® Ultra Slim Mini Bluetooth 3.0 Wireless Keyboard for iPad), and it fits exactly perfectly. The outer pocket is great for the charging cords, and some extra batteries for the keyboard. I use this to take notes in meetings (using Evernote), and to keep organized. No more laptop, no more messy notebook. This case is sturdy, looks fairly water-resistent, it stretches a bit to allow for the odd shapes of the cords, and the zipper is not puny like on most things. For the price this is one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. I will look to AmazonBasics first when I need cases for other things.
 What a great value.  I needed a bag for my trusty Thinkpad and really didn't want to spend a lot so I thought I would order this bag and at at the worst it could hold me over until I could shop for a better bag.  Simply blown away by this laptop bag.  The design is well thought out and it's very good quality.  In short, the bag exceeds every expectation.  Granted the bar was not set high, however, as I compare it to another bag in our household which cost more than 6 times as much, I find this bag better in every respect.  Delighted with my purchase.  Thanks Amazon!
 Just what I was looking for. I have a new MacBook Pro 13 and really needed to find a bag that would offer protection and able to store power plug and other accessories in The zippered pockets. Great product Amazon!
 I knew this would feel and indeed be a bit cheap and flimsy, and the bag has held up it's side of the bargain for being "just good enough" for my purposes. Will absolutely buy again when needing cheap carrying bags.
 Excellent little padded bag for Netbook computer and accessories. I have purchased at least three of these and have not been disappointed. The first one I bought still looks like new and zippers are still working fine. Price can't be beat.
 This bag fits my 16" laptop just fine. I would have liked to see a little bit more padding in the laptop sleeve. The front pocket isn't as big as you'd think. The bag has held up well with my time with it, but the one thing that really makes me want to get something different is the straps. I don't know why, but when I pick this bag up, I have to spend about 10 seconds adjusting the straps because they get twisted. If I don't adjust them, then the bag, somehow, comes unclipped and the bag with my $1,200 laptop in it falls to the ground. This has happened three times to me, and I've only had this bag for less than two months.
 This laptop bag is just amazing, thank You Amazon! For 15 $ you really get a lot and I had the oportunity to test it recently, placed a lot of things inside, the bag is cushioned all around, the 15" laptop fits perfectly (dell xps m1530), beside it I placed mouse and the mouse pad, two cell phones, a tablet, power bank, externall hard drive, ear phones, some documents and few things that I don't remember right now.<br/>A great product for the price!
 It's a good bag for the price, but after a couple of weeks of use the threads on the straps are starting to pull. I had an occasion when one of the clips that fasten the straps snapped open giving me a small heart attack when it fell to the concrete with my Mac in it. Luckily I had an insacase protector for my Mac and nothing happened to it. I'm still using this bag, just being careful on how the clips are positioned.
 Another inexpensive quality product from AmazonBasics. For me, the handles make this a much more convenient sleeve than normal sleeves, especially when traveling. I tend to check everything in or have a rolling carry on, so I usually want to have my tablet out. This makes it so much easier to carry it around than something without handles.<br/><br/>The inside is a soft material and the zippers are not exposed to your items inside, so no worries there. Some reviewers have mentioned that the zipper tags are prone to snapping off, but so far I haven't had an issue. They can be easily replaced, and for the price of this sleeve you're likely not going to be disappointed.
 My coworker suggested this and I was looking for a 17" laptop bag. Most cost considerably more, and may have been worth it but I do not need anything fancy. This is a very nice bag and reasonably priced. I'm quite pleased with it.
 I was looking for a simple no frills carrying case for my new iPad Air and I got exactly what I was looking for with this A AmazonBasics bag. It's well padded and the iPads (all models) fit in it quite well. What I've found that's especially nice is the zippered pocket it has. I'm able to carry a fairly large 15000mAH battery backup unite, a couple of earphones as well as a few cloths and cleaner for the iPad screens. The handles allow carrying the case around to be a breeze and I use the heck out of this bag without any product failure points (I.e. Handles, zipper etc,) Just a simple WELL made bag that's very price friendly. It delivers and delivers and delivers. It's far exceeded my expectations. Well done Amazon!!!
 What's not to love about Amazon?  They take a basic thing like this that others sell for many times the price and sell it dirt cheap with their name on it.  It's high quality, and it's cheap.  Boo ya!
 Do NOT buy this bag. I thought this bag was perfect for me, it had enough pockets, storage for a charger, everything. But, today I was walking out of my work office and all the sudden the strap just comes out and there goes my brand new laptop. I had my laptop custom made, waited months for it and a week after I get it, my corners are now dented in AND the laptop is metal.<br/><br/>I am so so so disappointed that I purchased this bag. Just fork over some more money and save yourself from this experience. Now not only do I have to look for another bag, I have to get my laptop repaired.
 Keep in mind that as with everything, you get what you pay for.  For the price, it's a good bag.  After about three months, the padded part of the shoulder strap wore down and tore on me (the reason for my four star rather than five star rating).  The strap itself is still in tact, as are the regular handles, so overall it's a good bag and it is still usable even with the torn padding.  And a steal for the price compared to a lot of other laptop bags.  I'm a little disappointed that the padded part of the strap already tore after only a few months, but again, you get what you pay for.
 This will be a pretty quick review:<br/>Its a fine bag with plenty of space for my fairly large (as far as 15" laptops go) Thinkpad.<br/>The issue is that if you use the strap, you will quickly be driven insane by the squeak that occurs every time you take a step, caused by the pieces of plastic that allow the strap to rotate rubbing together. It may seem like a petty complaint but its so distracting just trying to walk with it!
 The perfect bag for carrying small items. I am not using it for a tablet, but rather some small hand tools. The small size is exactly what I was looking for. The bag seems well made. I am very happy with this carry bag.<br/><br/>03/13/15 UPDATE: I just recently had purchased a 9 inch tablet. I had purchased an Amazon Basic tablet sleeve for it. Since this bag has handles, I switched the tablet to this bag. The Tagital 9 inch tablet with keyboard case fits perfectly in this bag and the charger and cords fit into the front zipper pocket. I am even more happy with this bag.
 It's a nice Tablet bag for up to 10". Well made and priced just right. It's Neoprene but it works for me just the same. It's not cheap looking at all. The quality and detail makes this a great buy period. No ifs, ands, or buts.
 I needed a laptop bag that wasn't $30 or more. I looked around at local stores and couldn't find anything that seemed worth the price tag. This case is beyond the quality I expected. Thank you Amazon. The only thing I would've asked for was a little bit more padding. But that's a minor thing since I don't plan on swinging this around like a helicopter. For what I paid though ($15), I couldn't ask for a better case. It has plenty of room for my HP, my power cord, and my Anker wireless mouse. No need to look any further people! Buy this laptop bag, the "name" brands aren't worth the price for the same quality.
 Works great for Alienware 15! It's a little light on the padding so I wouldn't call it "protective" so much as a thing I use to carry my laptop, but it gets the job done. If you're wanting something for daily use, I'd say it's fine.
 Good Ol' Amazon coming through with another great product! Needed a new laptop case since my old one was getting too small but didnt want to spend a fortune on something fancy. Found this case and wouldn't ya know it it has ample space, looks good, and houses all my stuff nicely. Definitely give this product a try if you want something nice but dont wanna break the bank!
 I wanted a carrying case for my Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 - something beyond the bookfold case that the tablet itself lives in.  We have so many adapters and chargers hanging around our desktop PC I wanted someplace to keep the Galaxy and its stuff when not in use.  This is a simple neoprene "briefcase", I really dig the internal orange lining (makes it easier to see what's in there), the zippers seem to be quality - nothing to complain about.  I think this is plenty of additional protection since the tablet is already in a carrying case.  If I didn't have the other case I might want something a little more rigid if I was taking it around with me all the time, which I generally don't.
 Update 4/2018: going on nearly 3 years old now. It has been to France and all over the US. Still going strong, not a single problem with it. Raising to 5 star, well worth the money. Definitely not the most stylish bag but then again I couldn't care less about who likes my stuff in an airport.<br/><br/>(14 inch) Has worked well for me so far. Nice selection of pockets, decent padding. Well made. I keep an Acer Aspire R13 in it, fits perfect. If anything maybe its a little thick if you don't require the extra pockets.
 As a bag, it's kind of cheap but it gets the job done. Has space for your cords and such, and if your laptop doesn't have a massive vent off of the back, I'm pretty sure you'll have plenty of space.<br/><br/>For my laptop, the ASUS ROG G752, it doesn't fit. If the bag was a half inch taller, it would fit perfectly, albeit with a bit of convincing from the zipper. As it is, it's barely too small.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something that'll get your laptop from the dorm to the classroom, this bag will do you fine. If you have a big and proud gaming laptop that you want to protect for cheap, just get a sleeve instead. Arvok's 17.3 inch sleeve fits my PC perfectly and has the padding to protect it to and from robotics meetings and LAN parties, for any fellow G752 owners out there.
 Here's what I was able to fit in this bag:<br/><br/>13.3" laptop<br/>HDMI cable (12')<br/>External CD drive<br/>External speakers<br/>Portable battery<br/>Cords for all that stuff<br/>USB hub<br/><br/>All that stuff, and it was still super small. I will likely never carry all that crap with me to class, but it's nice to know I at least have the option. And the bag still is very small and lightweight. I went to 6 stores before I finally decided to try online. I'm glad I did.  =)
 Okay, so this is not the most fashionable item but it protects my laptop and allows me to bring my charger with. Also has a pocket for a pad of paper and pens. It ain't bad I tell ya.
 Ok quality, you get what you pay for. Although it has good padding on the front and back, id like a little tougher padding at the bottom to protect the corners. It’ll do just fine to carry my laptop around but i definitely wouldnt trust the plastic strap with my laptop, hand carry it to be safe. Overall not too bad of a product
 I bought this for two reasons - as a perfect little travel bag for my iPad and as a protector for the iPad when I slide it into my larger work bag. It fits the bill for both of these!<br/><br/>The main pocket is great for the iPad and also has plenty of room for a book. The material appears sturdy and the item is well made. The zipper does not look cheap and I was pleasantly surprised at how light the bag feels. The secondary front pocket is great for putting chargers and little odds and ends.<br/><br/>I would give this item a 5 star rating but I am subtracting due to Amazon's use of the UPS SurePost. I'm a Prime member and pay the membership fees to insure 2-day delivery at no additional cost. However, due to the UPS/USPS co-op, this came a day later than what was advertised on Amazon. Not the biggest issue and still quite pleased with Amazon's wonderful services.
 Bought this item back in 2015. It is stil intact even though I use it every day and take it with me everywhere I go. It has plenty of compartments and dividers and is more than great for the price. Definitely recommend it for college students and other professionals who are currently on the go with a laptop handy.
 These were exactly  what I needed for my kids Fire tablets.  Great  quality for the price. And I was super happy to learn they can hold up to heat so I could add heat press vinyl to them
 For a 15.6 inch Laptop briefcase, this is barely a 3.5 or 4. But the value for price makes it a 5 star. There is nothing wrong with this briefcase. I needed something to hold papers, needed it fast, and needed it cheap. This was a 5 star for those requirements.<br/><br/>It has a cheap feel, especially the inside material that separate the compartments. But the compartments are designed well. with a small front zippered pocket. The handles have a nice feel. It has a shoulder strap that adjusts.<br/><br/>If you need a inexpensive laptop case or briefcase, I recommend this bag.
 I purchased this product for my new laptop, and it works just fine.  There is plenty of storage, even with the laptop in it.  I use the larger size of this bag for a travel briefcase; it's wonderful,, too.
 The reason I am giving this 3 stars as because I have had it less than a year and there are parts of the fabric that are already starting to fray and come apart, Other than that it will definitely hold what you need it to hold
 I just received this bag for my HP Mini 110 netbook (10.1") and it's simply perfect! The netbook fits inside well and the powercord plus earbuds and a flashdrive fit well into the accessory pocket. Also for kicks, I tried putting my Nook in with the computer (inside it's own neoprene sleeve as well) and it fit. The neoprene of this bag will stretch to accomodate. The Nook also fits in the accessory pocket if it's not in it's own sleeve and there are no cords coming along.<br/>  As far as the materials, it seems to be well made of quality medium thickness neoprene, heavy zippers with rubberized and enlarged pulls. The interior is a nice bright orange. I have been of the sleeve crowd in my anti- handle preferences, but these handles are padded and low profile. Just enough. Glad to have them.<br/>  Overall this is the perfect protector/carrier for my HP Mini! Couldn't be more pleased, and the price (under $12)can't be beat either!
 Bought this for my work laptop and have been really happy with it. It's not the prettiest case, but it does exactly what it needs to do. The amount of cushion is great and I never feel worried about it protecting my laptop. I love all of the pockets and extra storage areas since I like to keep notebooks, pens, etc. in the case as well. Would recommend this case for anyone looking for a simple, sturdy laptop case.
 Works good, so far no issues with zippers or seams, the only thing I didn't like was the logo on the outside of it.  Holds my 17" and 15" MacBook Pro's together.  There is not a lot of padding, so it's more of a carry bag than a protective bag.
 I work from home, so I only use this on trips, and it still started to fall apart after a few months (maybe 2 weeks of actual usage?). At this point it's completely falling apart and I just ordered a replacement from a different company. For comparison, I bought a $40 Swissgear backpack 10 years ago (for high school) and it's still holding up just fine.
 Nice case. I use it for a MacBook pro and it fits the laptop and all the accessories. It is not overly bulky, so I can carry it most places. Clean design, and looks to have adequate padding to protect the laptop from potential accidents. Recommend this product.
 Cheap, providing little protection, shoulder strap buckles are plastic and bend and come off if you sling it on too fast, causing your expensive laptop to plummet to the ground with almost no protection.. save your money and buy something better.
 bought it and using it for over a month now.  works good and can carry many files with a 14" laptop in it.  Only thing I didn't like about it the shoulder pad on the strap. It's bulky, bends out of shape therefore it doesn't sit on your shoulder well and slips off your shoulder while wearing a coat.  always have to keep it sliding off your shoulder.  but quality is just as good as the Samsonite I had.
 Got this for my new iPad Pro 12.9. This bag holds the iPad in its case perfectly. There is plenty of additional room for all sorts of accessories and essentials. I couldn’t be happier with it!
 I love this case it fits my computer and it's sleeve (with a little work) my cord and adaptor without the bulk! It's light and have enough pockets and space for the mouse and pad I plan on buying :-*<br/>Without the sleeve it slides in even easier with more space. It has some padding, but I trust it more with the sleeve. I want it more than just for functional carrying to travel. I also want it for safety.
 I ordered this case expecting to get what I paid for, which is not very much.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the case is much better than its price would indicate.  The fabric, although not super-thick, is sturdy enough for my laptop, the zippers work smoothly and don't catch, the handles are comfortable enough to carry for quite a while, and the pockets inside and out are roomy and useful.  I noticed some reviews stated they disliked the Amazon Basics logo, but I don't mind at all...I think it reflects that I got a good value for my money.  As a final note, it arrived quicker than expected which is always a plus.
 The bag itself for the laptop is well designed and fits my laptop, accessories, and even a notebook or book when I don't want to lug around another bag. However, two weeks into owning this the strap's padding started to fray at the seams. This is a design flaw. I am still using the bag, but not the shoulder strap for this reason. Other reviews have mentioned the strap's flaws, and so I would not purchase this if you want to use the shoulder strap.
 I use this bag mostly to carry file folders and a clipboard. For the price, you cannot beat this bag. I have yet to experience  the straps coming undone. My i-pad has an otter box case and my other tablet has a sleeve to help protect it if I ever transported the electronics here.
 First off, you can't beat the price.  I was shopping around, and never saw anything near this price, and most really didn't look that good. So, when I saw this for under $11.00, I felt I couldn't go wrong.<br/><br/>It arrived much earlier than projected (go Amazon), and I am very pleased with it.  It fits my netbook perfectly, and the zippered pouch on the outside is a good size for the power cord and adaptor if I need to bring them along.<br/><br/>I've read a couple of the negative reviews and it seems the zipper tabs have been an issue on a few of them.  I don't see how they could be a problem, because everything seems to be well made.  I will come back if there is a future problem, but for now, it's perfect.<br/><br/>Highly recommend.
 I looked in lots of stores for a laptop bag that would be useful for me.  I found one that would work, but the fact that I felt like I was settling and doing so at what I thought was a lot of money made me change my mind.  So I put it back and went to Amazon.  Found this bag and it has all the pockets and storage space I could ever need.
 I love this bag! I have an iPad Air with a Dodo case and it fits with room to spare. Compared with the other bags that I have been considering this Amazon Basics bag looks professional and not like a child's bag. I go to several meetings throughout the week and it has been so convenient to carry my tablet in this bag, it's helping me to go paperless. It does have a neoprene smell to it but that is typical of all neoprene products, the smell is slowly subsiding.<br/><br/>The packaging was simple and did not waste paper or materials, cutting back on the amount of recycling that will be in my bin.<br/><br/>This product is reasonably priced and I would recommend it.
 I have a Lenovo G50 15.6-Inch Laptop (59421806) Black and it fits.  Inside there is 3 dividers but I tend to just put laptop in middle since it appears to have the most space.  Case is perfect size for laptop but I tend to need to make sure I don't open bag too much so laptop can slip in smoothly. There's a small pocket on outside that I use for my gaming mouse.  And also another zippered that can potentially fit a textbook in it.<br/>Seems pretty basic, but works really well if just carrying laptop conveniently around campus for classes.
 This bag has all you need for carrying your tablet, small laptop or hybrid - in fact it is more than enough for me.  There are a couple of pockets in the main compartment that I never use, a full size side pocket that has organizing pockets that fit everything I use - cables, charger cord, mouse. etc, an additional smaller side pocket that remains empty.  Without all these other pockets, the bag would be lighter and thinner, but the bag does the job and if you carry lots of extras, this will do nicely.  It seems well constructed and durable.
 Very basic bag, gets the job done. No complaints, but I would recommend something sturdier for heavier devices, as it's not very well padded and if care isn't taken you could damage a device. Not recommended if you're prone to drops, bumping or accidents. But does the job fine if you simple need something to carry a laptop or large tablet around in.
 What else do you want? It totally does the job, quality isn't bad and is one of the cheapest around. Being from Amazon directly will be easy to solve any kind of "problems" with the order.
 If you are looking for a cheap laptop bag, this works great.<br/><br/>My work laptop has a 17.3" screen, but the plastic body is MASSIVE, the biggest laptop I've seen in a decade, yet it still fits fine.  This should fit any laptop honestly.
 It is durable, looks good, has lots of useful pockets, and protects the laptop. It feels expensive and offers plenty of padding. The stitches look good so far and no threads look like their coming undone. My daughter uses this for her Macbook everyday and it gets banged around a little in her school roller bag, but we feel confident it provides good protection. The convenient pockets and easily opened/closed zippers are perfect to hold the charging cord and school supplies. We love this bag!
 fabulous protection, very well insulated against bumps and shocking disruptions like mass transit. Five stars if it only had either better pockets or more of them. But I am able to transport the important items as intended satisfactory. It is very basic. I like this charm. Also, I tend to be a bit rough on cases in general, this one is holding up to my demands, so far.Hope it works well for others interested.
 This bag is just what I needed to transport my tablet and laptop.  It is small, but very compact and has many pockets and ample space.  I would definitely recommend this bag to someone with small items to use for travel.  It also has a shoulder strap.  There is a small outer pocket, then a medium sized pocket which leads up to the larger sized pocket.  On the inside it divides in half and even has clip-ons for pens.  This is a neat little bag, glad I ordered it.
 the best case in the hole world for laptops and usbs with the laptop mouse&amp;mouse pads and laptop chargers would give this a 10 or 100 star if I could its good for any laptop and maybe cd players it has 3pocket more then I need but better  great the best
 I bought this for the Sylvania SDVD1332 13.3-Inch Swivel Screen Portable DVD due to the fact that Amazon says that they are "Frequently bought together".  It did and it is too small. The player is 14-1/8" Inches which is the exact internal dimension so It will slide in with some effort but it will not zip without force and scraping up the corners. Then, you will have a tough time getting it back out. Do yourself a favor and get the next larger size. Otherwise it seems to be a great case.
 Two zippered compartments for document and/or accessory storage.  The main laptop storage section also has two pockets to for added storage.  Comes with a shoulder strap or use the attached handles for carrying.  Light weight but solidly built, looks like it will hold up well.
 It is a Christmas gift.  I hope they like it.  It is smaller, more narrow than I expected.  Which doesnt leave much room for anything else in the bag like a laptop mouse, etc.  I hope it holds up to wear and tear as the person I bought it for uses a bag constantly due to their work
 Made a quick purchase on this one just to have it and it turned out to be the ideal bag for me. Thank goodness for Amazon Basics! Very well thought out features - everything you need, nothing you don't. Light weight and super strong. Expect to have this a long, long time.
 This is a great bag especially for an oversized computer,etc  I use mine for an oversized DVD player, and it has plenty of room for extra cables and so forth.  Great for carrying extra DVD's..  Strongly recommend.
 Wow!!!! The case is very stylish and comfortable to wear. I was a bit skeptical at first because the case doesn't seem like it could hold much. For example, I was very concerned if my laptop charger would fit and not look bulky, well it did not the case has a lot of room. My tablet, laptop, and charger all fit in the case and does not look bulky at all. Honestly this is probably the best case out there for the price, it does protect my laptop with the firm cushion support. Trust me when I say it, you will feel like buying a new laptop when you buy this case because it's so awesome that your laptop will not feel worthy in it.
 I can echo the comment that is it surprising that Amazon has managed to come up with a bag that is better than almost anyone else.  One fault of the item is that the inside two pockets on either side of the laptop pocket have nothing keeping them shut, so if you put the laptop into the laptop pocket diagonally, as I normally do, it gets caught in one of those inside pockets and will not slide in.  I fixed this by adding Velcro to the two inside pockets to keep them closed.  It would be nice if Amazon made this product improvement.
 I like this case to transport my new ASUS netbook. It fits perfectly, and the fact that it has several separate compartments for other items, makes it very convenient. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
 A great carrying and storage case for many smaller format tablets and laptops. A perfect fit for my Dell Inspiron 11, with plenty of pocket room for the power supply, wireless mouse, and other accessories. I actually bought two of these cases and use the other one for my Acer Chromebook. The construction quality of the case is definitely high-end and the price is especially inviting. All in all, a great case that I would definitely recommend to others.
 I bought these because they were cheap and I think most laptop cases are WAY overpriced! Well that's not the case here. When these arrived I couldn't help but chuckle to myself because at first glance the quality far outpaces the price, at least by the current market standards and I felt like I had just got over on somebody without even trying. I won't go in to all the details regarding construction as others have covered that quite well. All I'll say is this, if you are looking for a functional, decent quality laptop bag and you aren't compelled to have some designers name on it then you found it and your work, as well as mine is done!
 Just as they say, it holds the laptop without the unnecessary bulk. I'm a digital artist and all I need is a couple of converters to connect to an occasional projector. The case has ample room for my power cord and also the small wires I use. If I need to slip a folder with papers in there, there is not only room for that, but some pockets to keep stuff separate.<br/><br/>I love the fact that it doesn't flop, and can be set by your seat at meetings and at home for easy in/out. A winner in my (note)book.
 I've been using this bag for a few weeks and I have zero complaints.  It has plenty of space for large iPad Pro w/ the super bulky Logitech keyboard case and a 15" MBP in the main compartment. I keep charging cords, keys and wallet and a few other nicknacks in secondary pocket.  The little zipper pocket is good for an id badge or a couple other flat items.  I mostly love the fact that this bag has no blackholes for items to fall into and seemingly get lost. If you need to carry more items than what I've listed, you'll need another bag.
 This bag is a good BASIC bag. It has held up well on four trips. It has room for a 17.3" HP Pavilion and a cooling pad about 3/4" thick, as well as the charging cable for the laptop; there is also plenty of room for my Kindle in it's case, as well as cords and wall plugs for our cell phones, with room left over.  I'm not too keen on the raw nylon edges on the inside, they aren't awful but as a precaution I sewed up a thin fleece liner and velcroed it in.<br/><br/>This bag, for the money, is a good buy.  For $15, you really can't expect more.
 This is a great bag.  I only wish it would fit an 8 1/2 x 11 legal pad (not x14).  It's OK, but you will have to bring a smaller writing pad instead, which isn't a major inconvenience.
 I bought this for my 9.7” iPad generation 5+.  It has an external pocket for cables and charger and a carrying handle.  The materials and workmanship are great and it’s at a great price.  I’ll buy more of these quality knock-offs from Amazon in the future now that I know they are available.
 I've had this bag for a year now and I couldn't be happier with it. I take my laptop to work every day and I've done some flight travel in the past year and the bag has held up great! All the stitching and zippers are intact and the shoulder strap is still going strong. I bought this knowing I would need to use it at least twice a day to carry my 6lb laptop + accessories and my appreciation knows no bounds. I've even stuffed it with notebooks/magazines without issues. Everything inside has, so far, always been protected from any general movement/shifting as I travel, too. If you need a bag at a good price, I highly recommend this.
 I bought the 11.6 inch one. It arrived and looks and feels great. Perfect size for my laptop. I had seen other reviews say the strap breaks so I'm not attach g it. It has handles so that is what I will use. If I have any issues down the line I will update.
 Product ripped after first use.  The pad that is on the shoulder strap did not even make it after my first business trip.  I barely used  the shoulder strap and it just fell apart.  I wonder how the rest of the bag will last.  NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE!
 Great bag, lots of pockets, I keep all my essentials and have plenty of room. I use this for my HP Spectre 13t.<br/><br/>BONUS: It's padded, so if you accidentally drop your laptop in there, you're protected. Love it and great price!
 Could Use a little more padding, but otherwise it's very nice and will neatly carry a power pack and cord and a Mouse and external speaker a bag of small odds and ends like pens aspirin flash drives and what not. I would buy this again, but please a little more padding for the laptop sleeve!
 Very nice bag, i like it very much... lightweight, slim style,  i can also fit the laptop with sleeve from amazon basics as well....and still have room for my brick ac cord...and other stuff....can be used for books...school or work...etc...good price
 Well worth the money.  Use it every day.  Good zippers, two extra outside pockets, light weight, well made.  I carry reading glasses and a mouse in one pocket; a plug in Wi-Fi antenna and a shopping bag in the other.  Print outs have slots inside.  The computer fits right in the middle.  If you're feeling clumsy, you can fit enough padding in this case to get the computer through a good drop.  With one small case I can carry a computer, phone an tablet, all the chargers and an extended range antenna.
 I purchased this bag for my ASUS Transformer T100 10 inch tablet/laptop.  I am very impressed with the quality of construction.  I am especially happy with the zipper which is very sturdy and well made.  The side pocket is quite a bit larger than I expected.  I was unhappy about that at first since it adds some bulk to the bag, but I found that it works very well for carrying my charging table, small headphones, and a wireless mouse.<br/><br/>Overall I highly recommend this bag.  It is sturdy, lightweight, and well constructed.
 I have a 15" laptop so I ordered this case for a 17" so that I could also carry my 8" tablet and chargers for both with some room to spare.  Padding is adequate and pockets and compartments are good enough for me.
 It smells really bad!
 I bought this bag  knowing it was not a heavily padded one, as I rarely carry my laptop very often.  I simply wanted a convenient carry bag for it and this product works just fine for that use.  It is not padded at all but it does have enough space and side pockets to carry power and USB cords conveniently so it fits my  requirements just fine.  At its current price point I consider it a good buy.
 This is the perfect size bag for me to carry my laptop and tablet to and from work. It also has spots in one zipper pouch to hold my two portable hard drives and SD card holder. The only bad thing is that the swivels came undone when I was walking. After I immediately cut them completely off and put paracord in their place.
 I needed something simple and cheap to use for my laptop and this caught my eye. It's much roomier than I expected, the shoulder strap is well supported without being too padded, and even though it's on the more affordable side it doesn't look like it was cheaply made, unlike a lot of other bags I've encountered which were plain flimsy. All in all its a great, highly functional bag that doesn't require breaking the bank.
 Great price, very well made! I use this laptop bag on a daily basis. It carries my laptop, my Ipad, my 6plus and my tablet! It's very well made, and you can't beat the price. Would purchase this again, but I think that this one will last me many many years!
 I had the bag for over a year. My HP Envy 17" laptop ended up tearing the edges after a few months, although it wasn't particularly pointed. One of the handles tore off in six months, and so did the zipper and strap by the end of the year. The pockets are decent, but that's about all that it's good for after a year. Consider a different case if you want one to last more than that.
 Perfect case for an affordable price. If I need to take my Chromebook or iPad while traveling this is a nice case. It protects my electronics very well and is just large enough to carry a tablet,iPad,e-book, etc. with no issues. I like that it is lightweight and not bulky.
 This is functional as in the material/seams/zippers have held up so far. It definitely looks cheap though. If you care about that kind of thing, you're better off sucking it up and buying something more expensive.
 Got it for our Tab E.  It's got lots of room, padding, a nice shoulder strap with padding, and long enough hand straps that a guy with big hands can use.  No complaints.  Good price too.
 Considering the price, this is a decent product; I would have preferred to have some dividers in the various pockets to keep things separated.All in all it's satisfactory.<br/>Actually I have found a pocket with dividers, so that complaint could be struck. I'm upping the rating to 4 stars, not five, because it's quite a struggle to insert my 17.3" Lenovo laptop, it only just fits.
 I would really like to give this bag a good review, it's very cheap, sturdy, exactly what I needed and it arrived extremely fast. There's only one small issue, piece of padded fabric that supposed to keep the shoulder strap from digging into your neck almost immediately started falling apart, the rest of the bag seems very sturdy so this is very strange I don't know if there may be faxed separately or if I just got a bad shoulder strap.
 This is a handy little bag/pouch. I use it for airplane travel. I can fit my iPad Mini, Kindle e-reader, and iPhone in the main compartment. And the side pocket is perfect for cables, headphones, boarding pass, etc. Now instead of constantly digging through my carryon bag, I just take this little one to my seat.<br/><br/>The only thing I'd change if I could would be to remove the handles. They're a little bulky and I found I don't use them. But this is a personal preference thing, so not a biggie.
 I purchased this case for a 15 inch Macbook pro.  There is plenty of room for the computer, charging cord, mouse and several other items  if you want.  I saw an identical case in Target for $29.99 except it was labeled Targus instead of amazon basics
 This laptop case is made of a study material. It has a large enough space for a large laptop, and it has areas to carry other things, such as charger or personal items. This is a wonderful laptop bag for this price.
 It's a great case for my Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 Tablet.  It holds all the accessories in separate divided pockets so nothing gets scratched: the Keyboard Case (which is attached to the Tablet), the Book Cover, the Simple Cover, and the charger.  There's plenty of room for everything, but the case is not too bulky.  I also got the Evecase Multi-functional Neoprene Messenger Case Tote Bag for Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5-inch, if I want to leave the AmazonBasics one at home and go with a more compact case that just holds the Tablet &amp; Keyboard along with a charger.
 Such a great find was able to put a 15.6 lap top and a 11.6 as well in front pocket still had room to put in flash drives and chargers might be able to put tablets as well but didn't want to push it overall a good bag to have im update if any problems should arise
 The quality and room for this case is perfect for my HP full size laptop - 15 inch. It has several pockets - one that I use for a mouse, power cables, HDMI cable plus a pocket for my notepad.
 I needed a briefcase to carry a few large books when I went to the library.<br/>So, far it is working fine and the handles are holding up.  I have only had it about 2 months, but again it is working fine.
 the latches are so terribly designed i am gravely disappointed with these reviews. I wouldn't put a 100 dollar laptop in this worthless bag. My laptop fell on the ground because the latches come undone for no reason.
 I bought this bag to carry around my surface pro 3 to school or other places. The bag's computer area looks durable, and there seems to be enough space to add other item in there. Inside the computer slot is a carry strap you can attach to the side of the bag, if you are wanting to wear it on your shoulder. The front of the bag includes a slot to put other peripheral devices. Right now I have a belkin usb hub, a polaroid stylus, Microsoft wedge mouse, and a sandisk cruzer mini 256 mb usb 2.0 in the front slot, and still have more room for other peripheral's devices. Overall this was a good purchase, I recommend this to anyone wanting a bag for your computer.
 I bought this for a 10" windows tablet that has a keyboard. It fit perfect in this bag and had enough room in the zipper pouch for the power adapter and the a stylus. It will accept a bigger tablet. Not sure but i believe it will take a 12". SO it is a little big for my 10" tablet but who cares for only $8.
 my middle school kid hauls a laptop back and forth everyday. The laptop case becomes another fashion issue.<br/>Tired of the one that began the school term, another model was requested. I did a fair amount of shopping because I<br/>spent like $40 on the first one. (I could have spent $60-70!). So, for under $20.00 including tax and shipping, I was a bit<br/>wary of the quality that might show up. No need. The case was exactly as advertised. Sturdy, fashionable, and useful. It<br/>also seems to be just as well constructed as those costing twice as much. very satisfied.
 I ordered this bag for my new Ipad Air yesterday afternoon and got it this morning.  I have a notebook type case on the Ipad and the Ipad and case fit nicely in this bag. The Basics Bag is well padded and will protect the Ipad from damage.<br/>I was very surprised at the quality of this bag. The material is very expensive looking and looks like it will wear very will.  This case is well worth at least three times the price. The texture of the material, handles and zipper grabs is very pleasing to the touch.<br/>ordered the 7 to 10 inch for the Ipad Air.  Love it!
 At the very onset let me inform you that the zipper of the bag that I received as part of my order came apart.  So, you all may be wondering then why have I rated it so highly and there are couple of reasons to that :<br/><br/>1. The moment I brought this to the notice of Amazon, they issued me a full refund - that's why?<br/>2. Other then the Zipper issue ( one off maybe) the bag otherwise has agodd feel and finish for the price you pay.<br/>3. Even though I mostly carry it unzipped both my iPad and Mac air fit snugly into it. Sometimes both at a time.<br/>4. Enough space provisioned to stove away charger and hearing device.<br/><br/>And again 5 stars to Amazons superlative customer service.
 Great case fits the Lenovo Tthinkpad T430 with extended battery like a glove.<br/>I got another shoulder strap <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Rothco-Gi-Style-Utility-Strap-55-Black/dp/B004NKY62Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rothco Gi Style Utility Strap/55''- Black</a> since the one included has issues coming undone per a few reviews on here.<br/>Pictured next to my old gargantuan T60 case!
 What else to say they are reasonably priced, last longer than you'd expect (for the price) do a good job, enough pockets &amp; space for your laptop &amp; cord plus more room for papers and more.
 This is the best bag.  I just bought this second one.  It is small but large enough to hold my larger Kindle, the charging stuff, my stylist and a few other things (has a outside zip pocket that is really nice).  And there is still room leftover.  I use one for the large Kindle and its stuff and the second one for my Kindle e-reader, charging stuff and my phone charging stuff plus room left over.  And it is a bit different looking from all the other bags so I know to be careful with it. Well-made and is padded.
 The laptop case is good for carrying a laptop and few extras. It feels cheaply made. After using it for about 2 or so weeks, the carrying handle began to rip half way on one side of the attachment. I rate 3 because of the low quality material and how easily and quickly it broke under normal use. It is still usable, so I try to be easy on it. If you need an alright carrying case for your laptop, and you are on a budget, you might try this out and be very gentle with it so it won't rip at the base of the handle. I would spend the few extra dollars to get a better case after using this one.
 I got this to keep my ASUS C 201 Chromebook in during traveling. As a writer I like to go out for a change of scenery and still be able to work, and this bag is a great size for the Chromebook and items like earbuds, power pack , notebook, pens, even my EpiPen to be handy while I'm public locations or on a day trip. Well done, Amazon.
 I order this to use as purse while traveling. It was perfect for my new Kindle! It has plenty of pockets for wallets, chargers and anything else needed. Going thru airport security was a breeze with it.
 Love this bag.  Perfect price point.  It is a simple, lightweight bag but is extremely functional with multiple smaller pockets for accessories and fits my 17 inch laptop perfectly without having to squeeze it into the bag.  Zippers are nice and sturdy as well.  Love it.
 Purchased this case after much research for my husband for his small Dell 2-N-1 laptop.  The case fits the bill perfectly.  Enough room to add a couple of files and a small-profile external mouse plus a few extra goodies.  So much better than just a sleeve.  In fact, my husband places the entire tablet bag into his larger Ogio backpack for travel.  Then when he gets to his destination, he can simply remove the AmazonBasics tablet bag to take on the jobsite and not have to tote his entire backpack..
 The case is the perfect size for my laptop to fit nice and snug inside. The other pockets are a great addition to hold other things like chargers or a mouse pad. I think the price is pretty fair for the quality of the material and the strap to carry it around is very convenient and strong. I this case is a great buy overall if you want a mobile case to bring your laptop around.
 Holds my tablet and the keyboard that came with it along with a hard drive, a bluetooth mouse, and the power cord. Zippers seem good. Handles make it easy to carry and it came with a shoulder strap.
 This really is a nice bag for my Dell Inspiron i3147-3750sLV 11.6-Inch 2 in 1 Convertible Touchscreen Laptop . My laptop fits prefectly in the bag with room in the front pockets for the power brick and cord. It also has room for 2 pens or pencils and your phone  and a pad or two or somthing of similar size that you may need for school or bussiness. The bag looks very well made and only cost 12 dollars and change. It also comes with a nicely padded strap to carry on your sholder and a strap on the back of the bag to hang on your luggage handle. I would definitely buy again. Great buy.
 Simple, basic, and well constructed.  A step up from a sleeve, but with room for your power supply, cords and mouse, and still thin enough to pack inside other luggage when you don't want to haul (or pay for!) another piece of checked luggage.
 I don't use this bag for any crazy use. I'm pretty hard on bags too. But for home use and minor taking out in public so far it does the job. I am happy with it. It matches the title it's BASIC
 I ordered this laptop bag based on the reviews, and I must say that I am very happy with the purchase. There are enough compartments, the adjustable shoulder strap is comfortable, and the handles on top are adequate. Most importantly though, I was pleasantly surprised with the lightness of the bag. I have owned a few laptop bags over the years, and they have all tended to carry more weight than they should. This one however, does not, and this for me, is its BEST feature!  My sister needs a new laptop bag and I recommended this one to her. She's gonna love it! :)
 The bag is amazing. Fits my Samsung 11.5 Chromebook perfectly. I love the front pockets and rear strap to attach to suitcase. Amazing value. The only negative is the logo ... Amazon basics! Looks very nice and I love the messenger bag style! Wish it was available in more colors.
 Perfect case for my iPad Pro 10.5 tablet. Very happy. Plenty of pockets for tablets power cord, earplugs, wallet and iPhone 6 Plus. Fits all these items mentioned and still have plenty of room for more. For $ 13.99, this is excellent buy and you will be pleased with your purchase.
 Very well thought out case. My laptop fit in it just right and all the peripherals had pockets for them to go into. The shoulder strap was anice plus for me since I use mine at work and having the shoulder strap frees up my hands for other tools.
 Because it is sized for a full size iPad, there is lots of extra room in this for my many adapters/cables I carry along.  Some of the cables I carry in the side pocket and others go in the main compartment with the iPad.  I'm not worried about scratching/damaging the iPad against these other things because the iPad is encased in a Devicewear Slim Original iPad Mini Case/6 position Flip Stand/On-off magnet switch.<br/>Gave it 4 stars because it only came in black, and I was occasionally losing it, especially against the black carpet of our car.  A little red duct tape - problem solved!
 It fit my iPad Air and some other personal stuff in it on my Amtrak overnight trip. Not a lot of extra stuff, but enough for a person who doesn’t carry a handbag and keeps wallet in pocket. Just what the doctor ordered!
 No the best bag in the world, it comes cheaply made with plastics hooks and material is flimsy. Considering the cost, it is still a reasonable consideration for light-unimportant use.
 Bought this for an old 14" laptop.  It is light as a feather - several compartments to make it multi-functional.  Interior materials seem cheap, but no issues with ripping or failure and the padding seems adequate to protect the laptop and/or tablet.  I bought this primarily to transport the laptop, but with the extra compartments, it can hold the power adapter, my Kindle or tablet, phone, etc. simultaneously.<br/><br/>A very versatile travel bag and I doubt you will find anything better for the price ($10.99 on sale).
 I got this for my 15yo son for school use as a companion for his new Kensington Key Folio 2 with keyboard.  He is not the most responsible and careful 15yo; perhaps about average.  That is why I wanted to get a carrying case to hopefully protect the Kensington (primarily the corners) when thrown into his book bag.  I had hoped to get a vertical bag, and I would have been happy with something basic with merely a velcro strap for the top as that would have been an ideal solution.  However, I wasn't finding anything inexpensive with good reviews.  The Kensington is a fairly snug fit around the corners, but I am cautiously optimistic that he won't beat hell out of the corners when zipping it up.  Perhaps it will be better after some use.<br/><br/>I considered the 11.6 Amazon Basics laptop sleeve, but it did not have the pocket like this model.  I also considered the 11.6 version of this model, but unfortunately it seems to be OOS a lot.  However that would have not been as snug.  All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase.  As most others indicate, you aren't getting a great deal of padding, but it is what it is.  It not only met, but exceeded, my expectations in terms of quality.  If it were a quarter inch wider it would have been perfect.
 I was looking for just a plain and simple laptop case and this one is perfect! The main pocket has enough room for laptop and papers! Also has a middle pocked for pens/pencils/planner. And the front pocket is great for your laptop charging cord. Light weight, can't go wrong with this laptop case!
 I have purchased a few cases to use with my Microsoft Surface 128 Pro. This case is an excellent buy, but be warned. The picture that is displayed showing the inside pockets is not correct. This version of the case only has 2 pockets and not 3. After 3 attempts to get this case in the 3 pocket version and each attempt had failed, I sent a message to Amazon to update the picture to reflect the correct pocket which is 2.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the case is very good for the price. The zippers work well, the case fits the items stored nicely and that includes the Surface PC.
 My only issue is I wish the pockets opened larger, other than that its perfect for the price. I feel like the padding is enough for it. It's a perfect fit for my 11.6 Lenovo Yoga 2 11 in the largest compartment. There is also 2 side pockets in there, it doesn't fit into either of that, but they fit my tablet fine. A legal pad is a tight squeeze in the main pocket. A few composition books or a thin spiral notebook fit fine. The medium pocket fits other essentials, a few writing devices, chargers, hdmi cable, small headphones. I wanted a small bag that isnt bulky and this is exactly that.
 So handy!  13" MacbookPro, binder with notepad, Apple charger and wire, Belkin compact surge protector, phone charging wire and a few small miscellaneous items all fit.  Just enough room for what I think are essentials without room to become overstuffed.  The internal pockets and dividers are the right size for organizing and carrying what I have listed.
 Bought this bag to house an Acer 11.6-inch laptop, and the fit is perfect. Cushioning is adequate, and the pocket is able to hold a mouse and power cord without too much bulge. I also like the fact that the inside is simple and not filled with 20 pockets that I never use, like some other cases I have bought. The overall construction feels cheap, but I didn't expect it to ooze quality for 13 bucks.
 I was not aware that Amazon had their own branded products.  I am extremely pleased with this product and would highly recommend it.  I had been to numerous stores to find a bag that wasn't to big but allowed me to carry my laptop, files and accessories.  This bag fit all of my requirements.  When I received it I was very pleased at the quality.  Much better than many of the others that I had looked at and at half the price.  I would highly recommend this product.
 I bought this case to replace my original Dell case and aside from it not being the right size case, it was a little flimsy in weight. I expected a carrying case that would actually protect my laptop if I drop it, and this case does not appear to have enough padding or protective reinforcement to keep a laptop protected from even a short fall. Amazon stepped up as usual when I did the return request. I think it was my fault as far as the wrong size issue-measured the screen at 15.6 diagonally, but the laptop was over 17" from corner to corner- really was unsure where they measure the size of the laptop?
 A basic laptop bag. I could have gotten a fancier one, but when I'm carrying a laptop around, I don't really want to scream "expensive laptop inside" by having a leather or other expensive bag. This one gets the job done and has plenty of room for carrying around all my accessories.
 This bag is the BOMB!  I spent weeks looking for a really nice leather bag, and just couldn't pull the trigger on any of them because of comments in the reviews and the sizes were just wrong for me.  I finally decided to get one of these to get me by until I found something I want, and I love it!  It's the perfect size and config for me.  And the price was irresistible.  I totally NEVER shop this way, but glad it led me to this bag this time!
 I like mine I got it today and it appears to be very well made its soft and padded while not looking so childish as other padded tablet carriers<br/><br/>My tablet and case fit<br/>my phone<br/>chargers<br/>my vapor<br/><br/>I do wish a slight smaller size was for my 7" if you have a 10" tablet you'd probably like this but you'd still have a good deal of room<br/><br/>I do love it's orange on the inside because it's my favorite color...<br/><br/>The one full reason I purchased it
 It's a great laptop bag, and the first one I've ever bought. I just wanted to try something new and this was a cheap but seemingly good quality first buy. I used it for about a week and the shoulder strap was uncomfortable and heavy on my shoulder, it dug into my skin through my shirt, and was just generally unpleasant. This may just be because I'm not used to laptop bags, so I won't hold a huge grudge. The product itself is sturdy, holds my laptop and a few books, and that's really all I needed. It's exactly what it's advertised to be.
 Excellent.  I use it for travelling with an iPad and a Kindle e-reader.  Separated by dividers with additional outside pocket.  Easily tote around by handle or shoulder strap.
 Good enough for the price, and the actual compartments and bag are very well designed in terms of layout - my only complaint is that the materials feel very cheap. It has a crinkly sound to it that makes it feel like you're crumpling paper everything you open/close it.<br/><br/>Fairly narrow, too - I can get my charger in with my computer (an Acer c720, which just barely slides in) but don't expect to fit much else - many of the pockets, because of their limited depth, feel more like wishful thinking than actually useful.
 It is a little small and light, but it is what it described itself to be. Fits my 17" Dell without issue. Still has some room for other things. Seems well made, looks nice. Shoulder strap is adequate, with no failures as mentioned in some other reviews. Great for the price.
 A perfect fit for my HP 14  4G! The front pocket holds a lot of accessories for the size! Definitely recommend!<br/><br/>Updated: 07/20/14: Just got back from a trip which *really* tested this bag to the max. Short story: I'm amazed how sturdy this bag is! More derailed story: I'm amazed how much it can store, (my HP 14 4G, mouse, AC adapter, plus my Nexus 7 and the Qi charger for it). I really liked the rear strap which made it sooo easy to haul around in combo with my luggage. It's very sturdy and for the price, you just can't beat it! Highly recommend it!<br/><br/>-A
 Bought this for my mother as a basic travel carrying bag for her laptop and it's accessories. Does not provide alot of cushion for the laptop so recommend putting it into a soft case for travel. Other than that, great little bag for the price!
 Solid basic laptop bag. The inside flaps get a little loose over time, but they still function well as dividers. The outer layer has convenient pockets for small items, and it has rubber band holders for pens.
 Slim, lightweight and the right size for my 14" laptop padded hardcase. I got this not for its protective features, such as padding, but for the portability while navigating the airport security checks while flying through Europe. Definitely a bargain hunter's dream here.
 This bag ended up being the best bag ever- great storage capacity - comfortable on the shoulder - easy to fit everything I needed until 3 months late r- the liner ripped - UGH. I wish this was still within the timeframe to return but I can't! argh - Thankfully its cheap but I wish it was better made. I can make another $15 purchase but how many times will I have to do this??
 This fits a 13.3" Ultrabook very nicely.<br/><br/>I put the shoulder strap with its cushion at the bottom of the laptop compartment to protect my Ultrabook when setting this case down on its thin bottom edge.<br/><br/>As others have written, do NOT expect this bag to protect a laptop if you drop the bag or toss it around.
 I think this is a great case.  I use this for my 11" tablet, and also carry a keyboard, mouse, cable and charger in it.  It seems to be well made, and everything fits nicely.
 Bought for our son. Works great. Has had for a few months and he has had no problems with it. I don't know exactly what he carries in it but he hasn't asked for a different one so I'm guessing that its working for him.
 Forgot to do a review for this thing lol, had it for a year now and take it everywhere. I put my tablets my iPhone anything that I just don't want to put it my pocket it goes in the case. So far after a year of tough abuse it has held up very well a very good purchase.
 This bag ripped the first time I put my laptop in it. I would have sent it back but didn't have a chance or the time too do it.
 Heavy duty material, a utility pouch and good padding make this a superb tote for a guy like me who lives by his laptop and takes it everyplace at a dead run. JDA
 These laptop cases are light just right for my new two laptops all I needed. Holds core mouse no problems ok to buy for a good price. Light weight and durable ! I brought two
 This bag is awesome. Well-made, good-looking, tough. I originally wanted a leather bag, but for my work, it isn't practical. I needed something tough that could handle my abuse, carry my netbook, along with a tablet, chargers, books, etc. It's not a huge bag, but it's a good size, sufficient for my needs. I love it, and the price was super-nice as well. Highly recommended.
 I was looking for a bag to cary files and paperwork in, but didn't want a briefcase or huge messenger bag, so when I came across this I figured I'd give it a try. This bag is perfect for what I needed it for. Extremely lightweight, but good quality, and plenty of room for all the files I need to put in there, as well as anything else I might want to throw in. The price is also a great bargain!
 I wanted a case with a handle for carrying my Fire 10.1 while it was also in my Fire Keyboard case. This is a perfect fit. It has a spongy fabric that should provide additional protection. It also has a zip front pocket to store my stylus and charging cord. Great value for the money
 Got this for a new VelocityMicro 17.3" laptop. This is really made by Clevo (sold in Amazon). 16"x 11.25" x 1.0" &amp; 19.5" diagonal. This a tighter fit than I am used to with old 15" laptops in a 15" carrying case. Maybe I was spoiled but I would give it an extra star if is also wasn't on the thin side (power brick &amp; cord fit "OK" but not too much else)....... price is nice &amp; looks to be made durable enough.
 Solid quality, holds my way-too-large lenovo laptop well, plenty of space in outer pockets for charger, mouse, and steam controller. Only complaint is that I wish the larger of the two outer pockets was divided into two sections to keep peripherals separate, and that it had a small zippered pouch inside to hold onto smaller items like SD cards and USB dongles.
 We have purchased several of these for work. My son has one too. He is a hard to please brand snob and he loves his. These bags are a real bargain in my opinion. The quality is excellent. We buy mostly 15: Dell laptops and they always fit nicely. The zippers and material are of high quality. We have been buying them for about two years now and have never had a workmanship problem.
 My laptop measures 17.5 inches by 12.5 inches, and this bag fits it perfectly! While it's very basic, and the plastic hooks on the shoulder strap look delicate, it's fine for storage and the occasional light use. I had looked for a laptop bag locally, but the few I found that were big enough were extremely expensive. This one is a bargain. Thank you!
 Not a bad case, however it did not fit my 17.3 acer predator by far. Wouldn’t even come close to zipping closed. Even if it did there would have barely been room for the charger or anything else. For a 17.3 case this has some design flaws. It also seemed very thin and did not provide much protection.
 This bag is well constructed, and provides a bit of padding to protect your devices, but, although it does have some zippered pockets, it lacks much of the storage space I have on my other laptop bags.
 I was really impressed with this laptop bag at first. It has plenty of room to store all of my office-on-the-go necessities, but after about a month of using it, the fabric strap that wraps around the plastic piece connecting the shoulder strap gave in to the weight of my bag (it only has my laptop, charger, a notepad, pens, and pencils in it). Whenever I walk with the bag on my shoulder it makes a slightly irritating squeaking sound. Overall, the bag is just okay and certainly serves its place being so inexpensive.
 What can I say? AmazonBasics does it again. In this bag I have my 15" Dell Inspiron (inside a 15" sleeve), my Cooler Master X-Slim Laptop Cooler, AC charger, wireless mouse, HDMI cable, USB flash drive, Transcend Multi-Card reader, basically my entire laptop set-up! It's amazing! The strap is easily adjustable, and the bag is perfect for both laptops/tables, or even if you just want to use it for school and put your binder/notebooks! The larger side pocket also has pencil/pen holders inside, so what a coincidence! Super happy with my purchase.
 I purchased two of these, one for a friend and one for myself. We both love them! This is nothing fancy and the inside doesn't have great lining however the padding is sufficient, it serves its purpose and works great. The strap is very comfortable. The case fits my 15.6" laptop very well and has some extra room, might fit a 17" but it would be snug. I love the extra pouches so I can slide some work documents in when I work from home. Overall very pleased.
 Got a 17" laptop? Want a good cheap bag that will protect it? This is your answer.<br/><br/>For a messenger bag its very comfy. Its light and got plenty of space to pack a laptop + cables + a kindle and some snacks. I use it for everyday use. I just wish it was a bit more 'colorful'. I have an Northface rexine bag that my other 17" laptop sits in, but I prefer this Amazon basics one. Its more comfy to carry for some reason.
 It's very well made. I use this for my tablet, a small keyboard, mouse, three charging cables, two outlet plugs in, a car outlet plug in, a 13000mah external battery, two headsets, many pens, nail clippers, eye drops, ten winning scratch tickets, and more!<br/>I needed something to take to work so my tablet wasn't sitting in a plastic bag but then also didn't need to store a back pack. Really glad I bought this product.
 The bag was good I thought but only a few weeks of using it just for work to commute back and forth I noticed the shoulder strap fraying really bad and the strap is all stretched out . i would buy a nicer bag if I had to buy again
 Oerfect for my Surface Pro 4<br/>And an iPad<br/>The charging equipment, and other must haves such as a 8000ah emergency power pack. Just incase you are stranded in the woods and the is no electrical power.  Can’t wait.  LOL.
 It will hold much more than I need, and even a mouse does not seem to bulk it out. Closes securely, keeping debris out, nicely padded, without adding weight.
 This is an awesome bag. I almost bought a similar one at Best Buy for 60 bucks, had second thoughts and gave it to the cashier before she scanned it. Went home and looked here and bingo....what a buy!!! This has padding all around the edges which was a good thin as I dropped the case with my new ASUS notebook the morning after and it landed on the bottom edge...no damage. It also has plenty of room for all the tech stuff I carry with my when I am riding, yet small enough to fit into the tail trunk of my GlodWing GL1800, even on top of all my other bags fill with tools and such. There is nothing I have found that is bad about this bag, all the seams are strong and neat, the zippers are sturdy and smooth, the handle gives one a feeling of security, and the carry strap was surprising excellent quality......if they only made motorcycle luggage they would make a fortune.
 This fits my 14 inch Lenovo Thinkpad ( laptop measures 9x13 inches) It would not hold a laptop any bigger than this. First, I couldn't believe the great price. Second, I am very happy with the padding, pockets, and all around construction of the case. Thanks Amazon!
 There is only one fault with this case, and that is that I jam a lot of stuff into it.  I have a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 with type cover, a Lenovo Idea Tab Miix2 with keyboard, power cords for both devices, Microsoft Wireless mouse , an ink pen and a stylus, papers that I need for work, various business cards, etc.  There are plenty of pockets for the various things I carry, but with it all stuffed into the case, I need a little more room.  I wish the case was about 1 inch longer and a half inch deeper, and then I could rate it higher.
 This bag is a great value for the price. I store my iPad Air in the main compartment. It's a bit roomy, with about 1" to spare on the side and top. I store my Kindle PaperWhite in the smaller front compartment. There's still plenty of room for reading glasses in a case, a pen, etc. The main zipper is very heavy duty, and there is padding that comes together when zipped to protect the device inside. The bottom is made of the same neoprene as the rest of the bag, so everything is reasonably padded. Especially for the price, this bag exceeded my expectations, so it gets five stars.
 Go no further. If you were looking for Something to carry your Fire HD 10 &amp; Docking station, Stop right here.<br/>It has tons of space for storage in the 3 separate zippered pockets (one single pocket &amp; two that have dividers to organize various items. Plus they have added padding inside for added protection. It looks and feels like a quality item. And the size is just right for the Fire HD 10. and the price excellant.
 Got this for my Boyfriend for his new laptop. Fits his Dell Inspirion just great. Has good amount of pockets and areas to put things. Seems to be made fairly well with decent handles and strap. He likes it.
 This is the perfect carry bag for my needs. I pack an iPad Air and a Bluetooth keyboard in the main pouch with a thin, semi-stiff foam divider between them. My Kindle Paperwhite zips into the front pocket with enough room to also hold a charging cable and even an iPhone if I want. Alternatively, skip the iPhone and slip in an iPad charger if you can live with a bit of a bump. BTW, if you use an "iXCC Element Series Apple MFi Certified 2 in 1 Dual Connector Lightning to MicroUSB Sync and Charge Cable," you only need one cable for everything. I've been using this bag for a while now, and I can't see any signs of wear.
 These are great for carrying light laptops, tablets, iPads, iPad mini's or even just paperwork. Very durable, nice strong zippers. The price is very good compared to others in the 30 plus range. Comes with shoulder strap and outside zippered pocket.
 I just bought an Acer Aspire One netbook and I needed a case for it so I checked around my local stores but I couldn't believe that they charge anywhere from $15 to $30 for a netbook case and it didn't even have handles like this one!  So I came back to Amazon, searched for cases and found this one.  It looked nice in the photos and I really like that it had handles for easy carrying but the price really sold me.  Plus, I have Prime so I would get the package in two days.  I'm glad I made the purchase as the case is solidly made, the zippers are durable, my netbook fits perfectly with room to spare and it's black so any spills (hopefully none) won't show.  The only thing I don't like about the case is that the accessory pocket is a little small and my AC adapter bulges in the fabric.
 I needed a cheap laptop bag for work, I travel every month. Bought this as a cheap option for the first few months. Well today it finally showed its price point. Besides this its held up fine in every other reguard.
 I love this bag; I love the size &amp; the way it is made. It's really nice for the price. The material is nice. I was amazed at how nice the bag is. I am very pleased with this purchase. I would recommend this bag.
 Great computer bag at a supper low price. My Dell laptop (15 Inch) fits with a bit of extra space as I ordered the 17 Inch bag. This bag holds all my computer stuff, Mouse, Power Cord, charger and has two more zipper side pockets for even more stuff. This bag is well worth the low price and it is the one that I recommend to one and all.
 I bought this to use as a day bag to carry the things that i need when out and about town. It holds my reusable shopping bags when going to the grocery store. It's very light and well made. I don't use it to carry a computer/tablet. The rings where the shoulder strap connects to the bag seem very well done. That is where my last bag failed after 7 years.
 I got this to put my Kindle Fire (which I REALLY REALLY like) in, which is in a heavy plastic case, my journal, my wallet, check book, two sets of keys, and some papers I need to carry. I got it on the weekend and , I am thoroughly impressed. It appears to be really well made, AND was a great price.<br/> Amazon, I wish I had stock in your company. You keep making my life so much easier. Plus your customer service, and Kindle customer service  is EXCEPTIONAL.
 Very well made Amazon Basic item. You will easily pay twice as much for the same quality at the big box stores. the zipper compartment is a big plus and holds things in securely. It was an excellent buy for day to day transport of a 15 inch work laptop.  Highly recommend.
 Started fraying on the inside seams and top of the pad on the strap.  Only used it for the past 3 months.  Another thing, it would be beneficial if there is padding on the bottom of the bag.  No thick padding therefore it is easy for devices to get damaged.  Disappointing.
 second time buying this , my friends loved it so much one person wanted it bad , i love this bag its realllyyy w well made for the price , and u can use it for many things at the office and school and outside etc, good amazon value !!!!
 This is a very well-made bag with all the features you'd expect in a higher-priced bag.  There are enough pockets and dividers to keep your odds and ends from scratching up your tablet or Chromebook.  The 11.6-Inch model bag fits the HP Chromebook 11-1101 model just fine.  The zipper pulls are rugged and there is reinforcing stitches at appropriate places.
 I got this for my son's iPad3, for him to bring this in the car/school. He has a pretty substantial case on it, and it still fits easily in this bag, along with a notebook and a snack. Perfect for our needs!<br/>Now that we've had this for a while, I'd like to add that the zipper pulls keep falling off. My son has compromised fine motor skills, so not having a zipper pull kind of makes this difficult to use for him. I'm not sure why it was designed with the space in between the pull and the zipper, but it makes it too easy for them to fall off.
 Very nice bag.  Seems to well built and fits my Asus tp200 perfectly.  Like the extra pocket to carry all my necessary accessories.  I have had bags which cost twice as much with poor zipper performance, this bag seals smoothly and secure!  Highly recommended.
 Product is small and light as advertised. However I would not recommend this if you're traveling with a suitcase.  Normally on the back of laptop cases you can slip the laptop on the handle of the suit case. They made the hook to small, so it makes it difficult to handle the bag and suit case
 I really am disappointed with this bag/briefcase. I loved it at first sight but after a couple of months the cloth tore right by the middle close to the zipper and I often didn't even use the zipper.
 I bought this case for my husband's Nook Tablet.  I am very happy with it.  I was concerned after reading what a few people said, but so far I have found it is nice and will also hold my Kindle 2nd gen that is in a case with cord.  We like the idea of being able to put them both in a case that has a handle to carry them.  If anything goes wrong with this case, I will write back about it.  I especially like having the orange inside and the nice padding.  I also like the outside zipper pocket which is quite roomy.  This is really a good case, and I don't think you would go wrong ordering it especially for the price.
 I can pack and carry my Acer Chrome Book, its recharging unit, my Acer tablet and its recharging unit and a note pad I use for my logins.<br/><br/>The bag protects all of the above and is easy to carry by the handle or strap.<br/><br/>When we travel, I put it in the car trunk during the day and bring it into the hotel room at night.  The next day I repack the above and put the bag in the car trunk.
 Nice bag for the money! Holds my HP Pavilion laptop just fine. Also holds my Kindle Fire HD tablet, Droid Turbo cell phone, cordless mouse and charging cords. Bag has pretty good padding, nice zippers, plastic swivel snap on shoulder strap. Bag is as described!
 I like it. It fit my 15.6 laptop perfectly and has room for mouse, and power cord. I can tell right away that there could be more padding around the sides so don't drop it because I'm  sure it will protect the computer from a drop. I'd have given it a five star if it had more padding.
 Perfect!  Amazon Basics rocks!  Inexpensive but not cheaply made.  I bought this for my husband's birthday for his 17" laptop and he loves it.  He said it's a perfect fit, has enough extra storage for pens, documents, etc, can hand carry this, or use shoulder strap, and is well made. I'll be buying two more...one for me and my daughter.
 This bag is a nice fit for my 14" laptop and is fine for my purposes but there isn't much padding and it doesn't feel particularly sturdy.  If you are going to be lugging your laptop around a lot and need some genuine protection you probably want to spend your money on something more substantial.
 Buy these for all the company laptops.  Great bag with a great price.  Lots of pockets for the little stuff that always ends up in a laptop bag.
 Amazing! Fits everything great and isn't uncomfortable to wear. Definitely a good laptop bag at a great price. UPDATE: still works well but cushion on strap rips up pretty bad.
 I'm using this bag for work. It holds my Large lunch, Water, Documents, Safety Vest, Gloves, Bible, Vitamins. Pockets for Flashlight, Pen, eating utensils, Sanitizer, Sunblock Lotion, Lip-balm. Zippers move very easily. This Bag, handled carefully, will last for a few Years I believe. Highly Recommended.
 This is a good in-between bag for 14-inch computers and tablets.  It's disallows some of the bulky carry-alongs of larger bags, and it's better protected than the slim 'computer only' bags.
 I use the storage space to the full and noticed it started squeaking after a couple months on each step you take, at a normal pace when walking - annoying defect. It happens right at the place where the carrier band attaches to the bag. Maybe some oil might help or if the material wasn't plastic on plastic? Anyways, it served its purpose for the time that I needed it - but long term use is defective in this way.
 The bag is a functional bag to carry a laptop and a couple accessories with it.  However, the interior slip that one would normally put a laptop in is an extremely tight fit for my 15.6 inch screen laptop(dell inspiron 15 3000).  I have been putting my laptop inside the main pocket of the bag loose which is stable enough but not ideal if it were going to routinely picked up and set down it could damage the laptop.<br/><br/>The bag has a fairly nice fabric and comfortable strap so it's by no means a poorly made bag.  If you have a tablet or a thin laptop it's perfectly usable and I would recommend it as a simple travel bag.
 for the money this is just perfect.  i use it daily to carry my work stuff.  didnt want a backpack or any other bigger bag.  just wanted something to fit my 14" laptop, a power cord, wireless mouse, few folders, notebook, and pen.  this fits that perfectly.
 Simply a steal, I never thought I would find a bag like this for the price. I had scoured the Internet for weeks to find a bag for my rather large laptop. The only ones I could find were either over priced, dubious in quality, or sorely lacking. That is till I found this bad boy, this is easily comparable to bags that cost at least 2x as much. Its padded almost everywhere with a nice shoulder strap (which also is padded), the padding seems to be of high quality as well. The stitching seems quite durable and it has plenty of pockets and compartments especially at its price. Amazon does not joke around with their products it seems.
 I bought this for Dell Venue 8 Pro and accessories.  It's the perfect bag to carry the Venue 8 (8" tablet), my Kindle K3, Microsoft Wedge Keyboard, Microsoft Wedge Mouse, headphones, power cables, cell phone accessories, and other trinkets for travel.  The case fits equally nicely under a coach class seat, and when sitting at a window seat, the useless area between your ankle and the fuselage.  The material seems durable and seems to have some level of water resistance.
 This bag is great! It stores all of my gear and fits nicely around the neck. The pockets are easily accessible and it offers great protection for all of the devices inside. It's a great bag for a great price
 Okay I am sort of a fashionista when it comes to computer bags and I bought this bag originally 'to get by until I got the one I loved' and frankly it is the one I use all the time.<br/><br/>Don't be dissuaded by the low cost on this product -- the stitching/quality and construction is excellent.  I pack my MacBook Pro 13"  2015] + my ipad Mini Retina + headphones in this and it holds all comfortably.<br/><br/>A good bag that does what it's supposed to at a great price!
 We bought three of these for Christmas to give to our grand children. They absolutely love them and take then every where loaded up when their tablets, i Pods, phones, stylus, books and other goodies. They thank us often for them. It has also helped them keep their items stored together and have less of an issue with misplacing things. As always Amazon Basic's quality is there and they are holding up well for as much as they are being used.
 So cute! And for it to be a small bag, it’s very spacious!! My laptop (MacBook Air 11inch), the original Apple charger, and my planner fit... and I’m able to zip it up! The unattachable strap is a steal too! I carry mine as a “suitcase” and I love it! Also, you can order this bag in black so it doesn’t clash with any of your outfits for work/school either! (;
 This is a great laptop bag for the cost.  Has held up well so far, is nice looking, but just know that it doesn't have a lot of extra storage in it.  I would recommend if you are looking for a well made, basic laptop bag for a larger laptop.
 Actually a very good bag compared to other discount bags I've seen. It has a shoulder strap, several pockets and places to store paper or notebooks. Lightweight. Holds the laptop along with my charger, mouse, book of notes, and a few assorted cables and accessories. Wide HP laptop fits snugly, but fits fine. Not the the toughest or most durable or most padded I've seen, but it gets the laptop from work to car to home back and forth safely.
 This wasn't big enough for what I wanted it to be (a bag for my laptop and my textbooks) but I use it at work to lug around everything I need for meetings. Sturdy, lots of pockets for pens, note pads.  There is a little leeway for a clipboard, a large notepad, and some files after the laptop has been put in there.
 I needed a case for my new HP Pavilion 17" laptop.<br/><br/>I didn't need anything fancy or with all kinds of special features. I didn't need one with a lot of extra storage space beyond what was required for the laptop, its power adapter and cord, and a small mouse. And above all I didn't want one with a large, bulky profile, one that would feel like I was carrying--or rolling--a small suitcase.<br/><br/>Turns out this AmazonBasics bag was just what I was looking for.<br/><br/>It is indeed slim and compact, and it's lightweight to boot (only weighing about 1 lb.). And even when it's filled to the brim and weighs a good bit more, it STILL looks slim and compact.<br/><br/>For its economical price point, it is constructed very well, and thus should be quite durable for light to moderate use. The stitching is very tight and clean, with even strong, "zipper-stay" stitching being included on this inexpensive bag. The zippers themselves (which I tend to be picky about) are of very good quality, and open and close without much effort. The zipper pulls are ample in size and weight, and are very strong and sturdy. In other words, they're NOT cheap.<br/><br/>I appreciate the case's simple yet thoughtful design. I especially like the single, large, zippered pocket on the front "face" of the bag, where you can easily and conveniently keep oft-used items such as your phone, keys, power bank, and so forth. Too many laptop bags' outside pockets are unzippered, which I find both impractical and unsafe.<br/><br/>The AmazonBasics bag holds my laptop snugly and securely, yet I can still manage to squeeze in extra padding (about 3/8" thick and 1.5" wide) all around its perimeter. I do this because the case provides only the most minimal of padding throughout.  (Mind you, I wouldn't have expected sufficiently thick padding on a bargain bag such as this one, but it's worth bringing attention to nonetheless.) The upshot here is that, as well constructed as this case is, it's not designed to protect our laptops from accidental drops onto hard surfaces. There simply isn't enough shock-absorbing padding.<br/><br/>But frankly I'm not that worried about accidental drops. Rather, for my most pressing general needs--storing or transporting my laptop and keeping it free from dust, scratches, dents and the like--this AmazonBasics bag really fits the bill. It's easy to carry, and it's easy (and quick) to access your laptop.<br/><br/>I'm VERY happy with it, would buy another one without hesitation, and I highly recommend it!<br/><br/>Finally, my goal as a reviewer is always to try and help others make better informed decisions about potential Amazon products they may be considering. Toward that end, I hope in some small way that you may have found this helpful. Thanks for reading my review. Best of luck with your shopping!
 I use this bag every Sunday to carry my computer for media.  They have their own computer, I'm just used to mine.  Anyway, the case is great.  I can fit all of my items in it (mouse, mouse pad, phone, keys, wallet, and cord for my laptop).  Compact yet just what I need.  I highly recommend.
 This is the perfect affordable laptop bag. It has plenty of pockets, both zippered and interior ones, and I feel as though it's a perfect size. The strap is comfortable and I can put my laptop and tablet both in the bag with room to spare. I feel like it also keeps me more organized with the many compartments. The material seems very durable and for the price I paid, I definitely think it's a huge bargain. Everyone who sees it agrees that it's nice looking and are shocked that I paid so little for a great product.
 I got this for my husband's 17" laptop and the computer fits well inside the bag. There's lots of pockets in the front zipper pocket for all the accessories and the case is padded too.
 Really nice bag for the price. The iPad Pro 10.5 with the Zagg Rugged Messenger Keyboard case fits in it just about perfectly. The two exterior zippered pockets are going to be great for cables, chargers, pens and whatever.
 Perfect for my Think pad X220.<br/>Fits with a bit of room to spare.<br/>If you want more padding it's easy enough to add some foam or bubble wrap.<br/>The zippers are smooth and feel like they are durable.<br/>The fabric is tough and blemish free; no loose threads or missed stitches.<br/>The handles are perfect and seem to make the laptop feel lighter.<br/>I'm not constantly focused on not letting go.<br/>It is just a well made quality product.
 Got this bag for my Kindle Fire. I already have a case on the Fire, wanted something I could carry the Fire &amp; all of it's accessories in + keep it safe. This covers it. It looks nice, colors are sharp, front zipped pocket is a nice feature, its durable &amp; its has a thick padding inside for protection! It is bigger than the 7inch screen-Fire, but that's what I wanted. If your looking for a snug fit, would do better for 10inch tablets. Would also serve well for notebooks. However, if your looking to buy for the 7inch kindle as a case, &amp; not just a carrying bag, it would protect it, just not snugly like some of the smaller sleeves/cases. would recommend, happy shopping!
 As I have mentioned in other reviews, I always seek out AmazonBasics products when possible and this is no exception. We compared higher-priced laptop bags and none seemed to be any better that this very reasonably priced AmazonBasics bag. Once we received them, we were evenmore impressed with the quality if that is possible. We boughts these as Christmas gifts for our kids so they have yet to be put through their trials but based on the quality manufacturing of the bag coupled with the low price and great Amazon reputation, we are excited to give them to the kids.
 Wonderful travel case for my 9.7" iPad.  I'm able to keep all of my utility connection and charging cords to myriad computer accessories.  Many pockets to easily organize supplies.  Easy to carry.  Very durable.
 Great for the price.  Laptop fits comfortably inside and the power supply in the outside pouch.  I was worried the outside pouch would be "too tight" to put the power supply in without it mashing hard against the laptop inside but there is enough "looseness" to the compartment that it's fine.
 At this price point 5 stars NO PROBLEM.<br/><br/>Obviously its less than 15 bucks, so its not like I expected a Tumi here... But, I do have to say its as nice as some samsonite stuff I have.<br/><br/>Metal hardware for the shoulder straps would make a nice difference and I would welcome a price increase for them.<br/><br/>I use it for a 11 inch macbook air and an iPad air... I have cables, chargers, business cards and pens. Fits great. A great small briefcase.
 Bought this for my son's school computer that he takes back and forth to High School. He has a macbook pro and it fits it well. Only issue we've had is with the padded shoulder strap. It became frayed and worn within a month.  The rest of the bag is holding up well. The zippers are sturdy, straps are well placed and are holding up well. Inside is padded well and roomy. I do feel the padded part on the strap should have held up much, much longer though and that's why I docked a star.
 This was EXACTLY what i was needing! my 15.6 inch laptop fits perfectly in it with enough room to put my laptop cooler in with it. the out compartment still has room for my small 7inch e-reader, digital camera, laptop cables and a few small things like pens and my sunglasses case and wallet.<br/><br/>its got light padding enough to protect your stuff but not so much that its bulky. The adjustable strap has plastic clips, a minor flaw but probably could easily be fixed if you are handy and replaced with metal ones.
 Needed a quick laptop bag for business. Got this within 2 days using my prime account and was able to put my 12.6" laptop, an ipad air with a otterbox casing, a mifi jetpack, laptop charger and still have plenty space for other items.<br/><br/>Great quality product for very cheap! Cant go wrong! Definitely recommend this product.<br/><br/>Zippers are all good as well as shoulder straps.
 Well made. Just what I needed. Laptop fits nicely with enough room to slide in and out but not so big as to slide around inside when transporting.
 Perfect bag, perfect fit.  Laptop fits in snugly and there is plenty of extra pockets and such for my charging wire, additional items like backup drives, a mouse, whatever you might carry.  I like the fact that the shoulder strap is detachable so i can choose to carry it by the two handles and now have a strap dragging along on the floor getting torn and dirty.  I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a laptop bag that does not cost you an arm and a leg and offers everything you need.
 Very nice bag and the price was great! I just needed a smaller bag to carry my Microsoft Surface Pro 5 and it is great.  Offers enough room for the tablet, chargers, mice and a few folders as well.  I recommend.
 Love this bag! Fits my Ipad Pro 12.9" with or without a case on it. It has plenty of room for storage (ie. Cables, charger,Apple Pencil, and even my Apple Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard) for an affordable price. I use it to take my Ipad Pro out with me. I feel it protects my IPP well enough, especially since I can have a case on it and it will still fit in the Bag. It's big enough , yet not too bag for my IPP and it's accessories.
 I have purchased a number of these.  I like that they are light weight, have two extra zippered pockets and have a shoulder strap.  When you have to carry multiple computers at once, it is much appreciated.
 This bag can get the basic job done to store your laptop and and other stuff with enough compartments. However, it already shows major wear and tear after a year, especially at the corners of the bag. Overall, it doesn't protect the laptop necessarily because the layer is somewhat thin.<br/>Great starter. but with a similar or slight higher price, you can get some better ones from the brand Case Logic
 Very good bag for the price and very functional.<br/><br/>This is a great little bag for my needs.  It fits my work laptop - Dell 13.3 and my personal Acer tablet both in the main pocket.  Both cables fit alone with my phone charger, class case and various other "stuff" I carry in my bag.  I went on a long weekend trip and didn't have to add anything or put computer related things in my suitcase. Only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have an internal zipping pocket for valuables that you don't want to fall out went the pocket is open.
 The bag is well made and perfect in both size and weight.  Ample storage for papers, notepads, ect.<br/>The Lenovo 17.3 inch notepad fits in the bag without any issues.  The padding appears sufficient to protect the computer.<br/>After looking at computer sleeves and other carry bags, the Amazon Basic fit the need and cost of my needs.
 Fits the HP Pavilion x360 11.6" 11-k120nr which measures 12" x 8.1" just right, no stretch, even had a nano receiver not included in the measurements. Wanted something to hold the computer, power supply, HDMI/VGA dongle, mouse, and passport and usb drives. All fit OK. Just what I was looking for to store and transport. Yep not padded to take a drop, but padded just right for a simple storage and travel case that is the right size.
 Keep my Bible and two high capacity 40 cal. magazines in the bag just in case I encounter someone who wants to meet Jesus...one way or another. Amen.
 A very good basic bag, but a very good value considering the price. Appears to be well made and I would expected to hold up to travel. I use it for my 13" Mac Book Pro and the bag holds the laptop, charger, mouse, etc with some room to spare.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-RBCWX7F49XBP6"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1tz0e2KYqS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ypXx1c0aS.png"/> This product performs exactly as advertised, it allows me to carry around my 15.6 inch laptop. The first thing I noticed about this laptop bag is how light weight it is. Even with my laptop in the bag I can carry it very comfortably and with ease. The laptop bag has two interior pockets and two exterior pockets. These provide for ample storage space. I carry my laptop, charger, and wireless mouse with ease. The sides of the bag provide excellent padding and protection.<br/><br/>The reason this product is not a 5 star product is due to the limited padding on the corners of the bag. The corners on the bottom of the bag are not padded enough in my opinion. Considering these are likely the points that will take the most abuse I feel they should have been padded better. With that being said, I just make a conscious effort to set my laptop down lightly. I should probably have been setting it down lightly to begin with anyways.<br/><br/>I have read reviews stating that the straps that attach to the laptop bag have a tendency to fall off. I cannot comment on this nor can I knock off a star for this. I do not use my strap, I simply carry the bag by the top handles. If I ever use the straps I will make sure to update my review.<br/><br/>I have also included a video review.
 As a longtime leatherworker, I was extremely impressed by the quality and features of this laptop bag, and quite frankly stumped as to how Amazon is able to offer it for such a low price. Very nicely designed, excellent weight distribution.With multiple zippered sections and internal pockets, it has more than enough room for my laptop and accessories. With both handles and a padded shoulder strap, it makes light work of carrying and protecting my electronics.
 I was worried about whether this case would hold my tablet PC + all of the accessories I have, but it does. I have a tablet with a keyboard, an ethernet/USB cable, a power cord, wireless mouse/USB plugin (old school, large-style), external hard drive + USB cable, and USB expander. I fit all of that into this bag, and I still have room to spare for folded papers or my phone, keys, etc. it's nice having the external pocket to separate things as well. I wouldn't risk dropping my computer while in this, as it is only neoprene, but I feel confident carrying it around or putting it in my backpack.
 I am used to going to Macys and spending anywhere from $100.00-$200.00 on work bags.....today I decided to go Amazon Basics since I read many of the reviews (student loan payments kicked) so I needed to learn to spend more wisely and economically, this bag arrived, I was floored. The quality i excellent, great craftsmanship, excellent material, and it is the best bag I ever purchased, Good bye Macys (ha ha for some things) and hello Amazon Basics. I'm learning to make more wiser spending choices, and this one paid off.....
 I've had this bag for about three months now and I have no complaints at all with it. It's the perfect size for my laptop, cords, tablet, and a few notebooks for classes that I take. I also use it quite heavily so it's been well tested for these three months. I'll update my review after another 6 or so months but so far it's a great little bag. Definitely seems like it would be more expensive than I paid for it.
 For the price, this is a solid product. It's not overly hardened and heavy, but not a super soft case. I feel like it will protect my laptop, cooling pad, and other products placed inside while traveling. I have a 13.3 inch Laptop that fits perfectly inside. Plenty of room for all my cords, mouse, etc. Carrying strap has a nice pad, so that if you're carrying a heavy load, it shouldn't be too hard on your shoulder.<br/><br/>If I ever drop the case with my stuff inside, I'll be sure to update this review and add the information of how it goes.
 I have a large laptop, and have been using purses as a laptop bag. I finally gave in and purchased this bag and I am very pleased. Additional features include storage pockets for laptop accessories and an extra zipper bag for miscellaneous items. The strap is extra long when fully extended, and that works very well for me.
 I like the convenience of this bag for carrying my laptop + miscellaneous work papers either to/from work, or on business trip flights. I go back and forth between using the carrying handles and the shoulder strap. The three zippered pockets help to keep items organized.<br/>I have used the 17.3" bag for 1 year now, and before that used the smaller 15.6" bag for nearly 2 years before upgrading to a larger laptop.
 If you've seen any one of the multiple cases/sleeves available from companies like incase, then this case by AmazonBasics should be no surprise. Feels just the same as the other products of similar nature that cost 3 times more. The zippers are solidly constructed, and have ttthe amazon logo printed on them.Also, the inside is orange, which is kinda fun. Gotta show my love for the ol' black and gold.<br/><br/>The front pocket is sizable enough to hold my bulky tablet charger and tablet stand, but the main pocket fits a little snug. It's not a squeeze by any means to fit my tablet inside, but seeing as how my tablet's screen is 10.1 inches, I'm obviously pushing the 10 inch limit.<br/><br/>This is the first purchase I've made of an AmazonBasics item, and after handling the bag for a while I'm more at ease about buying AmazonBasics items in the future. I always wonder whether you can trust the boasts of generic brands saying they meet the same standards of the more expensive brands, but at least in the case of this case (HA! see what I did there?) amazon can make due on such a promise. Overall, satisfied, but not blown away. I expect this bag to outlive the specs on my tablet, which is all I could ask for.
 This bag is a quality product at a great price (you would normally have to pay three or four times the price for a similar product). It's perfect for someone who needs a laptop bag and not a fashion accessory (though it's not too shabby lookin'). It may not make any bold statements around the office (UGH LOOK AT ME AND MY LEATHER SATCHEL), but it fits my Chromebook safely and securely. I can also easily slip my iPad into the pocket without adding any significant bulk. Thanks, Amazon, for another awesome Basics product.
 For the money, I was not expecting much. What I got left me pleasantly surprised. I have an iPad 4 in an Otterbox Defender series case. This bag appears to be made specifically for both. It is simple, compact and has a front pocket that is great for storing charging equipment and my stylus. It basically ads handles to your iPad and SOME protection. The zipper pulls are huge in proportion to the case which I thought would bother me. What I found was they are great for opening in a hurry especially with gloves on. I may eventually out grow this bag but for now it suits my needs perfectly.
 I have been using this for over a year now with my hp omen 15. I use it every day to and from work. The plastic clips on the strap are still holding up fine. The seams and zippers are all in great shape<br/><br/>I have a fairly nice leather case that I never use just because this one has better pockets and I dont have to worry about keeping it clean<br/>Excellent value
 Perfect. Exactly what I wanted plus more.  This bag is durable and has more protective padding than other many other much more expensive laptops bags I've purchased before. Strong snaps and shoulder strap. What a value!  Nice job, Amazon. You got this really right.
 Great value. Fits the laptop well, and it feels secure. As another reviewer points out, it doesn't have a seem on the bottom in the middle, which means that your laptop won't hit the ground every time you set it down. I'm not a fashionable guy, but I think this looks pretty good. It's professional enough, though certainly a step below a nice briefcase.<br/><br/>Also, this has just the right amount of extra storage. You can fit a few folders, pens, and laptop accessories in the bag without making it too bulky. If you want to replace a backpack (think college or high school student), this won't let you store your lunch and/or a few things for the gym. But, it'll take everything you need for class.
 Smaller than I thought it would be and has only one extra pocket to put items into, and zipper opens on side so things will fall out if not closed
 I hardly ever write product reviews. Usually my thought is that if a product is decent enough that I don't' have to warn people to stay away. For this product, that is most certainly not the case. This bag is as flimsy as they come. There is hardly any padding on it. Your laptop will NOT be protected from anything other than dust. It isn't worth the money and considering it was less than $20, that is says a lot. The saying, "You get what you pay for" in this case is a huge understatement. Do yourself a favor buy a decent bag,
 Just received it, perfect size for what I ordered. I guess for the price it's great, it's just a tiny bit thinner then what I thought it'd be. I think I would buy again, I will update after I've used it a while and see how it holds up.
 I have a 10" notebook and I don't think the case is quite the exact measurements stated in ad.  Not easy to insert the notebook and once in the case there really isn't enough room in the other pockets to place anything
 This was a good bag. It did it's job. I only had it for two weeks and i returned it because of the shoulder padding. It was not enough padding and it was not the softies. I replaced it with amazon basic laptop backpack which has really good shoulder padding, I would have kept it if the padding on it was better. I carried 5.30 pounds on it. It is a good bag if you won't be carrying it for a long time and don't mind the padding for the shoulder.
 I carry this bag everywhere, whether it contains my computer or some books for public transit. It won't fit a lot more than your computer and charger. There've been times I had to overstuff it, but it worked. Lightweight and durable.
 Like the bag &amp; fits my 17.3" HP fine. My 1 star drop is for the un-padded corners. It is a padded case, But The most vulnerable spot is the corners when carrying it around. And that it where there is almost no padding. Those corners should have double or denser foam padding. That is the only improvement I would make, But a separate  compartment only for the external mouse would be even nicer. It get scratched up by the power charger in the zippered slot.
 I bought this for my 10" laptop &amp; I love it. It fits nicely &amp; has an outer pocket I use for my charger cord &amp; accessories. The material is soft &amp; stretches to fit extra "must have" items. I've had mine for over 2 years &amp; its still in great shape. It's a bit big for my 7" tablet, in fact, I put my tablet, my nephews tablet &amp; Segate portable hard drive in it &amp; had plenty of extra room w/o using the outer pocket. You can't beat the price to protect your investment, I highly recommend it.
 I've ordered lots of these for all our new employees, and no one has had any problems with them! Not one problem! So I just keep ordering more! It's great to know I can keep ordering these, and don't have to worry about them! The box of 10 is the best deal! I highly recommend these!
 I think the bag is a GREAT bag, but the material is not very good. I was not happy with the material as you can see in the photo I have added that the bag just ripped on me.
 It is good for work. I am able to fit Lenovo T420 and the charger. Also in the front pocket it will fit a small notebook, some pens and has small pockets for misc stuff.
 though I did not purchase this for my laptop, I have so many books carry for different church services and I don't carry a pocketbook, so this bag came in handy
 Good bag, felt the connections were a bit weak between strap and bag.  After reading other reviews of connections breaking bought carabiners to reinforce.  Fabric is very thin compared to the laptop bag I bought my son over a year ago for a lesser price.  I expect this to only last a year or less.
 This laptop bag works perfectly as my file holder for when I have court.  I easily have enough room to place all of my items in here.  The space is amazing and even if I wanted to put a laptop in here, I would still have enough space to add my files.  I love the detachable sling and the sling has a nice pad to ease the load should you need to put a laptop in here.  It is great for what I needed.
 When I first received it, not gonna lie, I didn't like the basic box it came in (could of had an Amazon logo or a sticker at most XDDDD).<br/><br/>But then I unboxed it and damn is it sexy.<br/>Multiple pockets, and alot of moving space for a portable charger, I love it!
 For the $17 delivered price this is hard to beat.  Seems sturdy, includes shoulder strap, fit my wife’s 17” laptop perfectly.  Much happiness in the household!
 I bought this for my daughter to use to carry her school laptop and it is already falling apart. She has used it less than a month and the stitching has already come apart on the shoulder pad. Now if this would have been at the end of the school year I could understand but 1 month after I purchased; that is just sub-par material and product. This was an Amazon branded product so I did expect it to last a little longer since they have affixed their brand to it. Oh well, this is the first and last time I purchase an Amazon branded anything.
 Was going to use for my iPad Mini.  I was disappointed.  Rather than seek to have it returned, I will figure something else for it's use.  Good price though.
 The overall bag still seems sturdy and intact, however, after only a few months of minimal use of basically carrying papers and a few misc. items, the pad in the middle of the shoulder strap has completely frayed on one side.  (see pic)  It says I am not eligible to return but possibly replaced.  (not sure how)  In any case, it is only the pad that needs to be replaced, not the whole bag.  Would not recommend this product.
 Very nice! I pack mine daily with a couple tablets a smartphone and a hotspot. If I only tote my Pixel C the bag is a tad large. It likes to be stuffed. It stretches like a wetsuit. Great zipper. Wish I had one slightly bigger for my Thinkpad X260. I cancelled the insurance on my ARM devices, all is safe in this bag.
 Exactly what I was looking for... simple and small laptop bag but big enough to carry a few misc items.<br/>If I had ONE thing I'd like improved it would be the shoulder strap. It's not very grippy so it slides off my shoulder depending on how I walk.
 I needed a small case for a Surface, which has a cover, but needed<br/>a way to carry, and this is working great, and really good price.
 Thick enough to protect my notebook. Has all adequate compartments. 3 zippered compartments. Main one has two large pockets on each side. Medium zippered front compartment has 2 small  pockets side by side, along with two small attachments to hook a pen or something similar, with good enough size for cables with room for a 7 or 8 inch thin tablet. The outermost zippered compartment is small enough for a cell phone and ipod and a few small knickknacks. It also has a detachable shoulder strap. The whole thing is pretty cushiony.
 Nicely constructed bag.  My Acer 15.6" Chromebook fits perfectly, and the power adapter slides into the front pocket as well.  Padding is fine, not ample but enough to keep the Chromebook safe under normal usage.  It is a minimalist bag, not a lot of fancy pockets or hardware, but everything is  what it needs to be.  Strap is long enough, handles are strong enough, solid zippers, and sturdy fabric.  Good value for the price.
 I bought this for my iPad2.  I use a Sena Portfolio Case, but needed something to use when traveling with more padding and handles.  I am so very happy with this bag.  Great quality.  Strong zipper.  Perfect size for the iPad inside the Sena Case. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Sena-Leather-Folio-for-iPad-2-161102/dp/B004YEJ26G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sena Leather Folio for iPad 2 (161102)</a> Side pocket holds the power cord with ease.<br/><br/>If anyone at Amazon is reading this review... please make a bag exactly like this to hold my 13.3" laptop (that I use for work). It's crazy that Amazon's quality is so much better than the Case Logic I'm using for my laptop and at a very reasonable price.
 Bought this little bag for my Dell Inspiron 2-in-1 and I couldn't be happier.  Fits the computer snugly but easily.  I also carry a USB DVD reader/player, the power supply, a couple small USB devices (network adapter, card reader), a couple of bootable CD's for emergency use, and some small thumb drives.  For the small size of the bag it has some nifty extra storage, and holds everything well.  Best of all you don't end up feeling like you're hauling around a laptop bag -- otherwise why get a small 2-in-1 computer?  It also has a nice strap that will let this bag slide over the handle of a cart/wheeled suitcase for ease of taking it with you on the road.<br/>I've used this for almost a year now and am thrilled with how functional, small and effective this is.  Highly recommended!
 GREAT BAG AND I LOVE IT EXCEPT FOR ONE REASON: THE BACK ZIPPER PULLED AWAY FROM THE FABRIC SO I HAVE ABOUT A 5" GAP AT THE CORNER. OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S PERFECT FRO WHAT I NEED. NOT SURE IF I SHOULD REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER ONE!
 I love these bags!  I bought the larger one last year for my daughter's laptop and it was great.  I needed a small one for my 11.6 inch CB-111 chrome book and after a lot of comparison shopping and reading reviews, came back to the 11.6 inch Amazon basics one.  I love the small size, the chromebook fits perfectly, with a section inside that will fit my iPad mini.
 I got this case for my Dell Venue 11 pro. Its made well for the price, seems durable and tough. Plenty of room in the front pocket for some accessories like a charger, small portable USB hub, maybe even a small mouse. But I don't use a mouse with my dell venue 11 pro, its got touch screen, so put my dell venue stylus and regular stylus in the pocket instead plus a few AAAA batteries(Streamlight 65030 Stylus AAAA Replacement Batteries, 6-Pack ).
 The bag is great! I bought the smaller one for the 7-10 sizes. I have an ASUS netbook with a 10" and it fits perfectly. I bought it to be able to travel with. The bag is made of neoprene material, it has large strong zippers and is very light weight.<br/><br/>It will protect your computer/tablet from scratches and wear, but it wont protect it from fall damage if you drop it from any great height. It works perfect for my daily use and travel with it and would recommend it if you are looking for a light carrier. For the price you cannot beat it.
 The 11.6 inch bag is a perfect fit for my Acer C720.  The zippered side pouch easily accommodates the charger and cord.  There's padding separating the side pouch and the main compartment holding the C720, which should offer acceptable protection from damage to the device by the charger if the bag gets bumped on the side. The main compartment is nicely padded on both sides.  This product appears to be well made from materials that look quite durable.  In my opinion it's a much better product that the low price might suggest.
 Just what I needed - a basic bag for the laptop, power supply and mouse.  The case seems well made with good quality fabric.  The laptop compartment is pretty well padded. The important part is that it fits inside my tote so two bags for the ease of one. Important when schlepping it through the airport (and screening)
 I put this on a hook in the bathroom but it slid off (my own fault). My laptop feel but thankfully no damage!!! After a year of using it (I use it every day to go to school) it only has one small hole in the bottom (surprising for its price and how often I use it). Only complaint is the plastic hooks squeak when I walk. Besides that I love it.
 I love this bag. I have my mini laptop about 11" that fits perfect with a folders and a reg size text book for college.<br/>I still have room for my charger and personal items etc. This bag feels like it will hold up for a few years, but then I don't throw it everywhere, or even put it on the floor. I do hustle back and forth on NYC PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, so it gets a pretty good workout lol<br/>So win win.
 I bought this for my new iPad. I have a leather case already on my iPad and was a little worried that it'll be too tight of a fit when i got it. When the package arrived, it was in a nice pull flap to open box. The material of this case feels very soft and amazingly durable. It's weather resistant which is huge. Living in NY our weather varies a lot and knowing it's protecting from the rain made me that much more happier. The orange and black work very well together. I wish I could describe the material a little better but it's hard to describe how amazing it feels. This is a bargain and a steal. Thanks Amazon for the wonderful case. I'm pro Amazon Basic!
 This is a DEAL.  Compares to far more expensive bags. Nothing not to love about it.
 It's one of those straightforward, nothing flashy laptop briefcases. If you want something simple and durable, definitely get this. I havent had a single issue and think for just being basic, it's great for the price.
 This is a beautiful, well-made bag and is perfect of my new 17.3' laptop.  It has dividers and several sections for other computer related gear.  I highly recommend this product.
 Love the bag, but the strap failed after two months.  Hinge mechanism on straps creaks on this and another variation of this bag, but just now the shoulder padding on the strap started to fall apart.  I use this bag every day for work - with a commute so shorts its embarrassing: so its not wear and tear.<br/><br/>I've since replaced this with a strap from a Lenovo laptop bag
 We have a 9in generic tablet and we also use a keyboard case with it. Our tablet with the case on fits nicely in this bag. The front pocket is great to put the charger and other accessories into. The price was amazing too. I could not find a comparable one for even close to what this one cost. It had free super saver shipping too so that was awesome as well. Why pay more to get a product that is the same or less!? The padding is just fine and with our case on our tablet it covers well and keeps it safe. I would definitely recommend this product. Shipping was amazingly super super fast too!Get one now.
 Love this little bag...quality, colors, fabric, features...but it's way too big for the iPad Air despite claims. Yes, it fits, but there's so much room that I fear the iPad could get damaged sliding around. I have a Zagg keyboard cover on my iPad Air and the combination is hefty. Inside this bag there's so much room for the unit to slide around it that it creates quite a bit of momentum and if I were to swing the bag a little and hit something I believe it would damage the iPad.<br/><br/>Had to return it, but think it's a great bag if what you have fits more snugly for protection/
 I do not plan on actyallt using this bag for use outside my home. I needed a place to sore some old things. A laptop, external cd/dvd drive, wireless mouse, old cellphone an old tablet with keyboard cover a few thimb drives and sd cards and all the chargers that go with it and other. It is a snug fit but everything is in there so im happy
 Magnificent little bag for a notebook (Acer 11.6 inch). Snug fit with spare battery and perhaps a few papers in the main section. Mouse, Power Supply, USB appliance (one of microscope, debug pod, scope, logic analyzer),  and a small Ethernet hub in the main side pocket, cables (Ethernet, Serial, USB etc.) in the small side pocket. Enough padding to provide a little protection while carrying and transporting it without adding too much bulk. I hardly ever use the shoulder strap, it's too small for it to be really effective. I can't imagine I would make anywhere near as much use of the notebook without it.
 is almost as comfortable as my previous one, i'm sure i will give it the 5th star in a couple of months once i forget about my previous one and get comfortable with the new zipper arrangement, other than that is a good product at a very good price, will keep rebuying this when in need
 Nice, sturdy and most items fit into the various pouches easily.  (The power cord to my laptop is the only awkward accessory for me to find a spot for).  If you're buying a new laptop/tablet, spend the extra $ and add this to your cart, unless you already have a carrier you prefer.
 I got this used from Amazon Warehouse,<br/><br/>My first impression was how clean and sharp it looks, It fits my laptop accessories perfectly. I would definitely recommend this bag over the more expensive alternatives.
 Purchased for a middle-schooler to transport a school issued chromebook back and forth to school everyday.  The bag and shoulder strap have held up well over several months even though the child weighs it down by cramming the bag full of papers, note books, and reading books around the chromebook.  I would have given it 5 stars but the padding on the shoulder strap is falling apart.
 This bag is just what I needed.  It is small enough to be easy to handle, yet has room for computer, cord, my phone and a few files.
 For a$9 laptop bag, this is excellent! Those who want extra features and quality, should buy a real expensive leather or canvas bag.
 This case is perfect for my iPad Pro 9.7. My iPad is already protected by my Apple Silicone case and Apple Smart Keyboard. Plenty of room for my accessories. The price is hard to beat too! I have another case which I use for my iPad Pro 9.7 when I travel. This is perfect for just carrying my iPad and few accessories when I am on the go. Highly recommended.
 I bought this for my Samsung  Series 5 Chromebook.<br/>I had been using a "sleeve"(strange name) for it &amp; while it's ok, it doesn't have  any padding, which I failed to realize when I bought it.<br/>This case is great for the Chromebook! Lots of padding &amp; space inside. Highly recommended!<br/>As a side note, I now use the "sleeve" for carrying my Roku &amp; cables for using it.
 Bought this for a small lightweight 11.5" Chromebook which fits perfectly. The front zippered pouch holds the charger and a mouse perfectly. Well made and light weight. It will ONLY fit a 11.5" laptop. Recommended.
 It securely holds my 15.6" Toshiba and few documents and disks in main compartment. And holds a lot in the second pocket, the small one in front I use for cell and laptop chargers
 Exterior is good quality and the padding seemed to be good, but the interior lacks in quality IMO. If you only carried your computer or tablet and it’s charger and mouse then it’s great, but if you carry battery packs or extra cords, both a tablet and computer, then I’d look elsewhere.
 This arrived earlier than expected, excellent quality and will easily hold up against the elements. It's not strictly waterproof, but I'm not worried about the rain. I can't wait to deck it out in pins. It easily fits my laptop, a phone, computer mouse, and other items for college.
 CHEAPLY MAD ..THE STRAP BROKE 1ST DAY...I WAS CARRYING MY LAPTOP TO AN APPOINTMENT AND THE STRAP TORE OFF...VERY VERY UPSET...BARELY HAD ENOUGH MONEY AND I NEEDED SOMETHING THAT WAS  AFFORDABLE, NOW I'M BACK TO NOTHING
 This case is the best I've ever had, and also the least expensive! My MacBook Pro 13 1/2" laptop fits snugly inside the main compartment, which is well-padded.The design is such that my other electronic items fit inside well, too, without feeling too cramped. In addition to my laptop, I carry the following: iPad, Kindle, calculator, cell phone, and all associated charge cords/adapters. Very nice professional appearance, well-constructed. Very happy with this, can't ask for more.
 I have nothing but problems with this computer.  after a month and a half of trying to make it work for me,  I ended up having to buy another computer since I missed the return window.  Constant problems logging in, no service number to call, and it finally crashed on me and wouldn't even turn on any more.
 This was a Christmas present for our grandson when he goes to college.  He loves it and his 17 inch computer fits in it perfectly!
 Seems like a good quality product (except for that smell, Made in China?!).  FYI, if you are buying this for iPad Mini 4 as I did, this thing is HUGE.......way too big for the mini, I could almost fit 2 in there, that's how big it is.  Bought the small one going by the size listed, mistake, but not worth returning!  :(
 Although this was purchased for someone else product appears to be a good quality product that is well made.  I would recommend this product to others who have need for this type of equipment.
 I bought this bag for a Dell Inspiron 11 3000 2-1. The Dell 2-1 fit snugly into the main pocket. Easy to get in and out. I added a Bluetooth mouse so the dongle on the side made it a little more interesting to get the laptop in and out but still no problems. There was a nice pocket to put the mouse too, which fit fine. Then I added the charger and cords to the outside zipper pocket. Now we're getting really snug, but still usable. Then I added a USB optical drive which is not much bigger than a CD/DVD and about as thick as the laptop itself. This one broke the camel's back. It just wouldn't all fit. So, if you're like me and want everything you'll need with the Inspiron 11 3000 2-1 all in the same bag, just get the 14" one like I did and it all fits perfectly.<br/><br/>This bag (11.6"), and its 14" brother, are amazingly well built for the price. Good stitching and sturdy zippers.
 I love the AmazonBasics bags, I have the 13 inch version which I use for my chromebook and now the 15.6 inch version for my main laptop.<br/>They provide adequate cushion that I feel safe lugging around my valuables and a reasonable amount of space for accessories and other items.<br/>They definitely aren't the biggest bags so don't think you'll fit a laptop, 2 books, and charger without it being awkward.
 It is nice.  I expected a tad bit larger size.  It was made for my computer size but if you have anything in the USB ports, such as a wireless mouse USB, it does not want to zip up.  Just having something as small as a USB makes it too snug if that gives you any indication of the size.  Wish I would have went with something a bit larger.  Would be great for a 15" laptop.
 This is the size I wanted. It is perfect size for  conference and meeting to carry documents and ipad etc. I am really enjoying this small bag. This bag came exactly as described by the seller and I think this a very good quality.
 Product as described. Very roomy lap top mouse and mouse pad allfit with roonto spare<br/><br/>Product as described. Very pleased with. Plenty of room for lap top, mouse pad, and mouse and I put a writing tablet in the zip pocket on side. Highly recommend.
 It's the perfect size and weight for travel.  Well sewn and good zippers.  The pockets and extras on the inside are well thought out.  Highly recommend for anyone with this size laptop.
 Affordable and good enough.<br/><br/>I just wish there is more dividers to keep things organized/separated.<br/>Also there are areas that could use some extra stitching/reenforcements.<br/><br/>Overall a good buy for the price and recommendable.
 My sister bought me the a sleeve for my laptop from AmazonBasic and I loved it. It was great for small trips around campus and to the coffee shops, but while on a roadtrip, I found that I could fit more stuff in my backpack if I didn't have my laptop in there. So I looked on AmazonBasic to see if they have a laptop bag. They did! I bought it and so far it's been great. It came in frustration-free packaging, which I appreciated. The bag itself was wonderfully made. It has the main compartment for my laptop with extra inner sleeves/pockets for fit a mouse, charging cable and my tablet. The shoulder strap has padding so your shoulder doesn't get too strained and can be adjusted if needed.
 I purchased this bag to  hold a small apple Bluetooth keyboard and accessories, so that I could use my Samsung tablet like a little netbook. I found I could put the keyboard, my Simplyvibe speaker (on top of the keyboard), and a whole mess of cables, flash drives, extra batteries, etc. etc. in this case. It has held up wonderfully and I'm very pleased with it. It's a simple case with one compartment in the front, and it served my needs perfectly. I would recommend it for all you normal netbook user types!
 It is always a good feeling when something that costs you very little ends up being a staple in your life.  Well, it has been over a year since I bought this bag, and I can honestly say it has been money well spent.<br/><br/>I have been using it on a daily basis, lugging my essentials (iPad Mini, Vita, portable battery, cables, papers, keys, wallet) to and from work, and not once did I feel buyer's remorse.  I cannot say what would happen if put through a stress test, but the fact that no aspect of the bag nagged me in a negative fashion speaks volumes.<br/><br/>As a caveat, I never used the bag to carry a laptop, so I cannot say how it would fare in that scenario, but for everything else, it's been great.  Even my cat loves it (she loves sleeping on top of it) and, as a bonus, the bag's outer material does not appear to attract the cat hairs that plague me constantly.
 I really like this bag for my new computer! It fits nicely within and extra room for all those little things you need.  Not expensive either!
 Instead of the top of the case opening to allow easy access, only the front of the case opens so you have to slide the laptop in/out from the front of the case.  Very difficult, poorly designed and cheap.  I definitely to not recommend.
 This bag was just what I was hopping for. It is simple, will hold hold the laptop and allow for a few extras. The price is great for as it says a Basic Laptop bag. If you need a bag to store a laptop, then pick up and move around to house or even take some where, this bag is one that will do the job. I will pay more attention to the AmazonBasiscs line.
 I love this bag and would have given it  5 stars, but the luggage strap on the bag is too small for some luggage handles. I went to a shoe repair place to have them unstitch the strap and restitch it wider. If I didn't love the bag, I would have not bothered getting this fixed and just returned the bag. It just needed to be about half an inch wider on each side.
 Just received this bag and I love it. I would not recommend buying this for a laptop smaller than 17.3 inches because even with my 17 inch laptop there's a lot of room. Nothing major but noticeable. There's plenty of room in the front pockets for my charger, mouse, pens, etc. There's even space for a regular sized notebook in the main compartment next to my laptop. Be warned--- there is not much padding on the corners of this bag. It's very minimal. But as long as you're not tossing this bag across the room I think you'll be fine. But if you're a klutz, or you have an expensive Macbook, I would recommend buying a different bag with better padding. I just happen to have a regular ole PC that isn't too fancy so I don't mind the scratches.<br/>I give it 4  stars for the price ($16.49), design, and style. I knock it down one star for the minimal padding. But overall, if you're on a budget, and you just need something to carry your laptop to and from places, this is more than enough. Nothing fancy. Cheap.<br/>I will update after a couple months to let you know the long term value/quality of this product.
 I bought two of these bags for 15" laptops and they both fit the laptops perfectly.  The seams and zippers appear to be sturdy and well built.  The bag provides good basic protection and has enough room for bricks and mice and such inside.  I'm very happy with this bag and would purchase it again.
 I admit it is "basic" but I carry (and not far either) a light laptop + folders, cords, notebooks etc, within and in a short time one of handles stitching gave out! Another week the other gave out and I now have to use the shoulder strap to carry. I'm watching those connections closely...I'll replace soon with something else. It was cheap so...
 It's held up pretty nicely so far. I was scared it would start falling apart within the first few months. My only complaint is the part that clips the strap to the bag squeaks and it's kind of annoying.
 Perfect fit for 13.3 laptop in 14" bag. Charger and mouse go easily in side pouch without looking weird. Sleeve even fits over laptop if needed. Unbelievable price for quality and design.
 I was looking for a light weight bag which I could use as a briefcase and not a computer bag.  This laptog bag is ideal for my purpose!  It is light yet holds a lot of papers and files.  The zipper works well and has never gotten stuck like the bag I used previously.  If I chose to, I could also slip my laptop in with the files.  There is enough room.  The bag was delivered very quickly and you cannot beat the price for this quality bag.  I highly recommend it!
 Just received my bag today so my comments are with regard to first impressions. I like the look bag and think it will do nicely for my laptop. I have a 17.3" HP and it slid with ease into the bag as did the cooling pad I also purchased. There seems to be plenty of room for te power cord, cordless mouse and anything else I might want to store. The overall quality and look of bag is as good as several bags I saw at WalMart and Office Depot that were quite a bit pricier.
 I love my bag and would recommend it to anybody. It has many compartments that are extremely durable. It’s the perfect fit for for my laptop, however, I feel that I would’ve been even more satisfied if I would’ve went up a size due to getting the smallest size. If you want to put books and other items in this bag, I would go up one size. Overall, the quality is amazing.
 Not a bad deal here....I used for all my really important papers and a lot of huge court docs....This is a nice case, simple and affordable. NICE JOB ON THAT SHOULDER STRAP PADDING!!! It's light, well built and holds a lot of things. Strong zippers and a lot of pockets. I wish they'd make these in other colors.....PINK would be nice. Packed great and arrived in great condition. Seems like good quality and I won't use it for every day use. My priority was not to carry my laptop....but if I have to this will work fine.
 I love this laptop travel bag.. It fits my Lenovo Flex 5 15.6 really well and has room for my Megabblast speaker.. Along with my mouse and pad. Made very well<br/>. Highly recommend it
 I've been looking for a small backpack or brief for a 13" laptop to travel with.  The size of this is perfect.  I wish the quality was a bit better (plastic hardware, interior fabric, shoulder strap).  Then again, it was a great deal - you get what you pay for.
 I only used this bag once or twice.  it was great for practical reasons when I neededt o car a laptop AND a tablet.  But not terribly stylish.  so if you're looking for something you'll get compliments on this is not the bag for you but if you're looking for something that is just a great, protective bag,  this is very reliable and a quality product
 Great bag, can't be beat for the price.<br/><br/>Compact, lightweight, plenty of pockets, seems reasonably well-made. It even looks nice and understated.<br/><br/>Fits my 11-inch ASUS Chromebook like a glove.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!
 Amazon copied other major case makers and the result is a fantastic bargain. Works well for netbooks but be warned that your Surface (RT, RT2, Pro, Pro 2) and iPad (retina and Air) will have some wiggle room on the top of the case. I'm not worried given the price but buyers should know this. If you're looking for a tight fitting case for these two devices then this case is not a winner. However, the benefit of this case is that you can store a small notebook or papers along with said two devices with some room to spare. Try that with a snug case!
 The was pretty much perfect for my needs. Looks good and has enough pockets/storage for I need when going to school. Only problem is mine ended up ripping on the inside. the stitching separating one of the compartments and the padding came off. its not too noticeable and doesn't just ruin the bag, but its still bad to happen. Haven't heard of it happening to anyone else so I just assume it was defect with mine.
 This bag is perfectly suitable, and the price is good. It would be nice if it came in other colors, and there isn't really a good place to put your laptop cord, the two outside pockets aren't quite the right size/depth.<br/><br/>My laptop fits inside easily, and is well protected inside. The measurement is correct.<br/><br/>Overall, a good bag when you need something utilitarian and cheap. Appears well made, so I will keep this one until it wears out.
 It does what it’s supposed to do and fits my laptop nicely. I just wish there was a girlier version than this hunk of guy case. It’s so ugly!!
 This was my first ever Amazon Basics purchase, got to say I was impressed.  Purchased this to hold and protect a Sony 9" Portable DVD Player for use on airline trips.  Well built construction, fit the DVD player without a problem, and soft non scratching material.  And as a bonus it has an extra zippered pocket on the side where I store two iPods, a set of noise canceling earphones and a couple of AAA batteries that I use with the earphones.<br/><br/>This portable Netbook Bag then fits easily into a backpack I utilize on flights.  The bag is also easily carried by itself via the attached handles.<br/><br/>Glad I bought it.
 for the price it can't be beat but there's virtually no padding on this, especially on the bottom.  i always take very good care of my laptops and have heard a clunk when setting this bag down (the clunk being the laptop).  if this bag were to drop accidentally there's very little support/cushioning
 I purchased this so that I could take it with me on a long overseas trip, and it was perfect.  It was not bulky.  It also had quite a few pockets, which was exactly what I needed.
 This was purchased as an anniversary gift for my fiance because his old computer bag was falling apart. He loves it, uses it every day. His only complaint was that he wished it had more pockets in the beginning, simply because he was used to using a bigger bag, but after months of daily use this has held up and proved itself to be a quality product. Money well spent.
 Bought as a temporary bag to use for my wife's laptop until she found one that she really liked, but she loves it so much that we probably wont' be replacing it. Fits our 15.6* ASUS laptop perfectly, has plenty of storage for accessories, and still isn't too bulky. We haven't used it for extensive travel, but for a quick driving trip out of town, and storage around the house, it's been perfect.
 This was the second half of a gift for a 15 year old in St. Maarten's.  When it arrived I was impressed with the bag and after comparing it with my "named" laptop bags felt the extra money wasn't worth purchasing a "named" bag.  I won't be needing any more laptop bags for myself but if I did I would purchase one of these.<br/>As a gift, it was a big hit, had everything she needed and more.  Would not hesitate to buy as a gift again.
 This is exactly the right size for my 11.6 inch Lenovo Yoga 3.  Not tight and there is room for other documents and charger, etc.  At the same time it is small and compact and easy to carry.  I like the ability to use the handle or the strap if I don't have a free hand.  It is padded and protects my laptop well, I just have to be careful not to drop it.  It is well made and sturdy, not sure why others have complained about the quality.  Can't beat the price and for that price I am well satisfied.
 This weighs next to nothing and is perfect for those who only need to carry the laptop itself and some peripherals, but if you have several documents you will want something bigger. I wish they labeled it Amazon Prime--Basics isn't the best word choice. The three pockets fit my mouse, MiFi, and spare phone charger, and I put the larger ultrabook charger in the front pocket. There are two slots for pens. It a highly efficient little bag and for my 6'7'' frame the strap meets the length requirement.
 this is a wonderful bag - the padding is thick and surrounds all sides, and best of all EVERYTHING - computer, power supply, mouse, fits perfectly with ample room for zippers to close smoothly and without putting pressure on any of the other items in the bag - enthusiastically recommended...
 perhaps I am an easy grader, but I feel that getting a decent quality product that does the job well at a bargain price deserves five stars. It fits my 15.6" dell laptop perfectly, but not sure it would work well for a larger screen.
 It's not beautiful, look at the picture, but it does carry a lot without being huge.  It fits my HP Pavilion TouchSmart, Kindle Fire 8.9, chargers for both, mouse, portable hard drive, several file folders and a note book, along with pens and a few other random small things, with a bit of room to spare.  It's not super squishy and I wouldn't drop it and expect no damage to your electronics.  However it makes an awesome way to carry all of your gear around and organize it at home as well.  The price is excellent for what you receive.
 I ordered this bag to carry a 10' tablet which it does extremely well, but the bag is so perfectly sized and well made it's become my everyday bag and used for a variety of electronic devices.
 Bought this bag as a replacement for my last bag (15.6"), after i received the XPS11 2-in-1 ... I have to say this is the best &lt;$15 you're going to find for a small and slim, versatile tablet/small laptop bag.<br/>the XPS11 fits perfectly into the centre sleeve and i also have a ipad + logitech keyboard combo in their own neoprene sleeve on the side of that... does not bulge out at all....<br/>the side compartment for the XPS11's power brick fits nicely and again, minimal bulge (brick isn't that large anyway) and i have room for a mouse and other small items.<br/>all in all ... price for value, this is unbeatable and i'm very happy to have bought it
 The spinning hinges on the arm strap squeak constantly when I walk and I feel like an idiot. I'm inclined to believe it's not a fluke since it's both sides that squeak. Otherwise, a nice bag that fulfills its purpose well.
 This is better than I expected.  For the price I was just expecting a simple bag, and in a couple months I was going to have to buy another one.  However what I got was a great bag with canvas and a great strap, very quality built and I can place my laptop with a couple school books in it as well.<br/><br/>Very pleased with this purchase.  Thank you.
 I like it because it is slim and for the most part unbranded. However, the plastic squeaks and it annoys the crap out of me. I can't be too upset for the price, but dang it is irritating. I think I might have to put WD 40 on it or something.
 Well constructed, thick neoprene with bright orange interior. The zipper pulls feel sturdy and the handles are well constructed. I have no doubts this will keep my device protected well!<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great little pouch, my only complaint is that the pocket on the front does not go all the way across (or have 2 zippers). I have a keyboard that goes with my 10 inch tablet, which is about 12" wide, so it doesn't fit in this case. If the pocket in the front had 2 zippers I could use it to hold the keyboard. As it is, I have to store it seperately.
 I have used this every day for quite awhile now to transport my Dell Chromebook 11 (a recommendation from Wirecutter).  It is, for the price, actually an unbelievable bag.<br/><br/>Every day I have my Chromebook, a Kindle Paperwhite, two pens, a short HDMI cable, a few small pieces of paper with  notes, and occasionally a small tablet.  This carries all of them easily.  There have been no frays in the stitching, no broken zippers, no fading of color, and no problems.  I carry it via the handles (I don't use the shoulder strap that came with it) and it does its job wonderfully.  I'm amazed at the level of quality for the price.  I'd definitely recommend this if you need something for a small netbook/Chromebook/tablet as an every day bag.
 This bag is awesome. For 16$ you can't beat that! Has plenty of pockets for all my cords &amp; even spare room if i want to toss a journal or papers in there too. Padding is pretty good, not as thick as other bag but those are gonna cost you, and for this price it's a steal for a broke college student. The orange accents stand out just nice, gives it a cool simple look. It's a pretty light bag, more on the slimmer side, which I prefer since I wanted something that had a lot of compartments but wasn't the size of a backpack. AmazonBasics is the Robin Hood for college students!
 Nice looking carrier. Only bad part is the pad for the shoulder is very cheaply made. The material covering the padding is very thin and it needs to be replaced. It's a shame since I need to look for a replacement just for that reason.
 This little bag is such a good deal!  Very lightweight but seems to be made very well.  The soft neoprene material is flexible and can handle different sized books and legal sized magazines.<br/>The orange inside makes it easy to find what I am looking for and the secret pocket on the outside holds pens and a bigger post-it notes for easy access.  No unnecessary bulkiness getting in my way.
 I found that Amazon had their own label on laptop cases at such a reasonable price.  I am completely satisfied with the quality and function of this case.  It is just what I was looking for to put my husband's new laptop in.  I like the double handles that straddle both sides of the zipper.  No worries about the case falling open at the zipper.  The shoulder strap seems to be plenty sturdy.  If I were to make one design change it would be a thicker padding at the bottom to protect the laptop a bit better.
 This case is good quality and cheaper than a lot of the higher end cases out there. It's very light weight and easy to handle. Amazon basic products are cheap and good quality!
 I bought two of these, one for myself and one for my daughter. They are well made and have enough room on the smaller outside pocket to slip your cellphone, maybe wallet and charges while your tablet rests on the inside. If you don't carry a lot in your purse this could be the perfect solution. You would be able to carry your electronics, wallet, and chargers all in one bag.
 For the price, this is a great bag. Originally bought it with the hope it would fit an alienware AW17R4, but it was slightly too big (went with a Bonvince backpack, which is another amazing product). However, this bag works great with my smaller laptop. It's well balanced while wearing it like a messenger bag. Most important, the zippers never get hung up. The bag is great for the days I travel light.
 Sadly doesn't fit my 17.3" laptop.  And to return it would cost $7 or something which was half of what I paid pretty much.  Kept it for my son's laptop if he ever needs to take it somewhere
 I fit a Chromebook, Tablet, Chomecast, headphone and cords for all those toys in here and they fit well. There was room and the bag wasn't bulging at the seams. This thing is the best small to medium sized electronics carrying case that I've ever bought. Also, as a guy, it looks good...it doesn't look or feel like you're carrying a man purse. That may seem like a weird thing to say, but I'm sure some people reading this will understand what I'm talking about.
 I bought a new 13" computer and it fits perfectly. It also has plenty of space for all my accessories. Not anything to dislike. I had the same type case for my 15" computer and it served me well.
 Updated : 26-11-2016.<br/><br/>  I purchased this Laptop's Bag because of its complexity. By comparation with the other many different kind of bags over there with the equal average price this one got my atention because the several pockets and spaces that not only let you take motion of the laptop but also place other kinds of stuffs.<br/>Its quality does meet my expectations since it's a 15$ Bag, and in someways it even pass it because I can also use it like a backpack.<br/><br/>Definitely satisfied with the Item, I hope it to last years and not to be easily scratched or unsewed. Would recommend it ++
 This case is worth twice the $$ Amazon asks. It is on par with a $30-35 Laptop or Tablet bag. Has 3 convenient zippered pockets with divisions inside. the mid-outer pocket expands for those odd shaped adapters &amp; wires. It COMES with a shoulder strap if you want to use one. The Handles are well made and comfortable to grip. And it LOOKS good. Very solid, tight construction. Other manufacturers should take note Definitely BUY ONE after being sure what size you need. LOVE IT.
 The bag lacks foam padding in CRUCIAL areas, so there is a not-so-small chance that any accidental drop causes damage to your laptop. In the pictures attached the red zone is the zone without any foam protection, it is the same in the 4 bottom corners of the bag. I will keep using it but i would absolutely not recommend this to anyone.
 The 11.6 inch fit my Google Chromebook perfectly.  Finding something was hard with my laptop.  I do not use the shoulder strap and use the handles when I use the bag.  Fits other stuff like sunglasses, reading glasses, a place for two pens, my hotspot and charger.
 The only bad thing about this case is that I gotta listen to my wife wishing she had one instead of the case she bought. Amazing what I can get in something so little. Affords reasonable protection to the tablet, and carries whatever else I absolutely have to have. And at a price that makes buying one a comfortable expense.
 I bought this for my boyfriend and it has seriously been an amazing bag. He loved it but unfortunately the top strap padding just starting ripping apart. It was great for about 8 months! This was with everyday use from home to office and/or school to be fair. I just wish it was more durable. It's so great I'm debating reordering for him or testing out something that will last closer to a few years.<br/><br/>Update 11. 4. 2016<br/>The bag is completely broken. I last a little over a year but it's been laid to rest now. RIP.
 This AmazonBasics 15.6-Inch Laptop and Tablet Bag is roomy and sufficiently sturdy. Not bad for the reasonable price.
 This wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. It's a lovely little bag that carries both my Kindle Fire &amp; Galaxy Tab along with their chargers snugly. The biggest issue I have with this is it's soft and very pliable. It offers little if any protection if dropped or banged against. I use it more for the convenience of keeping them all together &amp; carrying them about the house. For that I think its perfect.
 This is a great computer bag. More than enough room to hold a 15 inch laptop or microsoft surface. Plenty of pockets to keep organized too.  Has stood up to daily use and being packed full with paperwork for over a year. Still in great shape and looks new!
 Very roomy, Good quality. Saw these getting scalped on ebay for like $7 more than Amazon (and it's an Amazon product).Very happy with my purchase.
 I needed a bag to carry paperwork, clipboards, and extra supplies for my merchandising job, and this is perfect. Since this will spend more time riding in a cart as I walk store aisles, and not toting a laptop or a tablet, the shoulder strap issue won't be a concern.
 This is a great product. The screen size is perfect for me. The audio is just fine and picture quality superb.<br/>I needed to contact vendor on ear pods issue. I received a prompt and helpful answer...very satisfied.
 This makes my second of these; unfortunately my first one was stolen with the iPad inside.<br/>This is a perfect size for an iPad and the needed accessories including: AC/DC Charges, stylus, screen cleaner, and whatever else you may need.<br/>It is compact only as large as it needs to be. It fits in my check back right next to my Laptop and is utterly convenient.<br/>The material is a soft neoprene and fit my iPad-4 in an Otter Defender Case without issue.
 I'm absolutely impressed!  After leafing through the laptop bags at BestBuy I thought maybe I'd check Amazon for a better option.  Stumbled upon this one and figured for the price, it was worth a shot.  I was right... for the money, it's awesome!  No frills here, but it's a solid bag with everything I need.  Two enthusiastic thumbs up!
 i am so happy with this!  i am going to be traveling so that strap will come in handy and  when i am not traveling i can remove the strap and carry with the handle which is very comfortable in the hand!  i am so please with this...the compartments to store the charger for my laptop and for my phone wonderful!  I almost didn't get it because it only comes in black but i am happy i did and when Amazon designs this same make in colors i will purchase another!  And it was delivered on time!  Thank you Amazon!
 I use this case to transport a ASUS Transformer Tablet T100TAM; there's just enough room to slip the tablet with a Mulbess cover into the middle opening in the case. I'm trying to find just the right USB 3.0 right-angle adapter, and I already have found a similar micro USB 2.0 adapter, to allow the peripherals to remain plugged in so the ports remain as unworn as possible.
 I have been looking for a laptop bag that is large enough to hold my 17" laptop, cords, some folders, and maybe a few other small things. This one definitely does the job. It's not the prettiest bag, but it is very functional and has a surprising amount of room. I have a Toshiba Satellite, a laptop cooling stand, the power cord and my external hard drive in this bag all the time, and they all fit comfortably. I could add some files folders as needed. I highly recommend this bag!
 used it for a trip recently, and was very happy with it.  Two smaller tablets plus my laptop all went in here just fine.  the materials are durable &amp; the bag looks like it will last
 This works for my needs. I have not used the strip, as I prefer to just carry the lightweight bag. I bought this purposely for my Surface Pro 4, as I wanted to save my back's pain from my backpack for something perfect for my Surface Pro 4 and accessories.
 Great item at a great price. My one and only "con" is that the inside divider between the laptop slot and the tablet slot is thin material that makes me need to use 2 hands to get my tablet in the bag. My old case had a slightly stiffened rib at the top and I could slide my tablet in easier.  I'd buy this again in a heartbeat though.
 I like the thin-ness that this bag offers. I use ot for my Asus ROG 17 inch laptop. If feels snug without offering a bulky bag. Has room for chargers, mouse, phone chargers etc. I would buy again if I needed to.
 I have a couple of bags that I use for my laptop but needed one to carry for my tablet which wasn't as big.  Not only does it fit that but also my Kindle which both are in cases of their own and 4 chargers.  Also there is two outside pockets one which can hold a camera and cell phone and numerous other things like a pen, IPod and miscellaneous small things.  It is not bulky so will be easy to store under the seat on a plane.  I have to say I am completely satisfied with this purchase.  It was a bargain.
 The size is very good and the extra zippered slot is nice. The bad thing is that it had a strong smell of synthetic oil or fiber.  It is going away some, but it takes a while.  So, I only use it to transport my Fire 8; I don't leave it in there.
 Nice laptop bag.  My laptop fits in it perfectly and I can put all the accessories in the bag with it, too.  Good quality bag for a good price.
 Had a hard time finding a case under 16" locally.  This case is great for ultrabooks in the 14" and under category.  I can fit my Lenovo Yoga 14, adapter, mouse, notebook, pens, and graphing calculator in it.  It does look stuffed, but everything fit without problem.  The case looks well made, and employs a minimalist design that helps keep the size down.
 I've had good luck with amazonbasics products in the past, but I've either been 1) unlucky with this one or 2) the product is sub-par. The bag itself is decent to pretty nice, but at this rate I'll be in the market for a new bag in the near future. Not too happy about that, especially when considering my backpack has lasted over 8 years while being handled a lot harsher than this guy has. You get what you pay for, I guess.
 I am actually using this case for an Asus Transformer, which is the typical size of a 10" netbook. The neoprene is good and provides some padding (average or above average for a sleeve I'd say), and the zippers are heavy duty with good rubberized pulls. No complaints about the handles either. The small pocket on the back won't accommodate too large a power brick or cord, but I like that it does zipper up so nothing can get lost. The main compartment is the right dimensions for an appropriately tight (but not inconvenient) fit, and is just wide enough to slide a Kindle in along with the tablet.
 This case is a fabulous addition to my iPad Air supplies. It's large enough to hold my iPad Air as well as the keyboards that I bought. Anyone looking for a netbook for any piece of equipment this size, should definitely get one of these. Amazon is a great source for products and is so easy to work with. I love the fact that AMAZON is a secure site, and that they stand behind any product bought through their website.
 Replaced a Targus bag that worked very well, but was just too bulky for carrying around all the time. I just needed a smaller bag to carry the essentials I need for work and this bag rocks. Two heavy duty zipper pulls on the main section and one on the front side pocket make for a really secure feel. The neoprene is soft and seems to be pretty rugged so far, though I don't take it mountain climbing or deep sea diving with me (I don't even take me on those kinds of trips). I think it will last a good while before it starts falling apart (if it does...)
 A very nice little bag. Fits my 14 inch Lenovo Carbon X1 work laptop perfectly. My only dislike are the cheap plastic connectors for the strap. They feel like they could break any second. I had one of them magically undo itself without breaking since the mechanism that keeps them connected is not as strong as metal.
 Smells like strong neoprene-type rubber. As other reviews say, very little padding/protection for edges/corners. Overall though, better protected than a bare laptop.
 What a nifty computer bag for an excellent price! The bag is canvas, well constructed, and light in weight. I was nervous that my laptop might not fit in the bag. But after carefully studying the bag's dimensions and the laptop's dimensions, I decided to take a chance. And the laptop fit perfectly. I'm very, very pleased with this purchase!
 I needed a laptop bag that fit within the "free personal item" guidelines for the airline I was flying. This fit the bill at a great price. It's hard to find a bag that fits the dimensions they specify... especially since 17.3" laptop bags are difficult to come by. It has plenty of pockets so it was excellent as a carry on.
 Pretty good. Have not had this bag more than a few months, and use it pretty seldom. Even still, the wiring and boning of the bag are coming apart. I wish I'd bought the more expensive bag, just to help prevent that from happening.
 Great product and an awesome price!  Needed a laptop bag...nothing special and didn't want to spend a lot.  Have been using this bag for awhile now and have had no issues with it.  All the zippers work and there's actually a lot of storage.  Holds my Acer 15" laptop and Samsung Galaxy Tab along with charges and some of my files just fine. Can't beat the price!
 This is a very nice vertical sleeve, exactly what I needed. Unfortunately, it's way too big for my 13.3-inch MacBook Pro. Sadly, I had to return it.
 Sized just right for my use of my Galaxy 8.0 Tab A allowing for additional room for cables and accessory devices and preventing the "where is it?" syndrome. Substantial construction which should provide long life.
 A great standard laptop bag. Has two pockets inside and one big zippered pocket on the front that easily fit our dell laptop cord.
 good basic case, could use more padding if I had to say anything critical. I feel like if I set it down vertically it might hurt my macbook but the positive is that it's not bulky. Has enough padding though. Very pleased overall. Zippers are actually really smooth.
 seems to do the job protecting the laptop, would have liked a pocket on the other side of the outside of the case
 this bag was bought to hold a dell m4500 with an xl battery. the laptop itself is a 15.6", so i was a bit concerned that the xl battery sticking out the back would make the case fit too snugly for my taste. in short, it fits perfectly. also, the extra storage areas give me plenty of options for other documents, a spare battery, and all sorts of other accessories i might need. at $15, you can't ask for more!
 Everything is great, but the strap squeaks while walking which is very annoying.5
 Works but seems cheap.  It will protect your computer and sells at a good price.  Nothing to write home about but is sufficient.
 About half the price of the name brand and equal quality, making this a real bargain. I bought this for my HP 14-inch Chromebook and find it a perfect fit. The design provides plenty of protection and gives ample space for charger and other items to carry along such as pens and even cell phone of one is so inclined. Personally I keep my phone in my pocket.  The strap adjusts easily and is padded for very comfortable over-the-shoulder carrying. And it looks good, too.
 Usually I'm happy with Amazon basic brand. This bag is cheaply made and offers no protection for a laptop.  It's very lightweight you'll be saying goodbye to the laptop if you ever drop this bag.  The strap clips are cheap plastic just waiting to snap.  I purchased this as the item was for a 17 inch laptop, however you have to giggle it in as it is very snug. I would not recommend this bag.
 Works well for a 17.3" HP EliteBook 8740w. It can hold it and a four fan cooling pad in the middle compartment and it's power supply and mouse in the second. The front pouch holds a six foot CAT6 cable and some other little odds and ends.<br/><br/>Only two negatives. The shoulder pad needs more padding and the strap squeaks fairly loud where it rubs as it passes inside the shoulder pad.
 I was looking for a bag with a small form factor for to and from work. I needed to fit my surface pro, keyboard, charger and headphones. This bag does it all! With larger on-ear headphones the front does get a bit bulged, but other than that, it works well. the main pocket is quite roomy with a couple dividers to slide the surface into to protect the screen. The front pocket comfortably fits pens, digital storage, etc with room to spare. Great little bag - especially considering the very low price-point!
 Great bag for the price. Hope it survives the beating its about to get. Slightly smaller than my old 17.3 inch bag, which had an inside pouch which could house a 17.3 inch laptop. The inside pouch on this bag will NOT hold a laptop of this size. But the laptop will fit inside the bag nonetheless. I guess I've been spoilt so wont remove a star.
 This is the perfect bag for bringing laptop to and from work. Not bulky<br/>Good construction and priced nice.
 The case for the most part is sturdy and does what it's designed for.  The various pockets on the inside are good for keeping the inside of the case neat and tidy.<br/><br/>My only complaint about this bag is the strap.  It attaches to the bag with plastic clips, not metal, so when I'm carrying the case with the strap, the plastic clips rubbing on the plastic rings make a slightly irritating sound, so I opt just to use the handles.
 Doesn't make a fashion statement,  but for the price it's quite nice.  Seems sturdy, and we'll designed for the task.  It is 'basic' as the name says, and that's all I needed or expected.
 Great bag for my Fire 10" tablet.  Well padded, zippers all work, compartments for all the other little stuff I "need".
 My 17" HP laptop fits perfectly. The side pockets are large and the power supply fits in them.<br/>Excellent bag for the money.
 Good size, storage, padding and a great price
 Fits very well! I have a 17.3 inch laptop and the bag fits just right. There could be a little more protection but what I'm using it for I don't really need it. Perfect for someone who is only using it to get from point a to point b once and a while, if you want something for daily use I would probably get something with a little more protection.
 This is a very nice light weight case with a lot of pockets. My Chomebooks 14 fits perfectly inside this case.
 This is a low cost laptop bag. If you need something to put your computer in, and don't want to sink a lot of money into an expensive bag, this is what you want. It has enough space for a laptop, cords, mouse, USBs, pens, paper, and perhaps a few other items, but it is meant to be compact, which means carrying space is limited. I use this as my personal bag on flights, and any other time I know I will only need my laptop and accessories.
 This bag has been used not only as a laptop bag - stuffed with more, heavier stuff than it ought to be, zippers "coerced" closed - but also an impromptu puppy chew toy. Everything still works. No broken buckles, zippers, straps, fraying material.... and that says a lot!
 Pretty basic but serves every purpose I need. My 17.3 inch laptop fits great! For everyday users you might want better quality but for me I only use it about 6 times a year. Perfect for me. Price is great and descent quality!
 My husband purchased this around 2.5 years ago now and it holds up amazingly. It has withstood multiple trips (some international). The quality is out of this world. This holds his computer, pens, hard drive, note books, and little odds and ends that he uses. We have purchased many computer bags, Amazon knocked it out of the park with this product.
 I like this sleeve with handles for my iPad. It has an outside pocket that holds the power cord, my screen cleaning pad, and mifi device. I was a little disappointed in the relatively thin padding. Since my iPad has a protective cover, this sleeve is ok for it, but I would not want to carry my Asus Ee netbook in it because there is just not enough padding. Generally speaking I like the AmazonBasics products, but it would be nice if they had one other color option. I have two external hard drives, and I did not want the same color case for both because I wanted to be able to know which was which without unzipping the case. In any event, I like this sleeve for an iPad.
 Purchased three of these to hold tablets I had purchased for my grandchildren and it has been the best money I have ever spent.  Being kids these cases have been dropped, bumped and banged and have proved to be strong and durable. Made of a material meant to last and the various pockets inside convenient for additional accessories and for protecting tablet screens.  Very well made and reasonably priced.......kudos Amazon!
 I bought this for my work laptop and it really was an incredible value for the money. This is just as nice as a name brand bag I was given for a previous laptop, and the price can't be beat! The construction seems sturdy in every way and has held up for over six months without any sign of wear.
 I purchased so I had only 1 tote that would carry my laptop, my iPad (and anything else that is needed with these items) that I needed when traveling.  Very pleased with the quality!
 Shipping was super quick.  Product has a nice long strap that can be detached when needed.  Great product so far, keeps the laptop protected.  Only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that I thought the padding would be thicker.  Other than that, great product.
 My 17.3 inch laptop fits perfect. Room for pencils, book and notepad too. You’d be stupid to waste your money on anything fancier. This has everything you need.
 Great size, looks very professional and many pockets to store everything.  Inside it is also divided with room for  papers or files and one of the pockets has smaller pockets to store post its or clips and smaller things like that. Really versatile, exceptional price...love it!
 I'll get a compact case like this one with the idea of just carrying a few necessaries and saving space.  In this instance, I wanted something that would be plenty small enough for the "one personal item" that airlines allow you in addition to your one carry-on item.  It had to hold my tablet PC, some accessories, and a few other items.  Of course, once I get the case, I ease off on my original intention, and am always trying to fit just one more thing in there.  Right now, it's holding my Asus 10 inch tablet with docking keyboard, Kindle Paperwhite, a journal sized notebook, another notebook, a couple of power cords, a number of accessories like flash drives and a mini USB hub, some pens and pencils, and some other slim items.  This makes the case bulge a bit, but it still closes easily, and doesn't seem to be straining at the seams.  And if I wanted more space, both the Asus and the Kindle are inside leather covers which about double their thickness.  This provides some protection when they are out of the carrying case, but I could make a lot of room by removing those covers.  I don't carry a lot of papers around, typically, but for work could make enough room by just leaving out the Kindle.<br/><br/>I read the criticisms in some of the other reviews, but at this price, figured that it was worth a try.  For the 11.6 inch size I got, the padding actually seems pretty good, but as mentioned, the extra cover on the Asus provides additional safety.  Don't know if the included strap would have given way, but I had an extra one lying around, with metal clips.  I moved the shoulder pad to this strap, and am using it instead.<br/><br/>The case has now been through four flights, where it was jostled a bit and stored under the seat in front of me.  I've been taking it to work, and around wherever I need my little computer.  A couple of years down the road, when I replace my little Asus, I may or may not need a bigger case, but I expect this will still be useful for something.
 It looked nice but feels flimsy and weak I feel nervous to put heavy stuff like if I'm putting laptop and adding water bottle on the corner
 For the money, this is great value. Yes, it could use some padding in the bottom etc but for just a few dollars, this bag is pretty nice. It looks good too.
 I was disappointed when I got this at how much bigger the bag was than my iPad.  The iPad floated around in the bag, with about an extra inch of of space around the iPad on all 4 sides when in the bag.  I guess I wanted something that fit more like a glove.  It seemed well made, though.  The zippers were nice and the neoprene was of a decent thickness.  I also liked the carry handles and the zippered outside pocket.  I returned it and am going to try the Speck pixel case.  I'm looking for an inexpensive bag that will carry my iPad with its Luvvitt keyboard case attached.
 I bought this for my 10" ASUS netbook.  There was more than enough room for the netbook, more than anticipated.  I was thinking that it might be more like a neoprene sleeve, but It is not a problem.  On the plus side, the slightly extra space allows room for extra protection when traveling if you want to wrap your computer in a small towel or dishcloth before putting in the overhead compartments.  The side zippered compartment allow sufficient room for you charger, power cords and extra cables.  It is very well made.  I have had this for about one year now.
 I wanted something to carry my iPad that wasn't too big or too small, and this was perfect for that. I did put a small strip of foam on the bottom for a little added protection. What I really like was having both a shoulder strap and handle... The handle is great for quickly grabbing the bag out of the car. The only thing I wish is that it was just a tiny bit bigger so I could carry file folders that hold 8.5" x 11" paper.<br/><br/>I don't think I could find something better at the cheap price of this bag.
 I am very happy with this case!  I carry my 9.7" tablet , cel phone, chargers for both, ear buds, and business paperwork with room to spare.<br/>It is a very well made, quality  case with more than enough compartments and pockets for everything.  Buy with confidence, you will not<br/>be sorry.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a tablet case.  It also comes with a shoulder strap, they thought of everything with<br/>this case.  Thanks Amazon, you came through again!
 The inner lining started to fall apart after a few months of use.
 Perfectly designed, with multiple pockets and is durable and dependable.  I liked the one I had so much I ended up purchasing another for my son.  Both our bags we've had for a while and have taken many places and they still look and function like new.
 Right number of pockets and organizational slots. Built tough, resists spills, very light weight.
 As described, and fits my laptop great.  Has plenty of room for all of my work items plus laptop accessories.  Definitely going to look for more Amazon basic items for purchase now.  I had tried another brand but returned the item.  I am really impressed with this bag's quality for the price.
 I bought this when I had my transformer prime and it worked well.  Now, I've moved onto a 7 inch tablet and this is too big.  All the 7 inch neoprene cases I can find do not have the carry handles.  Anyone know of a 7 inch case just like this one with carry handles?
 This case has room for my 2 small tablets plus a couple small emergency chargers and a few accessories.  Well padded.  Good quality.  Would recommend.
 This is an outstanding bargain. Nice quality and excellent design. This holds my laptablet convertable, mouse usb hd, p.s., cords, flash drives, etc, conveniently and safely. And at a price that one might expect of a much lesser product. This was the first one I bought and it worked out so well, I bought another.
 Absolutely fit the bill.  Just got back from two weeks in Mexico, stuffed my laptop, kindle, chargers, sun glasses, and several magazines as well as all my travel documents. Plenty of room. Like the zipper pocket on the front for easy access to items. When it got too heavy the shoulder strap came in handy. Shows no sign of wear and tear and for the price I think it's a gem.
 I bought this for my new ASUS Flip 2-in-1 13.3" laptop.  Fits well in the 14" case, seems well padded, easy to carry and has lots of room for desk stuff.  Has a shoulder strap, but I probably won't need that.  I might not need this very often because I don't travel with my laptop much, but if it prevents one drop, it is worth it.  Price is good and so far, all of my Amazon Basics purchases have been happy ones.
 Does the job very well have not had any problems with it so far. I changed the strap out for one with stainless steel clips. Not really necessary I suppose.
 I bought this for 14" laptop but changed my mind &amp; got a 15.6" instead. But I decided to keep it &amp; glad I did, I used it to carry my 9" Tablet recently on a flight to FL. It was a perfect size  with compartments to hold it, charging cables, boarding passes, keys, change, cell phone &amp;  much more and fits perfectly under the plane seat.
 This bag fits the laptop, charger mouse, a small notebook and couple of pens. It doesn't have a lot of room for much else but that is exactly what I wanted. No issues, good quality, durable and has held up great after a year worth of carry.
 Definitely going to withstand a fire but super convenient for throwing the laptop and heading out. I have this and a simpler one that'd for just a quick run to the coffee shop. But this one is good for travel and for keeping a few more accessories with you. Not stretchy at all, don't try to fit a laptop that doesn't fit.
 I bought this bag to carry around my new Epson portable printer, and it works great. The printer fits in the main pocket and the rest, wired, paper and ink cartriges it the rest of the pockets. It's made strong scratch proof. Love it.
 17.3 laptop could barely fit into the case and once there the zipper couldn't make it around the edges of the laptop.
 A light-weight bag with a reasonable amount of room for the basics.<br/><br/>After several months of very limited use, the shoulder pad on the strap has pulled apart.  I use this bag to house a portable scanner.  It rarely is touched.  There is no reason why the pad should have pulled apart at the seam.
 Good quality for the price.  It has a divided chamber so you can put a laptop and a large book or some papers.  Shoulder strap is adjustable and convenient.  My shoulder pad ripped after a couple months of use, but I was able to glue it back in place. The bag compartments are not expandable.
 I had several bags for smaller, 15" screen laptops, but none of them accommodated my current, larger one.  While I am no longer working on the road, I needed a bag for those occasions where I bring my laptop with me.  This bag does the trick.  It would be too small and hard to get into if I were still a road warrior, but since I am not, this bag is perfect for my needs.
 Simple, durable case for laptop. Had it maybe four years? No real wear. I don't treat it roughly, but it sees daily use.
 This will fit an ipad4 with. Lifeproof case on it. The padding is not that thick, but it's a good value sleeve and has a pocket on the side for your headphones and charger. Heavier padding would get this a 5. That said I have 3 of these..... They really are decent for the price.
 Bag is holding up well so far. After warning from other reviews I ditched the shoulder strap, but I wouldn't really want to carry it that way anyway. This jut fits inside of my loose molle compatible backpack, would probably be too large for many bags. I appreciate the number of compartments this has for organizing other stuff.
 This bag, it's exactly what I was looking for!<br/>One thing that I would like, to add I guess, it's the bag to be made in other materials.<br/>I'm not complaining, it is a great bag.<br/>I can fit the 14.1 Toshiba laptop (obviously), charger, phones, wallet, external hard drive, mouse, papers (folder).<br/>I have actually dropped the bag (with laptop in it) twice, from about 2 feet, and has protected the laptop perfectly, not too high I know, but when you do drop it, even if it's two feet, it feels like your insides are falling :) so, it's nice to know it will be OK.<br/>I would definitively recommend anyone to get this bag. I would get another one myself, but then, I would need another laptop :(<br/>Get it!
 I have a Chromebook and wanted a padded carrying case. I had one of those stretchy types and it was such a tight fit I had trouble getting all my extras in there. This bag is nice and roomy while still compact. I like that it has a handle and strap. I can fit it in my backpack, too!<br/><br/>Someone mentioned the Amazon Basics logo but it's very small. I like that this doesn't stain and can be wiped clean. Very satisfied.
 Good quality case and zipper. Was glad to see that a 14" case would "just" fit a 14" Laptop with a 9 cell extended battery.
 Really like this case.  I have a note book and it works great with it.  Small and compact, but holds the note book and charging cables.
 Well made of heavy pack cloth material.  It holds my 10.5" iPad Pro with Logitech keyboard case, accessories and an Anker 18Ah back-up battery.<br/>This bag is an excellent bargain.  I've already recommended it to others.
 Quality feeling bag, good storage options, fits laptop well with a secure fit. Padding is good as well.
 Needed a decent laptop bag for a few laptops that were being hauled around. Picked a few of these bags up. As I am quickly finding, the amazon basics are pretty nice products for a bargain bin price. Several people actually wanted these instead of the more expensive cases purchased in the past from Office Depot.<br/><br/>Would say that these bags and AmazonBasics are well worth using.
 I have a new iPad that is supplied by work and is already contained in a case to protect it from damage (I'm a teacher in a school setting). I've been looking for a reasonably priced cushioned bag that will hold my iPad and protect it from bumps and scratches. This bag is perfect and is exactly what I was looking for...I didn't want it to be too snug because of the case so I ordered the bag that fits 7 to 10 inch Netbooks and iPads. This bag is well made and is a great fit - I also like the outside zippered pocket that holds my charger. I'm very pleased with my purchase and I'm glad that I read all of the reviews before I ordered - they helped me make my decision.<br/>bbw
 Right size and weight. Good construction. Since I do not use the shoulder strap the risk of breakage of the strap clips is not a factor for me.
 I am so happy this fits my MSI GT72!  It is a bit of a tight fit in the corners but it zippers closed fine.  Sturdy materials and plenty of room for the charger, a mouse, controller, etc.  There is a bit of padding that will help with small hits but not heavy duty protection.  Looks good enough to carry daily, does not add much weight to the contents.
 This is a really nice bag for the money and my chromebook fits perfectly in it with room for the battery and a mouse, as well as a notebook.  It offers plenty of protection and is perfect to take on vacation.
 Fit my Asus C213 just right, and still let's my pack in a tablet, phone, wallet, sunglasses.. love it!
 I needed a bag to replace the one that broke from another company that allegedly offered a lifetime guarantee. This bag from Amazon is actually quite durable, roomy, and is perfect for my needs.
 Was looking for a case to lug my IPad Air 2 around in from the car and back.  The handles work great.  However, there is too much room for the tablet to move around, and while the case products some protection, the moving back and forth and the shock it creates may lead to issues down the road.<br/><br/>Nice product, however much too large for an Ipad Air.
 I wanted a small bag I could use to carry my Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 tablet and associated accessories to and from meetings and when travely that didn't require a full office worth of materials. This bag fits the bill and is very well constructed with a great design and layout. Plenty of room for the tablet and essentials while being small enough to carry on my shoulder without feeling like a beast of burden. The construction and finishing details are well done.
 Excellent, roomy bag for the price. Fits my Eurocom M5 Pro with ease in the main compartment, and the brick charger fits fine in the next compartment. Even then, there is space to fit documents, mail, etc.  My only complaint is that padding on the bottom of the bag is sorely lacking. If you drop the back and it hits on a corner or the bottom side (bottom while vertically oriented), I would be shocked if the machine you are carrying isn't damaged.
 I bought this to use with my 13" Chromebook.  It fits great and has a few extra pockets to organize a few other things. You can't pack a ton of other things in this, but it will protect your small laptop well and give you the ability to carry it with you.  The case is well made, not stray threads, no problems with workmanship.  The price on this item on Amazon is really a great value.  You could spend more, but why?
 The only thing I could complain about would be that it collects dirt really easily. If you have pets with light fur (like mine), this case will almost never be clean. If you would ever consider using it in a professional environment, I would keep a lint roller on hand.<br/><br/>Otherwise the case is really comfortable to carry, is really sturdily built, and even with the pocket fully loaded with chargers, earphones and misc wires, never feels bulky or awkward.
 I like it because it has padding inside I also was able to put my PlayStation 4 in there when I wasn't using my laptop
 I bought this to carry my Dell Venue 11 Pro 7140 to work and back.  I can carry the Venue with the ridgid keyboard attached, and the soft stand, plus allot of extras.  I usually have a 2TV usb 3.0 drive, micro hdmi to vga adapter, usb 3.0 hub with ethernet, usb 3.0 sd reader, and my spare power supply.<br/><br/>Seems to be great quality, light, and good looking.  It provides allot of protection around the tablet.
 The material seems a bit flimsy, but it looks nice. My son is in 6th grade and this was the perfect size and price for his needs.
 I bought 14 of these for classroom teacher's aides. It fits and protects the 14" Chromebook perfectly in a separate section--with room for the notebook, power cord, file folders, and mobile office essentials. Convenient outside pockets on front and back. Durable zippers. Padded removable shoulder strap or handles.
 So the bag is great, it holds my laptop, mouse, cables and even a folder. The only thing is, the comfort pad shoulder strap has started to fray a little
 Quality construction.  Plenty of room for my 15.5 inch Lenovo laptop.  Lots of extra pockets to carry accessories.  Exactly what I was looking for.
 Great little bag. Purchased this for my new iPad Pro 9.7" tablet with keyboard. I wanted something a little bigger than the tablet and this was perfect. Built in pockets keep the charger from rattling around and the pencil/pen holder is a nice touch. Light, durable and seems well made.
 Amazing bag. My laptop is 15” and it fits perfect and provides tons of room for all my other items.
 Well made. Good sturdy construction. It's made out of nylon, like what a traditional backpack is made of. Just make sure you get the right size for your device. I bought a portable DVD player from Amazon and the Amazon site suggested I buy this bag. I purchased the one they suggested for the portable DVD player and it was too small. I later bought this bigger size.
 Roomy enough for my 17 inch laptop, cables, mouse and a few folders. Have not had any issues with strap coming off as reported by some. Bag does not have a lot of padding but works well as a travel tote.
 It's a nice bag. However, it's prone to ripping. Within the first two months, a hole ripped near the main zipper.<br/><br/>Also, one should put the laptop in a sleeve before putting it in the bag. The bag padding itself is inadequate for anything other than a light fall.<br/><br/>It's pretty spacious. I can fit a 15.6in laptop, the charger, a mouse, 3 spirals, and still have rooms for a lot of other misc junk.
 I have a need for light weight padded crossbody bags for various task.  This time I needed a Tablet travel case and this fit my needs.
 The only nick I have is that the hinges squeak (at the strap clasp) when they move around. Other than that, this thing is perfect. No nonsense. Everything you need and nothing you don't. Fits my Dell 14" perfectly.<br/><br/>&lt;edit&gt;<br/>After owning this a few months, the bag holds up really well. The hinge squeak, however, has not gone away. It is really, really annoying when you walk around with the bag strapped to your shoulder. I might just buy a new strap for it.
 I like this bag. its compact and I can fit pretty much everything I need for the day.<br/><br/>I carry pencils and pens obviously, one TI-83 calculator, 100 page notepad, 3 subject notebook, a folder and a small laptop that is only an inch wide. It all fits perfectly. I could probably get away with putting a 1" binder but it would barely fit.<br/><br/>My only wish is for it to have an outside pocket to put a water bottle in. Other than that this is a pretty decent bag for the price.
 I needed an inexpensive bag for an old HP notebook.  Since the notebook is very old and is used only as a portable computer, I didn't want to spend a great deal of money on a bag.  I had some concerns about the inside dimensions vs. my notebook size but found that it has plenty of room for the notebook plus power supply, mouse and portable USB lamp.  It also has a pocket for literature or other things.<br/><br/>I gave it 4 stars only because it is a $14.00 bag and doesn't have the quality one would expect in a laptop bag.  However, for a cheap case, it is a 5 star!
 This is just what we needed for our 15.6" laptops.  We don't want to lug anything larger and these work perfectly for our needs.
 love this bag it's padded and I feel it will be protection for my grand daughters lap top and the long and short handles make it easy to carry
 This bag couldn't be better in my opinion, it's perfectly small but with enough pocket space to hold my wall charger, mouse pad, mouse, and miscellaneous cables. I had another laptop bag before this one but the zippers broke and they ran all around the case so it became useless; thankfully this bag has zippers that only run along the top. That's my favorite part about this bag honestly, even if the zipper eventually does break it won't be necessary to replace.
 We put this thing through hell and back.  This carries the sound computer for our comedy troupe and it has been a work horse.  Great separate storage pockets, sturdy and should last through our next computer.  Only wish it came in another color, preferably red.
 Great little bag! It provides space for the iPad, and an extra pocket for "stuff:" a little portable stand, my reading glasses, and a stylus. HINT: I made a "stiffener" for the bag out of corrugated cardboard: it helps protect the iPad screen from damage from the extra items poking it, and allows me to use the bag as a little "lap table" so I can sit the iPad in the stand on the table on my lap so I can read, play chess, etc.<br/><br/>UPDATE 8/31/14: Just got another one! 😃
 I really like this bag.  It gives my computer good protection while traveling with it.  I liked it so well that I ordered a second one for my husband.  I also like the pockets and compartments in the bag.  I can carry extra accessories for my computer as well as a nice pocket to use for carrying papers.  I would order again.
 Seam split within two weeks.  I used the item 3 or 4 times.  It was not handled roughly - I mean it's carrying my work computer, never stuffed it full of papers, equipment, just the laptop.  Accessories (charger, mouse , etc.) stored in separate bag.  Crummy construction, not worth a dime.
 The reason I give it 3 stars only is because it does not open up like a book allowing the laptop to travel through a TSA checkpoint without having to remove the laptop completely from the bag.
 I love this bag! I originally purchased it as a throwaway item that I'd use a couple of times but it has turned out to be my daily go-to bag for my Surface Pro 3. Plenty of room for my device, charger, pens, notebook, phone, phone charger, etc. Keeps me from having to carry a bulky backpack around! 10/10 - would definitely buy again.
 Great little zip bag for the money.  It is sturdy and well made. I use it for my 7" Nook tablet which has a cover on it.  I love the large outside zipper pocket where I can put headphones, charging cord, etc. I have even put my GPS in this pocket.  I like the extra touch of the 1-1/2" rubbery zipper pulls, one on each end of the main zip opening and one on the outside zipper pocket. I am very pleased with this item.
 When assigning star ratings I believe you must consider what you paid for the item. For instance,  had I paid double the money, I might find a portfolio that is better made and more versatile. Given what this item costs, it is well worth the money. Well made, practical and simple. I'd buy it again.
 Strong, lightweight carry case. It is fabric and not vinyl so it is lighter and maybe less prone to tearing. Doesn't have as many pockets as my old one, but that's less junk to carry.
 I use the 11.6-inch version with my Surface Go.  I store use my Surface Go in a sleeve and put the sleeved Go into the bag.  Works great.
 I needed a bag to carry my work laptop and this bag is great! It holds my laptop and other work items without feeling too bulky. Great price as well.
 I just received this laptop bag for use with my 15.6 inch laptop.  I am very impressed, as it has good quality and enough zippered compartments for accessories and file folders.  It is a great value, and I definitely recommend without reservation.
 This is just what I needed! My 17 inch laptop fits snug in here, length wise, but I'm able to also fit our other laptop in, as it is wide enough for two! Extra pockets to keep cords, memory cards, etc. I love the option of the briefcase handle or shoulder bag style... and so far it's holding up really well! It still looks and feels brand new, despite daily use.
 I was given  one as a gift and liked it so much I bought one for my granddaughter for school, she loves it.
 This is a great value.  I carry a 13.3" laptop and a Nexus 7, along with power cord and cordless mouse, along with pad of paper and pens, and all fit quite comfortably with good padding/protection.  Good handle, easy on your hand.  Shoulder strap makes it easy for a ride on the T and a walk from train station to the office.  Amazon has done a really good job with this, and at under $15, it's a real bargain.  I highly recommend it.
 Very nice computer bag or messenger bag. Much more roomier than it looked in the pictures and has a nice sleek design to it. I can also use this as my ever day bag with or without my laptop in it.
 Love the bag. I use it to carry my surface when I travel. Kind of looks like a man purse but I'm ok with that. Only wish it had more pockets.  Maybe a secondary big pocket for papers.
 The side pocket which is also padded is where I store my iPad4;  the big pocket in the middle is where I store my full-size Anker bluetooth keyboard, and I am sure I'll be using the extra space for other stuff in time.  I wanted the smaller one to start with, but it wasn't available when I was looking, so I bought this one;  as it turns out, I'm glad I've got this slightly bigger one 'cause I can fit the full size keyboard in it, too.
 This works really well for the Bose Soundlink III as a travel carrying case, where you simply want to get the speaker from point A to point B without throwing it into a bag naked.  I can fit the speaker unit very easily and it has nice padding to protect it.  Plus, I have more than enough room leftover for the charger (for the record, I don't have the authentic Bose cover for the Soundlink III, so I don't know if the speaker fits in this case with the cover on, if that helps at all).  Love this thing!
 It is nice and roomy. I like the look, however, I wish they would take off the orange thread and use black or grey. I do not like the way that stands out. The bag could also use a little more padding. I have no problem putting my cheaper school laptop in it, but I am a little afraid to put my more expensive gaming laptop in it. Overall, it is a nice bag for the price.
 While it appeared sturdy online, when I used it just a bit, it lost some of its quality.  I hope it holds up, as I gave it as a gift to my grandson.  It zips well, and the handles are good.  The pocket on the front is large enough.
 This bag has great quality. It fits my approximately 14 1/2" ASUS flip laptop perfectly! The handles are nice and thick. The shoulder strap comes with a padded shoulder rest. It has ample pockets for an additional electronic, such as an iPad, and cords, plus smaller pockets for flash drives, etcetera. Speaking of ample pockets, there is also adequate padding between pockets to prevent breaks. Thanks!
 Bought of my Surface when I go places.  It is compact, but I am able to fit everything in it.<br/>Have had for a few years now and it's great.
 I will be buying another one because the size is perfectly small and compact. Fits my iPad Air, its accessories, and my other gadgets and items (i.e. smartphone, iTouch, etc...). The second one will be used for work: lunch, papers, notebook(s), and many other items to carry around town here in Los Angeles, California, USA. There is a tiny Amazon logo on the bag, but I don't mind because the quality of the bag is what I pay attention to the most..
 I purchased one of these a few years back for my wife's IPAD and it does a great job for the money.  I decided to get another for my Samsung 10.1 note and the bag fits the tablet perfectly. However, when I opened the plastic bag it was packed in, the petroleum smell was pretty darn strong.  my first purchase did not have that odor.  I am hoping this will dissipate over time.  if you take the odor issue out of the equation, this bag is a great value and is well made.
 Solid item. If you don’t care of your stuff you ain’t got stuff. Prior bad review are most likely from those who don’t follow the rule.
 Some people have complained that there's no cushioning in the corners, but I haven't noticed that at all. Maybe they fixed it since then, but the bag is fully insulated and I am very comfortable keeping my laptop in it.
 I really like the laptop bag as it was bought to protect the computer and it does that well in a convenient package.
 Seems like a durable bag and serves its purpose for carrying my 15.6” laptop and accessories for a very reasonable price.
 Absolutely what I was looking for!!  I travel to construction sites for a living and needed something that was small enough that I could sling it over my body without it being a third appendage.  This works brilliantly with a not to big, very light, and plenty of spare room for mouse and power cordage.  If you have a Microsoft surface pro 3 this is the bag to get!!  I also added the Urban Armor Gear to this and it still slides in and out of the bag easily.<br/>The bag is small enough that when I travel I tuck the entire bag with Surface into my Targus messenger bag.  Then pop the whole bag out when I get to site or on the plane.
 I purchased this bag back in October 2015, and have barely used it. I recently noticed that there is a defect in the shoulder strap where it looks like the stitches missed the material (see attached photo.) I am disappointed because I had a high opinion of Amazon's quality.
 This review is about the 7-10" tablet bag. There is very little padding in the bag. I don't think a tablet would survive a fall in this bag.
 I am very pleased with the AmazonBasics Netbook bag.  It is lightweight, very well padded and easy to carry, either using the permanently attached carry handles or just under the arm.  The separate, zippered, front compartment is especially useful for cables, connectors, adapters, etc. A major strength of this case is the heavy duty zippers for both the iPad/Netbook and accessories compartments.  I had to discard another brand of carry case I had previously purchased when its, thin, standard duty zipper broke. I would highly recommend this case to those wishing to carry an IPad, netbook or other tablet device of similar dimensions.
 I read the reviews before buying this and I read that the strap broke and their mac laptops were dented because of lack of cushioning. Those people are just careless individuals that like to mistreat their things and expect it to be unbreakbale. If you are one of these people, don't buy this. If you take care of your things, then this is definitely worth the money.
 I love this bag and the storage it offers. Many pockets and plenty of room for papers, accessories, and whatever else. Padded for protection and I like the shoulder strap option. It is a quality bag and I am happy with this purchase.
 Nice quality bag and plenty of room inside with pockets inside and out to carry other electronic devices.
 I picked this up for my Macbook Air. It fit great and the construction is pretty solid overall. Unfortunately, there are no corner guards or even any sort of corner padding AT ALL, just the thickness of the fabric. I found this out the hard way when my bag slipped off my shoulder and landed corner first onto the pavement. A 2ft fall resulted in a large deformation on the corner of my MacBook. Luckily, that was the worst of it. Had I realized this, I would have spent a little more for the additional protection. Other than that, the materials are pretty good. The fabric is thick and moisture repellent. Very lightweight and minimalist. Don’t expect to carry much more than the essentials.
 Quite sturdy, and holds not only the laptop, but also the cooling pad, in the main compartment, and peripherals, power plug, gaming mouse, and USB data hub in exterior pockets.  Keeps all the gear clean and safe.
 I have a 13 inch DVD Player I use for this bag. With this being 14 inches thought I would have more room. When I try an zip it up it is snug. The zipper even hits up against the player while trying to zip it up.
 In the past, I've purchased Case Logic laptop bags and been happy with them. This time, I thought I'd try the AmazonBasics bag, and I'm very happy with it!! There seems to be more room, zippers move easily, and I'm thrilled with the whole thing!  I would definitely buy this again, and would also recommend to anyone else.....it is very nice!!!
 I purchased this for my surface 4 pro. I love it! I can not only store my tablet and keyboard, but also a mouse, power supply, my Samsung tab s2 9.7 w/kb, and several other small items. I ditched my larger backpack and will use this as my sole personal item when I travel.
 Durable product, fits my Toshiba Radius 11.6" laptop like a glove.  Unfortunately, like a glove, there is not much room for anything else.  I can barely get the power adapter and portable mouse inside the laptop compartment  There is no way it would fit in the front pocket.  I suppose I could have gone with a larger product but I wanted something more compact and that is exactly what I got.
 I bought this for my granddaughter for college. She bought a smaller laptop, or I guess they call the smaller one's tablets. The reason I chose this one is that she had room for her phone, keys, charger and other things she may need. She has had it awhile now and she like it very much. She said no problems and uses it daily. I do recommend it.
 All things fine but too big size for ipad
 My 17” inch laptop fits perfectly. Great storage space without the bulkyness of a larger bag.
 This tablet bag is perfect for my Acer Chromebook 11'6". Is exactly as described and well made. My Chromebook fits perfect, has a zippered pouch for the power cords, and another zippered pouch for all my USB and SD Cards I like to carry. Nice handles and shoulder strap. Couldn't ask for anything more. I'm picky and I am very pleased with this tablet bag. You can stop looking for anything else.
 The is without a doubt one of the best bags that's out there. It's well made and at a great price. It holds my Surface Pro 4 w/ flat MS mouse, my iPad and all the plugs and cords I need snugly, without stuffing. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
 Great for Mac Book Pro 15 inch with minimal extras.  I carry the full power cable, an external mouse and the laptop within a sleeve.  There is very little room for anything else.  However, it is easy to transport my MBP from the office to home.  I have a large case I use to travel with which allows me to take additional drives, cables, etc.
 Just received the 11.6 laptop/tablet bag.  I have an iPad Air that I wanted a bag to carry it in.  I looked specifically for an iPad Air bag but couldn't find one.  I ordered this bag and it works perfectly for my iPad Air--including the shoulder strap which none of the others had. The pockets also include enough room for the Chargers, etc.  Highly recommend this bag to anyone wanting a carrying bag for their iPad Air.
 Amazingly useful. Big enough to carry my 15 in. laptop, a book, charging cables and loads of pens and other misc. items a college student as myself needs. Its also simple so It looks acceptable with business attire for interviews.<br/>Update: I've had it for over a year and it is still amazing! I seriously love it. The padding on the bottom is also great to keep the laptop safe from any falls (too many to count).
 I love this bag - can’t believe the quality for the price.  Bought a second bag for my husband
 The price is definitely cheaper than most cases I have seen some of those prices going up to almost $30 just to fit one tablet. So it is worth it to buy something that is 1/3 of that price. It has enough room to fit my google nexus 7, kindle paperwhite and other tiny electronics such as my ipod touch. It comes with another compartment where you can store your chargers and other accessories. It is comfortable to hold and it is well made as well. It is worth the purchase.
 I bought this for my 10 and 12 year old sons to carry their Google Chromebooks in.  So far the bag has stood up to the test.  I recommend this bag for adults or kids.  Very nice for the price.
 I'm really impressed with this bag.  I travel and didn't want to carry the heavy laptop bag…this is great for size (fits my laptop, cord, and an iPad mini) and it is lightweight.  The reviews I read before purchasing the bag, were accurate in describing this bag.  Definitely will purchase another one if mine gets worn out.
 I bought two of these to hold my wife's and my Ipad and the charging cables etc. It is perfect. It adds a great level of protection and these is also three separate compartments inside and one zippered exterior compartment that provide great storage. This bag is well constructed and looks nice and the price cannot is good for this level of quality. Great construction. I would buy again and highly recommend. Lightning fast delivery with Prime.
 Love it!  It’s a well made case!  Works great at keeping our PC safe when traveling or when not in use.  Love the extra compartments and looks nice too.
 These are good laptop bags for the price.  Very durable and good folder and pocket space for cables, mice, etc..
 Fantastic bag, used it with a 15.6 inch laptop and carried it like a champ, alone with charger and other school supplies, very subtle.
 I was impressed. It was of much better quality than I expected based on the reviews I had read.  It is  definitely big enough for a 15" laptop and definitely big enough for a 17".  I am able to put the cord and mouse (I use a separate mouse) in the outside compartment, the mouse pad in one of the inside pockets, and there is plenty of room left over, maybe even enough for the folding laptop table I just purchased.  The fabric is sturdy and I see no problems with weak corners, which was mentioned in another review.  The shoulder trap is detachable.  I would definitely recommend it.
 I use this case to carry a Canon Pixma iP110 printer.  The printer has the external battery added.  The printer fits great, not a tight fit (width wise) with plenty of room. I probably could have used the 14 Inch Laptop size, but this one has plenty of room inside of the inner pocket to hold full size 8x11 paper.
 Only had it for 2 days so I might have to update if there are quality issues. It fits my Dell 2 in 1 Inspiron 3000 11.6" laptop in the center, a couple of notepads, A full size Ipad with Gumdrop case (which is rubberized and pretty bulky) in one of the outside zipper pockets and the other side zipper pocket has a microsoft sculpt comfort mouse. Id give this 6 or 7 stars if I could. I hope it holds up and doesnt dissapoint later
 Great little briefcase.  Taking into consideration $15 paid, I am very happy with it.  Basic and small, but quality design and construction.  Good for my 14" laptop or a trip to the DMV.
 This bag is a very good bag for the price. My only fault with this one is the lack of a pocket on one side of the bag.  It doesn't have quite the pocket space that many similar-sized bags have.  Other than that, I'm quite happy with it.
 son loves it but hated that the strap broke after only 2 months.  luckily, laptop seems fine.
 I honestly don't know how it took me this long to review this bag. I have had it for 2-3 years, and it's still in near-perfect quality. I can't recommend it enough!
 This is perfect for my work laptop.  I had to travel for a month and needed my work and personal computers with me, and they and all their accessories fit quite nicely into this bag.  It seems to be holding up well so far and after stuffing it with all those accessories (cords, mice, locking cable, legal pad, pens) and going through airports with it I'm mightily impressed with the $14.xx I spent for it.
 Simple bag. Holds my Surface Pro 3 and iPad Air 2 easily with room for in-ear headphones, mouse, chargers and battery pack. As simple as you can get with good padding. The only thing that I don't like is the shoulder strap cushion. It doesn't have a rubber type lining so it slips off easily but for the price, I'm not concern about it. Overall, a good simple bag at a good price.
 Nice looking laptop bag.  Questionable durability.  We used this bag less than a week and the handle ripped.  I can't recommend this bag to anyone. It does hold our 17" laptop well.
 sturdy case, well padded for our laptop, very protective and the material in the case should last a good length of time.
 In a market saturated with laptop bags in all sorts of price ranges, this one is a serious contender.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Light weight<br/>- Durable, lots of padding<br/>- Very cheap in price<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Handles are basically just straps, not very comfortable if you have to carry it a long distance.<br/><br/>Overall, if you need an affordable case, this one fits the bill and is durable,
 I had an iPad3 sleeve but was trying to find one with a handle, and this case fit the requirements.<br/><br/>It has some padding but it isn't too heavy or bulky.  The padding won't protect it from a fall, but it will help with everyday travel.<br/><br/>My iPad has a thin light weight cover on it and this case has enough room inside that it will hold the iPad (with the cover on) and some other small/thin items (like ear phones/cloth/fold paper) in the main compartment.<br/><br/>The outside pocket holds my charger and the extension to the charger, my ear phones and a small cloth to wipe my screen all at the same time.  With items in the pocket, the outside is bumpy, not flat, but most pockets do this.<br/><br/>The zipper is sturdy, with 2 pulls that are a great size so you don't have to "find" them every time you open/close the case.  And it zips half-way around the case - mid-way up each side and across the top, giving full access to the inside.<br/><br/>The handles are the same cushioned material and flat, and stitched to stay that way.  Someone with small hands may find them a tad wide and uncomfortable in the palm, but they can sit on top of each other so it won't be as wide.  (If you're looking for a case that the handles slip out of the way/view, these do not, but I don't mind because I can still carry it in my arm with the handles facing out.)<br/><br/>The inside is orange, and I like that it's not the same black as the outside, makes it easier to see whats inside.<br/><br/>For the price and my needs this case was exactly what I was looking for!
 Simple, Basic, oh Amazon Basic!<br/><br/>I really like when I see something, and when I open the box its Identical in all ways.<br/>It came in hassle-free shipping so it opened up no problems.<br/><br/>I am able to hold a couple notebooks and my laptop while it remains very lite, I didn't realize how much my old case weighed.<br/><br/>Get a lot of everyday wear and is keeping up just fine. Good Buy
 never thought that something could be so what I needed! Fits the 11.6 chromebooks or other laptops of same dimensions could be so perfect' am happy that I read reviews and decided that this is the case for my chromebooks or other laptops within same dimensions. Has the right amount of padding , not to big, kinda' like three little pigs, This one is just right!<br/>'
 This was perfect in place of a purse to take my notebook as well as other items I wanted on the plane. It fits easily under the seat in front.
 Perfect bag for the investment.  Padded computer area with slots to hold files separate from computer.  Outside zippered area is roomy enough for the computer peripherals including mouse, cord.  A separate zippered area to hold desktop items including phone, pens, business cards, etc.  Should strap is detachable and fully adjustable with shoulder pad.  I've used the bag a couple months now, and for $15, it was well worth the investment.
 For what you get with the bag, the price &amp; quality are amazing.  I wanted a mini-briefcase that was just big enough for my 2013 13" Macbook Pro, which is heavier &amp; thicker than the current version, and everything fits great, even the hjerking big powercord/charging transformer.  Plus, there's room for extra documents, phone, ipad, kindle, etc.  Just with it came in different colors.
 How often is it that you buy something and when it arrives it exceeds your expectations? Well this bag fits in that category. I wanted something that could carry my iPad when I went to work meetings and conferences. I wanted it big enough to fit my iPad in its Zagg case with the keyboard and I wanted a little extra space to carry a few other small things. The main compartment fits the iPad with room for a small notebook and pen plus there is a front pocket for me to carry my car keys and a small wallet and business cards. It is really the perfect bag and it is such a great price.
 Nice little bag.  Perfect for my small laptop and a few items i carry to and from work.
 Works perfectly for my child's school issued computer.  It is not bulky and gives me peace of mind that it has some protection from the middle school drama.  ;)
 I love the Amazon Basics brand.  You get a well designed product while only paying for what you need and not paying for a the price of a brand name.
 I bought this to hold my Ipad2 with Smartpad cover, and Kindle Keyboard in its leather case. It easily holds them in the main compartment with some spare room. I was hoping the front pouch would be able to hold my Kindle separately, but it's too short. However, I can fit the charging unit for both my kindle &amp; Ipad2 plus my book light in the front zipper and even with both devices in the main unit, it's not bulky or heavy. The main compartment has 2 zippers, which is very convenient. Very high quality, I definitely recommend!
 It does the job and puts up with the pounding I put my bags through.  And it always looks nice.  Enough compartments for easy storage of various needed items.
 For the price, this is an excellent bag.  It fits my 14' Asus perfectly and also worked for a MacBook Pro I used for work.  The carry strap began to come out of place after couple months of daily use, but is a simple fix.  The bag itself is a nice quality and I still take it to work with me every day.  I would recommend this product to anyone not willing to pay $30/$40+ on a laptop bag.  It was about $15 when I bought it.
 This case is perfect for iPad, iPad Air, and most any tablet. I use it to carry an iPad Air and an ASUS Google Nexus 7 Android Tablet. The soft lining helps protect the glass (although both of mine are in protective leather cases), and there is sufficient room in the main pocket for at least two tablets and important papers. The front zipper pocket is ideal for cables and other small accessories.
 This is my first iPad, so maybe it's not as fragile as I'm thinking.  I've got the smart cover to protect the glass and hopefully it will never fall. I got this Netbook bag thinking it would give the iPad some protection. But it is just made from padded fabric, so if the cat sits on the iPad in the case, it might as well sit on the iPad directly.  To ease my mind, I would have liked a bit of siding.<br/><br/>However, it is an excellent little bag to carry the iPad around, roomy, cute with the orange inside, easy zippers, nicely made.
 What a bargain for such a high-quality bag, I also purchased the 11.6 in Amazon Basics sleeve to pair with this bag. (fits Samsung Chromebook 12.3 perfectly) They work great together. It has a separate pocket that fits all my power cords and accessories and a third pocket that my Nook reader fits in perfect. Extremely happy with this purchase and highly recommend to anyone with the Samsung 12.3 Chromebook.
 I purchased this bag for my husband to use with his Galaxy tab with a super durable cover with handle (which doesn't have a front flap to protect the screen).  It not only fits his tablet but he also uses it for all of his other business papers he needs to carry with him.  It is light weight and doesn't take up too much space so he finds it convenient to carry around.  It's a great value for the price.
 I am using this bag to store my MacBook, and it has plenty of room and appears to be of good quality.  I would buy this again.
 I really like this case a lot. The different sections are perfect for what I need to carry. I am a college student and I am able to comfortably fit two textbooks, two folders, my laptop, and my charging cables without any trouble. The only thing that bugs me is that the carrying strap can squeak sometimes when I'm walking to and from class. I'm still trying to mitigate that but otherwise it's a great case, I'm glad I bought it, and I would definitely recommend! :)
 This bag was super cheap which is why I went for it. It does not have a ton of protection on the corners. I use it for work, and carry a tablet and several other odds and ends. I love it. Several little pockets in the forward compartment. If you just need an everyday bag for for it, if you have a top.of the line laptop, move on.
 Bag well made; option of using handles (like brief case) or long straps for over shoulder.  Sort of a canvas-cloth cover, some kind of<br/>plastic inside (no smell).  It does fit a 11.6 laptop, but is pretty snug.  Zippers work well.  Works for me:-)
 Great basic laptop bag.  I rarely travel, or really needed on until recently.  I was able to carry my laptop, book, checkbook and so on.  It has two pockets on the outside also, to carry even more.  If you are a professional with many documents and gadgets , I would not  get this one, but for the price, and for the average person , it is perfect.
 I am so pleased to be able to write a positive review. This laptop case is amazing!! The quality is wonderful. The price is too good to be true! The case is nicely padded with plenty of storage, and at the same time not too big. It easily holds my laptop and ipad at the same time, plus accessories. I highly recommend that you purchase this bag. You will not be disappointed.
 Excellent Laptop case. Case does fit a 15.6 laptop. Large pockets are very convenient to store wireless mouse, battery charger, pens, pencils, paper, tablets, etc. The case is also very light in weight. There have been no issues with this laptop case/bag. Highly recommend.
 I have had this bag for coming up on 6 months now and I use it every day to carry my laptop, charging cords and personal items. It has three external zippers and the two larger compartments have several smaller ones inside in which to organize items, which I find to be very useful. The zippers are strong and even using them constantly I've had no issues with them or the fabric at all. It's a great bag, especially for the price. The only thing it's lacking are external or side pockets to slip small items in for quick access, things like metro passes and cell phones, and there is a bit of room for extra items, but sometimes it's hard to fit in everything I want to carry. If it had this small modification - the extra exterior pockets and maybe a little more space or an expandable middle compartment, it would be perfect.
 I saw a commercial for the new HP Stream 11 and bought it after having my shoulder got so sore standing in a 2 hour security line at the airport.  LOVE the 3.84 pound HP Stream and purchased this case for it.  It fits perfectly, and has enough room for my Kindle Fire, the power cord and the mouse I bought!! Sweet little case and arrived VERY fat, in fact I think it came the very next day after I placed the order!
 My laptop is on the larger side and it has 2 inner pockets for me to choose from to keep it secure. It fits perfectly. Also has a pocket for my: tablets, wired mouse, charger, folders and notebooks. It even has room for snacks after all that. If there's one thing I love is a bag that can hold all my useless junk.
 What a perfect laptop bag at a great price.  Needed one to put our laptop in while we traveled and couldn't pass this one up for the price.  It is nicely padded and has the option of using a shoulder strap or a handle.  Plenty of room for the mouse and power supply in a different zippered area.
 This bag is just great.  It has tons of space. I fit a 15" laptop in along with my tablet, phone, purse and books and it doesn't drag down or burden my shoulders. The quality is good too.
 I have purchased numerous laptop cases and the Amazon Basics case is right up there with the best of them. The Amazon Basics case has a good layout and enough room for my Laptop, accessories and iPad (and then some). The only minor issue I have is that the material inside makes a bit of a crinkling sound, but it does not bother me that much. Overall I would recommend this case to anyone, especially for the price.
 I really really love AmazonBasics products. Great quality, thoughtful design, very usable and the pictures don't do justice to the product.  I bought this bag because I wanted more than one bag for my iPad and didn't want to spend an arm and a leg.  This is a great product - I've been using it primarily every day and it is proving to be a very durable bag.  I carry my iPad (with the keyboard cover on), Kindle, a Grid-it organizer and cleaning pad in it.  The zippers work beautifully and provide an ample opening.  The handles are very secure.  We have security checks at work and it's easy to slip one handle off my wrist, zip it open for bag-check, quickly zip closed and be on my way. Its slightly bigger than my iPad so everything fits nicely.  I highly recommend this bag - you can't go wrong with AmazonBasics.
 This is a perfect case for my husband to carry his iPad, phone, and any chargers or extras to and from work!  The material is a squishy synthetic material that protects and resists stains &amp; tears.  Washes easily with damp cloth. Great price, durable material, and great quality! What more can you expect!? Thanks Amazon for making a great product that is useful and affordable :)
 So far so good. Gave as a Christmas gift for my son's laptop. Has plenty of room for accessories and padded for protection. Looks really nice. Shoulder strap and handles for easy carrying. Zippers seem heavy so they should last without breaking. Wipes clean with water resistant material but will soak thru. Good value for the money.
 I have a 15.6 Dell inspiron which is definately not an ultra book!! Similarly to other reviews it looks very compact but fits my laptop very well with room to spare.  I love the compartments and fits everything in specific places so I never lose anything. Lots of cushion makes me feel like my laptop is protected.  Only thing is that the strap tore just a bit around the shoulder padding.  Other than that great buy.
 We purchased this case for our granddaughter's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 tablet. The Anker keypad we purchased for use with the tablet fits perfectly back to back inside the case with the tablet. The outside pocket holds the cable and wall charger for the tablet. I was very surprised at the quality of the case for the price, it is very well made and padded to protect the contents. I would recommend this product with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.
 No complaints. Cost a fraction of the brand names, and does everything I need it to.
 Bought this for my wife as a Christmas present. She's a real estate agent and needed a much better bag for carrying her laptop, paperwork, and other items to do her job. She's loved it so far, and will put it to good use. It has a shoulder strap so she can carry it over the shoulder, or the handles to carry it by hand if needed.
 Perfect for my new Dell 17 inch laptop. Fits great and holds the cord, mouse and mouse pad. Lots of room for paperwork, too. Highly recommend this case. Quick shipping, nice quality.
 This case is a great deal. Fits laptop perfect and with daily use no complaints after 2+ months.
 This is a really nice case for a small laptop. I recently returned from a month-long trip to Canada where I carried my HP 11" laptop, charger, power cords, wireless mouse, phone charger, passports and a few manila file folders. The case worked very well on the trip and still had room I could have put a little more in it. It is well made, light and very functional.
 At first I thought it was the best bag ever. After some time it began to lose padding on the edges. At this time there is 0 padding besides the fabric itself. If I drop my bag it will almost no protection on those corners. Another one is, every now end then the clips unlock somehow and have caused me to drop my bag. Apart from that, the style is good, it
 It fits all my electronics ( laptop, tablet, phone) and all there chargers. Best bag iv found for my all my needs.
 I like this amazon basic laptop and tablet bag. Not only can I store my laptop, but it has enough space to keep important documents as well.
 as the name says, looks compact, but fits a 15.6 "laptop and has enough space for additional batteries and accessories, but I think it depends on what the thickness of the laptop, whether it is thin and thin or large and bulky 15.6 "
 Very nice for the price. Good padding, came with broad shoulder strap, two large inner pockets, two zippered side pockets (both on one side).
 not cheaply made. Lots of storage pockets &amp; options, shoulder strap. Well made &amp; well worth the money.
 This is a great bag for the price! It is well-padded -- I am completely confident that my device will be protected in this bag. It has several zippered sections for accessory storage and organization.
 Awesome bag.  This bag is the perfect size, not too big, not too small.  Has room for my laptop and extra pockets for power cord, mouse, some paper work, and other incidental items.  The fabric is very durable and waterproof.  Best of all, the zippers work great and are of high quality.  I've bought other bags in the past and the zippers are the first thing to go.  At this amazing low price this is a no-brainer purchase.
 This is the second one of these I have purchased. I am rough on them. I had the first one for more than 5 years. Great for the price.
 This is intended as a gift for a school child and I believe it will work very well
 I bought Tablets for the kidos for christmas. Bought 3 cases to carry the tablets in. These are well constructed, durable, easy to clean. They carry everything with plenty of pockets to keep all the accessories organized. I thought for 10 dollars, it would be something just to get them buy until I could buy some nicer ones. But these are actually really good. I would buy this again.
 Nice bag, but you need to buy the next on line of what you suppose to buy. You get off better this way. Buy a 17 inch for a 15.6 laptop
 I rated this laptop case a 4, because it is somewhat snug for my Dell 11.6" laptop.  I love the inside pockets and outside zip compartments, but they are tight as well. I do get the power adapter cord inside and even my mouse.  It just feels like I could have used a couple more inches to make everything slide in quicker. The quality is suburb and strap is nice and wide.  Bottom line is I do love it, but it just a bit snug.
 This is a very nice case. My Samsung 11.6 Chromebook fits in it perfectly, even with a slightly thicker protective cover. I also found that my new Microsoft arc touch mouse and my iPad Mini fit comfortably in this case with the Chromebook!<br/>The AmazonBasics case appears to be well made but time will tell how it stands up. I just have a feeling that this case will be with me for a long time!
 I purchased 2 with these bags one from my husband 1 for my son. They love them they are roomy and can hold additional stuff besides their laptop perfect selection for them
 Just the right size for me.  I don't carry a whole of of stuff in my laptop bag.  Space left over.  Very high quality material/construction.  Great price for an excellent laptop bag.
 Astonishingly high quality for the price. My first laptop (and thus first laptop bag) so I can't compare to too many others but it seems to be sufficiently padded, and in the corners, for my purposes. I had seen another review mentioning low padding but it seems okay to me. My large laptop is 16 1/4" x 10 3/4" x 1 1/2" and fits fine, only a little bit more room in long direction though. Like another review I like the permanent handles, they're "wrapped" with some padding inside so quit comfy. Shoulder strap included with plastic swiveling clippy things. I agree that since it's plastic I may not trust it entirely (if you're nervous about it) but they certainly don't look any "wimpier" than other clippy things I've seen. Great purchase and under 20 bucks. Simply unbelievable.
 Fits my Dell Latitude e6430 with the 9 cell battery. It also holds the charger and a mouse (I hate track pads).
 lots of space for a notebook, e reader and add-ons such as a mouse, cables, etc.  Durable and easy to carry.
 I am an RN and purchased for by back-up supplies to carry with me on calls;  absolutely perfect in EVERY way!  Thanks for a good product.  So rare these days.  I plan to purchase another for my laptop.
 My husband needed a sturdy laptop bag to bring his work computer around. This is so perfect and great quality for the price. The pockets are deep, and there are lots of places to store extra things such as pens papers folders etc.
 Perfect fit and quality construction.  Very glad I purchased this item.  If I had any complaint it would be that, if I were going to use the shoulder strap, I would prefer metal clips and rings instead of plastic.  Even with that statement, I would purchase this item again without hesitation and would recommend this to others.
 Had this bag for coming up on a year now, and it's still holding very strong.<br/><br/>Great light weight bag, tons of pockets, used it for flights many times. And am very glad I chose this, great bag at a better price.
 Use it for a 14 dell laptop.  Offer plenty of room for puter, power brick, mouse and an external SSD.  Won't get a lot of abuse so should last for a long time.  Not a daily use item for me.
 Lightweight, sturdy, and good price. Several built in storage pockets and sleeves.
 I purchased this for my Asus Transformer Book T100TA. The T100 fits in it with enough room to spare for the charging block and cable. The pocket on the front is great for my external hard drive. The zippers seem to be high quality and zip smoothly. All of the stitching, handles included, are very well sewn. The fabric is spongy and feels as though if you dropped your bag with your device in it, it would be adequately protected. I would recommend this bag for anyone looking for a slim travel bag for the T100.
 HP 15.6 fits perfectly, and the bag seems to be well made. Has plenty of room for charging unit and any papers, notebooks,magazines, etc.
 This bag is made awesome and I love that it holds everything....chargers....papers.....external mouse....etc....everything!!! I don't like the sleeve laptop bags because you can only get the laptop in the bag and nothing else. This bag is well worth the price because in stores they are much higher but this bag is by all means a very nice bag and sturdy. My cats have even scratched it before and I can't even see where they did that...it like just fade away.
 Great basic laptop bag, lightweight and well padded with just enough room for essentials such as a power pack, sleeve, mouse and a couple files. The bag works well without a sleeve but I wanted extra protection. If you need a bag with more space like an attaché, this may not be the bag for you. It does the job it's intended for very well.
 Got this for my Asus gaming laptop, would frequently bring it to work for school during down time. Originally was using backpack. Was very disappointed that upon trying to fit my laptop into the bag it was not close to fitting. I didn’t think that the measurements were for the screen itself and not for the actually size of the laptop. Haven’t even used it still gathering dust!
 I purchased this bag (14") for my iPad Pro (12.9") and have been extremely pleased.  There is plenty of room for the iPad Pro plus quite a bit of paperwork.  There is a nice pocket on the front where you can place accessories like a stylus, Apple Pencil, etc.  This is a great bag and a great value.
 I love this case. It's just big enough to fit my iPad and a few odds and ends (camera kit, mints, a few coins). My iPad goes with me everywhere. It does not replace my laptop, but it is the thing I bring with me everywhere, and this case goes with me everywhere. The iPad fits loosely inside...almost a bit too wide but it isn't a problem. It's very lightweight and easy to carry. I carry this alone to many places, but also carry it along with a Case Logic case designed for my MacBook Air. The Case Logic fits the air only, so I will put the charger and stuff in with my iPad accessories in the AmazonBasics case. I can hold both this case and the Case Logic case in one hand and they travel together well and are still overall very light.<br/><br/>Very happy to have bought it.
 Nice bag. Large enough to hold my 9.5 inch portable DVD player as well as several accessories.
 I bought this for my wife and she thinks its a nice little laptop traveling bag.
 i brought so many bag before but yea i say,  what else i want for the price.  it does look cheap but the bag is lasting four  a few month so far and for that i will buy it again it right for my budget period.
 This bag is sturdy and fits my laptop (even with a sleeve on) perfectly. I like how many compartments it has, as well. If you are looking for something very protective yet slim and professional, this case is a great choice for the price. I will say that the strap can be a bit squeaky, but that's my only complaint.
 I love this bag. I use it for a 13" MacBook Pro, and it has tons of storage space. Hinges on the shoulder strap are cheaply made and squeak, but you get what you pay for. Great bag for the price.
 Perfect size and fit! Leaves room for all my stuff and my tablet and charger!<br/>Liked the shipping, plain and simple and fast!
 Excellent product. Just what I needed. I can carry my tablet and two phones with plenty of room to spare. Easy to carry and not too bulky. Also seems to be very well made.
 I've had pretty good luck with most AmazonBasics products I've tried, but this bag lacks the sturdiness I'd expect for a bag intended to carry a large laptop. The padding for the laptop area seems adequate, but otherwise, the bag feels flimsy. The shoulder strap is a serious pain in the neck. Pretty underwhelming storage capacity/options with a laptop in the bag.
 This is a stylish, lightweight carrying case for laptops, including the new Dell Inspiron 13 7000 Series 2-in-1. The Dell laptop/tablet measures 13.3 inches and it fits snugly into the 14.1  inch Amazon case. The pocket area allows for storage of the charging cord and (in my case) an optional external  DVD player. The zippers work well. Compared to the $45 Dell equivalent, I am very happy with this purchase.
 This is a simple padded bag with two handles. It also has a sepret zipper pouch that zips from the side to put in a charger or something. It's a nice bag to cary my netbook from when I want to take it somewhere. I've also put my iPad mini in it, but found that it's to big and that I'm just better off putting it in a backpack with other things rather than this bag. Might work for iPad though.
 Perfect for ultraslim notebook, this bag is well made, very light, offering plenty of pouches, sections, and storage places.  I wanted a bag for my ultraslim notebook, cables, attachments, with room for a book or two.  This bag delivered for a mere 1/3 of the price of those found in the local office products stores.
 I took this bag for traveling. Plenty of pouches for everything, I had my Asus 15.6inch Gaming laptop, Ipad, pencils, pens, medications, wallet, AC adapter wall chargers, etc. They were all able to fit in this bag. I recommend getting a laptop sleeve to prevent your laptop from damaging if you accidentally drop it because there is no padding at the bottom.
 Bought for son’s school chrome book.  Liked it and bought more for my office.  For the price you can’t do much better.
 The overall functionality of the bag is good, and it holds everything I need, a few books and a laptop. The only main problem is the strap hooks are plastic and what the hooks latch onto are also plastic. So when I walk I hear squeaking consistently because of the plastic rubbing, if it were metal it would make less sound. Due to that I often don't use the strap at all.
 Very good bag for the money. I would highly recommend this bag for anyone needing to protect their laptop.
 I've had this bag for a few months and it's just about the right size for an iPad, so I use it for that instead of my netbook most of the time. For $12, it's really hard to beat. It's not bad looking, and offers a good amount of protection. I keep my <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Twelve-South-Compass-Portable-Stand-for-iPad/dp/B003XQMUVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Twelve South Compass, Portable Stand for iPad</a> in the accessory pouch -- it's big enough to fit the iPad's charger and a few other things in as well. The only problem I had with it was one of the zipper pulls broke off a few months after owning it, but I contacted Amazon and they overnighted me another one for free (I was able to send the old one back after I received the replacement). Even with this minor issue, I think it's a great bag and highly recommend it!
 Every day I can have everything I need to work in the field without throwing my back out lugging a heavy bag.  This is Lightweight but durable with a pocket for everything - cables, pens, phone
 I am pleased with the quality of this product. Lots of room for device and accessory storage. The padding is good and better than expected. Would recommend this product.
 I have this case. My husband kept borrowing mine, so I got one for him too. Light weight, but lightly padded to keep laptop safe. Extra pockets for mouse, mouse pad and cords.
 Love the bag. It’s manufatured well. Blends in well with the business community.
 Fits the Dell inspiron 17 7000, I was looking for a laptop bag and I couldn't find one so I ordred this and it fits the the 17inch laptop that I have ( Dell Insprion  7000 ) when I first saw it I am like no way that's a laptop bag for a 17inch laptop but it went inside smoothly ^.^ yes so smooth with ease it was an enjoyable moment putting inside.
 Horrible quality.  I bought this item on Amazon that arrived first week of October. Only used it to put MacBook Pro and within 4 weeks the stitching holding the zipper tore.  Will not recommend.
 Kids were assigned chrome book laptops at school. This fits the laptops and so far has held up well.
 For the price, it would be hard to beat this AmazonBasics laptop bag.<br/>The Amazon brand name on the bag stands out as a sign that the owner is a brand-conscious shopper who won't compromise on quality and who only accepts the best products at the best price.<br/>And we know who makes it ;-)
 Keeps my 15" laptop secure and is a professional-looking replacement for a laptop backpack for project meetings and interviews. Can fit a few spiral notebooks as well.
 What a great price for this very lightweight, soft briefcase! My iPad fits in it perfectly, and the outside pocket holds other items I want to take along (screen cleaner, note book, charger, pen).  I have a heftier fullsize briefcase for carrying a laptop that the iPad could fit in, but it's much bulkier. This Amazon one is just right. I'm glad I bought it.
 Decent bag, still looks good after a few months of daily use. I got it for my wife's 13" laptop, and she loves it, especially the fact that she can load it with more stuff in those front pockets (it seems her bag is not enough for the lifting weights she carries with her). But what do I know... maybe only that "happy wife = happy life", and I like my happy life...
 I bought this for my Chromebook C720 so I could stash its power supply and wireless mouse, plus my notes and other miscellaneous crap that I always manage to leave behind at the house when I need to pick up and leave.  Like other reviewers have noted, it offers padded protection on top, bottom and edges.  At under 13 bucks it's equal and most times better than what's offered at twice the price at the big-box office and electronics stores.
 I haven't needed to clean it.  It protects the laptop and has enough room for other things.
 I've been using this bag for about 6 months and it's exactly what I needed. A low key bag that has plenty of pockets and dividers. Build quality is pretty good for the price.
 I have to carry my ipad and android tablet as well as hotspot wherever I go due to my work. It is a big hassle to carry these by hand, and it is not worth to carry a huge bag for it either. This bag is a perfect solution for this. Remember that this is not a permanent cover, carry solution. It is not padded like regular laptop bags, so do not throw around.
 exactly what I was looking for. just like a regular lap top case but smaller.
 People complain about everything now days. They expect to pay 13 dollars for something that's gonna last forever? Cmon... this case fits my 14' laptop nicely and I don't use the shoulder strap. Carry it like a purse to prevent it falling. Think!
 Very well made good fabric and cushioning lots of roomy pockets just what I needed to protect my laptop light weight
 I've had the bag for over 4 years and it's still holding up really well. I use it almost every day for carrying my kindle and papers for work. I would highly recommend this
 Practical and functional laptop bag. What I need for my gaming laptop, headphones, mouse and external hard drive. Pockets are nice an roomy. Item is not bulky.
 "Basic" does describe it.  It does hold my HP 17.3" laptop.  The power cord and an external mouse fit in the side pocket.  That is about it for ca paucity.  It is padded but don't expect this bag to provide more than minimal protection (but what do you expect for $20)?
 I used this for a few years. It held up great, I just wish the Amazon Basics tag didnt show.
 For the money, awesome laptop case. It's padded enough to protect a delicate MacBook Air. Has two additional front pockets that I find particularly useful for pens. For the 13" MacBook Air, the 14" bag will accommodate the charger and a small mouse as well. I also still have room for a few small, paperback books.
 not a TON of padding, but enough. i wouldn't feel good about dropping this on any level, but it works well enough to protect your laptop from minor bangs. for the price its a great deal, just don't drop it.
 Its a decent case for what I was looking for. The 15.6 inch does not have a nice interior. I was hoping for the traditional Amazon orange interior like in some of their other products, but this is just gray and not really cushioned. Holds my Google chrome book as well as a charger, mouse, and lap table. Serves its purpose of protecting my computer while not in use and light traveling.
 I just purchased this for my new laptop, 15.6 and the reviewed all the customers response and their reviews , which I always factor in, when buying anything, and they are pretty actuate, it's a must buy for the money, you won't regret it.
 Just got it today along with my laptop. Laptop fits perfectly,  and this is plenty oh storage pockets inside and out.
 greatly surprised on this one. amazing zipper action without flaws. I use mine about easily thirty times a day and still just as smooth as out of the box. never used the strap so far so no comment. the padding is moderate. material if the bag is great nylon with stitched cloth in the front. I rough house mine and it keeps my lap top safe so far. good product that I would buy again
 Stitching came out of handle within a month of use.  We only used for the Church laptop fir av systems. So twice a week at most.
 It's an excellent bag utility-wise, especially at a fifteen dollar price point. My only major complaint is the bag's durability. I am already seeing major signs of wear and tear, particularly on the strap, with just over a month's worth of moderate, weekly usage.
 So far the strap has not failed me yet!! Usually I get iffy whenever I buy a laptop bag because a lot of them are cheap and the quality is not so great and I don't want my laptop to fall on the ground whenever I walk with it. This one has by far been the best laptop bag I've had yet! So far so good. Thank you.
 It is what is stated on the description.  My 10.1 inch net-book fits fine and is somewhat protected.<br/><br/>The bad points of this product.<br/><br/>1. Little protection from the sides<br/>2. Side pocket will only hold small items &amp; will not hold a battery charger for netbooks. Doing so will damage the netbook since the layer between these two slots are thin.<br/>3. I'm a man...and this carry bag looks like a small purse.<br/>4. The inside lower portion of the case needs additional neoprene layer. It currently does not have this feature.<br/>5.  My main gripe is the zippers.  When taking my netbook out of this case, I have to be extra careful so that I do not scratch my netbook with the zippers...the zipper comes very close to the netbook.
 It protects my work laptop, phone, and tablet all at once really well. However, the plastic pieces that hold the shoulder strap is EXTREMELY squeaky and obnoxious.
 This thing is fantastic.  It's well made and has more padding than I expected for this price.  It has a good shoulder strap and the usual additional pockets.  There are interior pockets as well and pen holders.  It also has the loop on the back to slide it over extended suitcase handles.  It is only $2 more than the very, very basic "Amazon Basics Sleeve" which I also purchased.
 This bag was so affordable and we were NOT disappointed! It's roomy and big enough for a large laptop with lots of extras. Good, strong seams and zippers help us stay confident that we won't lose anything. Wish this brand had been around years ago.
 This item was purchased for someone else, however I have not heard any complaints from the person it was purchased for.
 bought this for a friend that can break anything! So far, he hasn't broken this or his laptop!
 Fits my 15.6 laptop perfectly with room for accessories. It seems well made. The material doesn't feel cheap.
 much better bag than expected.  it's not the best out there, but for basic duty, it's great.  seems to be made relatively well, especially for the price.  i was perfectly content with this bag until my employer finally decided to get me a different bag, which of course has more compartments, a tiny bit more padding, but cost almost 3 times as much.<br/><br/>i'd recommend this bag if you are just looking for a basic bag for your laptops.
 Since Im a college student, I usually like taking my electronics along with me, but with my purse (even though its big) the electronics weighs it down. So, here, I'm able to shrink down my purse and carry this bag around with my 7 inch tablet and still have room for my phone and case i bought for the memory card, along with room for the charger. I'm pretty sure it can also fit an iPad, but I'm not sure how much room it would have (I might just try it out with my friend's iPad)
 Fast delivery of product.  I love this bag for my  laptop,  it has two pockets on the inside and one on the outside which gives plenty of room for the cord and any other items I want to bring along.  I love that it's not too bulky!
 2-nd review, this time on new bag just purchased to replace 5-year-old original bag: All positives still apply, except the new bag, which looks and feels just like the original, is being made with a lighter-weight zipper and thinner materials overall, thus less padding. Weight of original bag was exactly 8oz. Weight of new bag is exactly 6oz, 25% less. Still seems to be a good buy, just not sure this one will last as long as the original.<br/><br/>1-st review 5 years ago on original bag purchased: Lightweight, easy to operate, easy zipper and zipper grips, just what I needed to carry an iPad already mounted in a swivel case. Very comfortable handles, handy pocket for small items, and enough room to carry a few papers with the iPad. One minor inconvenience might be that the outer shell could be just a bit stiffer, at least along the zippered edge, as it buckles a bit while zippering when something rigid is not already inside, requiring one hand to pull the zipper while the other hand holds the opposing edge. But don't let this stop you from acquiring this great bag at its great price.
 The bag fits my laptop without any issues.  I am also able to fit other items comfortably.  Lots of pockets. A good value for the money spent.
 I like this bag , it is just the right size bag to carry my 15 " DVD player, along with all of it's accessories.
 Nice bag. Not quite as roomy as i would like but it holds everything nice and snug.The zippered compartments allow enough room for the power cord and the mouse.
 I really like this bag. It has been holding up for a long time and I use it a lot. Would like a bit more padding, but it was pretty good for the price
 Slim - Lightweight - seems to be relatively rugged.  Good for on a plane.  Not as good if you need to carry a lot of "stuff" with your laptop.  Plenty of pockets inside, and 2 zippered external compartments for wallet, phone, pens, etc.  Probably the best of the last 5 or 6 laptop bags I've had.  Still to be determined if it will fall apart after extensive use.
 laptop bag began accumulating lint as soon as I opened the box it came in. Laptop bag has little to no padding so little to no protection. This is despite it being lightly used in office settings/cars. Developed a rip as fabric is of very low quality. Shoulder strap bunches up immediately and is still very uncomfortable (it digs) when not bunched. You are better off paying an extra 10 bucks and getting a decent product.
 A good quality bag that easily holds my new IPad Air with a separate zippered pocket for the charging plug and cord. There is enough additional room to also easily hold a separately purchased 400 page softcover IPad instruction book a well. The bag appears to be well made with quality material and zippers. The bag compartments are lightly padded and do provide some additional protection for the IPad. Overall this bag is an excellent value for the price.
 Much cheaper than the other brands, more features, great construction. So much better than I imagined. Two thumbs up!!
 This bag is perfect for the new larger iPad Pro.  It is nicely cushioned for protection and has room for the charger, a not pad and pens.  I am now comfortable with my disabled grandson throwing the iPad on the back of his wheelchair and looking for work.  The iPad Pro is too nice to go unprotected and this cas protects it nicely.
 I do a lot of traveling for work and have a ton of electronics. I needed something to carry both my new iPad with a case around it and my Kindle with a Speck case around it without worrying about dropping them. Did a lot of research and this is by far the best case for my needs. I was worried that it wouldn't be wide enough but it's perfect. I am able to put them both in without any resistance. I can even put my iPad charger in the little zip pocket. It does bulk out a bit but I move it around so it lays pretty flat. I agree that a shoulder strap would be nice but the handle is big enough to slip my wrist through if need be. Plus it's so lightweight that it doesn't bother me. This is my perfect travel companion to fit my needs. I'm sure if I wanted to I could also fit my Blackberry, iPod, and iPhone, too. For $10 you just can't beat this.
 Nice little bag and big enough for a Netbook.  I got it for my iPad and it is plenty spacious so I carry other little things I need for the iPad conveniently<br/> in the bag.  It is fairly protective (but still be careful as it is not hard-sided,) the handles are easy for carrying and it is light-weight which I particularly like.
 Surprisingly high quality and lightweight at such an affordable price. I use it as a computer bag.
 GREAT PRODUCT!!! I have HP Chromebook 11, fits perfectly along with charger.  I read some of the lower rated comments about bottom of bag not being padded, turns out people were wrong padding is on the bottom of bag for protection.  Value is unreal at this price.  Non Bulking feel so easy to take on the go, very light so you will not feel like you're carrying a weight. Could not be happier, was just at store last week looking at bags costing $75-100 offered the same quality as this Amazon Basics!!!!
 I use this every day, even around the house, to insure I won't drop my iPad Air.  As a generic bag it's not a snug fit, even over my Apple Smart Case, but it serves my purpose fine.  It's very well made, with sturdy zippers, and the neoprene provides some cushioning.  The front section can hold accessories, which are easy to see with the orange interior.  The actual dimensions are smaller than stated:  my bag is 8.75" x 10.5 x 1".
 I wanted one to fit my large laptop for trips.  I only used it once but it is a nice bag.
 I bought this to hold a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 and an Anker wireless keyboard.  The bag does not look or feel cheap, is not made from thin material like one would expect and the inside is sufficiently padded for the inside contents.  It's an Amazon Basics product, you should not expect anything less than perfect.  If you are looking to get one, do it, right now, you will not be disappointed.
 Fit my tablet perfectly  and still a extra pocket  and spare inside to store more items.
 The reviews were positive, but I was still pleasantly surprised at the quality of this bag. For those of you wondering, the 14-inch bag fit my 14" (diagonal screen size) slim HP laptop very nicely. And I put tons of accessories in the outside pockets with room to spare.<br/><br/>Mine was gray on the inside, not orange (thankfully!). It seems to be well-constructed. For the price, I can't imagine beating this bag. This is my second AmazonBasics purchase and second great experience.
 Needed something to tote a Lenovo T410 around a hospital without hauling a full-sized bag.  This works perfectly.  It fits the laptop, complete with its extended use battery, and a few other items.  Light weight and easy on the shoulder.  Not for those who require a lot of accessories, but worth the money if all you want is to take a laptop with a few other items with you.
 Perfect for my HP laptop and accessories.  Light weight.  Seems durable.
 This thing is awesome. I’m so glad I got it for my brand new iPad Pro 10.5! Fits like a glove, and plenty of room for all the little accessories.
 Light weight, plenty of room for laptop, folio, AC cord, fantastic value!
 Love the pockets fits what i need. easy to transport my laptop and sturdy
 Bought this bag because the handle on my computer bag was just about to rip off.  Really like the fact that this bag has two handles because it distributes the weight across both instead of a single handle.  The shoulder strap doesn't get as twisted as previous bag because it can be straightened out quickly and easily, even while the bag is on your shoulder.  If there was anything negative about the bag it would be that it doesn't open all the way up so that it could be loaded like a briefcase.
 I use this bag for a 14" laptop and it works great. The padding is comfortable and there is plenty of space for accessories. I wish it had some more sub-compartments that could be zippered or velcroed shut, but I guess there is only so much space to work with on this kind of bag. Overall, its a great bag and its been with me to work and school and back and feels like its made to last. The material and zipper all seem to be high quality. Recommended!
 Very nice accessory for our sons new lap top. He gets a ton of use out of it and it has held up very well! The straps have held up very well and there have not been any issues with the lining inside the bag or any rips and tears. Overall it was a great deal!
 I received the bag on Wednesday and by Monday the shoulder strap had torn. I only use the bag to carry my laptop to and from my car. I have returned the bag. I wouldn't recommend buy the bag.; you get what you pay for.
 We use these for MacBook Air and Chromebook bags for students. This year we ordered 100. They have proven satisfactory and roomy enough to hold the chargers and other accessories that students carry around
 I bought this case hoping that I could put my file folders and my kindles in it and a work notebook and cell phone. It is perfect...... the zippers work well and feel like they will last. I have had trouble with case zippers in the past, so this is something I definitely look at. The entire case feels durable and as a bonus I found that I can also put my portable DVD player in it as well. I love  this case. It's perfect for me.....
 I looked at dozens of laptop and tablet bags and finally decided to go traditional. This has plenty of room for both my laptop and iPad, their chargers, and lots of room to spare. It keeps them safe and clean and organized.  For such a reasonable price, I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
 Works great, no problems yet. The plastic hinges attracting the strap to the bag can be kinda squeaky, but it's not a bit deal.
 Strong construction and well thought out for storing accessories as well as paperwork
 A real bargain. Nicely made, very sturdy, quality materials. Zippered pockets are perfect for storing accessories, etc. Perfect fit for 11.6 inch device (Acer C720 Chromebook in my case.) Additional divided compartments inside for documents or whatever. Shoulder strap and handle for convenient secure carrying. I've seen comparable products for $30+. AmazonBasics has yet to disappoint me...
 We needed a candy bucket that was a boss baby suitcase for Holloween. Came across this item and took a chance. It was perfect. Even orange for Holloween on the inside.
 Am very happy with the quality of the bag and the versatility with the many zippered pockets
 Does what a laptop case does without spending too much. Decently made.
 Perfect bag to hold my ipad and small notebooks/pens. It does not hold my large folders but I bought the 11.6 inch bag. Buy the bigger size if you need to hold larger items.
 The bag is exactly as described in the ad for it and the measurements perfectly fit my HP laptop.  It sure beats carrying it naked!  There's sufficient room leftover in the bag for extra batteries, charging cords and assorted "stuff" associated with laptops like external drives.  The bag is also well-made with reinforced stitching at stress points, so it should serve well and long.
 I liked the size of the bag, but the stitching and threads were loose  on the inside and was afraid to keep it for my laptop. I don't believe the bag I got would have held my laptop long in it. I sent it back to Amazon.
 This bag is amazing! It is very hard to find a bag like this. Has a lot of compartments. It has a strap! There are may compartments! AND I can' fit my laptop fan and laptop in there as well as chargers!<br/><br/>Looks just as expected.<br/>I hope it's durable. The fabric seems to look thick and durable but you never know because it's such a nice low price..
 Very high quality, durable, decent padding, great price, and easy to clean. I use these bags to protect my customers computers while transporting them, and they feel very secure. It makes me feel like a real professional when they see their precious computer protected snugly in this case.<br/><br/>I had left one of them in a tote outside, and it got rain in it. The bag got some mold growing on it, and I figured either throw it away, or try to wash it. It survived a machine wash and dry like a champ, and came out clean.
 I have a big laptop so i was greatful for a big laptop case and felt confident that a product under the Amazon brand would be backed the company. So far so good. The laptop case has come in handy when i transport my laptop.
 My ipad was already in a leather case,but I wanted a travel case that would fit both the ipad and it's leather cover. I often use a boat bag to tote stuff to work,and wanted to be able to put the ipad in the bag with no worries. This neoprene bag is the perfect size to do just that, with  a bit of room to spare.The zipper seems to be sturdy, and there is a little side partition where I put my cleaning cloth and a stylus. I had tried an iluv neoprene case, but the ipad would not fit in it with a leather cover. If I had not wanted to use a leather cover, th iluv neoprene case would probably have afforded more protection, as it was quite padded. But this case works well for my needs.
 I bought this to haul an iPad around at work (rain, dirt, etc.).  For the price you can't beat it.  Plenty roomy for an iPad (could probably hold 2), small pocket on side with a zipper, decent handle.  Basic but it works great.<br/><br/>It's not waterproof, but walking 200 yards in a rainstorm it kept the contents dry.  The material is neoprene or similar.
 This is a really good, simple bag- particularly for the price.  I'd give it the fifth star if the two short handles could be tucked away- if you use the shoulder strap as the primary way to carry it, then those two shorter handles just get in the way when zipping or trying to reach into the bag.  That's about the only downside.  Well, that, and it's dull looking.  But hey- they can't make a "basic" item and give it style..
 My computer which is 17 inches fit perfectly in the bag. It came in on time and looks good too!
 What a great little bag. My iPad easily fits inside with its hard shell keyboard cover, but also fits when inside a book style keyboard/cover. I can also fit my Kindle in with the iPad (when its in the hard shell keyboard case). While it loses the slim profile when you put cords and plugs into the zippered compartment, its still a handy carrying bag. It's lightweight and has handles. Nice!
 This carrier is well made, but did not fit the DVD player I ordered.  This was my fault on ordering as I did not consider the total dimensions of the player.  I ordered by the screen size.  The return process was awesome &amp; quick!
 An extremely nice, basic laptop case that fits a new 15.6 computer perfectly. Nicely padded for transport with just enough space for the power supply and a small notebook or two. Can't beat the price of Amazon basics either. Highly recommended.
 I love my Kindle Bag! I had bought one that just fit my Kindle; but of course, that was all it held! As I travel a lot; I needed something to also carry my cord and accessories. And this just fit the bill! It even was cheaper than the smaller one!<br/><br/>The only thing I dislike about it; is the color of the inside: Orange! LOL The only color I truly don't like!<br/><br/>After using this bag for 3 months; I'm so excited to have it!!! Couldn't ask for a better looking, better made bag! Tho' used daily; it still looks brand new!
 Padding is so-so, and it's a good size but there's nothing to write home about.  It's a bit on the flimsy side, so it doesn't stand up very well if there isn't a laptop or a notepad in there.  It was inexpensive though, so still a good value.
 This is a nice case and a great deal. I bought one for my wife also. Nice details and solid construction. I feel like my laptop is safe inside this bag I wanted to add that I can fit a my computer in a laptop sleeve in the bag. I just keep the sleeve in there, my laptop goes in and out and this gives even more padding.
 I have been using this bag since I purchased it and its durable thus far. Great bag for the price.
 Freaking love amazon basics! It’s such a good quality bag. I wish it expanded in the width just a little bit so I could fit 2 laptops with chargers...
 Bought this for my Brother Laptop and it worked out fine.  I didn't want to spend to much, but wanted to protect his computer and carries a few accessories.  Does the job well for the money.
 Perfect size with well-designed compartments allowing space for a table (surface pro), some folders, and a separate compartment for pens, etc. My only wish was that it be available in a more upscale material.
 Great basic laptop case.  I would buy one again.  Seems very sturdy.
 Product OK (3 rating) really too thin except for occasional home use
 Update: I have been using the 14.1" case for the last year or so, for my UX302LA, and it has been a great case. When I recently purchased a Dell XPS 13, I really wanted to get back to having a smaller case. But my Case Logic 11.6" case was still just a little too small. It would fit, but it really strained the zippers around the corners.<br/><br/>I am happy to say that I received my AmazonBasics 11.6" case today, and it fits perfectly. It seems to be just as well made as the 14.1" case, if not a little better. It really is the perfect case for an XPS 13.<br/><br/>My previous bag was a Case Logic 11.6" laptop case, for my little Asus Q200E 11.6.<br/><br/>I just bought a 13.3 Asus UX302LA, so a new case was a must. The biggest negative about this case is that it is obviously too big for my new laptop, by at least an inch in every dimension. But I knew it was a 14.1 case, so I got exactly what I expected there. (Wish they had a 13.3" case, but can't have everything.)<br/><br/>But as for the actual product, let me give a point-by-point comparison with the Case Logic:<br/><br/>1. I prefer the case logic shoulder strap. The Amazon has a very stiff nylon pad at the top. The case logic's is rubber, much smaller and more pliable. I prefer it, so much so that I swapped straps. But it's not a huge deal, because you could always remove the pad on the Amazon strap.<br/><br/>2. The Amazon front pouches are MUCH easier to get in to and out of. Even with the laptop out of the case, the case logic was always a pain to try to get stuff into and out of. Not so with the amazon. Also the small front pouch is a completely different design. The case logic small pouch was almost useless, with a side zipper and it was so tight that you'd have a hard time easily getting a credit card into and out of it. The amazon front pouch is top-loading, has a long zipper, and is a VERY shallow design. Great for flash drives, credit cards, bluetooth headsets maybe. But it's so shallow that even a checkbook won't fit. Probably about a 2" depth max.<br/><br/>3. Build quality is almost identical between case logic and amazon. Both bags appear to be made to take it, with heavy duty stitching, good quality nylon and heavy duty zippers. No complaints.<br/><br/>4. Apparently the zipper pulls used to be pretty gaudy, but if they were, they aren't any more. They are a nice black metal pull. The bag does have a bright white and orange Amazon Basics logo on the front, which I colored in with a sharpie to make it more muted. No big deal.<br/><br/>5. The side pockets in the main laptop area are a little different; in the amazon model one of the side pockets is full size, the other is about 6" wide. It would make it nicer when carrying smaller stuff, since it wouldn't slide around as much.<br/><br/>All in all I'm very happy with the case. The only design complaint I have is with the shoulder strap pad, but that's a small quibble.
 To protect my Daughter notebook we got her a new case. Compare to our first case. This feels it was built to protect and to last. I was very surprised at the quality. Daughter is very happy with it.
 Nice little case for the money.  Fits my MacBook Air and my Chromebook.  Could be a little wider for storing the charging cubes.
 An excellent handbag, I put my laptop in there, a few pages and snackes for my workday. The materials quality is fine. I am taking it with me everywhere and it just does the job and looks good
 Bought this for my mom. She needed a place to store her iPad Air, plus any little odds and ends she may take out for the day (ID, credit cards, pen, phone, etc). She ended up giving hers to a friend and buying another. So I'd say it was a good buy. It's not going to replace a fit-in case, but if you're careful with your iPad and just need something to tote it around in, this would be a good option.
 Does the job as advertised. Fits my Dell 17.3" Inspiron 5000 perfectly. Fast shipping. Decent price and would recommend to a friend. Peace out
 I purchased it for my daughter for school and leisure.  She loves it!
 Nice basic case.  My HP Pavilion 15.6 with touch screen fits perfect, The dimensions of the HP is 15.18" x 10.16". Amazon states that the Internal Dimensions are 14.7" x 2.2" x 11.2" but the HP fits perfect in it. Also my iPad air fits in the inside pocket. Plus my mouse and power supply fit nice in the outer pocket. Amazon should address the inside dimensions of the bag on there web site.
 I purchased this for my son's laptop.  It is of good quality and the price is great for what you are getting.  It is lacking in the padding area however.  It is great for lite duty and an inexpensive laptop.  I would not trust it for any computer that cost more than $300 though.  If you have a high end laptop I would spend a bit more and get a bag of higher quality.
 I have to say I was skeptical...but I like it! I wish it had slightly more padding and a clip or something to put my keys (I use it for traveling) and the shoulder strap isn't the greatest, but it did exceed my expectations. It is well constructed and light weight with the strap on the back to put over the handle of your roller luggage.
 I have two of these. I use one for work with my Surface Pro 3, and the other for personal use with my HP Stream 11.<br/><br/>For work, I can easily fit the Surface Pro 3, Type Cover, Pen, charger, mouse, and other necessary gadgets. For Personal, I can easily fit the HP Stream 11, charger, mouse, cables, HP Stream 7 tablet and its charger.<br/><br/>The protection is good, and there are enough pockets to get the job done. This is not the bag for you if you carry lots of gadgets, but if you need a good bag to protect your devices and travel light - this is it!
 I ordered this so my husband's diabetic testing supplies could be easier to carry into a restaurant than being in a plastic zippered bag.  The handles were a must so it was easier to carry.  This works.  If it was a little bit larger, it could accommodate the carb counter book we often have to use but we are able to make this work.
 I bought this for my new ASUS C200 Chromebook, and it fits perfectly.  The extra pouch on the side also fits the charger and a mini USB mouse (if desired.)  Overall, the construction feels solid, and the zippers work fine.  You really can't beat the price on this bag, either.  So far, I've tried out a few Amazon Basics items, and found that they are great, and highly affordable.
 Nice case,Really a nice case that fits my tough book perfectly. The added side pocket compartments are very useful and the internal compartments are great. I was so impressed with quality of these bags that i purchased 4 of them, 3 for 12" and this size including. I wish there were other colors available as an option,maybe ( yellow,red,green,pink,gray) Wow! , i am very pleased with the details and construction of these bags and the price is irresistible.
 For the price, is a great buy. Compact and sturdy. No, is not so you can throw it around and expect the inside materials not to break. It does is job and if you get a Kevlar insert it can also become bulletproof, as I did with mine. Cheers.
 I needed a protective padded bag to carry three tablets in. My Kindle HDX, my Nexus 7, and my Samsung Galaxy tab 3 8.0 and all thier power plugs, cables, and accessories fit great!!! It is perfect, well made and priced unbelieveably low! Traveling with my bunch this bag is a must have. I highly recommend  to anyone before over paying at your local store. And shopping with Amazon saves me alot of time and money!
 Simple no-frills design, adequate padding, good detachable shoulder strap.The 11.6-inch size bag fits my Dell 11-3147 laptop and its too-chunky AC charger, an 8-1/2 x 11 noteboook &amp; pens, cell phone, boarding pass for easy travel or around town. The zippers are usually the weak link in laptop bags, but after a few months mine is still holding up well.
 I have used the laptop case with my 11inch MacBook Pro for 7 months without any problems. Zippers work well. No evidence of wear though I am not rugged with it. If it were stolen I would get another.
 Amazon Basics brilliantly crafted! As always you can trust Amazon Basics really...
 Great product!<br/>- LOVE the comfortable handles...feature adds such convenience and is what drew me to this case.  Handles are neoprene as well.<br/>- My iPad 1 is encased in an Otterbox Defender which I then put into this AmazonBasics Netbook Sleeve, but this sleeve is PERFECT for it.  Fits nicely and snugly. The fit may be a little too roomy if I didn't have the Otterbox.<br/>- Neoprene is nice and cushy.<br/>- Zippers are durable and do not get in the way of closing your case with the iPad in it.<br/>- Outside pocket is perfect.  I usually have business cards, and a small notepad and a pen in there (hey, sometimes you still need pen and paper!), but I can also fit my cell and the iPad charger as well.<br/>- Basic black goes well for school or business use.<br/>- Great for travel...goes through airport scanners with no issues even with the Otterbox on (and I love the Otterbox as well. It does add quiet a bit of weight, but my iPad is also a tank now.  I also got the otterbox at Amazon...much cheaper here!  MSRP is $90...Amazon has it for $46) <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Otterbox-APL2-iPAD1-20-C4OTR-iPad-Defender-Series-Case/dp/B003TVWNAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Otterbox APL2-iPAD1-20-C4OTR iPad Defender Series Case</a><br/>- No chemical odor from sleeve (I saw some comments regarding odor for neoprene sleeves in general).<br/>- This sleeve a durable, well-made product, and it's so inexpensive.  Now, since I have only had the sleeve for about 2-3 months, I can't attest to its long-term performance, but I do not forsee any issues anytime soon.
 Exactly what I needed for my Surface Pro 4!  The Surface fits snugly into the padded pocket with the attached keyboard . I can fit the charger, pen and paper easily.  When I travel I can add a little bag of vitamins, aspirin and other small items. Even my Bose Quiet Comforts fit into the 11.6 inch case.  All for $12 dollars !!
 Very nice product for my Ipad air and it has plenty of room for my iphone and small wallet in the front compartment.  There's actually more room so it would fit the first generations of ipads also.  Better than I though it would be.  I've dropped it once and would maybe like a bit more padding, but it didn't damage anything.  Like it a lot.
 There is nothing fancy, very simple design. Fits Lenovo Thinkpad P72 perfectly.
 I've ordered several of these bags.  We like them for their durability and design.
 Great little bag for my 11.5” Asus x200m laptop! Jut what I needed. Had extra room I needed for little notepads and pensiles and small things and is easy to haul around. Had it for a while now, and it’s holding up pretty well
 This is a great case!  It fit my Kindle Fire HDX perfectly.  I love the separate exterior zipped pocket for the pwoer cord.  i have two quibbles.  The interior is not divided.  If it had two pockets, I could put my keyboard in one and the Kindle in the other.  Second, the exterior pocket bulges with the power cord in it -- why didn't Amazon allow for the size and add a gusset.  After all, the company makes both products.
 Very premium build and premium quality and look would recomend without a doubt to anyone looking for something good to carry their laptop in.
 This laptop case has it all. The padding isn't a lot but its just enough to give an optimal amount of protection. There are many other pockets and zippers with this laptop case and you'll be able to fit some books, a mouse, pencils/pens and more into it. I bought the 15.6" version. I highly recommend this product if you're looking for a laptop case. Its a steal at this price.
 This bag is just right for what it is intended for, to safely carry my HP laptop. The bonus is it stores you phone and other small items in a well arranged manner. Well made for the price.
 It is just what I needed to carry a 14" with mosu and power supply. Laid out like other pricier bags, but what you need and nothing more.
 This case is exactly what I was looking for. I am a student and I wanted something with a shoulder strap that could hold my Lenovo Yoga 2, its charger, a computation pad, pens and pencils, and whatever loose papers I need to carry. This is perfect because the main compartment has two slots on the inside that I can put papers and my pad in and is roomy enough to do so. The front compartment will hold the charger, pens and pencils and possibly even my TI-89 calculator. Then there is even a smaller zipper compartment on top of that where I can put my phone.<br/><br/>Also, the bag seems to be of excellent quality. There is plenty of padding to protect your gear without seeming too bulky. The shoulder strap is nice. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
 I bought this for my new Kindle Fire HDX, it's quality is superb.It is a bit larger than the KIndle even with it's case on, but I consider it a bonus.  I ordered the case/keyboard to hold the kindle, but I like this neoprene black case with handle to put it all in as well as any accessories such as cables, headphones etc. Very well made!<br/>Thanks Amazon another great value.
 This is a nicely made notebook bag with good protection and storage.  The price is very fair.  I highly recommend it.
 Nice case, used it for a vacation and keeps the laptop secure. worth the money
 Perfect for carry class supplies, holds my iPad Pro and a 3 ring binder.
 Great price. Nice design and feels secure. The shoulder strap get tangle easily and the plastic clips don't spin in their sockets too well. The 3-pocket compartment in one of the zippers is cheap. I stuck my finger inside to get my thumb drive out of it and the stitching popped. If you want to just store your laptop in it then it is great. The large pockets are nice. Works for what I intended it for.
 With very little usage and almost nothing inside, (folder, 70 page notebook, two pens, my wallet) the handle started to separate from the bag.  Very poorly made!
 Paid only $9.99 for it and it fits my chromebook + accessories. Nothing to complain about especially at that price point.
 This fits my Dell Inspiron Mini 1012 perfectly and there is room in the front pocket to fit the power cable, a small wireless mouse, and a USB cable for my phone.  The neoprene material is kind of stretchy so you could probably fit a little more.  The zippers are good quality thick plastic and I like the neoprene handles which more expensive versions I saw didn't have.
 Nothing fancy about this but does exactly what I needed it to do.
 I live in NYC and take this bag with my laptop and tablet inside onto our subway system.  It has held up well with the crowds bumping into it! Also, it handles major rain and major snow without getting my items wet! I a a big type of male and the adjustable strap fits me just fine with and without a coat!
 A basic case with soft neoprene material. Works really well for my tablet.
 My laptop fits into this case perfectly and along with all the other accessories and documents that I like to carry with me.<br/><br/>ACW
 Small, holds everything I need on a daily basis for work, light, and price was great. Have been using for 4 months now and had no issues with it in terms of quality (zippers, seams, etc.) Was a great buy for me!
 My husband bought this bag for me to keep my Alienware computer in while we travel. It fits perfectly inside with enough room for the battery brick and mouse.
 I can actually place both my laptops in the same bag. Great buy.
 Durable, fits 15" Dell Inspiron easily, outer pockets hold a variety of accessories.  Highly recommend this laptop bag.
 BOUGHT TO PUT MY 10.5" DVD PLAYER &amp; ASSY'S IN &amp; IT FIT JUST FINE. SHIPPING &amp; RECEIVING WENT BETTER THEN EXPECTED, THE WAIT TIME WAS 2 MONTHS &amp; RECEIVED IN 1 MONTH
 Well constructed and roomy. Classy!
 I needed small work bag to carry my essentials for work (healthcare) separate from other things in my everyday bag and easy to toss in/out for days on or off.  This fits the bill perfectly and offers all the organization I actually need.<br/><br/>This is a great purchase to use as an organizer bag for a larger bag.
 Bought this for my husband for his work laptop. It's sturdy,  padded, durable. It has handles so you can hold it in your hands or on your shoulder. He's loves it and the price was great!
 I love love love ( my father always used to tell me I spoke in superlatives) this little briefcase. It is well padded to protect my iPad attached to keyboard and even has an extra pocket for the ear phone and a small pad of paper and pen. I cannot imagine how it could be better, yet it is called " Amazon Basic". I just wish "Amazon Basic" made an equally wonderful case for my new HUGE 17 inch laptop. .
 Very nice product for the money.  It's large, sturdy, well layed out, and well padded.  I would order again and recommend to others.
 just got it yesterday, so far great,, my 17 in.laptop fits nicely , with two external hdd's  plus room for the cord and mouse.
 We were so pleased with the quality of this product that we purchased another one for our other son who is in college.  Plenty of storage space and protection for your computer.
 Very well made.  Its protective and has 3 zippered "pockets" for misc. I'm surprised it's this inexpensive
 Typical AmazonBasics item, well-made, slim, moderately well-padded, priced right. Ballistic nylon shell with thin but compliant padding all around; includes a shoulder strap. Enough additional storage space for a slim 3-ring binder, the power supply, cord and a Logitech wireless trackball.  Fits my new Toshiba C55 laptop snugly.  It's not a Targus, but it's also not $65. Well recommended.
 Barely accepts my Acer Aspire E 15 I ordered at the same time.  Lacks padding to protect laptop.  Small for 15" laptop.
 Got this for my dad a few years ago, and it’s still in great condition!
 Not super spacious but great for keeping your laptop and some accessories safe. It is well designed and I really like it
 I was SHOCKED when I opened the frustration-free packaging...  this is a serious, high-quality case!  The inside is bright orange to make checking to see if you left anything in there much easier, and the handles are quite comfy.  A BIG, beefy zipper with large pulltabs, and a small side pocket to hold the charging cube.  Not one thread is loose or unraveled on it.  And the neoprene, I would guess it's 2-3 mil at least, it's pretty hefty.  The Amazon Basics iPad Leather folio (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VTGB0S/) fits in it perfectly.
 I have a cover/casse on my iPad 3, but I wanted a little extra protection for when I take it on the go.  Even with the leather cover case (front &amp; back) on my iPad, there is plenty of room.<br/><br/>I really like the handles--it just feels so much more secure than with the cover only.  And I love the front pocket.  More than enough room for charging cord, my mini external speaker, ear buds, etc.  Nice way to keep everything all together, even if only using it at home.
 Does everything I need for business travel.  Not the best material, but can't beat it for the price!
 Bought as a gift. It was very durable, and has many extra pockets for use. Not disappointed in the least.
 I like the cover. It fits perfectly for my new small computer.
 Wow, where else, except Amazon can you get such a well made laptop bag for such a ridiculously small price?  Just perfect for travel, holds PC securely, plus adequate room for the essentials. Shoulder strap comfortable.  Would buy another one of these.  Good product.
 It fit's well. It is also large enough to include a small paper pad and a few essentials. I'm quite satisfied with its padding, protection, and quality. And the price is right.
 Amazon quaity is perfect.  Such a great deal.  I use it for my MacBook 13 in and it fits perfect with room for the chargers and maybe some small items.  Most of the reviews said it did not withstand a drop but I am not sure what bag will do that unless it was fully reinforced.  For the price its a great buy and I will buy again if I need another.
 I bought this for my surface pro 6.  There is room for the surface and the charger, a 3 subject notebook, my mouse, pens highlighters, cleaning cloth and my cellphone.
 I love everything about it except the shoulder strap split and frayed after only a few uses. I rarely use it except on the rare occasion that I work from home.  Do they sell replacement straps?
 This bag could have been perfect but it has one major flaw that amazon NEEDS TO FIX! For the first few days the bag was perfect but afterwards it started to make a very loud, annoying and embarrassing squeak. This is because at the end of the strap is a very weak plastic connector and it twists when walking and makes a very squeaky sound like someone having sex on a squeaky bed in your bag. I purchased a replacement strap but I still recommend purchasing this if you don't mind replacing the strap with a metal one. REALLY GREAT BAG OTHERWISE.
 Very happy with this bag! I bought the 14-inch size. The main compartment in the middle of the bag easily holds my 13" MacBook Pro and my 3rd Gen iPad (9.7" display). There is a pocket in the main compartment that holds the iPad quite nicely. With the MacBook Pro and the iPad in the main compartment, I use the secondary compartment for my laptop power adapter and a portable, usb-powered DVD drive. The small compartment on the side of the bag I use for misc. papers and/or USB thumb-drives. It comes with a shoulder strap, but I haven't used it yet. Build quality seems good. It should last quite a while.
 I love amazon's Basic's collection of products.  This is such a great bag for my kindle fire HD.  It is well maid and has plenty of room for my 8.9" tablet.  There is also a front pocket that I can store things like my stylus, head phones, and tablet stand.  The side pocket is actually big enough that I can fit my ink kindle reader in it.  The price for the case is also amazing.  I will be able to use it when I upgrade to the HDX tablet.
 Exactly what I wanted for my iPad! and a SUPER GREAT PRICE!!!
 my lightweight and minorly emcumbering Chromebook. As a graphic artist, I have an overwhelming workstation, but when i travel i just want to Duolingo, email, and find what's interesting close by. This has nice central section for chromebook with pockets for flash drives and headset-mic; side pocket for charging-wires both 110 and DC, and another pocket for notepad, pencils, erasers and paperclips. Tiny portable office.
 I am happy with this Purchase. My 17 inch laptop fits perfectly with room to spare. The compartment in the front is very helpful as well as the extra space inside. The best part for me is that I’m able to charge the laptop while it’s in the case. Rugged material should last a long time.
 Bought it to carry my I pad with me for traveling.  I used it instead of a pocket book for hand luggage.  It not only protected the I pad but was also was very useful for organizing travel documents for easy accessibility.  Was also useful for carrying more incidentals than a pocketbook.  Fit easily under the airplane seat and still had room for extending my legs on a long international flight.
 Well made bag, and unbeatable price.  I will I had bought a size a bit larger, because I am trying to use it as a briefcase as well as a computer holder.  I have a macbook 13" computer and it fits very snug inside.  If I try to put more than a folder, a tablet, my phone wallet, keys, some pens my computer and my charger inside the bag, I am pushing it.  For someone who just wants a laptop case this is it.  For someone who wants a laptop case / briefcase get the larger bag.
 Great case for my s2 tab and blue tooth keyboard. Charging cords fit great in the side pocket. I loop my blue tooth headphones through the upper handles when I am transporting it.
 Carries my 14" Dell notebook and power brick perfectly with no unnecessary bulk. The bottom is structured and padded so the computer is protected in the event of a drop and doesn't sag while carrying. The shoulder strap has a pad that stays in place and is actually padded. Very happy with this bag, price is a huge bonus.
 We just received this a few days ago. For a $17 laptop bag, this is nice. It holds a 17" laptop and has plenty of space. I can't say how well it will hold up, but I will update when/if it falls apart. So far, this is very nice for being so inexpensive.
 Lots of compartments for extras. Fits laptop well and provide nice padding.
 I've been carrying this case around for months now, and it's really held up well. No sign of fraying or tearing, which is almost unheard of with cases like these. It keeps my computer and accessories well padded and neatly secured. If you have a small 11.5" netbook, this is ideal. It's small and portable on the outside, but big and roomy on the inside!
 Showed up FAST from Amazon. Seems to be pretty well made &amp; fits my laptop. I would buy again.
 Fantastic Bag!<br/><br/>I use an Ipad Air 2 and a 10" keyboard. Both fit perfectly in this bag. The handles are sturdy and the side pocket allows for carrying other accessories (I use it for a stylus and a cleaning cloth).<br/><br/>Overall a great bag for consolidating a tablet and its accessories! AND at the best price on Amazon for 10" tablet/netbook bags!<br/><br/>BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY! You won't regret it!
 Nice bag with lots of pockets.  Plenty of room to store cables and even a notepad.<br/>A little larger than I really wanted, but it will do fine.
 I am extremely fussy about my laptop bags.  This bag has the pockets I need to hold my iPhone 8 Plus and other supplies and the bag is extremely light with plenty of insulation to protect my laptop. Thank you.
 I bought both this case and a case logic one for my iPad 2.  As soon as they arrived I found this basic case was perfect for my iPad 2 that has a bear motion leather case on it.  If your trying to decide which sleeve to buy for your iPad then stop wasting time and get this one.  Couldn't be happier with it. I have thought about ordering another one to have around if for some reason this one ever wears out.  Its easy to use, has large zippers that don't bind like some sleeves I looked at.  Over all I am very pleased.
 Beautiful 🎁 love it just before Christmas 🎄 thank you Amazing Amazon I knew can count it!! 😘
 This is my third Amazon Basics laptop bag (3 different sizes). The reason is that they are lightweight, well constructed (zippers, stitching etc), well padded and low priced. There are very few frills but that's ok as I plan on just using these when I'm on the road and I need something to hold my IPod, tablet and cell phone and all the cords, chargers and accessories etc. that go with them.
 I have Dell Latitude E7450 (12.2-inch wide laptop, 8-inch height), I chose 11.6 laptop bag because I did not want gaps on both width and height of 14.1 inch laptop bag. Luckily, I chose 11.6 laptop bag, it slide through just fine. No gaps on both end of the width. From the height, it has another 1.5 inches gap. Able to store S4 phone, adapter, wireless mouse, and a book notepad and few mini size wires. I wanted to say, it is what I wanted all along and I love it !!!
 Nice bag ... No frills ... serves it's purpose .. That make me happy...lol<br/>Great bag sturdy straps well built<br/>It is an excellent purchase for anyone needing just a basic laptop bag. My son needed one for school and this one has worked like a charm and truly has served it's purpose.
 I got this for my mother's 9.7 inch tablet. The tablet slips in with room to spare. The handle is nice and sturdy.  And the bag hasn't had any tears or craftsmanship issues either. Can't think of a single complain't<br/><br/>Oh and I like the zipper pouch on the front. Definitely a nice little case.
 Good carry case. I have had the strap unlatch a couple of times which could have ended badly. Could use more padding especially on edges but they all could really. I have put hand towels on bottom and at edges for reinforcement.
 Wish inside pockets were bigger. Like another reviewer stated, the inside pockets are almost uselessly small though they may work for smaller items like white-out, erasers, vials of mechanical pencil lead, and pads of post it notes.<br/>Seems well constructed for the price and I'm pleased with it so far.
 This 14" bag accommodates my Lenovo Yoga 3 14 nicely. I am pleased with the fit, construction, appearance, and value. I have room for the Yoga, an optical drive, a 7" Kindle, a mouse, charger(s), cables, and more. Inside is a central slot for the main item, laptop/tablet, with dividers forming two additional slots. There is a second zippered compartment with 3 pouches/pockets, and a third zippered pocket on the outside (as pictured). Plenty of room for accessories, cables, and other "stuff".<br/><br/>Apparently reviews for all sizes of this product are grouped together here, so read carefully. Other sizes may have different slots and/or pockets, and at least one has a different color inside.
 I needed an economical solution for occasional storing and transporting a laptop.  The AmazonBasics was a perfect match for my needs.  Actually, I purchased 2 of these.  The first, after minimal use, I gave to a family member with similar needs, and liked the first enough to reorder another for myself.  It seems well made, and if not abused, should provide years of service.
 For the price, this bag can't be beat.  There is plenty of room for all of your accessories and a few pads or other miscellaneous things.<br/><br/>The only down side to this bag is that the shoulder strap is held on with plastic clips attached to plastic rings, and though they haven't broken yet, I don't have much faith in them.
 Exactly what I needed. The top doesn't have a flap, meaning I can easily access my laptop on a bus, train, or plane without needing a lot of elbow room. Four pockets allow me to neatly divide my stuff so I can find it quickly. I've been using it for a while now, and I've beat it up quite a bit through use, but you'd never know by looking at it. Honestly for 15 bucks I was expecting a piece of crap, but this is so far the best laptop bag I've ever had, no exaggeration.
 Beware it is extremely small. If you are looking at making this a messenger bag I do recommend going up the next size or two as you can only fit a couple of things in this.
 I bought this case to fit a14"DVD player and when she opened it, the case was to small to put DVD player in. Quality very good but to small. I bought this for Christmas gift so we just opened today. If you could help me with this even though I ordered since July, I'm just an early shopper. Thank you
 It was too small for my laptop. I mean, it was very small for a bag I bought to hold a 14-inch laptop. It felt sturdy and well-built, but I was not satisfied. I didn't even bother to return it.
 It looks much better in the picture than in real life. Though I must say that I am happy with it. The two less starts I gave it is due to the expectations mentioned being somewhat dashed. Other than that, it is practical, seems like a good purchase.
 Excellent bag. High Quality.  Had it for several months before posting this review. I use it to carry papers and electronic devices. So far it's held up under pretty rough conditions.  Zippers, handles are solid. Highly recommended.
 Tight fit, but does the job. I have a 17.3" laptop and it zips up but nothing else can be in the bag until it's zipped up. Then add the chord and what have you to the side compartments.<br/>* Very sturdy<br/>* good material<br/>* properly padded<br/>* solid handles<br/>* overall great bag
 This is a pretty okay bag. My monster 17" laptop fit squarely in the back compartment. It was easy for me to keep my accessories, papers and a notebook organized. I replaced the strap with one from another bag I had, so I can'r say much about the comfort. I can, however, say that the piece of fabric meant to attach the strap to the bag completely ripped off after about 3 months of use. This caused the zippers to come off as well.<br/><br/>Overall, pretty disappointed that I have to choose between repairing my bag or buying another one.
 Buenas tardes Estimados Amazon<br/>Con la presente le informo que el disco duro externo Toshiba canvio de 1Tb que les compre dejo de funcionar por completo , por favor necesito que me repongan el mismo producto o uno de mejor calidad.<br/>En espera de su pronta respuesta.<br/>ATTE.<br/>Tedone GIulio
 Fits a fullsize 15.6 inch laptop and a cooling pad, plus chargers and headphones. Or, it will fit my laptop and a few school notebooks. Works fine for the price
 Solid construction and ample space for my laptop, a notebook, an iPad and some miscellaneous items I need for my meetings throughout the day. This bag is not flashy or bulky, and it is an excellent value.
 Fits my Dell Inspiron 15-7000 fine.  Pocket is fine for the AC cord.  If you plan to carry a wireless mouse as well, it will probably get a little snug unless you have a smaller mouse.  Padding is adequate for casual use, but wouldn't want to drop it with my laptop inside.
 Received this purchase within specified time frame and it is just the right size with more room to fit my iphone.  I recommend this product.
 I'm using this thing in Kuwait. It does an excellent job keeping the sand out and it has a ton of space. I keep my 15 inch HP, mouse, charger, gaming controller, AND Turtle Beach's in this bad boy. Plus I'll use it to stick random things like smokes, a master lock and my wallet in sometimes. Can't get much better than this.
 I bought this for use as a brief case, than for a laptop, and it was just what I needed for holding a book, papers and pens. Its lighweight, but feels rugged enough to last many years.
 I never even heard of AmazonBasics until I went shopping for a tablet bag. I was unsure of the correct size for my ASUS T100 10.1" Transformer Book with Fintie case, but the price was right and the description sounded like it would fit. And it did, like a glove. This is a no frills bag made of padded neoprene material, dual zipper pulls on the main compartment, and a single pocket on the front for carrying accessories. It does what its supposed to do: protect the tablet and carry the extras needed.
 Great bag, is holding up quite well. No rips, tears, splitting seams, etc. Quality product.
 i dont like the sound the material makes *crinkle crinkle* on the inside.<br/><br/>otherwise seems like a decent carry case except for plastic clips and hardware, but, you get what you pay for.<br/><br/>eventually ill buck up and get 150$ leather netbook bag. for now this is fine. seems decently constructed.
 Purchased this for my 13 inch MacBook Air.  There is about an inch left over on the sides and about 2 inches left over on the top. I teach middle school so there is enough room in it to also have a good-sized textbook, along with 100 three-page essays I need to grade.  I use this everyday and love the many pockets/compartments.
 Quite a bit bigger than the 9.7 ipad, but keeps it safe from scratches. Easy to carry around. Has plenty of room for the pen and keyboard.
 Got this for my son and he loves it.  Loves the extra pockets for storage and super easy to carry and comfortable.
 The bag fits my MacBook Pro 13 inch with a bit of extra room. Has enough room to fit my iPad and other school supplies probably.
 This bag is almost an unbelievable deal.  I use it with my 15.6 inch Notebook computer and it works exactly as hoped. The price of this is amazing for the quality. It also has room for my full size mouse, mouse pad, AC adapter and more. It's very lightweight and easy to carry. I have yet to see another comparable bag for anywhere close to the price.
 Fits my 17 inch laptop even in the sleeve.  Nice product for the price.  I am hoping it lasts a long time.
 Great price for a great case. It works perfect  for me!!
 Pros<br/>- Fairly good amount of storage. I regularly carry a USB mouse, mouse pad, phone charger, laptop charger, phone,<br/>  and my laptop in this bag all at once. No issues. Even has nice divided pockets in the one of the pouches. Very nice!<br/>- For the price, the shoulder strap is a good length, and gives me confidence that it will not break. (Even with the bag fully loaded)<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- Inside materials are very cheap feeling. But what do you expect at &lt; $20?<br/><br/>Other Thoughts<br/>- The bag looks very basic/plain. Does not bother me at all. Some people care about that kind of thing.
 Very cheap material.  Will not be good for everyday use
 This is a great, magnificently crafted bag for my XPS13.3 Dell laptop. Just the right size with ample storage for a bluetooth mouse and the corresponding laptop cables. Very light and the handles are well constructed and do not cause any friction in my hands. Would definitely buy again. From the opening of the box where it was shipped to the actual placement of the laptop, a great experience.
 Bought as a christmas gift.  Excellent size for tablet.
 Perfect fit for a Samsung Galaxy 12.2 tablet! Not too big, not too small, exactly what I hoped for. Sturdy construction, but lightweight. Light padding, a couple small pockets for charger, strap handle, and lightly-padded shoulder strap. This is definitely my new go-to bag for carrying my tablet on travel. By the way, I bought the 11.6" size, which was the perfect fit for my Samsung.
 Amazon is doing it right, by making quality products, at a affordable price.  This case is everything I neeed
 This bag is sturdy, spacious, and I can carry what I need when I travel.
 I've been using this bag for about 5 months, and it's probably one of the best laptop bags I've had. My macbook pro 13" fits perfectly (and it has a protector on it, so it's a little bulkier than normal), with plenty of room for paperwork and a notebook.  I've also fit my iPad in there, in lieu of a notebook (both might be a tight squeeze).  The compartments hold exactly what I need perfectly, with room to spare for the oddball things that show up.  I adore this bag!!
 very basic, difficult to get more items in the bag once your 17" laptop is in, but it is exactly what I wanted for a great price
 Birthday gift to go with 11 inch acer chromebook. recipient hated it. Returned for refund.
 I bought this bag on Dec. 5th of 2013 and I use this bag heavily and it is just now starting to show small tears on<br/>the handles. I take the bag to meetings &amp; I bring home every night and is has held up for nearly two years.<br/>I have the Mac 15.6.<br/><br/>This one is a winner and you cannot beat the price.
 Exactly as pictured, many pockets and very durable. Has protected my high schoolers laptop very well.
 I recently purchased a tiny 11" notebook (HP stream) as an alternative to my larger 17".  I was looking for a nifty case and came across this one with it's high ratings.  I bought it right away and received it the very next day.<br/><br/>The quality is nice and it has enough space for my HP stream 11, amazon kindle, notebook charger, 1 ink pen, TI Nspire graphing calculator, and a wireless mouse.
 Love this bag!  My 10.5" tablet in it's folio keyboard cover fits perfect and there's plenty of room in other pockets/sections for all the cords and other items.  Works great for travel or carrying away from home for extra protection.  Very pleased with delivery.
 This is a great case for my Microsoft Surface Pro 3. It protects the tablet with the type cover. The side pocket fits all the other  accessories like the power supply, full size mouse, MiFi hotspot, USB drive etc. without showing too much of a bulge. I have even fitted an iPad Air with Surface Pro 3 in the main compartment. A good price compared to other name brands offering a similar bag.
 15.6 in laptop bag worked great for my Pile DVDPlayer
 This is a good but simple bag used to carry a laptop. It is good for the price ($14.99). I would have removed 1 star because, as simple as this bag is, it should cost less than that (that's just my opinion). Still, it is a good simple practical bag.
 I was worried this would be too big or too small. This fits my HP Spectre X360 perfectly, almost as if it was made specifically for the ultrabook.<br/>Its built well, pockets in all the right places and sizes, more than ample room for a normal days worth of items. Highly recommend taking the plunge and ordering this.
 An excellent quality laptop case with a tablet compartment and  inside pockets. Very light, triple zippered compartments and water resistant! Great price!<br/><br/>P.S: strap included.<br/><br/>I love it!<br/><br/>Thank you Amazon!
 A very nice, simple case. No frills to it, and it is nothing fancy, but it is what is to be expected at such a great price. I use this to carry my 11" Samsung Chromebook (2012), which fits quite well, with room for a full-sized legal pad, some papers, and additional miscellaneous supplies (pens, sticky notes, binder clips, etc.).<br/><br/>However, I am only giving four, instead of five, stars because it lacks sufficient space for a charger. I am forced to carry my charger separately when using this case, even if I only carried my computer in the case. It can be very frustrating as that is the one aspect separating this case from a stand alone computer bag. If only!
 I purchase this bag for my Apple iPad 2 a little over a moth ago and use it constantly.  The bag is stylish and protects my iPad with its soft cushion interior.  Unlike other bags it holds both my Zagg keyboard/cover and my iPad in the main compartment.  In addition it  has a side zipper pocket for your pens, note pads, stylus, charger, etc..  The handles make it very easy to carry especially if you're carrying other items along with it.  In short, this is a must have bag at an unbeatable price from Amazon.
 I use this to carry a few small items to and from the office such as my notary stamp, a handheld police scanner, pens, business cards and so on.  It's not quite big enough for paperwork you are not willing to fold but it works for my purposes.  I have been pleased with Amazonbasics Products in general.
 I really like this bag. I have two, one for work, a Lenovo bag with umpteen pockets, etc, but it's heavy. This one is lightweight and has enough pockets for what I need it for, to carry the cord and a mouse, some files and pens etc, it was cost effective and seems very well made. That's what I've found with AmazonBasics, that they are really well made items, I love their cables.
 I got tired of carrying around my ordinary sized laptop bag.  My Surface Pro 3 is small and compact, and I have searched long and hard for a bag that would match, but still carry a few essentials.  I travel frequently, and I prefer to travel light.  I was wary of this because it seemed too inexpensive, but it is perfect.  It even has the strap to hook it over the handle for my roller bag.  I wish I had bought it sooner.
 What you see is what you get.  A good, no-frills, inexpensive bag that does the job.  My nephew's 10-inch notebook fit just fine--snug, but not too tight--with good cushioning all around and good protection from zippers.  Front pocket provides plenty of room for a mouse and charger, plus more.  Stretchy fabric means that fewer items in the pocket won't rattle around.  Some buyers may  not like that larger items in the pocket, like a mouse or charger will bulge somewhat, basically to the size and shape of the item.  But the up side is that when the pocket is empty, you still have a slim carry case without extra pocket bulge.  The interior is definitely Amazon orange--not my favorite--but you know that before you buy.  Overall, a great, recommended product.
 Great bag for the money.Competes with bags costing somewhat more. Well made, keenly priced and devoid of unnecessary frills. Highly recommended.
 Love it!!!  The handle and the extra pocket are icing on the cake!!!
 Fits my aspire switch 11 perfectly, along with its charging cable, wireless mouse and other accessories.  It looks snazzy too!  I wish I could have gotten it without the amazon branding though.
 I love my new laptop bag, so convenient, perfect size. I have been using it for quite a while now and sometimes I decide to use just my laptop bag instead of my backpack. I only take a few classes tho so it is not a big bag so a lot of books wont fit. Overall I'm very happy with this product.
 The bag fits a 17 HP with no problems. Pockets work well and fit everything i need. The build is quality for the price it is a +++.
 We got this for my in-laws to go with a laptop we are giving them for Christmas. The quality is really nice and we like the extra pockets it has for the chargers, your phone or anything else you want to carry with you
 Fits my small chromebook perfectly.  Good quality.  Wish it had room to fit my power cord and small mouse..
 Based on some other reviews I was a little hesitant to order this but now that I've had it for a few weeks I am very happy that I got it. I have an HP Chromebook and it fits perfectly. There were complaints about zippers and zipper tabs but it appears that Amazon has changed those to a stronger, more durable zipper with metal tabs. I have had zero problems in that area. The outside pockets have plenty of room for chargers, glasses cases, pens, and more. The main compartment has three sections so I can also toss my Kindle in there without it rubbing against the HP. Like I said, it appears as though some of the earlier issues with this item have been corrected and right now this thing is a steal at this price.
 Excellent quality. Protects my new laptop beautifully.
 Loved it until it completely fell apart when I brushed against a doorway. Ripped the shoulder strap right off the bag. Looking at it now it was barely sewn on.<br/><br/>Still using it with the grab handle until I can get a new bag that is built better.<br/><br/>Might work for you if you never stress the shoulder strap.
 Guess I didn't research how much would fit into the dimensions stated in the description because I found that my Kindle Fire was too tight a fit and certainly could not fit the accessories needed, such as keyboard, headphones, back up power, etc.  :(  oh well,  I figure this was my fault because the construction is sturdy and it's well made.
 great bag holds a lot of personal items have several pockets as well if needed a travel bag not to heavy try this one very nice.
 Seems well made. Fits Kel-Tec sub 2000 w/butt pad. It's a little tight put it does fit. Also fits 7 high capacity mags in outer pocket and some smaller items in inside pockets.
 Great laptop case but needs more pockets.  I have a mouse for my laptop and there's not enough storage space for the cords and mouse, otherwise a nice bag.
 Seems like it will hold up, but the padding and material is a little thin. The stitching seems well made also. There are a few pockets inside each zippered area and seem sufficient. This makes carrying my laptop much easier. This is very light and would probably purchase again if need be. Great value so far.
 Seem reasonably built and zippers feel solid. Materials are also good for the price. VERY tight fit for 11.6 inch Insignia Flex 2 in 1 laptop - can only be inserted in 1 direction. Much better fit for 10 inch device such as Asus T100 TA and similar sized devices. Bough another case for the 11.6 inch laptop
 Lightweight laptop bag with plenty of pockets. I have a 15" Dell that is thick and heavy, and it fits fine into the bag along with the wrapped-up power cord and the mouse. There is also a zipper section on the outside of the bag that's very handy. I think for the price it's really great. My only wish is that it would come in different colors.
 Good cheap option to carry and protect my cheap laptop.
 This is probably the most useful thing I've bought on amazon! I carry it everywhere. It's way more useful than a backpack! Only problem is that the strap broke shortly after I started using it! Other than that it's perfect!
 I just want to add quickly to all the other 5 star reviews listed here. Unless you have a lot of extra time on your hands don't bother to read a bunch of reviews before purchasing this case. It's excellent and could easily be priced about double what it is and still be well worth buying!! It's simply one of those amazing deals which you hope to come along but rarely does.
 I am very happy I purchased this carrying case. It has lots of room to carry my three tablets and accessories. Plus there are lots of compartments to organize and store stuff. Wonderful price!
 Used it for a portable DVD player and it worked great.
 Bag is very padded. Enough pockets to hold accessories. Bought it to be used with an iPad.
 Uses plastic latches to attach strap to bag. As others have stated they won't hold. My new computer was broken. Don't buy this bag. Amazon needs to quit selling.
 i bought this for my 2013 macbook air 11.6 with a hard case that i also purchased on amazon.com.<br/>this bag is awesome, really roomy and not bulky.<br/>it fit perfectly for my macbook air 11 event with the hard case on.<br/>i can also carry two pens, charger, extension cord, portable hard drive, mouse,and couple cables,<br/>the pad on the both side is adequate, its not really thick but adequate.<br/>one thing i do wanna point out. the carry strap rings and the rings on the both side to hook the strap are made by plastic.<br/>i do wish it made by metal, since my mac book air is light, i'm not so worry, but if you use yoga or some other heavier laptop, you should be cautious  about it, or change it when you wanna carry it by the strap.
 Got this for a chrome book and it fits perfect and Carrie's all the accessories easily.
 I bought this to carry/protect my Stampin Up Stamparatus. It fits perfectly. nice weight and well designed.
 This is minimally but functionally padded and has several useful pockets. However, if you intend to carry it over your shoulder, know that the shoulder strap starts to squeak if you stuff it with some weight. You get what you pay for.
 These bags are better and more elaborate than I ever expected for the price. Room for two laptops in each bag and a lot of accessories. Buy these if you need a bag
 its an awesome most convenient bag i have had in years  for a laptop very thin and easy to carry and comfortable ... the price is perfect for this .. i have had the bag now for 2 weeks no issues
 Bad quality Very soft materials and fragil, as I read on other reference, no have sufficient amortiguation, not inspire to trust my 1500$ laptop, I prefer still use my 6yr old bag who is more strong and have more amortiguation! Possible use To carry a tablet on a future maybe 😟 My error was make blind by illusion of buy a laptop with lot review , and not read review for the bag offer, I was a stupid victim of marketing. 🙁
 On a Dell Inspiron 11 3000 laptop, there is a fatal problem: While the bag will zip up around the little Dell, the cushioning cannot cover the top edges of the laptop. The result is that if your bag takes a hit on the side facing the handle, one the edges may take the full force of the hit without any impact protection at all.
 Soooooo apparently even though the clips from the shoulder strap are tight, they're not right enough. I was grabbing the laptop bag out of my trunk and lifted it onto my shoulder where the clip gave away and the bag fell on one of its corner. I ran in my house to check and alas, a dent on the corner back of my laptop. Although my laptop seems like it's functioning fine right now, there is a terribly ugly dent. Other than that, the bag is really nice for what you pay for, although you might end up paying more for repairing your damaged laptop.
 The reviews are not wrong. This is a lot of bag for the money. Holds my ACER 15.6 laptop well, in addition to my 10" tablet in it's own case in a side pocket. I carry a charger and mouse too in the provided space. Material is light weight but very strong it seems. I like mine enough to also order another for my larger laptop. I'm finally organized!
 Great bag for the price.  Plenty of room.  Plenty of pockets.  The zipper quality is great!  Perfect!
 Gift for my daughter. Her computer fits perfectly
 This is great! I love it. It's small, yet still large enough to carry my tablet or laptop/Chromebook. Great price for a great bag.
 got this for my little nephew.. he looks like a mini ceo running around with a school bag and laptop bag now.. so parents if you want your kids to look like Donald j trump ..hopefully minus the bad haircut buy them this.. as far as the product it worked great.... there was plenty of space to store your ipad...
 This bag is perfect for my Dell 15.6 laptop and meets all my needs.  This is a reasonably priced bag that will help you transport your laptop safely and keep it close to you with all your support cables, etc.  This bag is not indestructible, but with usual safeguarding precautions should outlast the life of your laptop.  Good value and reasonably priced.
 Nice lightweight laptop bag with ample room for cords and even room for notebook and writing supplies. I have used big, heavy bags in the past that actually hurt my shoulder when I travel with them. This one is very comfortable to travel with. It fits my 17" HP Envy Laptop very nicely.
 This was exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a bag with pockets that zipper closed and this was the only one I saw that had that with everything else I wanted.
 I love my devices and they fit in this little bag perfectly.  Also holds chargers and earphones in a zipper pocket.<br/>Lots of room.  The reason I bought it is because I wanted a handle so that I don't have to lay it down when I am<br/>out and about.  Harder to walk off and leave it if you hold on to it.  Light weight but protective.
 The laptop carrying case was exactly what I expected. Plenty of room for a large laptop and accessories. I recommend this case for everyone who need a carry case.
 I got this as a gift for my father with his laptop. It is light weight and easy to travel. He is highly satisfied.
 Nice bag. Fit my laptop perfectly.<br/>Good for travel with a hanging belt so that you can put it on your luggage.
 Like other AmazonBasics items, this is sturdy and does what it is supposed to without flash.
 I love this bag. I am able to put my iPad Pro 9.7 along with my textbook for my class in it. The pouch on the front holds pens and pencils and such. The handles are perfect. Highly recommend this product for someone that needs a place to carry their 10" tablet!
 Love this bag, extra compartments come in handy too. Great product for the price.
 This is a basic laptop case. I have a Lenovo T440 (14 inch). It fits perfectly. This case has many pockets for accessories. It is well padded even around corners. I don't what happened to the laptop corners that got damaged in one review. Maybe the case has been enforced on corners. For the price, you cannot get better than this.
 It's what I expected, and I feel the product is good. My computer fits. I believe the price was reasonable.
 Works well and is just what I wanted for traveling with my tablet.  I have a bluetooth key board case and I leave my tablet in it and it still has plenty of room in this bag.  The zipper pocket for chargers, etc. is handy.  Definitely would recommend.  Note, the inside is ORANGE.  I was not expecting that but I wrote my name and phone number on the lining with marker and it shows up as soon as you open the case.
 Construction slightly cheap. Zippers work good. Not much extra storage. Few compartments but get what you pay for here
 A simple, smart and perfectly sized case. Fits my Toshiba Chromebook fine, ample room for chargers and other knick-knacks. Simple, cheap and good quality exactly what you want from AmazonBasics. Only thing I can complain about is that I'd like a little more cushion in the main pocket but really that's not necessary.
 This size was wrong recommended size for the 14 inch DVD player. Had to send it back. Went to Walmart to get proper size.
 The bag is good for the price. I received my bag yesterday. It was just a little weird that there was a white powdery substance on the shoulder pad of the strap. Besides that I believe it is a decent bag.
 For the price, it is very, very well made. Not your leather business case maybe, but terrific for protecting your laptop.
 Worked great for my 17 inch laptop plus room for other materials.
 I continue to be impressed with these agressively-priced Amazon Basic items.  Just the right package for our employees' 14" laptop and accessories.
 I recently purchased the 15.6" bag for my Toshiba Radius, and boy did I expect way less for the price. This bag is absolutely Amazing at an Amazing price. Inside there are 3 sleeves with an additional zipper pocket in front. The bag not only fit my laptop, but also my mouse pad, mouse, charger, phone, and I'm pretty sure I could fit a couple of more accessories. The only down I see in this product are the plastic clips, but hey who owns a 5lb laptop anyway. this is a great bag, and DO NOT WASTE YOURE MONEY on name brand bags, made of lesser quality...Hope this review helped some.
 Great, cheap bag. Carries my laptop and all of its peripherals without any space issues. Quality is quite good. Very minimalistic look and feel.<br/><br/>If I had to name some cons, I would say that the shoulder strap padding could be higher quality and a bit more "padded", and the plastic connectors that allow the shoulder strap to work squeak a bit while I walk sometimes. I wouldn't say that those are even close to deal-breakers, though.
 Great case and value.  It could use a little more padding at the bottom and the pockets feel somewhat cheap. Over all, it serves it's purpose well.
 Needed new light weight case, this does the job.
 Fits my 15.6 inch Hp laptop just nice, well crafted, has removable strap, nicer than cases I saw at Staples for $40.00
 Bought this since it was light weight and I just need something to carry my laptop/protect it. The bag slipped off my shoulder (as it tends to do since the shoulder strap grip is not very good) from about knee height and low and behold my screen was cracked. Didn't protect it from a 2 foot fall which was disappointing. I would suggest something a little more sturdier as one of the straps is losing it's stitching as well after only 2 months of use.
 Great product. Three compartments and the largest one has pockets for flat items. Very pleased
 Purchased for my husband's 17.3" Dell &amp; fit &amp; look perfect.
 The quality is a bit lackluster. There is no padding, which leaves the laptop extremely vulnerable. Just a little padding would have been nice.
 The laptop case shouldn't be heavier than the laptop.  This case delivers.  It's small, light, cheap, and appears sturdily built.<br/>D rings tend to 'rotate' which is a bit annoying, but all in all a fine value.  I use this for a 14" laptop right now - which fits<br/>if you don't care about zipping that compartment.  The front pouches are big enough for all I need to carry.
 I have a 14 1/2 x 10 1/4 inch laptop so this is the perfect case for me.  It holds my laptop, power cord, mouse and mouse pad and there's even room for my Kindle Fire which has it's own keyboard and case.  The case seems well constructed and is adequately padded.  I like the handles as I don't normally use the shoulder strap.  They seem sturdy so time will tell.  For the price, I am ecstatic!
 Great Laptop bag at a great price. Do wish they'd offer it in other colors. Plenty of room to store your laptop, charger and cords etc.
 No problems to report so far. It fits my needs.
 For a 17.3" laptop this ended up being very compact to stow in front of my seat on a plane, plenty of pockets too.
 I bought two of these, very roomy, very sturdy and nice look.
 Just what I needed! Love the front pocket to put the charging cord in. Room enough for an extra cord of greater length too. Also a stylists, glasses, etc. Main compartment has room for any extras you may want to include i.e. pamphlets, small notepads.etc. very roomy! Handles are a nice touch,enough room for me to actually carry on my wrist if need be.Very easy for children to hold/carry also. Only suggestions I have would be perhaps a shoulder strap to carry when walking around to leave hands free and that it come in different" fun" colors-patterns,Hopefully they will come out with this new and improved version soon! : ) Great Bag!!
 I got this case because my brother got it for his iPad2, so I got it for my new iPad 3.  It's a nice little case for the price.  Well I had the bag a week, and then it slip out of my hand as I was walking to the door of my house.  My iPad 3 and case landed on a corner on the brick.  At a height of about 3 feet?!?!  Holding the handle in your hand, it's not that far from the ground.  Well my ipad 3 cut right though the case and it scuffed up the corner of my new ipad!!!  Luckily the screen didn't crack!!!  I got it to protect my ipad, and it didn't do much protecting.<br/><br/>It's a nice designed case. The storage compartment on top is handy.  But it seems to offer very little in the way of protection from a short drop!  Your best bet it to have your iPad in a case, and put that in this case!  I had been waiting for my Clear back cover for my new iPad and just hadn't shown up yet.  If it was on, I'd have no scratches on my new iPad, just a hole in this bag.  Generally the Amazon Basic stuff is well made and at a great price.  This is no different for the most part.  If it landed flat it would have been fine, but it didn't.<br/><br/>I think it needs some kind of doubling up, or reinforcement in the 2 bottom corners to offer better protection in case you drop it and it lands like it did for me.  Maybe double up all along the bottom and corners up the size edges should be enough.  There's always a trade off from bulk and weight, to protection.  This case should offer better protection.  You aren't going to be holding this and using your device at the same time,  so a little more weight shouldn't be such a issue.  It's already a pretty light bag.<br/><br/>9-6-2017<br/>I have sold the iPad 3 along with this case.  I ended up putting the iPad 3 into a Otterbox type of case.  Which was then put into this Amazon case when not in use.  The Amazon case held up well for the 5 years I had it.  This was the 10" version.  I brought my iPad 3 to and from work every day and other places and it held up just fine.  It really doesn't offer much protection from a drop on the corners.  It's just not very padded.  It's gotten dirty, I just threw the thing into the washing Machine and it came out looking like new again.  My 3 star rating stands.  It's a Cheap case.  You get what you pay for.  I now have a new iPad Pro 12.9" and using a much nicer case that's well padded.  This case was about $9, the one I have now from Amazon I paid about $30.  Don't expect these cases to protect your device in a drop!!!  It's just not going to.
 Fit perfectly, nice and snug, exactly as described. Feels durable enough for my pre-teen &amp; a little extra space for his paper notebook!
 This is a wonderful bag!  I bought this to carry my ipad, and it's wonderful, with enough rooms for some folders and pens for school!  I'm in college, and I have to walk around on campus so I needed something portable and not too heavy to carry my tablet.  This is wonderful, and for the price, I would highly recommend this product!  I love it!
 Love the price. Normally the Basics products are very good. But this bag is too small. My dell 15.6 laptop just fits tight. You scratch the laptop zipping up the bag. Holds the power cord. But no room for a tablet. You have room for some papers and a phone, that's it. It's just barely a laptop only bag.
 As a frequent flyer I was looking for a small bag to accommodate my tablet, Kindle, and some files i needed to review during my trips.  This was perfect for me.  It has a strap on the bag that helps to hold it in place while resting on my roll-a-board bag.  This fit under the seat in front of me without me having to give up my legroom.
 I bought the 17.3" bag and my 17" Ailenware laptop will not fit.
 Holds my tablet and all the accessories. Excellent value for the price.
 I bought it for my new Dell XPS13. Very good fit, plenty of space for accessories. I haven't used it much but first impression is very good.
 I like this bag a lot.  It is a perfect fit for my 17" Toshiba Laptop.
 It's a very basic laptop bag with no extra compartments to store pens or other miscellaneous items.  I returned it the day after I purchased it.  If you don't mind the lack of organization then you would be okay using this.
 I love the design and it has 3 pockets and even slots for my mouse
 A very nice little bag. Works perfectly with my Dell netbook. The bag has held up very well, showing very little wear over months of use. Storage is very good for a small bag of this size, and the price couldn't be beat.
 Received order faster than promised.<br/>My Dell 11.6" notebook fits perfectly . I can fit the charger and some accessories as well as a couple of files etc.<br/>The quality is very good especially for the price. I would strongly recommend this bag for price and quality and fit
 Just received the bag today! I have my laptop, external Blu-Ray drive, all my cords, and the set-up discs I need in the bag. I could easily fit (2) 100-page notebooks and the hand-outs from all my classes inside of it, still. I'll update this review if anything arises from my use.<br/>Price: 5/5<br/>Space: 5/5<br/>Material: 5/5<br/>Sturdiness: 5/5
 Great for storing my HP Laptop 15.6" and cords.
 For the cost, I was very surprised with the quality of this bag. It's awesome. It is padded and can hold an 11.6 Chromebook, a mouse, the power cables, and with possibly room left for a tablet or notebook. There's also a space to hold pencils or pens. And the shoulder strap is pretty decent. I bought this item as a gift and will probably order one for myself because I like it that much. Always impressed by Amazon.....
 Bought for a laptop that is "entry level". IE, so slow that it is faster to go to the neighbors house and check your email and then come back than it is to wait for the thing to boot up. So it was placed into this nice new bag and then put in a drawer. I'm sure this bag will make a nice storage location for that stupid computer!
 It’s exactly as is. It’s very convenient to carry around an 17 inch laptop in the bag. The bag is specifically made for small to medium size laptops.
 What a great case for my 14 inch Lenovo.  Enough room for the cord and mouse in front pocket.  I could have spent more money...bit why?
 I like how simple but nice and useful this product is. Even though it is small, it perfectly fits a 14" laptop and there is some room for some more material in one of the other compartments. Great product at a great price!
 great bag, especially for the price point. The only reason i don't give it 5 stars, is due to the tearing of the shoulder strap. I use it normally as my daily bag. The seem has already begun to tear apart.
 The Asus Transformer with attached keyboard I got Black Friday fits right in with hardly any slop remaining. The Transformer and keyboard dock together are heavy, but it all feels secure in this nice, cushioned pouch. Love the close, padded handles and pull covers too. Plenty of room in the side pouch for the charger and whatnots. Now I can toss the thing into a tote or briefcase and head out without worrying about dust, dirt, rain and bumps. I might get more of these for tools and gadgets I have that need protection. Eggselent price for this, too, BTW.
 I actually bought 2, 1 for my son &amp; the other for my oldest nephew &amp; they both love it, has several zipper compartments  to put the charger 🔌 cables in &amp; room for so much more
 Great little bag.  I purchased for carrying a bluetooth speaker (flat and rectangular) and associated accessories.  Well made with sufficient space.
 This is an absolute steal for the money.  Spacious room in the fabric dividers; ample pockets to store items such as the power cord.  I use mine with my teaching materials that I lug back and forth.  Also, the adjustable padded strap fits snugly to my shoulder.  Definitely a ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
 Great bag. Nice compartments.<br/>Easy carry on.
 haven't really use it yet.but it is durable for now.
 I love this bag so far. I bought this because I received a Surface Pro 4 for Christmas. This is the perfect size to hold my Surface, the charger, my flat mouse, plus more. The material seems sturdy, like it will withstand some where and tear. You cant beat the price for this size bag.
 Why spend more on other bags in this size category when this works great for the given price point?  I have had no issues with this product and would give it a buy rating.
 Good bag overall. However the straps squeak sooo much every time I walk. The inside lining on one of the pockets ripped too, of course right past my return deadline.
 Perfect fit for my Chromebook  3 but with room for charger, mouse, and a few miscellaneous items. Very smart looking and can fit anywhere on an airplane. Quick access to all items. Highly recommend!
 Inspiron 11 inch 3147, fits snug in the main compartment. great budget bag my only complaint is that there is no soft interior lining. my new laptop already has a couple small/light scratches from entering and exiting the bag... boo also a bit tight for the power adapter. i would recommend buying a slim travel adapter for this case.
 Thank you it’s just right for my chrome book and my tablet..very light weight I love it..
 Great experience and the product is exactly as stated. Perfect for what we need
 The laptop bag is very small and does not have good padding to protect the laptop. The bag is very thin. Cheap material used to manufacture the bag. I returned it.
 so scared something will happen to my bag so I'm ordering another just on the safe side! I love this bag, it's perfect.
 love all the features works perfect for my chromebook
 For the price, this is the best laptop case out there. Fits my MSI workstation with a 17.3” screen with ease. Love the front pockets for charger cable and mouse storage.
 I use this bag every single day.  I mean 365 days a year. I have worn a hole in the bottom. it is time to get a new one. I got my moneys worth about 10 times over with this product. Sometimes I wished it had a few more pockets but then I realize it would be bigger and cost more money. This is the perfect size for me. It is lightweight and easy to use.  I love this bag.
 I have bought several AmazonBasics items, including a camera bag, a tablet case, a hard case for assorted electronics, HDMI cables, and a laptop bag. Every one of them has been under $15 and of better quality than those going for $50 for at your local store. Any time you need a basic item that is available from AmazonBasics, buy without hesitation.
 Fits iPad Air 2 perfect, even with my case (mine is a small case). Front pocket perfect for holding cables/battery/etc.
 The AmazonBasics 15.6-Inch Laptop &amp; Tablet Bag makes for a great concealed transportation unit for my newly purchased laptop. It is sturdy, with lots of space for storage. It works well with both the detachable shoulder strap and the attached handles. I was able to fit all of my accessories and a few other things that I often use in correlation with my computer. I would recommend this item to anyone!
 I just purchased a Dell 11.6" 3000 Series Laptop but no OEM Box. Adding this laptop/tablet bag, which looks fantastic is what I'll use to protect it while being shipped in the Amazon Box it came in... Not much more to say other than thank you to Amazon for having such a beautiful laptop bag at a more than fair price...
 Seems to be well made for the price. There is a good sized pocket for organizing and storing additional items like the power cord, business cards, pens and a couple of note pads. The strap is comfortable, however the zippers aren't the best (having a dual zipper for the main pocket would be nice. But for protecting my work laptop from most everyday things like transporting in the back of my car, or through the tsa and air travel, this bag works does as it is advertised.
 So I got this last year and I still use it. I pack a lot of things in it and it lasted a long time. I've since jammed one of the zippers but it's still super functional, when I'm leaving for a night I just jam my laptop and clothes in it hahaha. It's really good, high quality in my opinion, I recommend it.
 Very well made and works great for my chrombook. Great extra storage.
 Purchased for portable dvd player but great for a laptop.  I was so impressed with the excellent price and quality of this product.  Simply Amazing!
 Works really well to carry my tablet .. Would buy again
 I have a Lenovo N22 Chromebook. I didn't want just a sleeve. What I was looking for was basically a miniature laptop case with some storage. This is exactly what I hoped it would be. Perfect.
 Couldn't ask for more for such a great price. I got this bag for my C720 because I wanted something as small as it is. It's got just the right amount of space, light and small. plenty of room for a charger and probably an iPad if you wanted to shove one in there too. As well as a small external hard drive, mouse, etc and few other assorted items like phone and charger for that etc.
 Lot of nice features and quality in this bag.<br/><br/>Later I decided I needed two and got a cheaper brand.  Which it was.
 Nice attache for laptop or other things.
 Too small.  Won't fit Dell Precision M6800.  Tried but it just won't fit.  This is a larger laptop with a 17.3 diagonal screen.  Not much room for the large power supply.  Otherwise it's what you would expect. Not great materials but probably would work.
 Very nice bag, holds my large laptop, mouse, cables, Kindle Fire, stylus, camera, still room for more. Well made.
 I am storing a multi effects guitar processor in this bag for transport.
 I found that the manufacturer's bag did not have room for the charger and stuff.  This bag holds a 15" computer and all of it's accessories without being bulky.  I like the quality of the materials in the bag too.  This is my third purchase of this bag.  I gave two as gifts to grandkids and they love it. This one's mine !  :-)
 For the price it was definitely worth it.<br/><br/>If you're like me and are kind of rough with your bags, it may not be for you. I don't use it often, but I can imagine myself getting some wear and tear soon if I'm not careful.
 I ordered this product on Wednesday,January 16, 2013 and it was delivered Saturday January 19, 2013...Quick service! I was able to fit my iPad, and wireless Logitech keyboard with a little room to spare. Inside of the front zipper pocket, I was able to fit the charger for the iPad and a battery pack with all the accessories. The bag is perfect! It's not too big, not too small, but enough room for me to carry around everything I need for my iPad without carrying excess baggage. And all for the small price I paid! I've shopped around for other bags and they cost $20 or more. this is by far, the best deal I've found for $10. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who carries their iPad and accessories everywhere they go! Thank you, Amazon! I've been a customer for a very long time and I will continue to be!
 Amazon Basics always seem to be very high quality at a great price.  This was true again with this Laptop Bag.
 This is the second one of these we bought. We bought one for my netbook and then another one for my husband's. Both are 10.1" netbooks. We like it for it's snug fit, perfect size, comfortable handles, low price, and quality of materials. It works great, it expands to hold a few more things (I also pack an external hard drive and a small wacom tablet with it, as well as other netbook accessories such as USB cords, the power supply, and a compact mouse). It's a tight fit, but it all goes in there.
 This was the perfect bag for my new HP Pavilion X2 12 four in one laptop/tablet that I recently purchased.  Also got this Amazon Basics bag for a better price than I could have found for the equivalent bag elsewhere.
 This bag serves my need perfectly!  I'm very impressed how great this bag is for the inexpensive price.  Granted, the more expensive bags have more pockets, but for me, who's gone back to school, it serves its purpose beautifully.  Someone mentioned in their review something about insufficient padding in the bottom corners, but I don't see an issue whatsoever.  This bag is a GREAT investment for someone who's looking for a basic bag and not having to carry a lot of files... there's just enough pockets to carry just what you need.  It's very, very, very well made with a smooth zipper and a thick shoulder pad.  Even the handles are well padded.
 I like that its the perfect size fir a laptop
 Use this every day...love it!  Perfect size for my iPad Pro 9.7 with charger, iPencil, etc. Good construction.  Smooth zippers.  Interior smartly designed with three sections and exterior has two good compartments.  HIGHLY recommend if the size fits your need.
 I received a mini-I-pad for Christmas.  I ordered this bag, and shortly before it arrived, I received a smaller one as a gift.  It fits right in this Basic's I-pad bag giving me a very good, safe cushion for the I-pad.  I especially like it because I can also carry the charger in the outside pocket, so I can safely charge up even while not at home.
 These are great bags for carrying and protecting your Laptops/Tablets, charging cable/transformer, wireless USB mouse, USB Flash Drives, etc. that you like to have with you. I have one for my 11" ChromeBook. Sadly I didn't care much for the ChromeBook though. I had no problem using the Operating System though. I suppose just didn't care for the difference in Windows vs Chrome OS.
 Much better than expected despite all the positive reviews. Very well constructed and just about the perfect size. The only negative is that I wish it had a few more extra pockets inside the pockets. Also, the handles tend to flop down and get in the way of zippering the side pocket. But that's minor.
 This bag holds my iPad, kindle and galaxy 3 phone. For the price it's a steal. Seems sturdy, soft protective neoprene is just what I wanted. I have the Amazon camera backpack and love it so took a chance on this bag for my iPad.  Didn't realize it had another zippered compartment that my kindle fits in (upright) and can slide my phone in to boot. Thanks Amazon.<br/>Still going strong 6 months later. Will buy for gf for xmas.
 Really good laptop bag. Totally protect my laptop from anything. And your can fit your charger, phone, tablet (if you have one). It's a perfect work bag can fit all of your technology for work and school.
 It was even better than expected - doesn't have a cheap look and fits my 15.6 inch laptop and its charger easily.
 I use my AmazonBasics bag to carry my iPads. There's very little padding on the sleeve, but my iPads are in a protective case so I feel quite safe. It's not a snuggle fit, quite loose actually if you only have one iPad inside. If you're looking for something that is exact fit for your iPad, then you should avoid this. If you want something to carry an iPad and a book, then this is great!
 Got this as a way to carry multiple small electronics when traveling. Needed something to carry 2 PaperWhites, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0" + keyboard as well as a couple of phones &amp; a MP3 Player with earbuds. So this should work perfect.<br/><br/>Picked this size over the next size smaller as this one seems to have more features for only a few extra dollars. Build quality is good for the price.
 This bag is basically perfect in terms of what I was looking for, and the price is amazing. My boyfriend bought a near identical bag from best buy for close to $40 and you can't see a real difference in quality and style between them. I like the extra pockets, I am able to put my charger and a textbook in the bag along with my 15.6 inch laptop. The only downside is I'd like my laptop to fit in the pocket on the inside - I have to have it in the big open space which allows it to wiggle around.
 For my mother again, convenient for toting around if you have peripherals you are using for your laptop.
 When I got my new computer I was disappointed to discover that it did not fit into my old bag due the wider format of the screen.  When checking for bags I again looked for the name brand of the prior bag.  I was surprised to find this for the price.  The "name brand" was twice the price.  This has room for a lock cable, an extension cord, my portable HD and other small items.  The stitching seems secure and has some reinforcement.  I have been using it daily for a month now and I am completely satisfied.  Hopefully it will hold up better that the name brand did with zipper problems after three years and one of the carry handles  pulling loose.  The strap fittings are not metal, but the material used seems solid and strong enough.  Amazon seems to have chosen a good supplier.
 Great looking bag, holds a lot of other things with the lap top, highly recommend
 I bought this to use along with the AmazonBasics Laptop Sleeve and it's perfect. It's lightweight but offers great protection and I like the fact that it has handles in addition to a removable strap. I was amazed at the quality considering the price and I'm so glad I purchased this.
 This is a really nice bag. I use it for my PS4 when I travel. Everything fits perfectly. For the price the quality is really good.
 Simple design and very light to carry. I've had laptop bags that were a burden to carry even without contents. I carry this to work every day. It's plenty for a MacBook Pro 15, the power adapter, and a wireless mouse. Carrying more is possible but not optimal - this clearly isn't designed for a multitude of accessories. Travel light and you'll be pleased.
 Well made construction and quality components too...  holds and protects my Lenovo ThinkPad securely for storage and automobile travel!!!
 We really like this bag for our laptop. Excellent construction, good amount of padding for protection good quality zippers and plenty of compartments to keep things organized. Very happy with this purchase and would not hesitate to recommend it to others.
 This a great case for carrying the iPad, even with a bulky silicone cover.
 I'm using this bag for my Asus T-100. Plenty of room in the main compartment for the T-100 with the keyboard dock (and both with the iPearl cover. The secondary compartment holds the charger, cable, and the TekNmotion tablet stand. Everything I need for heading out the door with the T-100.
 Excellent quality. Sometimes you get more than you payed for and this laptop bag is an example. I would have payed twice the asking price and I still would have been happy.
 This bag fit my laptop perfectly and has plenty of space for the cord, and other equipment I carry.  So far, it's holding up well.
 I was skeptical when I ordered this case, at such a low price I wasn't expecting much, but it's quite nice!  Seems sturdy, good material, perfect size for my 14.1" Dell Latitude.  And plenty of room for a cord and a mouse in the outside pockets. The handles seem sturdy too.  As an aside, I only use this at home, so I didn't need anything fancy or "road-worthy",.<br/>Definitely worth the price, and more.
 I first purchased one for my 17" laptop and liked it so much, I bought this 15" one for my other laptop. Functions well with pockets for all accessories and personal belongings. These bags seem to be made pretty durable. My 17" laptop bag has lasted for a few years with lots of air travel and I except this bag to last a long time as well.
 I have a kindle fire HD 8.9, inside a leather cover.  I ordered this case because I wanted just a little more room.  I'm simply amazed at how well this little bag hold everything.  I carry my charger, bluetooth keyboard, earbuds, pens, small notebook, cell phone, and a variety of other things.  The bag does not look stuffed and has good padding.<br/><br/>I would definitely buy this bag again.
 This computer bag is totally adequate! Its design is unobtrusive, its materials sturdy and serviceable. The zippers are heavy-duty and its shoulder strap is comfortable. It is not the most padded bag, but the padding is certainly functional for daily use -- just don't hurl your laptop at the ground. It holds my oddly wide 15.6" laptop with plenty of room for peripherals, plus my ebook reader and various other handy items. It's good for short or long trips, seeing as it is a bag and won't get tired.
 Some of the stitching is coming undone but it's cheap so that's to be expected. I don't care for the "Amazon basics" logo on the bag as it screams "this is cheap". The small series of pockets don't fit the length of an average pen... Which is weird.Oh well. I needed a bag for my laptop.
 Fast delivery. Well made. Great Price. This tablet bag hold my Kindle HDX 8.9, the charger, the keyboard, a generic USB charger, and the Amazon "Premium" earphones (see my less-than-premium review of these). And there's even room for a few additional extras.<br/><br/>The bag is perfect for my Kindle-carrying needs. 5 stars.
 I couldn't believe the quality of this bag for the price that was asked. It fits any 11-12 inch laptop quite snug and with enough padding to keep the bag slim while safely cushioning your device. The extra pockets provide room for your charger and/or stylus and a few other small things, and the included strap is very comfortable.
 I wanted a little laptop bag I could use alone or stick in another case. When I did a search for 14" laptop cases I was surprised to see this one for such a low price. I couldn't resist so I grabbed it. It is great and works well for the reason I purchased it. I just ran to Best Buy and glanced at theirs, noticing they were easily $50 or more. Great deal!
 Perfect for my IPad Air 2. It had enough to room even with a case. I did see another review mention the lack of extra padding at the corners. Yes it is not reinforced but with case it should be fine. Material feels durable. Very simple but to carry your IPad and a few items it perfect.
 Perfect for my 13" laptop.  Well constructed, lots of storage pockets, great value.
 Carry my laptop and important papers... Works as it should
 I like everything about this bag...a great buy. Its well padded and wrist and shoulder carry options make it perfecto.
 Great quality. Perfect size for my Microsoft Surface Pro laptop/tablet!  Very happy with this purchase.
 Nice size, weight. Plenty of pockets and zippered compartments. Can switch back and for between hand straps and shoulder strap. Cleans nicely, padded, protects my laptop.  Also, lightweight, so not much added weight when toting computer.  Fits my mouse pad, charger, remote mouse, instructions, --everything I need into one case. Very stru\\urdy.
 I use my laptop 1x/month so I bought an inexpensive case but I sure expected it to last longer than $1.42/use.  Maybe I got a lemon?  I'm bummed I don't like to waste money or time.  This purchase was not a good one for me, don't know if a year later I can return.  Bummed...
 I use it daily for work and it works flawlessly.
 I like this bag, except the front pocket opens from the side. Would be perfect if it opened from the top!
 Flimsy material, can't even seem to be able to balance when carrying on shoulder. Initiated a return.
 Absolutely love this bag for my new samsung chromebook, It fits it perfectly with still room in front panel zippered area for the charger and then I just put the mouse on top of the chromebook in the main zippered part of this bag.  Even better yet, the quality of this Amazon product is amazing. Suprised this item isn't twice the price.
 This is way to small.I have a 14 inch Acer laptop and this is too small.It doesn't fit at all
 This is a very good bag, nice sizing and plenty of space and pockets. It is a BASIC laptop bag, not extreme padding so it will not protect the contents from being damaged if abused. Excellent $$ if you are looking for a bag for your laptop and tablet, they both fit together.
 I bought my iPad and I wasn't planning to buy a case, but then I thought that I probably wanted to protect my expensive new iPad. I bought this case because it was affordable, and I've been very pleased with it. Quite high quality, good fit for iPad, extra pocket for carrying pencils or a few papers. I've been using this case a lot as I'm biking around campus, or just tossing it in my backpack with textbooks. Materials feel high quality, handles are good, even the rubber covered zipper handles are nice. Well worth the purchase.
 This bag is exactly what I wanted. It's reasonably small, has lots of pockets, and is durable. And, topping that off, it's reasonably priced! When I travel internationally, I take only my iPad and a compatible keyboard. The pockets hold all of my other travel items...eye drops, power supplies, cables, etc.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this bag.
 17.3 inch bag does not fit a 17 inch laptop. I have a 17 inch Acer Nitro Black, purchased on Amazon, which is a very thin laptop, and it simply does not fit in the 17.3 inch version of this bag. They don't make a bigger one, so I either return this, or make do with not being able to zip it shut. Sucks, because this is a nice bag otherwise.
 Good cheap case. Pretty thin especially on corners. Compact size. Fits my Lenovo 710 just fine.
 really much nicer than I expected. My only complaint was I bought it for the 7 inch Kindle and it is plenty big enough for the 9 inch. It is advertised for the 7-10 inch. If you don't mind lots of room on a smaller Kindle, it is great. It you are worried it is not big enough for the larger Kindle, relax. It's huge.
 This is a very good laptop bag. It’s not too bulky, and not too thin. It has great padding, and many places to put your laptop, a cell phone, a tablet, a charger, etc. I DEFINITELY recommend this product. I love it so much, especially the amazon logo on the front. It also comes with a detachable strap if you choose to wear the bag like a messenger bag across your body. I am very satisfied with this product.
 Very happy with this laptop bag. My Chromebook fits PERFECT inside.I can also put my Amazon  Basics mouse inside and my ear buds.<br/><br/>5 stars all the way!
 This is a no frills item that holds a laptop and connectors, mousepad and mouse and that's about it.  Good basic laptop bag, and the price is right.  Best for infrequent users.  Arrived in perfect condition and on time.
 I really love this bag! For the price you would think it would be pretty cheap looking/feeling but it's actually very nicely made. It has padding inside the compartment where your laptop goes and there are plenty of pockets and things to store the computer's power adapter as well as an external mouse, backup battery and even an external optical drive and all the necessary wires. I highly recommend this product!
 The case easily holds my new HP, the cords, cabling plus other items.
 This bag is lightweight and holds my laptop, mouse, and power cord.  It’s perfect for my needs and the price is incredible.
 I'm not using the Bag for my laptop.  It fits my notebook and related paperwork I need for my position of Financial Secretary in the organization<br/>I belong to.
 Needed a case for the iPad air.  Chose this since it could hold a lot of accessories.  Very happy.  Can get the air , kindle hd and the kindle reader into this case.  Good value for the money.  The inside has vinyl pouches so we shall see how long they last…..even if they do not I can always put the popcorny sheets from the Amazon packages in-between the devices and jam along like a happy clam.
 Very good and for the price awesome
 Good product  Low price,  durable, love it
 this is the perfect case to hold the MacBook Air 13 inch laptop with plenty of space for my iPad as well as such accessories as a mouse, power cable, memory cards and even a portable had drive.  Will all that in there....and more, the package is surprisingly thin and light.  A superb product.
 I bought this for my daughter for school. She has to carry a Chromebook and a number of folders, notebooks, and a huge 3-ring binder around all day in addition to a pencil case. They are not allowed to carry their backpack, but a messenger bag is allowed. This works well for her so she doesn't have to carry everything in her arms.
 I'm very pleased with this little case. At less than $10, it's hard to see how Amazon makes money on something so well designed and constructed. (Guess they don't have to). Since the iPad Air pairs with a standard Apple wireless (bluetooth) keyboard, this carrying/protecting case is perfect. Opening the zipper to the main pocket reveals the bright orange lining, making the iPad easy to see and remove. The other zippered pocket is perfect for small must-haves.<br/><br/>The only question is how long it'll last. I'll update the review in about 6 months.
 Great bag. Can hold my DELL laptop, Ipad and samsung phone. Im happy with the purchase
 Carries my laptop efficiently, fits well, easy to carry, ans srong.
 Great size!! Lots of extra room for accessories!!
 I bought this to hold my new ipad (the newest one that hasn't come out yet that is larger than the current models).  This case is awesome.  It will of course hold my ipad perfectly, but there is also room for client files and for brochures.  It comes with an arm strap (detachable) as well as having the small handles that are attached.  I am very happy with this purchase.
 Strong straps has a good amount of sections for other things. I was even able to place my ps4 in it comfortably
 One of the handles frayed at the connection to the bag after a few months,  and still appears to be hanging by a string, but amazingly it has not broken yet.
 It is a really a good bag and it does exactly what it says. Nothing is fancy, just a usual laptop bag which is exactly how it is supposed to be. Easily the best bag you can get at this price range. I was surprised to find out that the 2 additional pockets besides the main one used to put the laptop are pretty spacious. I was expecting to be able to put only a charger in those additional pockets but I am also able to put a book and some other additional utilities and it still fits everything in it. I would definitely recommend it.
 Quality and appearance of computer bags are much better than I expected for the price. We would purchase again.
 Super useful...I changed out the shoulder strap with another from a different bag as it felt a little flimsy. The bag itself is a great value for the price.
 Couldn't like without this as my grandson carries his laptop with him like a woman and her purse.  Very well padded providing protection for the laptop.  Great item. Glad I got it for him.
 Looks nice, decent capacity. the shoulder strap is comfortable and there's a pocket just the right size for my iPad. BUT, this is a pretty flimsy case. The handles are starting to tear off (after less than a year), and stitching is starging to come undone. I travel a lot and really need something more durable. This isn't it.
 I bought this for my dad to take his laptop with him on the go when performing. He loves it! Fits the laptop perfectly, notes and sheet music, mouse, etc. Nice that it has the strap so he can easily carry his equipment with less trips to/from the car. Would recommend! Also, great price.
 Most certainly basic, but it seems well padded and has enough room for power cords and other cables, but not much more.
 A gift for my son. He loves the bag about as much as he does the computer it is designed for. He says all his school stuff fits into the bag along with the computer - no more back pack.
 This is a great product. It fits my 15.6 inch laptop perfectly with extra pockets for the charger and other things such as my notebook for work. It has just enough space and isn't too bulky. I prefer this laptop bag to my old one.
 Purchased this as a gift for my step dad, he uses it everyday and it’s held up well so far. No frills, but just what he needed.
 It's great for our New Acer we bought . The computer fits perfect with the power cord and mouse. There's still plenty of room for other things in the carrying case as well.
 I didn't expect much for this case but I needed one to take my laptop and tablet on a plane trip. It was a lot more secure and padded than I expected. The zippers were well built too. I'd buy this again for the price if I needed another one. Fit my 15.6 in laptop, 10 inch tablet, and all related charger/accessories just fine.
 Bought this to protect my new Samsung Tab A 8" tablet.  Unit fits well in the case including the charger and cable
 For the price this is an excellent case. It holds a tablet and small laptop plus some accessories. No padding but it has become my go to daily case even over my more expensive padded cases.
 This is a great laptop bag at a super price.  Lots of side pockets and great zippered areas.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes to carry a small laptop and other accessories. the pockets fit my power supply and an extra mouse. The shoulder strap is very comfortable.  I looked locally at a big box store and this one is 1/3 the price and very nice quality.  I would buy again!
 I bought this for my iPad 2 for the rare occasion I take it out of my house. I expected it to be a much snugger fit, based on similar cases for laptops I'd previously owned. This case is clearly designed for a much, much thicker device than an iPad. It just flops around inside the case.<br/><br/>The case is otherwise a fine case, it just isn't really an iPad case despite saying so in the title. I'll probably just fill it out with a good sized book or something so the iPad isn't just floating around.
 Very nice comp bag. 4 months so far no issues.
 It's hard to complain about anything given the price.  I think the bag is amazing for the price, simply amazing.  However... All of the lining is this scratchy nylon (I think it's nylon) and it's pretty brutal to my MacBook Aluminum finish.  Other than that it's great, simply can't beat it for the price, but I would have spent the extra .20 if I were amazon to get a better mater for the laptop portion.
 Perfect carrying size and laptop fits in it just right.
 I'm baffled at how amazon could have composed such a nice case. It not only looks nice but protects my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 very well. It even has extra room to fit my case and Bluetooth keyboard!! The small pocket holds my external battery, cables, and adapters and a few other miscellaneous items. For $10 this item is a STEAL no doubt about it!!!! I've paid close to $60 for cases at bestbuy that don't stand a chance against this one.
 the price is good for the quality
 Plenty of pockets and space but still not bulky
 It is thin, light and constructed well. It fits my ipad pro perfectly with some room for papers. The zipper closure is high quality and the whole thing works so well for what I needed.
 Great for my 4 year old's bag for church that holds all of his colored pencils, notebook, etc. it would be quite small for an adult but fits perfect as a cross body bag for my child
 Great product, strap is holding up
 Excellent and appealing bag. I use it for grad school and professional settings, works great.
 I really like this bag and I use it every day. the delivery was perfect as usual.
 Almost exactly what I was looking for. Sizing is great for my 10 inch Dell Notebook. Bag is well made and padded pretty well. However, my only complaint is that the picture of the accessory compartment don't match the product. The picture shows three pockets on the inside and this smaller bag only has two pockets. I have a few accessories and needed all three pockets, otherwise this would have been a five star review. But for the price (under thirteen dollars), it's still a great deal and I'd buy it again.
 Pretty much what I expected for the price. Light weight with enough internal and external storage for all the accessories, charging cord and mouse.
 Perfect for iPad Air when traveling!  I have the Apple Smart Cover and the Belkin Shield Sheer Matte snap case for the back.  Those two products provide some protection and look and feel great but offer minimal protection when traveling.  This little wonder: a miniature, neoprene laptop case is terrific and an incredible value as well as excellent quality.  WOW+++ Recommended for all iPads!
 I was skeptical at first but this Product is actually very good I carry it everywhere in the sun in the rain in the end it looks brand new
 Made very well.  Comparable to expensive ones sold at Office Products store.  Lots of pockets and thick strap.
 Carrying my computer and other research items.
 Amazon Basics is amazing and this product is no exception! Looks great, and feels like good quality! Great size for 17.3" Laptop.
 Bag part works well. I like all the pockets. The strap was so squeaky and flimsy. I replaced the strap within a week. Still using the bag though!
 I bought this one for a 11.6 tablet after trying the 11.6-Inch bag first.  It was too small for accessories.  The 14-inch has plenty of room to fit my large charger, mouse, flash drive, cell phones, etc in the front pocket while also fitting the tablet and a pad of paper or small notebook in the main area.  If you need to carry a few accessories with you, I would suggest you buy a little larger than you need.  I've only had it a short time but I carry it on and off all day and it has held up well.
 I ordered this for my 11" ASUS laptop computer and it fits just right with room for a tablet, pocket for a mouse and other accessories. All padded very well..
 Bought this in Aug 2018. Now it does not work in Dec 2018.<br/>Never buy a product that can't be shipped back to the USA if you live in another country. Read the fine print!
 It is durable and it holds my wife’s laptop great.
 Fits my new 16.5" HP laptop perfectly!
 I am a college student so I use this bag just about every day. It has enough pockets for my mouse, art tablet cord, chargers, and usb drives. HOWEVER the padding on the strap is coming undone. This isn’t a big deal for me personally but it kind of sucks because everything else about the bag is great.
 It can hold my laptop and journal, along with other items. I just wish the pockets had more variety of uses but still, you can't beat the price.
 Great for the price.  Not real wide, so don't get it if you want to carry alot of other stuff around with it.  Add the power supply, it really bulks up the case.  I knew this going it, but I'm not thrilled with plastic hooks and rings for the shoulder strap.  I have purchased a few for staff here and none have broken, it just worries me that its plastic.  It's a good case for just being a case.
 Love! IT IS PERFECT. VERY Durable.
 It's exactly what they say it is: value purchase, large enough for 17" laptop, well made, limited but sufficient storage for daily use, not week long trips perhaps.
 Bought because my 17" laptop didn't fit into my regular briefcase. In addition to the main large area for the laptop, it has one large side pocket inside for cords &amp; such and one smaller. There is one small flat pocket on the outside. Not large enough for much more than the laptop and accessories, but sufficient.
 This is an excellent case.  It protects the computer perfectly and is well made from high quality materials.  The padding is really good and it comes with a nice strap.  Just take note that the case is made to hold the computer and charger only.  I use the case instead of a sleeve in order to provide more protection.
 Ok for what it was designed for
 Great bag! Fits my Acer 11.6" Chromebook perfect, it has lots of pockets for flash drives, and accessories. After looking at a lot of bags I'm glad I got this bag.
 Excellent quality and value.  Highly recommend.
 Holds all needed for the flight
 Excellent,  functional laptop bag at a great price.  Plenty of room to fit my ole dinosaur Dell into it :). Lots of storage too,  well done.
 I am impressed with the fast shipping. My husband loves the bag and it may actually be able to withstand his use.
 Very nice but I probably should have bought the newest model. For a woman, you still need to carry a purse as the computer fills the case with a small amount of room left.  No space for your phone.
 PRO: FITS WELL<br/><br/>CON: MATERIAL
 It is pretty good but a little too small for me.
 I use this everyday! Simple and affordable. The only reason I could see someone not liking this is if they wanted a nice leather laptop bag. I basically only use it for going out of my house to my car, going into work from my car, and vice versa. So it fits my needs perfectly.
 Very nice product and was delivered on-time with no issues. My only problem is that it could have more places to put things. Don't get me wrong there are other compartments inside the bag. I just wish it had a little more. Overall very good product and it does it's job if you're on the market for a laptop bag.
 This bag is great. It works. The pockets are all appropriate sizes.<br/>I like<br/>- The multiple pockets<br/>-The multiple dividers in the pockets<br/>- The price<br/>- The size (everything is just right) It fits my bigger computer.<br/>- It has pockets for my mouse, charger and pens<br/>- It seems like craftmanship is good. Time will tell.<br/><br/>I don't have anything negative to say. I have not had it long enough to test it for an extended time.
 For the price I definitely cannot complain. It feels like it has proper protection for the laptop, and doesn't feel like it's going to come apart. Definitely doesn't feel as robust as more expensive well known brands, but those cost at least 2x as much if not more. Great value.
 Very nice bag for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. It fits perfect with my Otter Box.  Nice zippers, storage compartment for chargers and<br/>other accessories. I have a Amazon Basics Back Pack for my cameras and gear. It worked so well I thought I would try the bag too. Glad I did. The bag is not gay looking so it does not look I am carrying a purse. The compartment looks lumpy wtih my charger in it but oh well. I have gotten over that.
 I was looking for a storage bag with a handle to store my Kindle Fire HD 7" and all its gear: providing it protection and making it easy to keep all my Fires components together when I came across this netbook bag.  It is generic and roomy maybe even a little too roomy for my Kindle Fire HD 7" but the side zip compartment holds the quick charge adapter, cord and styluses with ease.  Very pleased with this purchase for the value!
 I bought this for my Thinkpad X61, and I have to say, it is very good quality. After using it for more than a week, I can say that the fabric feels strong, and the padding is enough to protect and delicate laptop or tablet. It has several smaller pockets inside the large pockets, and with my laptop, charger, mouse, and bulky Minolta camera, it is still very light and seems to have nothing in it! Unlike my old laptop bag, the strap and the cushion is very soft and does not cut into my shoulder. Everything feels very comfortable,and i would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a protective but comfortable case for their delicate items.
 So far, it's great!  Everything I carry (which is a lot) fits securely, and not too tight.<br/><br/>For a smaller 15.6" laptop bag, it is surprisingly roomy.<br/><br/>Great job Amazon!
 Nice quality!  Padded well too.<br/><br/>Make sure you know the size of your laptop at order. The 14" Fit my 14" Laptop.
 I love this bag!! Recently purchased a lap top 17" and this is an awesome bag for my lap top.
 Nice to have to use for travel
 Overall satisfied with the product
 Read the other reviews for more details. I can confirm that the gussets are lame and if you want to put an 8.5 X 11 paper inside has to be exactly 11". My Fire HDX 8.9 with a Supcase fits in the padded pocket perfectly and their is room for an Amazon Basics bluetooth keyboard and stand, charger and cords, and more. It's too small for a carry on, but to buzz to meetings it's great. Well worth $12.50.
 my hp 11 inch chrome book fits perfectly. enough space for the charger as well.
 The bag is well made and the padding is not too much, just right. Plenty of room for cables and the like. Quality zipper as well.
 I saw some of the reviews and wasn't sure if we were talking about the same product. I have loved this little bag! It can hold one or two items if necessary. I put my iPad and Kindle in there and you can take all your cords with you. Nicely made and works well, especially for the price.
 For what you pay, this is a deal. Nicely done.
 Perfect for a tiny notebook. Very well made and durable, protects well in the rain I found out!
 Nice bag, but since the laptop was junk, I have no need for it.
 Excellent well made case for my Asus Chromebook.
 The price is right. Bought it for my portable  blu ray player
 It came nicely packaged and for the price, it is pretty good quality! While it doesn't look extremely fancy, it fit my laptop really well, with a pocket in the front to hold my charger &amp; mouse easily. There was still a bit more room to put things as well! I don't have much to complain about except that I wish the shoulder strap cushion was a little softer and the strap itself to be perhaps half a foot longer or so.
 Basic bag but really nice and durable.  Lots of pockets and space.
 I love this bag. Water resistant which is great. The bag is large enough for my lap -top, one large text book, my wallet, and some small little things. I carry this bag almost everywhere and love it. Great bag.
 Great for fire tablet storage
 Arrived promptly ..  well packaged..  as described.  Thank You.
 Works as intended. Using it to carry a touch pad. It's durable, but not as resilient as hard or reinforced cases.
 My normal work bag was a hassle to lug through the airport. I need something small enough that would hold a laptop and a few peripherals for short business trips, and would easily slip over the handle of my wheeled suitcase so I could maneuver through the airport quickly. This is perfect.
 Well it does fit my 17" gaming laptop, but the laptop does not fit in the sleeve that is for that purpose. Not much room for anything more than laptop and power cord. And the padding on the shoulder strap let's the strap get all twisted inside of said pad, making it so you have to untwist the strap Everytime you want to use it. The handle also flips inside the pocket when open so if you want to close it you gotta mess with that while zipping up the bag.... over all it works mostly for what I want, some of these complaints might come from me always using backpacks before now.
 I bought one,  i liked it so much, I bought 2 more for my friends
 I like it a lot, and I use this often. I just wish the strap at the top didn't move as much. Overall, a really good purchase.
 I wasn't convinced that this bag would be good, considering the price, since I'm a believer in you get what you pay for. Having recently bought a pretty expensive laptop, I needed a bag for it. This turned out to be quite a good purchase. I can't comment on it's longevity, but my first impression is very good. Definitely worth what I paid for it.
 Just what I needed because of the type of work I do. All the pockets can be zipped up to keep unwanted critters out. However, the bag doesn't stay together very long before it falls apart. It may because I carry too many things into peoples homes. $17 dollars every three months is cheap compared to getting rid of bed bugs or roaches that just might hitch a ride.
 This has been the best computer case I have ever bought. I can fit my laptop, headphones, chargers for phone and laptop, pens, highlighters, quite a few research papers, and my glasses case with room to spare. It doesn't hurt my shoulder or back to carry for longer periods of time.
 great product great service!
 Local stores (electronics dealers notwithstanding, I didn't even bother to go buy their overpriced stuff) failed to carry big bags for big laptops. Enter the cheap AmazonBasics-branded bag. Is it the most rugged design available? No. Is it the prettiest? Nope. Is it a functional tote for huge laptops? Yep.
 This computer bag really comes in handy! I use it almost every day for school! It can fit a small laptop (such as my chromebook), a few papers, some pens/pencils, a charger, a calculator, and I usually can try to fit one or two granola bars. I really stuff this thing. It's GREAT quality, and I would highly recommend it!
 This tablet bag is as good or better as the bags costing twice as much. Very well constructed and has ample storage space for charging cords, external hard drive, pens and date and small notebook
 The perfect bag for my 10.5" tablet.  The construction of the bag is very good and the materials should hold up to, and protect my tablet from a lot of potentially damaging stress.  I do recommend that you also use a padded (neoprene) sleeve to provide added protection for your device when traveling.  For my needs, this bag is a bargain.
 The AmazonBasics 11.6 inch Laptop and Tablet Bag was perfect in every way for our new tablet.  It fit the tablet perfectly.  The extra zippered area was perfect for items necessary for the Tablet.  We were absolutely delighted with this bag and would highly recommend it to anyone with a tablet in this size range.
 i bought this as a suggestion from Amazon when I bought my laptop. It is exactly what I needed. My 15" laptop fits easiily, and also my accessories. There are numerous pockets for those items. I mainly wanted to have a safe place to put my laptop when not in use, and make transporting it easy and I have found this the perfect solution. For the very inexpensive price it is a perfect match for me.
 Great quality for the price.
 For the money, great bag.  It's a little tight (i.e., don't expect a lot of extra room).  But again, it does the main role of protecting the computer, it's stylish and so far seems to be of very good quality.
 I bought this for the 7 year old's new tablet for the vacation trip and it not only held the tablet but markers and comic books. Well padded for the tablet with lots of room for everything else. Including lunch. EXCELLENT.
 Bought this for my wife for work. She likes it a lot.
 good quality product ... it holds my chrome book 11.6 screen perfectly ... nice and snug ... my fire 7 fits in the front pocket
 I love it!  Very well made.  AmazonBasics 11.6-Inch Laptop Bad fits my Surface Pro 3 and all its accessories that I carry along with.  Delivery was faster than I expect from free delivery.  Got all my items at the same time (Samsung Galaxy Smart dock Multimedia Hub, Ukoonnect USB3.0 Superspeed 7-port, SanDisk Ultra 64GB UHS-I/Class 10 Micro SDXC).<br/>I would definitely recommend this bag!
 Definitely worth every penny! Its durable, and fits my laptop perfectly, and I still have room for papers and pens!
 Bought for my daughter's portable DVD player and tablet, headphones, chargers, etc.. to be stored in and taken places. Plenty of room for those things and more! Love it!
 Lots of space, I can store my 13" MacBook Pro and my Surface Pro 3 inside their own sleeve in this bag with room to spare for more.  The chargers could fit better however...For the price though, not bad at all.
 Excellent case for the price.  Seems well constructed and has a fair amount of padding for this price range. Has extra pockets and enough room for extras like pads and the power pack. Would buy again or buy as a gift.
 This is a great quality case for your small laptop or large tablet.  I've seen cases of lesser quality at retail for 3x the price.  The 11.6" is the perfect size for my iPad Air 2, while the front zipper pocket is a perfect fit for my Kindle e-reader.  There are plenty of pockets inside to manage cables and accessories.  Highly Recommended.
 This bag is great. It looks professional and has pockets for everything. We ordered larger than we needed to have extra room to put some things in and that was definitely a good choice. They only get moderate use, but seem to be holding up so far.
 If you looking for a high quality bag that impresses others - you might choose something with a higher price.  However, if you need a dependable bag that will get you from point A to B on daily basis, this is a good choice.  I work from home and visit clients office a few times per week and stop at Starbucks 3-4 times per week to work - this bag is fine.
 love this bag. Fits my 17" laptop with plenty of compartments for accessories and can also serve as a briefcase.  A great value!
 Looks very nice.  Can look professional when you carry it.
 Nice laptop bag and great value.  I do wish it had a little more structure to it.  If you're carrying it over the shoulder with a laptop or something rigid inside, it tends to fold over a bit.
 My 15.6-Inch Lenovo, (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HEYVAN6/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) fits perfectly in there, has plenty of room to store and pack whatever you may need, also has pen/pencil holders in there, along with handles it does come with a detachable shoulder strap, I love it!!
 At first I loved this bag. It is a great size, perfect for my laptop and a 1" binder without anything being forced in or hard to get out. The pockets are nice and it is decently padded so I don't have to worry if I accidentally set it down a bit hard or bump into something.<br/>However, after only a couple of weeks, one of the carry handles is already pulling out of where it was sewn to the bag. This is especially worrisome to me since I have been extremely careful with the bag because it holds a brand new laptop. I feel that if I were to be using it normally the bag would have already fallen apart.<br/>Also, the plastic connections to clip on the shoulder strap make creaking sounds when I walk using shoulder strap which becomes annoying quickly.
 My MacBook Air 11" fits perfectly into this case, along with the wall charger and extension cord, as well as my iPad mini and there's room for my iPhone if I wanted to put that in the front zipper pouch too (it's usually in my pocket). You cannot go wrong with this case, it's fantastic and a bargain.
 I purchased this for one of our engineers. Most of our engineers have demanded bags that cost up to 10 times this one - so I was surprised at how well made this little bag is! The engineer was happy with it and the cost was excellent!
 I bought this for my new laptop.  I can't rave enough about it!!! It's super sturdy and the quality is amazing.  Completely deserving of the amazon name on it!  It's not the trendiest by far but I just decorated my self and it looks great.  It fits my laptop charger and other accessories well.  It's light,padded but not bulky and incredible for travel!
 Very nice case, compact and sturdy with good padding. However, it didn't fit my ipad air and accessories very well....the zipper had to be force closed. I contacted amazon to return, and they refunded the cost and told me I could keep the case....so sweet of them.I then got the next larger size which is perfect for me.
 Not great quailty - one of the pockets tore on the inside fairly quick but still a decent bag for a good price
 Works perfect for my laptop.  Holds all the little extras I have to go with my laptop.  Like having the handles as well as the strap.  Has many pockets for whatever you need to carry, ie: papers, headphones, extra speakers, whatever.  Seems to be very well constructed.  Should hold up for a long time.
 This case is perfect. Why spend extra money on a name brand? Well you get a name brand here with AmazonBasics. The quality is great. It doesn't look cheap at all.
 Love it! It fits my computer perfectly and is very light.
 Fits my computer perfectly
 I was looking for a basic but solid bag to transport my new 11.6 laptop to and from work, etc, and I didn't want to pay $30-$60 for one.<br/>This is exactly what I was looking for...Nothing fancy, but very practical for my needs, and the price is right.<br/>There's a good amount of space for accessories.<br/>I'm very pleased with this bag.
 Roomy and protects your lap top,
 I used this bag for about 2 years and loved every day of it. It's sturdy and holds even the heavy gaming laptops comfortably. It has plenty of pockets and room to where I can lose small things easily. Since I've had this the zippers and the straps were never broken.
 Inexpensive, light, and reasonably sturdy.  If you need to carry a lot of items, you will need something bigger.  It is good for what it does.
 good product good price.
 This is very cheaply made. It does what I need it to do so I give it 4 stars.for the price of this bag its well worth it
 Fits my laptop well.  Laptop just slides in from the top.  Has two large pockets on the inside and a zippered on on the outside.  A couple of small shallow pockets inside would have been nice for keeping small items, such as earphones and thumb drive handy.
 This bag is cheap and absolutely perfect, there are so many pockets, I carry my Laptop, 4 legal pads, 2 mice(one wireless one not), the charging cable and my tablet and still have plenty of room, don't even bother looking for anything else unless you need something with a fancy print on it. The quality is superb!
 I've bought "Amazon Basics" products before and was very satisfied. This bag is no different. It's exactly what it was advertised to be. Nice sturdy construction. Plenty of room for power cord, mouse and a few other small objects. Bottom line is I love it. And the low price was pretty much unbeatable for the quality. Go Amazon!
 AmazonBasics is a company that in the past I have been very satisfied with. They make extremely affordable accessories that always work as advertised. This carry case is no exception. It is sleek looking and simple. The interior is well designed with its pouches to hold headphones, chargers, etc. Highly recommend this case.
 Bought this for my kindle fire hd. It was too big but I kept it. I bought an ASUS netbook computer that fits perfectly. There is a zipper pocket on the front that I keep the power cord and a mouse in. While it is not a hard case it does provide some protection for the items inside and the handles on the side make for comfortable carrying of everything. I am very satisfied with the price and the  bag.
 This is my first experience with an Amazonbasics product. Basically after just 4 days of usage the pad on the shoulder strap is coming a part / getting disjointed. (no abusive weight, just a light laptop).<br/>Maybe early to say as the product itself it might be the first / last item I get from this BRAND.
 The laptop case wouldn't zipper closed. Didn't fit as expected.I returned this to Amazon no problem
 There isn't much to say, it is a small laptop bag and one of the only ones to fit my 17 inch laptop. Incredible inexpensive so honestly not much you can say about it.
 I needed an sturdy tote to carry my 10" netbook around, as it does a lot of traveling. I didn't want anything too expensive and I didn't care if it was stylish or not. I bought one tote that was too big and the computer flopped around inside unnecessarily, so I returned it. The amazon unit was a perfect fit with a handy side pouch for the power cable. Looks pretty good, very sturdy, holds everything very well and surprisingly was the cheapest solution overall. Recommended!
 Grate laptop case. i bought this for school to lug around my mac book and it works like a charm. in the main pocket it has multiple sleeves, places to put my laptop, binder, and papers. it also has a pocket for pens and chargers and front pocket i keep sticky notes in. so in all i love this case and recommend it.
 Great for the price! Very padded
 fits 2017 Newest Dell Inspiron Flagship High perfectly. the room is what like about it the most
 Holds my laptop with much room to spare. For the price your getting a great deal.
 Very nice, but too manly for me.
 Worth the money they are put under heavy use.
 For the money this is a very good laptop bag.  I threw away my old one and started using this full-time and have had zero complaints.  Material has held up well so far, zippers are all still functional and it has seamlessly vanished into my everyday life.  That's kind of what you want a product like this to do for you, right?  It's good enough that I never have to think about it.
 perfect for my lap top.
 Great bag, prefect for my brand new laptop. Nice and sturdy with lots of room for extras, such as chargers, mice, phones, wallets, even headphones. I was worried about this being to small and flimsy at first because of some of the reviews, but I am glad that I got it. Padding is great, I can trust my expensive laptop in this case.
 It’s great for my needs.
 The perfect size for tablets. Letter size paper fits in center without folding.
 Great size. I use this for work. My laptop isn't this big but it's great to put paperwork in. Love that it has three compartments.
 Everything is great. Keeps your computer snug and secure. My only complaint is the two nylon dividers inside the case. The ocasionally prevent the lap top from going into the case. They can be easily cut out though.
 This is a very nice and neat tablet bag. This is my second bag I got. The zippers are large and easy to zip. I have one for my Nook HD+ and with keyboard it fits perfectly. My other one holds my Kindle HDX with keyboard with a little extra  room. The side pocket holds my supplies. I am very happy with them..
 This is a well constructed bag with lots of pockets and places to stash stuff. I am using this for a large tablet and the associated miles of wires, cables, wall warts and other paraphernalia that I seem to end up carrying all the time.
 Good product. Shipped on time. It appears to be made well....to me? Some people in/on the reviews were kind of negative but I'm HAPPY. Does what it is supposed to.  I can carry my Surface Pro 3 with keypad and stylus + I carry a Samsung Tab 10.1 tablet ......all of them in it.  It works well and I am very happy with it.
 Perfect fir for my 16" laptop + cords and optical mouse (my accessory of choice) + all the extras I carry including my cooler fan,  Price and material are excellent for my needs; I have noted that Amazon Basics products are more than equal to the more expensive (and sometimes not as good) name brands.
 This is a great simple laptop carrying bag. I can fit my laptop, notebook, and tablet in it very easily. I also like the extra pockets to store pens and chargers.
 I absolutely love this briefcase. The quality is amazing considering the price. It also has a large storage capacity. They could charge 2x as much and it still would be a good buy. I use this bag every single day. I am very satisfied with this purchase. I love this bag.
 Very flimsy and not really good at protecting anything.  I would've returned it, but I forgot to and just kept it.  It is catching dust in a closet somewhere.  There are better options, but for the price it is as basic as it gets.  It is in the name.
 Well made, comfortable, fair price. I bought it used and it was Like New.<br/><br/>I haven’t tested the water resistance so I did not rate it.
 I used this item for few weeks and it is already torn by the handle. I would give a zero star if possible. I dont think I will buy anu other item from Amazonbasics. Perhaps I am doing my best to shop on Walmart online instead of Amazon.
 Fits the laptop I bought perfectly! Like a glove!. Durable yet lightweight and well padded for any accidents you may encounter with your machine such as dropping or if you have children or pets ;) Great value for your hard earned money!
 Wish it had a more thick pocket for my mouse and charger just because putting those in make the bag super bulgy. Other than that, good quality, love all the little pockets on the inside.
 I use it for my lap top however I also  use it with out my lap top  as a carry on when traveling. Nice quality and plenty of compartments. The strap can be long enough to put over your shoulder and across your chest to allow hands free activity.
 This bag is the perfect size for holding a tablet &amp; power cord.  I'm very happy with the workmanship.
 18 bucks. ???  nuff said
 This is perfect for my i pad.  I put this in my back pack and take it on trips.  The cords fit in the zipper part so everything is together.
 Good for the price if you're looking for a more solid laptop bag spend more money
 A great bag for all your needs.  Well built with plenty of compartments for everything you need for the office and more!
 nice bag and fits well
 LEARNING HOW TO USE IT !!!!
 Serves its purpose - a bag to carry your laptop but there isn't much cushion and it's thin material. My computer is kinda flimsy so I will not be using this to take outside anywhere.
 The bag is perfectly size for my laptop and it has way more room than you would think! I was actually able to pack for an overnight trip - laptop, wireless mouse, headphones, laptop charger AND a change of clothes and little travel-size toiletries - in this bag!
 Exactly as advertised.  I use if for a Dell 10 inch windows tablet with an attached keyboard.  I can fit the charger in the outer pocket.
 A perfect carrying case for a small laptop (12 inch tested ) or an document portfolio (12.5 x 10.5 size). Quality is good for the price point. No complaint about the workmanship. The shoulder strap is robust, with a wide shoulder pad.
 When I ordered this itesm I thought that it would be an average quality and appearance at this low price.  WOW, was I surprised.  The item was very smart looking and the quality was equal to the cases at triple the price in local stores.  I was not expecting to be as happy and satisfied as I was.  Once again Amazon Basics has provided qualiy at a savings.
 I do field work with this bag. For the price, all you can ask is that it's durable and I so far it has been holding up very well. No rips, broken off zippers,  etc.
 I actually bought this for my Samsung Galaxy keyboard.  I didn't like putting the keyboard in my large bag or suitcase without some sort of protection.  It fits perfectly (long-ways) and, of course, since that isn't what it is made for, there is quite a bit of extra room side-ways, but I just wanted a padded case to protect the keyboard (Samsung doesn't make a case for it...at least I couldn't find one) and this works great.
 I have not had this bag for long but it looks really good. It is sturdy and foamy on the inside which I don't doubt would protect my laptop fairly well. It fits my 15.6 inch Toshiba laptop perfectly and has plenty of room for the mouse I have and any other small or flat things I might want to put in. It has both handles and a shoulder strap and the handles don't prevent the zip from closing. Originally I considered buying a more colorful case but decided to go for this one because of the price and extra space and I am very glad I did, it is even better than I thought. I hope it lasts
 I was carrying my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 LTE in my bag.  I usually did not carry all my accessories and would regret not having them with me.  This bag holds everything without having to crowd them all with the Kindle.  There is a separate zipper section to hold the AC &amp; DC adapters, headphones, stylus, and my reading glasses.  Perfect for what I need!  The price is cheap, but the bag is not!!
 If you're looking for a small bag for a tablet, small laptop this is an excellent value for the money.
 Use it for a 15” laptop and Microsoft Pro tablet.  Both fit with a minimal amount of paperwork but it’s very tight.  For the price, can’t go wrong and it does everything others I have that cost 3 times as much do.
 Nice little case at a great price. Fits my iPad 3 with a heavy rubber case on it.  My iPad and case would probably not fit in the smaller size bag made for the naked iPad.  This one is sized for an 11" to 11.5" notebook.  There's actually enough room for my wife's iPad with a leather case (much smaller than my case) as well.  Good value.
 This carrying case is great and has enough room in it for what ever else you need to take with you. Power cords, User manual, wireless mouse, and what ever you may need to take with you for your Laptop computer. Plus the shoulder strap is long enough and adjustable too. It has enough storage room both inside and out to take whatever you need for your laptop computer.
 A GREAT bag for laptop, and more!  I have stuffed it will notepads, ipads, computer, camera, etc.  It still looks brand new, despite over a year of abuse from usage.
 This is yet another tremendous value from AmazonBasics.  The quality and features are even better than I had hoped for.  The really low price and Prime shipping make this a real bargain.
 Fits everything I need. I love all the pockets.
 17.3 inch will fit, but it is VERY tight
 Light weight and good quality of materials and construction
 A great laptop bag, well made, great price. Thank you for making such a great product.
 Perfect in every way.
 Great bag for my laptop. Sturdy and has several useful pockets. I use it all the time.
 wont fit asus g752 laptops so beware if youre a owner of them,overall its made with good quality at a decent price
 You can't beat the price/quality combination with this one.  Holds my Asus 200ma laptop perfectly (and charger, mouse and a few discs).  Well worth the price if you have a 11.6 inch or smaller laptop.  I don't plan on ever using the shoulder strap.  At first I just left it in the bottom of the bag and the laptop didn't fit very well.  Problem solved after taking it out.  (Just food for thought there)  I like it a lot!
 Has 0 protection around seems and corners, the padding doesnt reach the edges.  it's a bag not a protective one
 Great bag! Plenty of padding and storage pockets for my laptop and accessories!
 It lasted six months of daily use before the strap broke (the loop that connects to the bag detached by its strings).  This is a short term solution, but if you want something of quality buy another product.
 For how cheap this is I put my gaming laptop in and it fits perfectly and nicely, and it has all kinds of storage areas for another laptop, a table, cords and more!<br/><br/>I say its a good buy to anyone looking for a protective case for their laptops!
 Case after case nothing seems to last ,just broke the strap on my Manhatan Portage messenger bag for $125 .<br/>This case was $13 and put them all to shame
 For the price you cant beat this bag! Nice and small, fits my 13inch macbook pro perfectly! After 6 months the shoulder strap ripped off and i just replaced it with Shacke Shoulder pad (much more comfortable). Very happy with this bag!
 We got a like new 14 inch one for 8 bucks.  It looks brand new and as far as build quality and materials this is on par with cases that cost twice as much.  It's a little bit plain, but if want protection and padding over style this is perfect.
 Fair packaging, maximum protection with the highest quality and elegance, unparalleled practicality.
 Really happy with this purchase, my first "Amazon Basics" purchase and will be purchasing from them again. Fits my very large 17'' gaming laptop nice and snug, with some room for the charger/mouse/etc. Also its very sturdy. For the price I was expecting less, but really happy with the quality of this.
 Just as described. Fit my laptop perfectly with room for charger and mouse and a file folder full of papers.
 I'm super happy with this case.  The zipper works great.
 Only complaint I had is that it did not have an outside pocket (non zippered). from the pic online I thought it did but that was just a seam on the side. As for the bad itself it seems to be fairly well made for what you pay.. I have not used it yet but I assume it will serve its purpose.
 Great for traveling
 I wanted a lightweight, zipping carrying bag for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (GT-N8013) that would also fit my Anker T320 keyboard. Fortunately, that's what I got! Although I was hoping that the little pouch in the front of the bag would fit my keyboard, it ended up being slightly smaller than I imagined. Ultimately, I just placed the keyboard inside the main bag since I already had a folding stand/case protecting my Note. Now the little pouch is home to my USB cable and charging adapter, so it ended up not being too much of a bad thing.
 This is one of the best values I have ever seen.  I read where someone had a problem with the strap but I don't use it.  Really nicely made plenty of extra pockets better than bags I have bought costing more.
 BANG FOR THE BUCKS!!! WELL CONSTRUCTED NO ISSUES SO FAR AND BELIEVE ME I CARRY IT AND ABUSE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY, A 17.3 HP 2010 MODEL LAPTOP INSIDE
 Very thin and not much padding.  Could stand to have more protection, especially in the corners.
 Good item for the price; what I was looking for.
 Computer fits great in it. A lot of compartments
 Well made, roomy and perfect for my laptop. Side compartments are nice.
 Perfect for small tablets or computers. Enough pockets to organize accessories.
 I ordered this case for a 12" screen x201 thinkpad computer. The case allows a safe and secure encasement for the computer, the charging cable, a mouse and external speaker. I easily fit a small cd-dvd drive in the side pocket. This case is quite acceptable for its stated purpose and was delivered quickly and securely packaged. I would order again from this vendor.
 Super happy with this purchase. I just bought a new laptop and needed a new bag to fit the larger size and after weighing my options I went with this product.  I'm not sure it would hold up over time if I traveled a lot especially through airport security but for everyday use its outstanding.
 Great just as advertised Works very very well
 I got this netbook bag for my iPad 2 with cover, but initially found it too big. However, after using it for a while, the extra size has come in very handy.  The notebook bag has a front zippered pocket in which I store my usb cords, chargers, iPad pens, etc, and am now very happy with my purchase.<br/><br/>So, if you plan to put iPad accessories in addition to the iPad w/ case, then this is a wonderful netbook bag.
 Nice little carry case for my 7 in tablet and small Bluetooth  keyboard. Has a thin but adequate layer of foam - should protect the keyboard ok. I keep my tablet in a rubbery tight fitting "drop protector" so i'm not worried about that. Case also has another small zippered sleave for storage.
 My product came nicely packaged and loved the laptop bag. It was the perfect fit for my laptop. Lots of storage to put other stuff as well. Lovee it!
 It might be very utilitarian looking but it is functional and keeps everything together.  Wish some of the pockets were sized a little differently, but it's nice to have a laptop case with several pockets!  I can keep mouse, charger, tablets, etc all in 1 case.
 fits everything i need for work  another must have
 for the price superb product
 I love the overall bag . It’s very strong , durable , and Most importantly Stylish ⚡️. I love Amazon Basics 👏🏽
 Great laptop/tablet bag for small devices. I purchased it to carry an ASUS C100 10.1 inch Chromebook and fit perfectly, leaving enough space for accessory items. Great buy. Definitely recommend for the price.
 Looks good, holds an iPad, many cords, and other stuff.  For the money this is a great case and not to big.
 Bought as a Christmas present.  Worked perfectly for his new larger laptop.  Very happy with the quality.
 This worked great! The laptop that went into it is a 17" and it fit perfectly. There is a pocket in front that is just right for a mouse and the power cable. The material is soft, durable and I had no concerns that the laptop would get damaged. I recommend this bag!
 We recently upgraded our Fire to the larger size and went looking for a travel case. The prices in the retail market were outrageous and often too large. This is the perfect size to hold the 10" Fire as well as additional items. Highly recommend
 half the price of similar case, room for tablet, mouse, charger and more, really like amazon basics high quality and low price items
 Nice good quality
 Good for my Acer Aspire E 15 E5-575G-57D4, buts its very thin, I recommend a sleeve to put inside your laptop and then in this bag.
 This is a great basic "small" footprint 17.3 bag.  I personally don't like carrying huge laptop backpacks around and this thing fits the bill.  Y70-70T is snug, but it does fit, along with power supply, wireless mouse, ext. hard drive and ext. disk drive.  A great deal at less than $17.
 In case you are wondering what will fit comfortably in this bag:  In the main compartment I can easily fit both my kindle with the leather origami cover on it and the amazon basics blue tooth keyboard. There is room for the charging cord, a stylus, documentation and earbud headset in the outside zipper pocket, Everything is nicely protected.  I love that this has handles and good sturdy zippers.
 This case is so lightweight, but so strong.  I recommend it highly. And the price is exceptional.
 very good for price it will do the job for us  jerrt
 Bought this for a tech travel bag.  Feels well built, with a ton of accommodating pockets, and useful storage.  Mine is full of a big external battery, four USB cables, a small spray bottle of LCD cleaner, a USB charging hub, and even with all this it still easily fits a Nexus 7 and iPad 3 in a Lifeproof case.
 Great computer case with good protection.
 Very basic low quality bag. It could use more internal pockets. The shoulder pad stitching ripped after a week of light use, and the zippers seem to get stuck often.
 Bought one as a gift. Had to buy a second one for someone who saw the first one and liked it.
 Lot of compartments and space to organize cables, charges, tablets, pc, notebooks and whatever you want to carry on it. Delivered on time.
 I was looking for a bag for my Lenovo Miix 2 11 laptop, and ordered another brand that was priced higher but decided to try the AmazonBasics 11.6-Inch bag as well. This Amazon bag is well-made, holds my laptop and accessories nicely.  It turns out to be a better choice and I love it.
 Fits my MacBook Pro perfectly!  Plus and get a note and accessories in as well.
 Really nice bag!
 Purchased this as a gift for a family member who received a Microsoft Surface 2. The Surface 2 fir perfectly inside. The quality of the bag was fr better than other name brand bags we ordered from Amazon. The bad had storage for the mouse and cords. Perfect for what they needed. Would buy this bag again.
 This is the perfect, low-cost 14" laptop bag for what I need: commuting back and forth to work. It doesn't have a lot of cushion so I wouldn't toss it around with a computer inside it. But it perfectly fits my laptop which is 13 inches wide. Anything wider than that and I'd recommend getting the 15 inch or bigger size bag. It's incredibly lightweight and small, not much room for accessories, but otherwise a great, good quality, cheap laptop bag.
 Matches what I need to travel with the DVD player that I purchased, including power chords.
 Know nothing about it
 My only issue with this bag is that the strap shoulder pad is way too wide and stiff. I had to remove it, because the bag kept falling down off of my shoulder.<br/><br/>The exterior fabric of the bag is great, but the inside is a thin, somewhat delicate light fabric, that I can see tearing very easily. Be careful what you place in there!
 It's a solid bag and I find that's it's quite roomy. I don't think it will save ur laptop all that much if you are really rough with it but it's a nice way of transporting it and keeping my books inside as well.
 The bag is perfect and will fit any 17" laptop. I just bought this bag for the new MSI GS73VR 17.3" laptop and it fits well with even some leftover space. Definitely recommend this bag. One downside is that the AmazonBasics Logo is on it, so if you're just looking for a simple, stylish bag this may not be it because of the logo. Other than that, it's great!
 This bag has every possible space that you can use to stow your laptop. For $16, it isn't too bad. I would recommend getting this bag if you have a 15.6-inch laptop and you are looking for something to stow your laptop in without paying $30 for a bag.
 Fits my MacBook Air 11" and iPad Air perfectly. I an even squeeze in a small (paper) notebook between the two, and put the power supply and various dongles in the pocket on the side.  So it's perfect for carrying my equipment.<br/><br/>Note that there's absolutely no room for anything else.
 Exactly what my husband was looking for! He uses it for work and loves it!
 It’s a good bag
 There's not much padding and the materials aren't exactly top notch, but for the price it's a bag I'd recommend. I needed something quick since my other bag broke but it's worth the extra $20-30 to upgrade to a nicer bag if it's something you're carrying every day.
 I like the fact that this computer bag has a shoulder strap, a lot of the cheaper bags don't have shoulder straps.<br/>  This is also good quality and doesn't feel cheap at all! I'm very satisfied with the over all purchase.
 While the functionality of the bag is perfect, the construction fails. They did not design it to actually be used it seems. They did not not stress test this design for extended use. I have had it for less than 2 weeks and the seams are breaking on the sholder pad.
 Super light bag with 3 partitions.<br/>I like 3 partitions so I dont have dig through lots of pockets to find my stuff which was a problem with my back pack.<br/><br/>The super light weight is easy on the shoulders and makes a quick dash at the airport super easy.<br/><br/>Good quality and sturdy.
 useful and nice
 Was looking for a basic case and didn't want to spend a lot. Well made and inexpensive. Exactly what I was looking for.
 The 15.6" Laptop and Tablet case has Interior dimensions of 11" x 15".  It just *barely* fits my 15.6" laptop, which is 15" wide due to wide bezels (possibly due to the touch-screen?). My laptop does fit into the case smoothly and easily, without effort.<br/><br/>The padding on the ends and bottom of the case is not as thick or as firm as I would have expected it to be.  So, while this is a great case for carrying stuff (good handles, removable shoulder strap, two exterior pockets, multiple interior dividers or pockets in which to stow things), and will certainly provide excellent scratch protection for its contents, it will not provide much impact protection for your laptop... not that any soft-sided case provides much protection if you drop it with laptop enclosed...
 Great Bag for my IPad Pro...it will hold everything I need to take with me...I have a keyboard in it, battery charger, pencil, all kind of good stuff...I use this kind of bag if am going somewhere that I need everything...like the Hospital.
 The absolute best laptop bag I have ever bought.  So strong and sturdy and full of pockets and space.  I use it every day and have packed it full with my laptop, padfolio, tablet, chargers, extension cords for the chargers, notebooks and it holds it all.  The strap and handles feel very strong.  I love it.
 Good protection for laptop. Cheaper than replacing a broken computer. Well padded.
 I was looking at different cases for my 10.6" Asus laptop, and decided to go with this one because it has additional compartments and great reviews!  This bag is everything I need into one!  I can put my laptop, Ipad, chargers, earphones, and other small items and everything fits in this easy to carry around bag!  You could even put a second Ipad or other tablet in the external pocket!  So no need to have different cases or covers for each items, everything can be carried and protected in one small bag that does not feel or look too bulky!  Amazing!  Highly recommend if you want to carry all your small electronics safely just using one bag!  Love the detachable shoulder strap, small handles, and even the material feels nice!  Very happy with this purchase! So basic and so perefct! Thank you Amazon!
 Bought another case of these for my users. A great bag for distributing with a laptop rollout. Can't beat the price and quality combination. Far less bulky than what we use to use.
 I have a little asus netbook and this case is great for my needs.  It has a handy little zipper pouch on the front that is useful for sticking notes and my usb drive. The zipper is very sturdy and the bag has a fine amount of cushion for protecting my computer while in my book bag. The only downfall is that the bag is not big enough (and I wouldn't expect it to be) for carrying the power cord.  This is no big deal with a 12 hour battery life!
 The only product you will ever need to carry all the little things you will use with your tablet including the tablet!! Soft. On the inside, protective on the outside. The layering of the materials provides safety you need.  For those expensive items you own and dont. Want to bounce!
 I just bought the latest Ipad and a keyboard, but I didn't want the case with the keyboard attached. This case is great. My keyboard and Ipad fit nicely. I currently have my Ipad in its smartcover, and the is keyboard separate. But either way works in this bag. It's flexible and slim and I can push the case into my handbag and 'roll' the handles out of the way. There's even a pocket for my cords.
 Love love love this bag. So many compartments for headphones/mouse/etc, and very comfortable to tote around. Would recommend to others.
 I got this for work.  The seam is coming out by the zipper.  Lasted approximately 5 months.  Good price.  Not a good product if you carry a lot of stuff in it.
 I almost didn't buy this because it didn't have a a strap inside.  Other amazon owners assured me I didn't need it because it doesn't have room to move around.  I'm glad they told me because this case is first rate.  The quality of the materials and the workmanship is excellent - as well as good looking!
 This bag feels like it is much more expensive than it is.  The bag is wonderfully padded and the zippers are sturdy, not chintzy.  The outside zippered pocket holds the cord comfortably and there are dividers on the inside that can be used to keep papers, etc. without touching the laptop. The shoulder strap is also padded and makes it easy to carry.
 Great product.
 I use this bag almost every day. It fits my laptop, charger, paper notebook, folder, wallet, phone, pens, and a couple of other odds and ends.<br/><br/>Downside: the plastic hardware squeaks quietly with every step, and one the D rings that the shoulder strap clips onto has turned on its side. But for $14, I'm willing to overlook it.
 I love this case. I wasn't expecting a lot for the money but it's great.
 Perfect fit for my 13" HP Stream.  Easily holds the laptop in one sleeve and the attachments in the other.  This includes the charger and cable, the mouse and the HDMI cable with room for more.  Decent looking and easy to carry with handle and shoulder strap.  Seems like a very good deal for the price.
 good price good quality
 Exactly as described. Great fit, great price, fast delivery.
 Buen artículo.
 Perfect size case for my 16” Lenovo.  More like a briefcase.  Fits my cords, mouse iPad and files.
 The shoulder strap is wearing out or it came unstitched at a certain point can you fix it please thanks
 The bag arrive with the bag strap loose and damage I was expecting high quality product from amazon... I guess that was not the case.
 Its worked great for carrying my tablet (Samsung Tab A) with me...just what I needed.
 Received this items a couple of months ago. One handle of the bag already ripped.<br/>Not very pleased with this item. I am only carry a laptop in this bag.<br/>Thumbs down...
 Great price, and good product.  I ordered one for external mini speakers and all those wires, and one for my Kindle fire. This product has a separate mini zippered storage area as well--for more wires.  If you are going to watch videos or listen to music on your Fire, you'll want speakers--that means extra wires.  At this price?<br/><br/>Good product.  Good price.
 This case is well constructed with good padding for the laptop and room to spare for the 15.6" machine.  There is also room for accessories.  Really liked the packaging  - easy to get into.  I had seen cases that were just like this one for twice the price, so this is a great value.  Should be good for travel, although we haven't road tested it yet.
 This is a nice bag for my iPad. I also use it for storing other things at the same time.  It has nice soft protection.  It is small enough and adds enough protection to put in with my other laptop bag so I have everything together
 Great case for my son
 Very nice,well made and durable. Has a nice adjustable shoulder strap. I took it on a plane trip as a personal carry on and it worked well. Has several zippered compartments. Holds a lot.Very good value for the price. Would buy it again and would also buy the other sizes.
 Bought two of these for Christmas as gifts to go along with the two new Laptops that went in them. These are really good Laptop briefcases. I have one that I paid twice as much for, right here on Amazon, simply because these were sold out. These are better. So if you need a good Laptop Case, this b it. Can't beat it, price wise, or functionality. PERIOD. AMAZON RULES.
 Good materials and fits the computer well.
 The bad is perfect. Very comfortable to carry the laptop around in the bag. For it's price it is a great deal.
 I like it. It's lite and not cheesey looking.
 Best quality and a great price.
 Buena calidad, Excelente compra
 A little less that what expected.  My other bag had an inner sleeve.  But, the price was right.
 I had reservations about ordering the Amazon Basics brand, but I'm now a convert.  Great little bag to hold my 11.6" Chromebook.  It also has a strap on the back that slides over the handle of my suitcase.
 Very light and that is what I love. I thought it would have been heavy but not at all. It fits my Inspiron very well, I love it. I would not carry anything else in side the bag with the laptop as I am not too sure it can hold up to much pressure. But I am good with that, suits me just fine.
 Good case for the money
 Gets the job done and keeps my laptop safe from being scratched.  Has enough pockets for my needs.  Too many pockets leads to cramming too much stuff in them and making it heavy.
 Really worked well for my travel.  Dimensions were as specified for my laptop; good quality.  Had enough room for my other device/cords, etc.
 I am able to fit all the following into the 14.1 inch laptop case (at the same time):<br/><br/>Original Macbook model 1181 with Ipearl hard shell case<br/>Charger for Macbook<br/>Kindle Fire HD 7" with leather Roocase<br/>Charger for Kindle Fire HD<br/>Logitech Bluetooth mouse<br/>Mouse pad<br/>LG 235 cell phone
 I have now purchased 5 of these cases and all work great no issues and laptop fits and is protected with space for accessories.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/AmazonBasics-17-3-Inch-Laptop-Bag/dp/B00LU7B8X0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AmazonBasics 17.3-Inch Laptop Bag</a>
 This bag is just the right size and just what I needed for an excellent price. Everything I have fit in it nicely. I was able to schlep my iPad Air, iPhone 4, a Nintendo 3DS, a smallish Moleskine sketchbook, and all the cables and plugs to go with my devices from the USA to the UK and back. I also carried medicines and tissues and a bunch of other miscellaneous things with me. It's smallish but makes great use of its space so with careful and well-organized packing, you can bring a LOT. The strap was comfortable and the swivel clasp hooks for the strap don't squeak like some other brands out there.
 Love this little bag. It's a great fit for my surface pro 4! When I stuff all the accessories in it, include my surface mouse and charging cables, it's a bit tight, but still fits and works perfect for my needs.
 I ordered this for my cat as she likes to lay on this type of material. It is actually less expensive than most pet beds. The bag is very well made and it has a lot of compartments to organize your stuff. I recommend this both as a computer bag and as a cat bed.
 This is a no frills case for a 15.5 inch laptop and is inexpensive and gets the job done. Has three zippered compartments and the largest has three partitions for computer, notebooks and files.
 Unfortunately the bag start falling apart a week into my son using it, just for his laptop.
 I really like it
 Nice case for the money with a lot of pockets, but a little too big for my tablet. I'm going to keep it in case I get a laptop computer.
 I need a laptop bag for a long time and this is the one. Don't have much pockets but that's okay. I still like and you will too. :)
 Perfect size for my Phone, Reader, &amp; I-pad.  Has enough room for all of my re-charging plugs .  Perfect when we travel!
 This bag seems like it was made for the Surface pro. I absolutely love it and use it every day. The price is unbeatable. I have plenty of room for me Surface, the charger, a notepad and a few other items. I showed it to 2 of my coworkers and they each bought one. Well done Amazon.
 Nicely made
 This is a very nice laptop bag. BUT, I got caught in a heavy rain for 10 minutes before finding shelter and by then the bag had 2 oz. of water inside the main compartment. The bag retained the water very nicely.
 Like the way holds laptop and has shoulder strap
 I just received delivery of this bag a few minutes ago.  It was purchased for my MS Surface Pro 3 (which is an amazing device by the way).  It came well packaged, the shoulder strap was inside, there are no cosmetic faults.  It is an absolute perfect fit for the Surface Pro 3, to include the mouse I use and the power brick.  Extremely light, it adds little weight to an already lightweight computer.  It barely increases the footprint.  With that being said, owning the bag for 10 minutes does not a review make.  I cannot attest to the long-term build quality of this bag.  But, because of the outstanding price for this bag, even if I were to get just one year out of it I would be more than happy.
 I like its construction and multiple pockets. The only downside are the three small pockets in one of the compartments. They are placed a little too high in the compartment for tall items (like a reading glasses case) to fit comfortably below the zipper.
 This case is exactly what I was looking for at a reasonable price.  It protects my laptop, has pockets for the cords, etc. and internal pockets for files, notes, etc. and other thin materials.  It is handsome, durable, and light weight.  I recommend it for anyone with a 14" laptop.
 Fits my 17.3 inch Dell perfectly. The bag is made of quality materials &amp; feels sturdy. It's slim like the new laptop pouches, but has plenty of pockets &amp; storage space like a briefcase which is perfect for me. I'd highly recommend this case for anyone who travels with their computer.
 Seems well padded. Fits my 15.6 hp envy with some room to spare. Definitely room to fit an iPad/ tablet in the main pocket with my laptop. My only complaint is that the auxiliary pockets aren't big enough. By the time I put my mouse and charger in the bag, I can't fit much more. But you can't beat it for the price
 I really like this bag!  It feels really sturdy and sewn together nicely.  Has plenty of pockets to put everything in.  The part I liked most, it has a slot for your tablet in the most protected area too! <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/AmazonBasics-15-6-Inch-Laptop-and-Tablet-Bag/dp/B00DUGZFWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AmazonBasics 15.6-Inch Laptop and Tablet Bag</a>
 I shopped around a long time for a good laptop bag, and they were all either WAY too big, a little too small, or ridiculously expensive. This is a well-priced, medium-size bag. I can easily fit my 14" laptop, charging brick, and 2 textbook-sized books.<br/><br/>I'm very impressed with Amazon-brand computer accessories.
 The bag worked quite well for some time. The handle became frayed but this was only an aesthetic issue. While carrying my Laptop around with it, the shoulder strap broke, sending both the bag and Laptop falling onto hard concrete. As a result, the Laptop monitor has become damaged and needs to be replaced.
 Inside has a slight plastic feeling to it that I think could be improved upon, but good value for the money. I used mine to store tools in the back of our Toyota Highlander and have no major complaints. If it had a slightly more supple lining, then 5 stars for sure. All in all, it's very nice, however.
 I bought this case for my Sylvania 13.3-Inch Swivel Screen Portable DVD Player (SDVD1332) with USB/SD Card Reader  fits perfect has extra room for extra cables/Power adapters
 It is a well made bag.
 I paid less than $20 for this nice zippered case to put my new laptop in.  The case seems to be very well made &amp; my laptop fits in it perfectly.  There are extra compartments that I can put a spiral notebook in as wells as some dvds to watch if I get bored with my work.  I love it!!
 I love amazon basics.  It fits the compiuter with lots of room to spare.  Perfect for the office, classes, everything!  I always recomend amazon basics items.  It's not fancy and flashy or anything, but its very functional and looks good.  great price for extremely durable bag!  I also like that the branding of the amazon logo is minimal.
 A really nice bag, big enough for all the stuff I carry with my Tablet. Fast delivery, good price - better than I envisioned.Padded well, lots of dividers, even room for my Kindles in separate rear compartments, when traveling
 I was looking for different bags for my iPad and the iPads accesories, when I came across this bag. I was squeptical at first because I wanted the bag to hold my iPad air 2 with the griffin survivor I had on it. It fits perfectly, I have room for accesories and protects my iPad well even with out the survivor
 Works great, would recommend
 Good price, quality product.
 AT first I loved this, BuT now one of the handles Busted out like it wasnt sown in good. Such a drag cuz the bag is in perfect shape but is truly Broke.
 I bought this for my <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Dell-Inspiron-i3147-3750sLV-11-6-Inch-2-in-1-Convertible-Touchscreen-Laptop/dp/B00KMRGF3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dell Inspiron i3147-3750sLV 11.6-Inch 2 in 1 Convertible Touchscreen Laptop</a>, which being a hybrid laptop with dimensions of 11.81" x 0.74" x 7.91", is admittedly larger than many traditional 11.6 notebooks. This bag has interior dimensions of 11.8" x 0.8" x 8.7", looks nice and is inexpensively priced. I can squeeze my laptop into the main compartment, and cram the power adapter &amp; a small mouse into the accessories compartment--which makes the bag look bulged, but doesn't leave much room left for anything else.
 Works great. Laptop fits a bit snug but hey it fits so I can’t complain.<br/><br/>Lenovo Y700
 could almost replace my purse with this and have room for  all my computer parts I carry
 I bought this for my parents last year, to go along with the 10" tablet I bought them for Christmas.  It fit the tablet perfectly!  This bag is very light-weight, soft, and is cushioned enough for drops.  It's great to travel with.  I highly recommend it!
 I bought this case to replace a six year old Targus case. Easily holds my MSI GP60(15.6 inch), power cord, spiral notebook, game pad, portable HDD, and various papers and miscellaneous small items items.<br/><br/>First day of using this case I get into a car accident and end up with the driver's side of my car on the ground. During the accident I saw my laptop fly/fall past my face and hit the window/ground. After dealing with all the accident/insurance related stuff and finally getting to school, I slowly open up my case expecting the worse. Laptop is complete fine, and the case has a very minor scratch/tear on the front. Easily worth the money I spent ten times over thanks to it protecting my much more expensive computer.
 Good for the absolute minimum of storage for my 14" Dell Latitude E5450. I will probably replace it with something with a tad bit more storage and bottom padding. Great if you want as small and light of a case you can get and you will be very careful to not drop. You laptop will get damaged in a drop on the edge.
 This works great for a carry-on on an airplane.  Holds a tablet and all your important stuff.  Easy to manage.
 Very nice bag for my Dell 17" laptop.  Lots of protection and roomy for gear!
 This bag is much better than it seems in the description.<br/><br/>I had just purchased a Targus bag which cost $34.99 and this bag works better to hold my iPad Air, Mobile Hotspot and the portable stand I also bought on Amazon.<br/><br/>I definitely suggest people to buy this bag to carry their tablets, even ones that are 9" - 10".<br/><br/>It's great
 Well made plenty of room for any accessories you may have or need. You won't go wrong getting this for your needs!!
 Really great case for my 9 year olds Chromebook. Paid a couple extra bucks and got the cordless mouse. Fantastic.
 This helps me so much it carries my lap top as well as all my clients files etc with a very comfortable shoulder strap. Its also very durable quality Ive been using mine for a few months now ( heavy use ) and it dosent look worn at all.
 Bought this bag for a new laptop. It is very lightweight. Just be aware that if you need heavy-duty protection and do a lot of traveling, you may want to opt for something a bit more sturdy than this bag.
 Lightweight and slim but does not offer a lot of protection or room to carry other items. This wouldn't last 6 months with the amount of traveling I do. Ended up using it as an attaché for papers.
 Great bag
 Miy bueno
 Fits my HD 6, Fire 7, HD 8 and HD 10. I can also place two smart phones.<br/>Nice material and looking bag. Recommended.
 Perfect for my Acer Aspire V5 11.6 inch computer and my daughter's HP 12 inch. It has enough room for my mouse and extra DVD drive. Offers very good protection from bumps and knocks. Dropping it, I haven't done that yet. So not sure how far is safe.
 It is perfect for my 11.6 chromebook, I can also carry my mouse and charger.
 I have a Dell Venue Pro 8, a Windows Wedge Keyboard, a mouse, a USB hub, the tablet's charger (which is by no means dainty), and a few "other" peripherals that I like to carry.  This bag holds them all!  I love the front zippered pocket.  This is where I put the "stuff" I do not use often.  This bag is soft, sturdy, and well made.  It works for me!
 This has great pockets, very good zippers and has padding all around. Great stuff for the cost and lots of different uses. I recommend this 100%.<br/><br/>For my uses I did not see a use for the shoulder strap on such a small case, I took it off. But--It is an excellent quality strap and I used it on something else with great results.
 Very nice
 I've had this for over a year and use it whenever i need to bring my laptop anywhere. It can hold the laptop, charger, power strip, heasphones, and most everything you'd need with you. Highly recommend.
 The clips on the shoulder straps have a tendency to release under weight. It looks like the thin flexible part of the clip moves from side to side when a bit of force is applied, opening it just enough to come loose. Thanks to this, my laptop is damaged.
 no the zippers don't break. This is my second one. It's made very well and I highly recommend it.
 It's too bad, cause other than my main complaint the bag is great. It squeaks constantly while you walk. It's enough to drive me crazy.
 Nice and light- no added weight! <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/AmazonBasics-15-6-Inch-Laptop-and-Tablet-Bag/dp/B00DUGZFWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AmazonBasics 15.6-Inch Laptop and Tablet Bag</a>
 BIG BANG FOR THE BUCK. Don't waste your money on more expensive bags. This one has it all. Holds my laptop, tablet, and Kindle read, plus my mouse, mouse pad and all the chargers. They only thing I can't fit in it is my keyboard.  Never could type of a laptop.
 I like it ,very handy to carry all the attachments I may need.
 This is certainly a bargain compared to the many items that I examined at the computer store. It is very nicely made. I like the bright colored lining. I can just slip my iPad into this and the slip it into a large handbag. This is one of those great Amazon deals!<br/>I also purchased an excellent bag for my iPad from Amazon for $15, and an elegant vertical briefcase &amp; laptop case in patent leather for about $120 - covering all bases!
 When you consider a price of under $15, it is amazing what Amazon offers with this laptop &amp; tablet bag. I have been bringing it to work everyday with my work-issued MacBook Pro and couldn't be more happy with how functional it is. Gets the job done with no fuss. Someday I may upgrade to a more "stylish" case, but for now this will more than suffice.<br/><br/>My only recommendation for further iterations is to add extra padding along the inside canvas pockets/flaps that hold your laptop and/or tablet. Besides that, this bag far exceeds what I had expected to show up at my doorstep for $12.99.
 Perfect for my 15.6 laptop. Great price was the best price I found, for this useful bag!  Would buy again.
 A decent carrying bag at an affordable price. It provides my laptop a good amount of protection. I just wish that the shoulder strap was more sturdier.
 I have both a Nook and a Kindle Fire.  It's perfect for both devices and my headphones!
 Fits my Dell Latitude E5420 14.1" perfectly.  Good padding on the bottom and the sides.  Lots of pockets for your accessories.  Very compact.  You won't be able to fit too much more than the laptop and a charger, but it is a made for laptop/tablets.  Maybe a slim mouse and keyboard.
 Sturdy, lightweight, perfect for carrying my laptop everywhere. The outer fabric is not waterproof but is water resistant, so it's suitable for transporting your device in a light rain or such back and forth to the car or coffee shop without fear of water damage.
 Can carry all my daily use electronics in the bag.  I carry a tablet and two cell phones with chargers, cords and stand.<br/><br/>Great product and highly recommend.
 Great bag. I have them in 3 sizes.
 Great for transporting my laptop and other documents when I'm traveling. Cushion to protect laptop.
 Good bag, will carry my hopper in it when we go south for the winter.
 Love it, stored my laptop and my cooling pad &amp; accessories
 Good build quality! If you go for other brands for the same quality, the price might double!
 This really is a well made/strong case for your tablet... lots of places to hold your 'stuff' as we as your tablet! Very well protected!
 This bag is very well made and well padded.It is a great value too.
 Awesome
 I'm pretty darn happy with my Amazon Basics laptop bag.  I've had it for 6 months now.  While it doesn't get hard daily commuter use, I do tote it around quite a bit.  It's roomy, has lots of pockets and the overall construction of the bag seems decent.  Also, you can't beat the price!
 EXCELENTE BOLSO PARA LA NOTBOOK
 GREAT VALUE
 Great designe and a lot of xtra packages for store cables and school items
 Solid bag, just the right size, and quality construction throughout.
 Very good
 as another reviewer stated, you must be careful when picking up the side bag straps. if they are twisted in anyway, they might pop out. I did get some damage on my laptop but not serious damage. I dont know how it pops out but it happened to me -.-
 Perfect small tote bag for my new Surface 3. Wanted a bag for commuting to and from work with new tablet. This bag is absolutely perfect. The Surface 3 (in a case) fits great in center compartment. Another outstanding item and value from Amazons basic collection.
 nice works well with the laptop<br/><br/>Dale
 This was just perfect for what we wanted.  It appears well made.  It is large enough for the IPAD and some extras.  I think it was the right choice.
 suit my needs for 14 inch dell laptop perfectly. Well made and has a both a handle and a shoulder strap. nice lille zipper pocket in front and it provides a little padding much preferred over just  sleeve. great pricing less than half the price of well known brands and better quality.
 Does the job and has plenty of room. Great product for a good price!
 It works for what I needed it for.
 good to have
 great bag nice size fits everything with room
 Excellent very lightweight. Works perfect
 Perfect! High quality. Nice and slim. Great case for my Acer Chromebook. Well worth the price for this one.
 Nice for carrying just a 14" laptop and papers
 This is exactly what I wanted and it is the perfect size for my 17.3 inch laptop.  I would recommend this one to friends over other bags that I have looked at and it would save them money too.  I must say that I am very satisfied with all of my "Amazon Basics" purchases.
 Perfect for our 14 in Portable DVD Player for Boondocking in our RV.
 This was a gift for my mother. She uses it as a purse and to carry her Bible in for church functions. It works great, and should be great for tablets also. Well made.
 Very well built - better than I expected. I can easily carry an 11" or larger tablet, a portable keyboard, a 7" tablet, a leather portfolio and dozens of connectors and cables in this case. The only "useless" pocket, for me, has been the zippered one on the front!
 Bag is built well, sturdy, and holds up under pressure!  I usually end up putting one college textbook in it, my laptop, and gear and have not had any problems.  I use it every day that I am working and have yet to have ayn issues!
 Very good and nice color. Have lots of space and compartments. Look delicate.
 I really like this little tablet bag.
 No issues
 A neat, study case for an 11.6  inch laptop.  It is well padded but a little snug for the laptop, mouse and power cord.
 Great product just a little small so will send back.
 This is a good bag for the money. Its well constructed and fits my 12.9" iPad Pro (with plenty of room to spare) and accessories.
 Handles started  to come out of seams within  2 months. Decent quality. Not for lots of extras.
 Great
 I bought this for a 10 inch tablet in a folding case with its keyboard. Bags designed for 10 inch tablets are just too small. Construction is good, so the bag should last a long time, and more importantly, provide protection for my tablet and its keyboard. It's a quality product, so don't hesitate to buy one if you are in the market.
 Very versatile
 As expected
 A 17' laptop fit nicely inside this  bag. An excellent purchase for the money.
 Does the job! I've had it for over a year and it works great. I use it to carry everything I need for my tablet. I like that all pockets have zippers, so that you don't have to worry about things falling out. I recommend this case!
 My two boys have been using it for their MacBook Air for the last 3 months. The fact that it is small and comfortable, and has lasted for the last 3+ months without any blemish means it is a quality product. Can't go wrong for this price (I paid about $13).
 This is a great bag!  I have Amazon Prime so I received it in two days.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.
 Very good buy I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to buy a laptop bag.
 I'm not disappointed. This is a great Amazon product to carry your laptop and tablet. It has 2 extra side pockets and 2 internal pockets. Comfortable to carry and looks professional. I'm quite pleased with it.
 Works great as a brief case that I needed for work
 This bag provides excellent protection from bumps and damage, with a great price.  I have a 10" netbook, and it fits like its supposed to.  It is not cramped or tight.  The handles are right where they should be, conveniant and not in the way.  The outer zippered pocket holds my cordless mouse AND power cords for the netbook with ease. It seems to be made of quality material, not at all flimsy like some products.  I recommend it.
 Best simple efficient way to carry and store laptop
 I used this everyday to transport my laptop and other computer-related items back and forth to work. Except for the pad on the shoulder strap, it seems well-made. However, the stitching on the pad is coming apart.
 They make everything well, have yet to find a product they dont make just as good as the competition. Another plus, Amazon doesnt put a gigantic logo on it. its nice and discreet. (the way it should be)
 Roomy, well-cushioned bag.
 Quality is great. Wish it had another compartment but will make do!<br/><br/>It's well padded to protect laptop, tablet or whatever device you choose to use it for.<br/>The strap is very sturdy.
 nice
 Muy bueno para guardar tu laptop, muy confortable y práctico
 So for the price, this case is perfect.  Functionality gets 5 stars.  I looked everywhere you can think of for a good case to carry it around, while already in its Apple case, and found nothing under 40, until....<br/><br/>I saw this case and read the reviews and oh was it a great buy!  The orange on the inside is a nice touch and it even has an outside zipper with a pretty good size storage compartment(perfect for storing Sony digital and iPhones).  I use this case a lot when I use my telescope at night because I have the Starwalk App and am always afraid I am going to drop it while I am carrying everything outside..this baby has handles so I can slip it through my fingers.  Also great for when I want to carry it in my backpack.  No more fear of an accidental drop and no more smudges or fingerprints on Apple case.  Hooray!
 Just what my husband needed.
 I just wanted something that wasnt a briefcase- this is light, durable, zipper and stitching seems solid. I can toss the ipad air into it and there is still a pocket for accesorries. It's fairly well padded so unless your intentionally hitting a wall with it - this will work great! Thanks for saving me a bunch of $$$
 It's good quality for the price.  However, I bought it for my friend's laptop and just an FYI for everyone out there who's thinking of doing the same - BARELY fits inside the bag!  You have to stuff it into the bag and can barely close it the fit is so tight.<br/><br/>Other than that seems to be of good material and has a shoulder strap (which is a big bonus).
 Didn't expect this bag to work since it looked way too small for my 17 laptop. The fit is snug &amp; secure and the bag is padded which I love. There are extra pockets for all my supplies. and the convertible strap is perfect.
 Super affordable and worked perfectly to keep me from breaking my new tablet. Thanks!
 Twice in 1 month the strap had given way and the laptop bag fell to the floor WITH THE LAPTOP! Laptop was fine, but I have to replace this bad. Spend extra dollars and get some other brand.
 looks simple, it is light and has the right amount of pockets for either documents or a laptop.
 Great bag fit my 15 inch computer with out being bulky. Great price for the bag
 This laptop bag is a workhorse. I love it. Everything is durable from the zippers the the internal compartments. I've stuffed a lot of stuff in here and it has handle the wear and tear very well. I don't use the shoulder strap and find that it got in the way, so I unclipped it. You can't beat the quality and price.
 This is perfect, has everything I need for my new laptop, great price and quick shipping.
 I use 2 different sizes for my laptops.Great case and priced low.
 I bought this to tote my iPad around. There is plenty of room to add an in-wall charger, USB-to-Lightning cable, notepad and screen cleaner pad.
 I wasn't sure about this case whenI ordered it. I travel and needed a case to protect my Ipad while traveling and also travel with a Kindle. Ti case can hold both if I need it too! It has a little side pocket for my Ipod too!<br/>I use the Ipad more and more and it is so easy to travel with (don't have to remove it from my briefcase at security) This case is perfect, not too tight not too loose. I am a woman and would love a little more style and color but aside from that, the case is perfect.
 This is a well-made, sturdy product that holds my 11.6" laptop comfortably and offers very good protection from normal hazards of everyday use, at a very reasonable price, replacing a sleeve that was too tight, too little protection and too awkward for convenient carrying.  I'm pleased with it.
 A year later and it’s still in good condition
 for the price this is great case for a laptop its not meant to be thrown around its made to store and protect your laptop and all you need .<br/>Unless you throw your laptop across a room this is all you need
 great for my computer when I need to be on the go !
 I have a  HP Pavillion g7 and I couldn't find a case that was light enough for me to carry around during my trips. This one seems it's well made, with very light material and enough padding for protection, I like the design of the bag, I even think the AmazonBasics logo looks unique and cool. My 17.3" HP laptop fits in the bag perfectly.
 Recently purchased this along with the OtterBox case. I was looking for a soft case to stick the iPad in during my travels. Not sure if any other reviewer mentioned this, but the iPad in the OtterBox case DOES fit into this bag easily - no need to 'fight' to get it in there. Nice zippers, solid design, but I've gotta say it doesn't have as much padding as I thought it would. I'm going to keep it since I know it will be protected in the OtterBox case, but for those people looking for a bag that keep their iPad bare (without a case) or with a flimsy non-protective case I'd honestly look for something with more padding. It'll keep it from scratches and dents, but I would be afraid to drop this case from a few feet with a bare iPad in there. (Not that I'd do it on purpose, but accidents happen)
 We needed a carrying case for our PC.  So far it is working just fine for our needs. The price was good too. Comfortable and convenient.<br/>If you take good care with it, it should last you a long time. I don't know how well it will hold up if used daily, but good for occasional use.
 I bought this item because of another review. He said this case is as good or better than the ones for fourty dollars for only fifteen bucks. I agree! can't beat this deal.  Good solid padding and nice outside pocket for cord and transformer.  Laptop fits in easily.  I like this purchase.
 Thank you I already get the bag. I really appreciate it.
 STYLISH  AND RELIABLE,  PROFESSIONAL
 This bag is of very good quality and price is also reasonably good. I ordered it for my husbands HP Elitebook 820 G3. He loved it so far. I'll update my comment if anything goes wrong.
 Very nice case reasonably priced.
 I bought this for the google Pixel C tablet. It fits perfectly and protects well.  Nice side pocket. Sturdy but light weight.
 perfect fit for my laptop and handy pockets/holders for accessories, including a mouse. An excellent value for the price.
 Well made and the perfect size and weight for my laptop. It got here quick! Much lighter than other bags I've eperienced.
 For the money you get a great bag, hands-down! Plenty of storage and pockets.
 Arrived fast with no issues.
 Bought this to cart around my iPad Air (in a leather case with a Bluetooth keyboard) and its accessories.  Well-padded inside.  Strap handle is a nice touch.  Pocket on one side is plenty big enough for iPad's charger/cable plus HDMI adapter and cable.  Zippers work very well.  Great buy for the price.
 Perfect fit for the new slim laptops with extra room.
 Works well if I had to laptop to go with it would be great
 I love this bag!  I have a 14" Lenovo Thinkpad and a 13" MacBook Pro that I take to and from work and this bag fits both perfectly!  There is plenty of room for both laptops, associated chargers, and a wireless mouse.  I can often fit a few folders in the bag as well.  It is great for day to day use and it's easy to carry.  The shoulder strap is pretty sturdy and it won't chafe your skin.
 Good quality product, exact fit and room for storage. The price is the best I could find. In stores such items run between $25-50. I would recommend to everyone who is looking for a bag to fit a 11' laptop.<br/>I purchased other Amazon Basic items such Iphone 5 chargers and case, and are very durable products!!!
 This bag is the best bang for your buck.  I have my Surface RT in it.  Also holds: 48W charger, 3 micro USB cables, 25' HDMI to micro-HDMI cable, tp-link travel router, wireless mouse, few USB thumb drives and a small usb hub.  All this without bursting at the seams or anything.  It looks reasonably good, for me function trumped appearance for this bag.  I think I could fit the wife's iPad in there in addition to all my Surface accessories
 If you are looking for a nice bag for you MacBook Air 11" to carry around and don't need a lot of extra stuff, this is the bag for you. If you have lots of cords, external hard drives, then I would recommend looking for another bag.<br/>I love this bag because it is small but well made and inexpensive. Besides the laptop I usually carry an Ipad, charging cables, external HD and there is room for your phone or iPod.
 Great!
 I LOVE THIS THING!!!! It lasted me almost two semesters and can be used longer! But it ripped a little bit on the inside but that is probably from me abusing it since I'm always running to class with it! It fits anything I want to fit in it! My phone charger, macbook charger, macbook, pens, pencils, ID, candy, papers, tissue, and other things I might drop in there during my long busy days! Its perfect and I highly recommend!!
 My computer fits in perfectly and is well protected.
 Love all the pockets, perfect, thank you
 Love this case. Perfect size and looks trendy! It has pockets to keep and organize the basic things you will love to carry o your bag.
 Very comfortable to carry around and plenty of space for laptop accessories
 Perfect for the 15.6" laptop.  Decent manufacturing and materials.  Time will tell how well it holds up but seems to have strong sticthing and padding where needed.  Comes with a shoulder strap and an extra pocket for a mouse and charger.  It has a back strap to use with your luggage pull up handle.
 Hey, it's simple and compact, but still great product for the price.
 Very nice quality in a small simple bag - looks good and feels like it will last a long time<br/><br/>I use it for carrying around my computer and gear while in the building from room to room - has room for all I need to carry
 Very happy with this. Fit comfortably. Has removable shoulder strap if you would rather carry by hand. Also has several pockets for any accessoriesyou carry around. High quality zipper to keep the bag closed.
 Good value for the money, fits my laptop perfectly
 This product is just as good as the higher price items and the price is very good compared to similar laptop bags.
 This bag is perfect for my Acer C720 chromebook. It fits inside with room to spare. I have a mouse pad in the computer section in the outer pocket, which gives it a bit of extra padding. The side pocket holds a wireless mouse and the power cords, plus 2 pens. The bag is comfortable to carry by the handles or the padded shoulder strap, and it is holding up well after a month of use.
 I love this laptop case so much that I will be buyinga second one for my other laptop.
 High quality. Has lasted well.
 I purchased this for my iPad Air which is not in any kind of other case but it is a little large for this.  To give you an idea of how large it is, I also have and iPad 2 which is in a Otterbox Defender case and with the case on, it fits perfectly in the carry bag.  This may be made more for a Netbook due to the size but I am now going to use it for my iPad 2 while also using the Otterbox Defender case.
 The perfect small laptop bag.  Can't beat the price and value.
 Good basic case for the money. Not the heaviest duty (my previous case was heavier duty, but I purchased it many years ago for an older heavy laptop) but great for today's laptops.
 I can't believe how affordable and how great this bag is. It fits my ipad and more. I can stuff chargers, wires, makeup, stationary, and other junk into the pocket (it's gigantic). The big zippers and a HUGE plus. It's a flexible material which is why it can fit so much, yet it is the perfect size for the ipad so the ipad won't move around. The handles are great; thinking of purchasing a shoulder strap for it!
 Recommend... fits very well for 17.3 inch laptop... lots pockets... sturdy... ready to travel... and $$ is very good :)
 Great product at a good price.
 Well designed
 excellent. Now I don't have to carry my tablet around in a bag. I carry it to work every day
 Son used it on a trip/loved it .  worked great for his needs.  Nice for the price.
 Great bag. I love it fits my laptop nice and snug. Great protection as well, trust me I'm pretty clumsy while lugging around my laptop and this thing has protected it. My co-worker bought three of them because of me.
 I am part of an IT dept at a large company, and we recently bought these to go out with laptops instead of ones we purchased previously that were a few dollars more.  These are just as sturdy, but have better pockets - great for what we need!
 I love this bag! I am able to fit my Nexus 7, 9, and my Acer Chromebook in it! It's a good built and worth more than the $12 I paid for it. I'm a google specialist working at best buy and wasn't interested in getting a back quickly for $50+ in stores, so I ordered this with same day delivery instead.
 Well worth the money.  It is very low cost, but very nicely put together. Most of the bags in this price range were very thin &amp; don't provide much padding or protection, this one does.  Has 2 separate pouches with cushion in between each section.  Would highly recommend this bag.
 This is an awesome bag and a great value for the money!  I'm retired and didn't need anything fancy, just something big enough to carry and protect my 15" laptop if I'm on the move.  This fit the bill perfectly!
 I started out with a smaller version of this case for my Verizon ellipsis. I have a firearm permit, and upgraded to the larger bag so I can fit 1 small pistol and my Taser X26 + headphones  and other accessories  inside unnoticed.
 Have used this for a couple months and am very happy with it. Nice padding, zippers work well, more than enough interior pockets. And it's a great price.
 This case is beyond a value. It is just as good as the 50 dollar bags in Best Buy &amp; Staples but for a fraction of the cost. There is plenty of room for the laptop and cords but no extra room for something like a mouse. I love this bag and I am really glad I purchased it, TY Amazon so much because I cannot afford the bags elsewhere. :)
 After a week of use, when I hanged on my shoulder the strap unclipped itself, the case fall corner first. I opened the bag to find my 700 dollar laptop with a black screen. What a nightmare!!!
 Nice size bag for my personal items and my Samsung tablet and keyboard. Very happy I went with this bag instead of the higher priced bags that would have only fit my tablet. Or would've been too big altogether.
 works great, lots of room.
 Excellent product as described, spacious and roomy fits my 17.3" perfectly. light weight but durable. hihghly recommend.
 This bag is best simple computer bag I could find. I'm really happy I didn't spend more on another brand because this is great. Keep in mind that the bag will have the Amazon Basics logo on the front; if you're concerned with image, you should know that.
 This is exactly what I was looking for, at a much better price than anything I could find locally! I gave to my 7 year old to keep his tablet in while we were traveling. There is an outside pocket which is great for carrying extra cords and I wasn't worried he would scratch the screen. Fits his Nabi perfectly which he then put in his backpack. We are thrilled with the quality and price of this purchase-just what I was looking for.
 This was a good choice for the Acer Aspire E15 I bought.  Lots of room, plenty of padding, and lots of outboard storage for chargers, mice, paperwork etc.  Great price too!
 Highly recommended. Very happy with this purchase!
 Fits my iPad Air II and well made. Still using it for local and distant travel.
 This laptop bag is fairly well constructed.  I easily packs all my accessories when I travel.  Good value for the cost.
 Excellent brifcase, very well made! and its very useful
 I went to Best Buy and fondled some bags before I bought this one. This bag is a very good buy. Fifty dollar bags are not much better that this one. I mean, they have a little more padding. So unless you plan on playing football with it, I'd say get this one instead of the pricey ones.
 Product was more then I expected!
 I purchased this bag for my children's Dell Laptop that they use for doing homework on. I was very glad that I bought this AmazonBasics bag. It is very nice and has plenty of storage. I am tempted to trade them my bag for this one, but they said no.
 Good product for the price
 I really love this its the right size with alot of compartments. I would recommend it to anyone.
 Does the job, looks amazing!
 very nice, good quality, construction. zipper is sturdy. material is padded slightly, and water repellant, it seems.
 It's a bit more than jsut a basic bag. It has a few pockets and slots for a few add ons to the desktop. Lots of space for the laptop and the charger with whatever else you want like a headset and chargers. There are better bags for sure for around the same price but I like this one.
 Can't beat the deal for the price. I'm not a huge fan of the shoulder strap but overall the bag is very nice for $16 and feels like it will hold up very well. It's also much more spacious than I thought it would, which is great.
 Very happy with it
 Really durable with many compartments. Kind of large for a 14" notebook but as other reviewers have noted, you can easily carry other stuff. I had no problem packing a cell phone, iPad, cords, headphones, USB optical drive etc. The various compartments help keep devices from scratching each other.
 I received this on a Sunday, the day after I ordered it (Yay, Prime).  It is exactly what I was looking for!!! There is plenty of room for cords, the mouse and miscellaneous stuff that goes in a lap top bag.  Plus it looks good and is comfortable to carry by the shoulder strap.
 I like the price of this little case from Amazon but it didn't turn out to fit my needs very well. It's pretty thin, I did not feel like my Nexus 10 tablet was very safe from damage once inside. There was a ton of extra space which I suppose is to fit netbooks, not tablets. I like the pocket where I can store a charger and a USB To GO cable. Now that I have an actual fitted case for my tablet, this amazon case will serve well to carry my tablet around while it is in its own more secured case.
 I CAN NOT believe this bag was only $17!!! It is amazing and does everything I've ever need a laptop bag to do. Sure you can spend $70 for a fancy leather bag with 6 cellphone pockets, but you know you'd rather have a bag that says AmazonBasics on the front ;)
 If you have a 17.3 laptop but no bag then this one is for you it holds your computer, power cord as well as important business papers. the bag is well made and comes with a shoulder strap  for ease of carrying the price is right so grab you a nice shoulder bag for you laptop
 Bag is slightly larger than what I would have expected for my 10.1 tablet, I suspect you could fit a 12" in this.<br/>Nice padding and has a zipper pocket on the outside.  As long as you kept the back of your tablet towards the zipper pocket, I think you could safely store a charger in there without fear of cracking the screen.<br/>Handle is nice, over all seems like a good carrying option for my tablet.
 I love this. Seems to be heavy duty. Room for lots of extra things. With everything I carry in mine, it probably is 20 lbs. Padding protects laptop well. I use it in my work truck, and it's taking the abuse fine. Zippers all still work. Handles still firmly attached. This is a great case.
 I got so tired of carrying around my "stuff" and always dropping things - so, I put everything into this case now.  By everything, I mean my iPad, my iPod, my cell phone, my chargers, and other miscellaneous items.<br/><br/>It's soft, holds a lot, and I don't drop things like I used to as I'm walking out the door, trying to lock up, get into the car, etc.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.
 Met my needs
 A GOOD BAG TO CARRY TWO AMAZON FIRE TABLETS PLENTY OF ROOM WITH A STRONG OUTSIDE HANDLE TO CARRY.
 Simple lightweight laptop bag.  If you don't want/need a million compartments and just need a bag for your laptop, try this one.
 Great product
 Great bag for my computer especially for the price,  I needed a bag for my new 17.3 in laptop, since all my old bags only fit th 15" computers.  I shopped several stores and bags were 20- 40 dollars more than this one,  Quality of material is excellent.
 I bought this bag for use with my Chromebook and it works perfectly for this. Size is small but still well padded for protection. It has room for some paperwork, the charger cable and a few small things. Like other 'Amazon Basics' products, it serves a purpose wel at a low price.
 Very nice tote bag for my small laptop and acc.
 Highly recommend this as a quality product that I am using for my Surface 3 to easily accommodate the Pad, multiple power cords and peripheral equipment (including lunch and a thermos) in a minimal package.  Zippers will outlast anything purchased previously.
 standard basic needed edition as i need. im happy good price/
 My expectations were partly met and is light with sufficient space inside for my work commute. I thought 14 inches would be bigger for some reason. Strap is perfect helps my back.
 For the money its "ok"... but no question its an inexpensive bag, looks and feels inexpensive, but does what was intended...you get what you pay for...
 Carries a Acer 10" Netbook just fine, snug and secure. The handle makes all the difference as I don't know know why you'd want a little laptop only to have to carry it like a book?! Neoprene may be nice to the touch but it does make it a bit slippery. with the handle no problemo. The orange interior is cool- Silver Creek HS Raider color! Only thing is once you pack the AC cord in there it does get a little bulky, not a big deal.
 Pretty decent bag for the price. Only issue I have is the front of bag seems to collect lint from everything and anything... @_@ it's crazy lint-city.
 This case is perfect!  I carry my iPad, while in a keyboard case, inside the AmazonBasics Bag.  The bag is roomy, yet not too big.  It's obviously not too small either.  The side zip pocket is perfect to carry my headset in so I can listen to music on my iPad while traveling.  I also can carry my iPhone in the zip pocket too!  Great Bag for the price.
 I bought this larger size for my iPad2 and it's perfect for my use.  My various<br/>iPad cases fit easily in this size along with my phone, stylus and miscellaneous<br/>stuff.  Construction seems solid, the look is clean and the handles or shoulder strap<br/>make it a mini-briefcase at a very reasonable price.
 It’s perfect for me. I take it to and from the office, and occasionally on airline travel. I have a big 17” laptop and the bag accommodates it, and all my kit perfectly.
 It's cheaply made (but I guess you get what you pay for).  It doesn't seem very padded, and the interior dividers are "crinkly."  It gets the job done though, allowing me to carry my computer, an external drive, a mini surge protector and the plug all in one small bag.
 My laptop fits and it has a lot of room for my mouse and mouse pad.
 Perfect size for what I needed. The extra organization and storage was really helpful. I used to carry my tablet in my backpack, but this is nicer and I don't tend to stuff it with as much extra stuff as I do my backpack.
 I'm picky when it comes to laptop and tablet cases... must have a shoulder strap, handles, zipper pocket large enough to hold the power supply and mini mouse and yet not be so thick and padded that it is bulky.  This one is really just right.  Our 13.3" dell laptop fits really well.  Good buy, good price, great quality.
 Excellent for small laptops/notebooks.  No frills, but sufficient pockets and well made.  AND, all for an unbeatable price.  Good example of Amazon getting it right with their AmazonBasics line of products.
 Great for the price and holds up, but the plastic pieces at the end of the straps don't stay in their intended place and make an annoying creaking sound when you're walking.
 Nice bag, good price.
 Good product
 Fits my 17 inch laptop perfectly with room to store the power cord and other accessories. Nice and padded.
 Fit my gignormous computer with room to spare!
 Good carry case for my IPad with the case. Roomy. The handles could have been a touch longer and material little flimsy but it serves the purpose
 Quality stuff! Glad I got this one..lots of storage and pockets! Carries all I need
 The 14.1 size is perfect for my 14.1 lenovo. Divided main compartment has room for the computer and at least a couple inch think stack of 8.5X11 note pads. It would snuggly fit legal pads. Outside zippered compartment snuggly fits 8.5X11 folders. Appears sturdy and well made. Padded base give nice cushion if dropped or set down hard. It is a relief to carry this small, light case after years of lugging a huge 15.6 case that now looks like a suitcase. 'can't go wrong for about $14.
 Perfect size for my Toshiba Radius 2 in 1 11.6 inch tablet/laptop.  It as more than enough room for the adapter, a slim mouse, wireless gym type headphones and my portable hard drive without bulking it up too badly.  Great price and well made.
 Great product at outstanding price. Nobody can beat Amazon laptop tote!
 Great price and very good value for money
 Not as large as pictured and described.  Can't get all of my extras inside.  Tried to get an iPad Air plus Galaxy Tab 10.5 inside and would not fit;  Also had cables, chargers, etc and no room.  Might handle one (1) small laptop or Tablet and a charger plus cable. Will give it to my wife who has fewer extras.
 Case is not as heavy or padded as more expensive ones . Does what it needs house to car keeps it clean and dry.
 I own an iPad Air with the Zagg keyboard/case installed. I wanted something that I could carry the iPad in and this is just the ticket. It is padded and just the right size. I has a zippered front pocket that you can carry the charging cord and some note paper and pens, or whatever accessories you need.
 Very well made, quality throughout
 I bought this to downsize from a briefcase I didn't really need as a truck driver.It fits my IPad that is encased in a hard case Incipio &amp; a Case Logic tablet case.It also has ample storage for my clipboard &amp; a legal pad,pens &amp; charger.It also slips over my suitcase handle for easy travel.
 works perfect for my 17" laptop
 Good basic bag for carrying your tablet. It will hold a 10" tablet as well as a bluetooth keyboar and small blustooth mouse. The zippered pocket in front can be used for small cables and manuals.
 Got this for my I pad and it is a great case with much added room for extras.
 I purchased this to travel with my iPad. It is good looking, very well made and an incredible value. It has a zippered compartment for my charging cable and stylus, and pockets inside for additional papers. I chose a size a little bigger than my iPad and I'm glad I did.
 This is a wonderful bag that does the job and what a great price.
 Amazing little laptop bag. Fits my Alienware 13, Super slim cooling fan, wireless gaming mouse, charging cable, mouse pad, external HDD, external DVD player, AND extra paperwork too. Properly padded as well!
 Very nice
 The bag works well. It has space for various items without being to overloaded. Just wished it had a little more padding to better protect a computer. Good value for the budget minded.
 First bag, and now the replacement, had the shoulder pad rip after a couple days -- seems like poor design - curve in the pad puts all the tension of the strap on one spot when you carry it;  the pad is thin and tears.
 Awesome bag for an amazing price , it was just too small for my needs.
 I purchased these bags for my work, and couldn’t be happier! They look nice, have plenty of pockets/storage, and the materials finish is very good quality. For the price, you can’t go wrong with these laptop bags.
 Just enough pockets to carry laptop, chargers, cords, mouse, etc. I put my laptop inside another pad just for insurance.
 Positive ..it is the right size for my iPad 9.7
 Fair product
 ITS WHAT I NEEDED FOR MY NEW LAPTOP, IT'S FITS JUST RIGHT. CONVEINT FOR TRAVELING.
 simple and sturdy; bf takes to work every day for laptop and has lasted a while
 Fit Lenovo X201 with standard battery in the main compartment AND an iPad (w/leather amCase) in the secondary compartment. Not much room for anything else, but that's all I was looking for. Probably could also fit the power supply and cord in the small accessory pocket but it'd be bulging at this point.
 Very good product
 I had one about the same size but it was heavier than this, and I prefer this one for travel. On the reverse side is a strap pass-thru so it slips nicely over a rolling suitcase handle.  Plenty of room for my MacAir plus my iPad in its own Amazon Basics case, and all the necessary toys, chargers, cords.
 Excellent bag, especially for the low cost.<br/>I picked this size for a Samsung 12.2 inch tablet. It fits nicely with plenty of room in other pockets for keyboard, cable and accessories.<br/>Zippers are of good quality, it has both handles and a shoulder strap. Decent padding and fairly lightweight.
 I am very pleased with the build and ruggedness of this case. I especially like the price. It is a perfect fit for the chromebook I bought it for. Very fast shipping too.
 Surprisingly well made for the price.  Has enough room to use for a small briefcase.  Light and decent padding.
 This product is just as presented.  I am very happy with the quality of this bag.  I needed it to carry my 10-1/2-inch Dell netbook on trips.  This one is perfect, because it has a handle.  The padding inside is substantial, and there is a large zippered front pocket to store my mousepad and wireless mouse.  I was worried that my netbook wouldn't fit into this bag, as it is larger than the 10 inches specified, but it accommodated my netbook perfectly without stretching.
 Just the perfect companion to my ASUS Eee PC 10.1" netbook. It fits in perfectly without having to stretch the sides. There is an inch of space left on top. I have enough room for a small 100 page notebook and couple of pens. Outside pocket fits the power cord, earbud headphones. The bag is sleek, sturdy and shall last forever. The neoprene is surprisingly thick and cushy than some other bags. I like the rubbrized zippers with cute Amazon logo. Price - No one can beat it!!
 I really like this bag. Great as a carry-on for several magazines or a large book, tablet, passport &amp; misc. The handles are very comfortable. Looking at pictures posted by earlier reviewers, this bag design has been well improved.<br/>Nearly perfect--the only change I'd like to see would be the zippers; the large metal fobs are pretty noisy. I put heat-shrink tubing on the fobs to tone them down.
 Great Computer/Brief Case! I Store My Laptop, Notebooks, Wireless Mouse, Portable USB Harddrive, Pens, Pencils, Badges (PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING I TAKE TO CLASS) &amp; It's Still Pretty Roomy. I Love How I Can Either Carry It With My Hands or Be HandFree &amp; Throw It Across My Shoulder. FIVE STARS!!
 Just perfect. The size is great and it has just about the right amount of padding. Got it for my 10 inch tablet with otter box case. It's light enough to carry at college all day but sturdy enough to protect my tablet. Very happy, especially for the price.
 Everything I wanted and more from this bag. I can fit my 15inch MacBook Pro as-well as two-three textbooks and a notebook at one time, I also carry around my charger and a mouse and this bag holds it all and doesn't feel heavy on my shoulder.  Only thing stopping this bag from being a five is if i hold it at certain angles it makes a squeaking noise.
 i got this once before , for one of my Amazon tablets so I bought this one for a friend , for his laptop.<br/>HE LOVES IT, great room and exter slots for pins, papers, ext.......I will buy another when I get my next tablet or laptop.....
 Nice size, good quality bag. Would buy again.
 We ordered two - one for my wife's Mac Pro and one for my Mac Air.  Both are great.  There is room for accessories.  My Air has 11 inch screen and my wife's Pro has 13 inch screen.  Highly recommended.
 Very good quality.
 This bag perfectly fits my Asus T100, my charger, my mouse pad and mouse. I honestly could not be happier with this purchase for the price and quality! I highly recommend it! I'm going to start looking for AmazonBasics before I buy anything else! Simple, but very good quality products!
 Works perfect for what I need
 Nice case with plenty of room even store my printer paper inside
 Just a tad on the small side, so my 11 inch laptop does not easily slide into this bag. It does fit, however, and I like the fact that the bag is light and seems to be sturdy. The extra pockets could be a little bigger, but they do the job and I'm able to squeeze my accessories into the bag.
 I was generally happy with this laptop bag for the year and a half that I've owned it. Up until now, the main concern was the lack of padding on the corners, as other reviewers have noted, but mostly this was fine if I was careful.<br/><br/>The reason I'm dropping the review to 2 stars is because the connection to the strap has recently become frayed and is the middle of falling apart. This seems to be too early for this bag to start breaking apart, especially since it's had only light use.
 Fits everything
 Bought these to put some mini iPads in them for our workers.  This way you can  this will you do you can put a pad of paper pencil and whatever they need for that job.  Seems to be very well made for the price.
 Strap started to come apart.<br/>Amazon replaced it.
 Excellent bag for my iPad Pro with Smart Keyboard. Nice pockets for chargers/cables. I use it for travel and put in my iPad Pro, wife's iPad Mini, my iPhone 6+ and all chargers. Good protection for everything in case it is dropped or banged on a hard object. Build quality is excellent, nice zippers, easily accessible.
 This is a decent bag for the money, but it started falling apart within two months of use, and by the time a year had gone by, the zipper had broken and the stitching on one side of the strap had come complete undone, which made it unusable. But, for the money, that might really be a reasonable expectation for quality.
 Just what I was looking for. Fits my Acer chrome book and accessories.
 My laptop fits into the case perfectly. It has several zippered parts that make it easy to carry the charger, mouse (I use a mouse, not touchpad), and/or any other needed things.
 Not bad!  I get it isn't some expensive bag.  But it's been holding up just fine for me.  Seems pretty well made.  I'm not sure how durable it is, I don't use it much.  But it gets tossed around and moved a lot in my home and it hasn't had any issues with use either.
 Perfect and lightweight! It’s exactly what I was looking for and needed!
 My Lenovo Ideapad Flex 6-14 fit just right...
 Bag fits 17.3 MSI gaming laptop with mouse and clothes inside comfy good bag
 Let’s start with the cons. The outside collects dust a LOT.<br/><br/>Otherwise, useful even for heavier gaming laptops. It seems to be a bit water resistant, but don’t go swimming with the thing.<br/><br/>Great product overall.
 Perfect for a tablet but absolutely not big enough for a standard laptop.  Unfortunately, I purchased for my laptop and it didn't fit, but will find a purpose for it.  The bag itself is made well, but again, not a laptop bag, so bad description
 Very nice quality. Holds laptop, cables, mouse, &amp; tablet perfectly. Also has exterior zippered pocket perfect for files.
 All kids in grades 5 to 12 are issued an Acer Chromebook in our school district.  Bag is smartly priced and the Chromebook fits perfectly.  I bought two of these for less than one of the school district's "recommended" bags.  The only issue was finding this bag in the product sort.  It was on the fourth page.
 This bag is a little larger and bulkier than I expected from the description, but it's well made and a good deal for the price. My Asus T100TAR fits loosely. The padding seems sufficient, the zippers are good, and the handles are nice.
 Exactly what I need.  Case is padded on all 6 sides, aprox 3/8" thick closed cell foam.  Padded divider between outer zip compartment (pictured) &amp; main compartment which housed laptop.  I put external hard drive, power cords &amp; mscl hardware in the zip compartment (since it's padded between pc &amp; compartment, and paper documents in the light nylon internal sleeves (one each side of center compartment).  Price is great.
 Perfect for my needs.
 I had high hopes for this bag but I'm a little disappointed. After 6 months using this daily during my comm but carrying a laptop only 50% of the time I've noticed the handles starting to come off, and the strap was always a problem. It squeaks loudly, and the shoulder padding is thin and also coming undone at this point. I'm considering just replacing the strap, but the d-rings are the squeaky part, and the bag just doesn't feel sturdy.
 Alright, I see you Amazon! This bag looks EXTREMELY professional.  When I tell people that it is Amazon brand, their jaws hit the floor.
 This item is great and fits my Asus Touch Screen laptop perfectly. It has excellent storage space for my stylus, disks, flashdrives, and power cord. The strap is a little uncomfortable and oddly made, but I like to tote it by hand since the item I use it for is so light. It was also a great price and doesn't feel like it's going to fall apart in a week.
 I do not usually write product reviews but this bag is incredible! It is manufactured extremely well, has ample storage, and the price was great!<br/>I highly recommend this case for small laptops, Tablets, or notebooks and files.This is a 10 in my book!
 It is fine really.  I wanted something that opened  up like a suit case.  This opens only across the top.  It is okay.  It would have cost me half of what I paid to return so I kept it
 Holds my 17" HP laptop and my Targus Space Saving Lap Chill Mat in the main compartment and power cords, etc in the zippered front pocket.  Just what I was looking for.
 Excellent high quality bag. Fast shipping as well.
 I got this for my Lenovo ThinkPad and I love it.  It serves its purpose and has plenty of storage space for accessories.  I would definately recommend this to anyone that just needs a basic storage bag,  Not padding so I don't think it would protect your laptop from a fall but for the money, what would you expect.
 I only paid 15 dollars for this.  I thought it was a great deal.  Simple design, plenty of pockets.  Thanks Amazon.
 This bag is well-made for what it is. It's made of foam. Fits a little loose on my Asus Chromebook. The side pocket is a little small. Works well as a bag when I want my device but don't need to bring anything else with it.
 Bought this as a gift for my brother-in-law who has a new Dell 15.6" Laptop. It is a perfect fit and he likes all the available storage space. My wife has the same one for her 14" laptop and loves it as well. It is very well made, with good protection for the laptop, and is not bulky to carry.
 Perfect fit for a chrome book and easy to travel with, lot's of room. No problems.
 Great bag. Fits a 15.6 HP Elitebook with no problems and plenty of coushin
 Like it better than I thought I would. Holds my laptop and gear better than the $50 model I originally tried out.
 I have had mine since 11/2015 and have had no problems with it.  I even wash it in the washer.  Great buy and no problem with the strap at all.
 Just got it, seems like good quality for the price, will update to give durability review.
 Works very well as a laptop bag. The only problem with it is that I now know that I just don't like laptop bags. If you like them though, this will serve you well.
 This was perfect and was approved by my lovely wife. I bought her a new tablet and this was perfect to carry it in , and when we go on trips she has no problem taking her tablet along.<br/>This is lined with soft material that will no scratch your tablet. perfect storage and carrying device , Thanks again
 This is a cute little bag.  Very soft and spongy.  Perfect for the Apple Ipad Air 2.  You could also use it to carry just about anything.  I am getting one for my husband to use as his "man bag" to carry his sunglasses, reading glasses, crossword puzzle book, pen, and anything else.  He loves it.
 This bag does not fit a 11.6" Dell Chromebook.  It is way too tight around corners.  Charged over $8 in return shipping charges which was not disclosed when the return process was started.
 The price is great and it appears to be well made. Time will tell.
 I purchased this to carry my Nook and wanted a little more room for other items. This product fits the bill. It is made of sturdy material, has the option of a strap which can be easily removed, and has pockets inside to carry items such as notebooks, phones, pens, etc. It is perfect for a tablet or small laptop. I can see this product lasting for a long time.
 I purchased this for My Ipad Air 2.  A lot of people were asking if it would fit an I pad properly.  It does and its actually a little on the big side but I don't mind.  I can fit a little extra in there if I need to.  I love the material, its easy to clean and durable.
 What can I say, carries my laptop for cheap. I like the long strap so I can sling it over my back
 This is simply the best small bag I own.  Well constructed of good material.  Good design too, has a strap across the back to attach to your wheeled luggage estended handle.  Bonus!!!
 Great bag.  I downsized from my much larger and significantly more expensive bag and couldn't be happier.
 I have two 15" laptops, and wanted a bag that was a bit bigger to carry more items.  This was a great find and purchase. The bags arrived on time, and allow me to fit the charger and school books inside.  Easy to carry and protects my laptops.
 perfect little bag for my mini laptop.  Has plenty of room to add in the charging cord and wireless mouse too!
 Needed an inexpensive but durable bag for carrying correspondence, flies,  etc. when I don't need a backpack.  This ideal.  Attractive, very well made, and the right size and weight.  If I need to bring my laptop, it offers adequate protection.  For twice the price, this is an excellent bag.
 Had to return it my husband is getting were he doesn't want to order anything. He has no I idea how much I save .so sorry
 needed a new carry bag as I had upgraded from a 10.6 to the 11.6 tablet ;I had bought the 1st one from amazon an was happy with it. so when I saw this one I gave it a shot great deal for the price, its well padded an seems to be all around well made, has to b as I take this on my scooter, So far I'm pleased would recommend
 Exactly the size and style my husband was looking for! The extra pockets are great and fit his laptop and tablet no problem! It's holding up great so far and doesn't seem cheaply made!
 Well made and good storage space.
 It is basic.  Nothing special
 nice not much space for accessories but works well for my needs.
 Good product
 I needed a bag to protect my MacBook Pro / Touch laptop and here is what fits in this bag: the usual papers I carry with me, the laptop, a charger, my international power adaptors, the charger for my phone, my Amazon mouse, deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste, pair of socks, underwear, clean shirt. Meaning to say: this tiny bag fits perfect for my one day business trips.
 Works great w/ my laptop, plus extra room for cords
 Simple and effective. Nothing impressive but nothing lacking. For $15 it 5/5.
 Received safe and sound and as described, thank you very much
 Perfect for my lap top, Light weight and easy to carry<br/>LOVE!
 Perfect!
 Great holds my 10 inch and my 8 inch tablet or my 15 inch laptop.
 Perfect briefcase/laptop bag. Purchasing another for my sons laptop.
 Its multiple compartments are very convenient for storing my keyboard, mouse, charging cable and tablet in. I can't recommend this simple carrier enough!
 I have been using this case for a few months now and it is sturdy and still looks new. It was a great buy and I am certain it will hold up for along time. Love it!
 Plenty of space for its rated size. Durable enough for moderate travel usage. Could have a little more cushioning in it. Pockets and pouches are nice and they allow for simple organization. Sometimes threading comes unraveled in the support stitching, but nothing a lighter can't fix. One of the best for the price/package deal.
 using to hold  Acer C720-2103 Chromebook (11.6-Inch), very strudy and decent size pockets to hold charger and headphones etc.
 I recently purchased a portable DVD player, which did not include any type of carrying case. The 15.6" case was perfect for the player and accessories.
 For the price, this was great. I also updated the all black look by applying ( fussing) a Hawaiian Flower onto the front of the case! Wah La, instant personalized plane wear which helped locate my computer in a snap while deplaning! Found the case to have lots of pockets for accessories and even fit my laptop cooling pad, books and more
 What a first class bag for the money. I'm going to have to watch what other products Amazon puts their name on. If they keep this up their name could become associated with premium products that everyone can afford! My Asus TF300T 10.5" tablet fits great!
 This was the perfect gift.
 This bag is very nicely constructed and has lots of pockets for all my stuff.  It fits my 11 inch laptop perfectly.  I've been using this bag since December and it is holding up great, I absolutely love it.
 Nice package
 Used for jumper cables, etc.
 I been using this bag for about a month, it works as intended. I use it every day.
 This bag fits my HP Touch perfectly.  It is soft and padded enough to protect my tablet.  I like the orange interior, it lets me easily see if I left the bag unzipped.  The front pouch is roomy and the zipper pulls are soft, large and easy to pull.  The handles are also soft and comfortable to hold.  The price was reasonable too.  I am overall very happy with this purchase and will recommend it to anyone.
 Another great product from Amazon... I use this for my Lenovo T520 which is a sizeable laptop... I can put my ipad, several gadgets and documents and still have loose room for adapter and whatever else I might want to through... Definitely for this bag if you own a 15inch huge laptop like mine or up...
 Bragging about my Amazon bag! My second time purchasing this bag! Great bag, very comfortable strap. I pack a full bag daily for work! Books, folders, small metal work tools, and lunch..lol! Bag lasts a long time, with problem!..Very happy!😄
 Nice bag for carrying my Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5, the tablet has a silicon case that is wide.<br/>There's enough room in here for the iClever KB, my cell phone and stylus.<br/>It's well constructed with a number of pockets and compartments.
 Does the job. Nuff said.
 Great
 Great travel bag. Lots of room for our laptop and charger and any paperwork we need. This bag has held up well during our motorhome travels all over N. America.
 Good quality for price
 This is a good simple laptop bag. I'm confident that my devices are well protected. Build quality is good and it seems like it will last for as long as I'll need it to. Another product by Amazon that is  impressive.
 Very happy with this product. I read the reviews before I purchased and saw the comments about the cheesy shoulder strap that can come undone. So I took the strap off the bag I was replacing and used it for this bag and I'm all good.
 Delivered on time as described.  Good workmanship.
 Laptop fits perfectly, with pockets for other items, well priced too.
 Well made with a couple nice pockets for the extras. My Chromebook fits nicely.
 I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said. This bag is very light weight and fits my 17 inch laptop, accessories and a book. It's easy to carry and comfortable on my shoulder. My main recommendation for this bag would be to have more pen holders in the front pocket.
 Great Value. The strap swivels are very noisy and annoying. Case is great quality.
 Great bag, for my 15" hp laptop, exactly what I needed.
 Best briefcase I’ve had. I was going to stores looking at spending $80+ on a bag, but got this one for under $20. Very happy with my purchase.
 The case has room for the computer and accessories I carry, power brick and cables, mouse and a small bag of miscellaneous stuff. It seems to be well made. I wouldn't call it stylish, but it has a certain made for purpose look. In short it is what I need and not a lot more to carry.
 I LOVE this case-- its very roomy on the inside, even with ipad protector case on it..outside zip pocket perfect for headsets, ipod, phone, etc..i only wish it was offered in a variety of colors
 Needed a smaller bag for hospital stay, it will work
 Great bag for the price.  Could use a little more padding in the corners, but overall it handled a week-long travel trip, protected my computer well and carried the power cords, assorted small add-ons and some paperwork (reservation and ticket printouts) easily.
 The bag is very durable.  I have owned it for almost a year, and average using it two days per week.  No sign of wear yet.<br/>==========<br/>UPDATE 2018-11-30<br/>The bag has lasted many years.  I'm so happy with it I decided to order a second one for my new laptop!
 This has so much room for more then just a laptop
 Excellent. Does what it was designed to do...very nice. It's sturdiness will prove over time..
 very pleased good value
 Good quality, inexpensive laptop bag.  Easily worth the price.
 This bag exceeded my expectations!!!!!!!! It is very well-made. The zipper is very easy to pull and the fabric/material used is amazing! Holds my tablet perfectly with plenty of room for all my extra items. Definitely blows all the other name brand bags away!!!!!!! I plan on ordering at least 2 more soon. Great find!!!!!!!!!!
 Great quality for a good price, if you want to carry your pad in a bag with accessories and/or extra protection.  You can't go wrong with this bag.
 Holds my Azio Bluetooth 3.0 back lit keyboard, Fire OS4 HDX (7 inch display) plus cords, ear buds, user manuals and I even have my HDX in another sleeve .  Soft material (acts like a mild cushion) and seems to be holding up well .  I've had good luck with AmazonBasics products .
 It is a great computer bag for my Acer Aspire One.  It's sized perfectly and some room for essential accessories (I even have room to pack an external CD-ROM drive).  I am VERY pleased and commend Amazon for offering such a good product at a reasonable price.  Best value I've ever personally seen in a computer bag.
 No complaints out of the box - this is solid well made and comparable at twice the price ... excellent value and I would purchase it again.
 This is a great bag.  Sturdy! Great quality.  I would buy it again.
 Just what I was looking for with room for asseseries
 I sent this back as it did not fit my new 17.3" HP laptop!
 Great case, i bought this for my chromebook and it has many pockets to hold everything. it holds my computer my wireless mouse, my phone and all of the cables for both.
 Samsung Oddessy fits nice. It could use one more even smaller pocket on front side for smaller adapters or early buds. Nice quality.
 Just as Advertised. Basic Laptop Bag at a good price.
 This is a great bag for my Asus notebook. It's a nice and compact carrying solution. The only bummer was that I could not fit standard 8.5 x 11 documents in the main compartment as the rounded corners of the bag create less than 8.5 inches  - resulting in dog ears on your documents.
 Best bang for the buck
 Grandson loved it
 Not bad at first but after a month or so the stitching on the shoulder pad began to come undone and this is only using it twice a week. Spend a couple of extra bucks and get something of better quality. YUK!
 Bought this almost two years ago, and still holding up well. Big enough to fit the laptop AND a lot of extra space for more stuff. A lot of times I don't even need a backpack when I'm using this bag.
 Exactly what you would expect for the price.  Its not the greatest/thickest case ever, but it is economical and gets the job done well for me.  Fits my 15.6 inch laptop very well.
 Nicely made and thoughtful design for unbeatable price. Very snug fit for my 14.1 inch ThinkPad laptop so you may consider going up to the 15 inch case for a 14 inch laptop. Padding seems adequate which is the average from my experience with such bags, regardless of the price.
 Plenty of pockets and slightly padded.  However, will not fit it my large backpack when I want to travel.  For the price of $16, you really can't beat this. It is a perfect fir for my laptop.
 Very Nice Case fits Ipad pro and Charger Perfectly!
 It's a perfect fit for my 15" MacBook Pro. I only wish there was a bit more room so I can store all of my electronic gadgets.
 I have owned two.<br/><br/>Good bag for the price, but it will rip.  My strap broke after 4 months and bag started ripping on the interior around 9 months.  I have to buy a replacement.  The material is not the best quality and will likely not last you over 6 months of daily use.
 Great bag for a chrome book. Nice price for what you get too. Very made well, strong, great design, extra pockets and the pockets are where you need them. zippers made well. Fits the 11.5 laptop with large earphones, mouse, wires and still zips up with room to spare. You will be happy.
 Wanted a simple case to use when I had to visit a client.  This case works great and very functional.  The fit of my 17.3 is great.  Has room for accessories and my notes for the meetings.  Looks great!
 Just what I needed, fits the new 2017 iPad very well and I have a keyboard case which is big. No complaints at all.
 Perfect fit for my laptop that is 13 1/4 inch in width. Even room for my micro mouse to ride on top inside.<br/><br/>Functional, black to not show stains, slim, lightweight, but made with rugged material. I'm quite pleased.
 Compact with good fit
 Awesome, just as described! Thank You!
 Our laptop fits perfectly in the bag.
 This is very well made and fits a 9.7" iPad very well.
 Great value. nice bag especially for the price. Travels well.
 Absolutely perfect for my little I pad.. cannot believe it is so nice for the inexpensive price... everything fits perfectly and it looks much more expensive than it is.. thanks
 good price on bag,  it little light on padding,  but Ok for the price and my usage
 Good
 Great deal on a great product
 I already had a sleeve case I bought for my Nexus, but there is no room for things like the power cord, key drives, reading glasses, etc.  This is just exactly what I was looking for.  A safe case for the Nexus 7, as well as an extra pocket for accessories.  And handles make it easy to carry on airplanes, hotels, etc.  Well made, well priced.  Love it.
 This fits a 13" MacBook Air perfectly, and has plenty of extra room for all the other stuff you need to carry. I was looking for a small laptop bag that would fit inside my 20" carry on suitcase. I travel a lot for work, and I love the convenience of traveling with only one bag through the airport. This makes it easy to travel with just my suitcase, but still have a briefcase for going to meetings once I arrive. The laptop lives in the front pocket of my suitcase while traveling to make it easy to get through security. The rest of the stuff lives in the briefcase inside the bag.
 Superb quality, good padding, soft to touch.  Perfect size for the Dell Venue 10 7000 tablet.  Outisde pocket is large enough to pack a mouse or small cable.  Enough room inside to store the computer and a mouse pad.  Surprisingly good value.
 Perfect!! Just what I needed and great product
 It works.
 Very good bag.  Some loose threads started fraying at one outside corner within a few weeks, but they haven't spread, so I'm not concerned about that. Size is excellent, price is right.  Bought this for a 15 inch laptop, and it holds a can of soda next to the laptop with no problem.
 Often put a 2" binder in along with my laptop but this bag is not heavy duty enough for that.  I should have known the strap wouldn't be able to take the stress in the long run. The zipper went soon after - that I don't understand.
 It a really nice case that I gave to my husband. I bought it for myself but I needed more pocket space which it has but not so much pocket space if you're not a teacher...lol
 Perfect fit and will accommodate several accessories that I have.
 Wife loves it. 17.3 fits perfectly. Lots of pocketses for taters and such.
 The bag is about the minimum required to carry the laptop. I would add a little more room for a mouse, cables, pendrives, etc.
 Great bag for the money, quality stitching and feel, Holds my laptop great and was here on time.. Good bag for the money for sure.. I would recomend it..
 Very nice
 Perfect for Granddaughter going to college
 The only "complaint" I have is that the AmazonBasics emblem is right there on the front in a way that is very obvious. Kind of cheapens the look if you ask me. Other than that, I love it!
 Sturdy and roomy! Keeps my 17 inch HP Laptop inside without any struggle getting it in and out and the front pockets have a surprising amount of room. The Shoulder Strap is sturdy and comfortable.
 Good case for my 11.6 inch laptop. I would definitely recommend this case.
 I especially love the front zipped pocket!  I have a collection of Targus for all my other electronics and really love them but I saw this and decided to try it for the price.  Much less expensive than Targus!  It came today and I am very happy with it.  I will be ordering more as they become available in the sizes I need.
 Very light bag, almost feels like your carrying nothing at all. All compartments are also well distributed.
 It's a little bit on the light duty side. Decent value though considering the price. I don't think I'd carry around an expensive laptop in it though.
 Works great so far, previous bags I have ordered the handles fall apart quickly doubt this will happened this time around.  Lots of room for laptop, I Pad, I phone, pens and other accessories.
 Good quality and nice size for basic travel for electronics.
 Cheap, functional lap top bag. Squeaks at the plastic connectors of the straps while walking through the airport. It has been very durable. Nothing fancy but it does the job.
 Perfect for my laptop.<br/>Protects -does the job.
 bought this for my Dell Inspiron 13 laptop. fits good, plenty of pockets - only complaint is when putting the laptop in the case it catches on the cloth pockets inside.
 Good quality, looking forward to using it.
 This case is everything I hoped it would be!  It fits my DELL mini 10" laptop just perfectly, and the zippered pouch on the front holds a data cable, flash drive, power cord and a mini mouse!  That's everything I need, and is a heck of a lot easier than lugging around a small brief case or backpack.  And the bright orange on the inside doesn't bother me a bit...I sorta like it!  This is a great deal for the money, and the only thing I can't comment on at this point is durability, as I've only had it a few weeks.
 Cheap, yet effective
 There's nothing fancy about the bag. But it looks rather professional, and has enough padding to take care of my laptop. I have no problem storing the mouse, pad, zip drives, power cable, and whatever folders I want to put in it. The zipper is always the first thing to fail on bags and backpacks I've owned. So far the zippers are operating easily and the laptop compartment zipper seems pretty heavy duty. So far so good!
 nicely padded. seems like good quality, has seen heavy use over the last 2 months and has held up very well so far. would definitely recommend it.
 My laptop fits well in this case. It does what I need I it to do. Is s light weight case for light duty applications.
 I brought this bag as a Christmas gift.  It's been reported to me that tablet bag is perfect for the netbook he also got for Christmas.  No problems have been report with the quality of the bag.  In short, he likes it.
 I have been using this bag for over a month now and i love it. the size is great, i can fit my laptop, a small binder and all my electronic accessories in it when i travel. The build quality is great and you cant beat the price!
 Have used this bag for months prior to this review.  It is perfect size for Acer Aspire One 532h netbook.  The zip pocket on the side is large enough to accomodate flash drives and an AC charger, although there will be a lump if the charger is large.  Like the fact that it also has a handle, so you can either put it into another carry bag or carry it by itself.  Durable so far and an excellent value for the price.
 Very nice quality. Bright orange interior that makes it look stylish. This will suit an iPad just fine.<br/>I bought this as a bag to carry 7"x9" literature instead and it's just right. Even the side pocket can hold a small thick book without the bag looking too bulky.
 Arrived in order and worked perfectly!
 Purchased this bag as a replacement for my original Dell sleeve which was falling apart after only a few months.  Was skeptical at first since I went for the 11.6" bag for my Dell XPS13, but I have to say, the XPS13 fits perfectly.  It holds my laptop, slimline mouse, passport drive, charger, and external cd drive without appearing "bulky".  Case is well constructed with good stitching all around.  For this price point I was astonished by the quality for the price!  Amazing job Amazon!
 I bought this to transport multiple items on a recent trip overseas. I had my digital photo camera, my Kindle, the power cords for both and some USB sticks and memory cards. This case protected all my items and I could use it as a travel bag when I took them with me to use the contents away from the house.
 Initially I thought this laptop bag was going to be just right for laptop with no much room for other stuff.  I was wrong and I'm glad I bought this one.  It's elegant, comfortable, and allows me carry the charger, mouse, and a couple of books I need on a daily basis.
 I love it I have been looking for a sleeve with handles for a long time.  Sleeves are nice and handy without being bulky.  However they are somewhat slick and can slip out of your arms or hands.  A handle make life easier.  I could use one for laptops also.
 Great laptop bag that holds the PC, the charger and some DVD holders if I want to watch a movie.
 almost a 5
 Just what I expected I should of orders two
 For the price a good laptop computer bag
 This is great bag just the right size that I was looking for. I use this bag everyday and it has held up well, I wanted something I could not over fill and this bag has just the right amount of compartments and pockets. I did look for a bag from AmazonBasics and i'm very happy this purchase.
 Its nice alot of compartments inside made very well you have a lot of room.
 Great product, great price and fast delivery
 Bought this for my dad new Amazon Fire tablet. He loves it!
 This case is beyond my expectations.  I was concerned with how it would fit my 15" Mac Book Pro.  It fits perfectly, without being too snug.  Lots of room for accessories in the various compartments.<br/><br/>What a deal!!  And absolutely can't beat the price.  I am delighted!
 Love my bag. Protects my computer and provides ample space for me to add papers and folders.
 Can't beat the price. Quality of this product is very good. Fits my iPad 2 with case and cover with room to spare. Front zippered compartment is nice and will hold the charger and cable. This case can also hold larger items like a net book of a 10 inch tablet. The material is soft but pretty stretchy. Nice work Amazon!
 Good quality well made laptop case with decent storage room for other items.<br/>I have ordered a few different AmazonBasics items and I have been happy with each of them.
 Very good bag
 Bought as a gift, it has space for pretty much everything you need to carry with your laptop. Feels very sturdy and does not feel cheaply made at all!
 This Netbook bag is just what I was looking for; it is soft-sided and lightweight, yet protective, and my 7 inch mini-tablet fits with plenty of room to spare. Extra items (the charging device, stylus, etc.) can easily be stored in both the main area and the zippered section.  I love that it has handles--- it's a convenient, effective way to protect, store, and transport the tablet.  Economical price, too --- love it!
 I purchased this case for a new 11.6-inch screen ASUS laptop.  The fit, even with the laptop in a TSA-friendly sleeve, was perfect.  The price was unbeatable and the workmanship was excellent.  I would recommend this case to other 11.6-inch laptop owners.
 nice
 I have a nice roomy Samsonite leather bag, but it's almost too large for my everyday needs. I typically use it to haul lunch, dishes and whatever else, along with my computer gear. I happened onto this Basics bag, and had been really happy with a Basics sleeve that holds my Macbook Air. The reviews were encouraging, and who can beat the price. Two days later, it showed at my doorstep. Very pleased--- easily holds my Mac, my Ipad 2, charge cords for each, an ear buds with mic cord, laser pointer and pen (inside). In the outer zip pouch, I tossed in a 2 TB portable drive and small umbrella. It all fits in great, and the padded carry strap secures with strong plastic swivel clips. There are 3 dividers inside, and I still have room for file folders, or other. Amazon has a winner with this nicely built cordura type bag. I may buy one for my wife and her Mac &amp; Ipad now.
 Works well for my intended purpose, which was to protect my SB246 drum machine.. But it smells bad. Very chemical smell coming from the bag.. Didn't notice any "State of California" warnings, but thought I'd find one..
 Very nice material and construction. Many good sized pockets.
 A super, multi-compartment tablet bag.  Also, a super price!
 Great bag for the price. Nothing I can complain about. The delivery was even more secure than the actual computer delivery was. We had to sign for it. LOL.
 Ordered one for me and one for my wife's laptop.  Can't beat the price.  The laptop bags I was looking at in other stores were at least twice as much.  I was looking for something to keep my laptop in at home so it doesn't get damaged and this was well worth it.
 So impressed with this. Made with very good material. Not made cheap. This is a must get. Purchased this for my younger son for a book bag. MUST HAVE!!!!
 Very pleased with this...lightweight and roomy.  And on top of that, it was very affordable.  I had purchased another case and didn't pay attention to the size and it was way too tight and had no place to put the cord.  But needless to say, I wasn't happy about spending more money on another case.  All's well that ends well!
 The case would be fine if it wasn't for the sloppy interior pockets.  There are inside pockets on both sides of the case which "pucker" out. They are very effective at preventing the user from actually inserting a tablet (a laptop would be worse) into the case. If there was a pocket on just one side it would be easy to simply cheat the tablet to one side when inserting. I cuss it out regularly. The rest of the case is just fine. Well made and seemingly durable.
 I am a writer and freelance marketing person, I carry a MacBook Air wherever I go. This bag is perfect for what I need.
 I like the fact that it comes with a handle and the front pocket was surprisingly large enough to fit in my 10.1 inch laptop charger as well as a few peripherals despite its small size. Great bag
 I guess I didn't read enough about this case before I purchased, because I bought it thinking it would protect my iPad air.  My iPad air does fit nicely, but the case is simply made of neoprene.  I'm keeping it however, as I ordered a shock resistant case and this will fit inside there too.
 As describe
 I thought because of price it would be cheap but it is awesome great quality very durable.
 Buy 1 size up for extra storage or a sleeve for extra protection. I have a 14" bag to carry my 11.6" laptop with a sleeve, it fits nicely with room for charger and other small stuff. This is a $13 case so don't complain it is not bullet or water proof.......
 Product was as described and it arrived on time.  I'm Happy!!
 This is a decent bag for the price as bags go, however, the strap has come unhooked on me twice, once with my Macbook in it, falling straight to the concrete and damaging my computer. Be careful with the cheap plastic strap hooks. I wouldn't go heavy with this bag.
 I gave the case to my grandson for Christmas. He said it works but seems to be a little on the small size. He does love it. He stated the quality of the product was good.
 Excellent bag for carrying laptop
 This bag easily holds my laptop, Samsung 8 tablet. All the cords plus files that I take on trips and many other items. It appears to be of very good quality and the zippers are also of very good quality. Received within 2 days and I feel this is the best bag I have found anywhere and at a very low price.
 fits my acer laptop with no problems,looks good to.
 This case was as described...roomy without bulk, sizeable interior pockets, exterior pocket, comfortable &amp; adjustible crossbody strap, with padded easy carry handles as well. The interior is padded well, again without being bulky and comfortably fit my Surface RT with keyboard and accessories. Wonderful bag with an affordable price!
 A little tight on a 15.6" when you have some nano flash drives installed. Just barely fit.  With nothing on the computer, it is fine.
 Great product. Have it a few months now I carry it everything day, no rips no signs of wear or damage.
 Exactly what I needed.  No frills bag.  Great bang for your buck.
 Very pleased
 This Hand Bag is excellent for what I intended. I purchased it to protect a Toshiba Laptop when it is being transported. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a bag and this model fell into my price range.  It is a very well made bag and has extra side pockets which is a plus to me for the price...  My recommendation if this is what you are after, buy it, you won't go wrong.
 Large enough to fit a 17"gaming laptop and to still be able to put all accessories in smaller zipper pocket. Stitching strong and sturdy to hold the weight of this laptop.
 Was as expected.
 This is of the best values ever ...
 It's a little snug on my work laptop, but my work laptop is a massive beast to be only 15". Solid bag, simple, does the job. Absolutely great for the price!
 It's a good buy and provides basic capability for transporting my 15.6" laptop. If your power brick is large, the sides will bulge because it doesn't expand much, but mine is a lightweight newer generation computer and it fits fine.
 Excellent purchase
 Bag is slim and small looking, so don't expect roomy space.
 Super small and compact but fits the MAC Air, the amazon basics 11.6 laptop sleeve around the air, and the charger and pens. Great to use when you know you only need your computer and maybe a folder to hold.
 Awesome
 Much more solid than expected for the price. Would definitely recommend.
 This replaced my old $95.00 bag - this is higher in quality than the name brand one I had - def recommend it for anyone with a small tablet or small laptop
 Very nice, impressed of this case.
 It's a basic laptop bag, but for 15 bucks, you really get your money's worth, and then some. Short on features and padding is thin, but very well constructed. Appears that it will last a long time. I would buy another in a heartbeat!
 Zipper ripped away from the pocket and one of the straps is tearing off as well. Not durable at all.
 This does not fit the Alienware R4 17.3.  It is way small.
 looks ok but lots of pockets and very helpful. Would definitely buy agaain
 Bag is well made. Unfortunately, I should have ordered one size larger for my Surface Pro and charger to fit without being too tight.
 Overall I'm super impressed with this bag- the pockets, lining, and zippers all work great. It's a great fit, holds the charger but without being rookie or tight, and is durable. I would totally stick with these bags but mine came without the shoulder strap and the handles work, but not efficiently. No strap = major inconvenience.
 Great for my large laptop.  I typically actually fit 2 laptops and a tablet in here when flying
 Bag quality exceeded expectations. Perfect for small computers/ tablets. Has many compartments for other items.
 It’s adorable!! So slim and sleek, yet carries the laptop and charger amicably!<br/>Love it!<br/>Highly recommended
 Great quality bag.  Nice design, nice feel...it comes with handles &amp; a side zipper pouch.  You can tell it's good quality with the thickness of the bag material and zippers themselves.  Got a few of these for my customers and they are all extremely happy with them for months now.
 This thing is excellent, and the price could not be better. Honestly, I don't see how Amazon can make money on this bag. The materials and construction had to cost far more than the low asking price. It holds my Samsung Galaxy Tab3 and its charger and cable, plus there's room for a cell phone, an iPod and other small stuff. It's padded pretty well and it's light grey inside so you can find your stuff. Nice!
 I've had a number of computer bags.  I use this with a tablet and it's great.  I've had it for several months now and it's wearing well.  Plenty of room for cords and accessories.  Great price, would buy again.
 Really nice functional bag for 14 inch laptop with accessories
 This 11.6 model is an incredible value for $12 and change. The shoulder strap is pretty junky and I wasn't planning on using that anyway, but if you are be advised its beyond ghetto. That minor gripe aside its 4x nicer than I expected a $12 bag to be. Another thing is there isn't a lot in the way of padding/protection, but again just letting you know, it's fine for my use.<br/><br/>I was happy to find that the large zippered compartment on the front fit my apple SuperDrive. The smaller zippered pocket fit my power brick and thin MagSafe cord. If I didn't need the SuperDrive I could have used that space for the included optional heavy 3 prong cord.<br/><br/>There is some other divided sections in the main compartment, but I couldn't speculate exactly what fits in them at this point.<br/><br/>This may not be for everyone. For me, I just wanted to keep dust off my MacBook air when not in use, and a bag to carry it somewhere if need be. I mostly use it at home so I didn't want to spend a fortune.<br/><br/>It's a genuine bargain at $12. I would have gladly paid $35-$40 for it. It's very light and made reasonably well. It's not junky/cheap looking, but it's also not a $60 bag and should not be expected to be one.<br/><br/>If I was going to be taking it from home more often I'd want a hard shell case on the MacBook and then I think the bags protection would be more than adequate.<br/><br/>I'm happy as a clam with it, sans ghetto shoulder strap which I have tossed out. Will update after more use. But bottom line, if you have the 11.6 MacBook Air, then go for it, you'll probably love it.
 This bag is light weight and meets with my exact need.  It fits both my iPad and laptop comfortably, even leaving room for a little extra.  I am satisfied with this purchase.  The price was okay.  I would always prefer cheaper but it was good.  The bag does not look cheap either.
 This is a great bag.  If you travel all the time then you may want to look for bag with more features.  If you are a Dentist (like me) and just travel with your computer two times a year for a accounting meeting or continuing education event then this is the ticket.
 great value
 A great basic case, if you are looking for a lightweight, minimal case to protect your laptop and maybe a few papers or a thin textbook. Works great for daily used, and has held up very well.
 This is a great, professional looking case that is not of cheap quality and it does that job needed.
 This is a great product.
 I absolutely love this bag.  I used it to replace my heavy leather bag and never looked back.  It's lightweight and works perfectly for transporting my laptop, notebook, charger and other items I need for my too many meetings.
 Great price - great value.  I use it for a 13" HP spectre ultrabook. The only thing I would change would be a thin, open at the top, pocket on the back where I could slip a couple of pieces of paper, tickets, etc. for quick access.
 Great bag, fits my laptop perfectly. Like that it has both a long strap for over the shoulder and smaller carrying handles. Extra pockets for storing stuff. Great price, good quality.
 This was a really good buy!! The material is thick, and seems like my laptop will be well protected. I like the versatility of the straps and the convenience to carry my laptop around
 the computer 15.6" fit well and had enough space for important documents.  the seams were sewn well and the zippers were well done.  I would recommend this product
 Previously had a much more expensive case that was stolen from me. Purchased this one in a pinch and very impressed with it. Has held up great.
 This is a good all around laptop bag.  It has plenty of storage and seems very sturdy.  It's a good value for the money as well.
 The bag is smaller than I expected. however it does fit my laptop and everything else I need. the bag construction seems to be top notch. the extra pouches really help with storage I can put my mouse my pens and other supplies. so far this has replaced my other carrying bag and would definitely recommend.
 Good
 Great product for this price.  Enough padding to protect your computer.
 Perfect for a Surface including it's power supply, pen, keyboard, and even a mouse. Quality seems good.<br/>Was also able to include the booklets and recovery thumb drives. Pretty pleased...
 This bag does the job. Ample room for the 15.9 HP Laptop. plus the cord, and the mouse and the iPad. Don't worry. and the padded strap makes it easy to carry.<br/>Amazon Basics does it again....
 Got this for my Dad's laptop. He likes it. Fits all of his laptop accessories in it.
 I had purchased another case with just (1) pocket.  I saw this case after the fact.  I returned the other one and took a hit on the shipping and got this case.  This case is just perfect.  Lots of pockets to store everything neatly and orderly.  Perfect!
 Really nice for the money. This fit my needs perfectly
 Nice case for the money!
 Just what I wanted. No frills. Great price. I like how the shoulder strap comes off.
 Excellent product..
 works great and has well designed pouches and pockets.  not exactly fashionable
 It is very easy to transport, light, and easy to acommodate with the baggage. Storage rooms are well thought. On the other hand does not feel like it will last too long...some materials should be of a better quality, specially inside.
 Great value. Lots of pockets, great design. Includes slots to insert papers and easily attaches to a suitcase.
 Liked
 I purchased this one and the 14" because I have a Dell Latitude 12 E7250 which has a 12.5" screen and some of the reviews had me worried the 11.6" wouldn't work but it worked perfectly.
 Very nice bag. Use it for my 15" screen laptop. For the price you can't beat it. It's slightly padded with a larger and a smaller pouch on the same side. I can fit my computer charger, a mouse and earphones along with my computer plus a few folders. Love it
 Nice compact baby.
 Awesome. For $10 it is everything you could ever want it to be. Seems well made and the neoprene is quality, stitching is nice, it has sturdy zippers that look like they'll last. There is even an extra zipper pouch for your power adapter. Fantastic case for a 10-11" netbook. A Macbook Air 11" would fit nicely as well.
 great bag at a great price. good for our chromebook
 Carrier made for a regular sized Tablet or IPad, rather than the IPad Mini (which is why I bought it). Not many reasonably priced carriers for that product, yet. It's a good quality product. I'll keep it for my other Tablet and keep looking for a smaller version. Though, once I get the Bluetooth Keyboard, it may be just the right size to carry it all.
 Very good case for my computer at a great price.
 Good bag, a little on the small size.
 Resistant heavy fabric, great price.
 We had received a Pandigital e-reader tablet free from Art Van last year when we purchased a sofa. We needed something to<br/>carry it and it's accessories. The bag looked good online and since the price was also good we bought it. When it came we were<br/>VERY pleased! It is of good quality and serves the purpose perfectly! Since then, Padigital went out of business so we bought a<br/>Samsung Galaxy 2 tablet. There is plenty of room for both the e-reader and the tablet. We still use the e-reader, but really enjoy the Samsung. Would highly recommend the Amazon Basics Netbook bag with handle. Can't beat the price OR the quality.
 I purchased this bag to hold my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1inch. After reading some of the reviews I was a bit worried about whether or not it would fit, but I must say that the tab, that's in a hard shell case, fit into this bag with plenty of room to spare. And an added bonus is that there is a zippered compartment to the front of the bag that easily stores the charger. The bag is so roomy that I was able to transport my 10.1 inch tablet, a friends 7 inch tablet and both of our data cables with plenty of room to spare still!
 I have used this as a travel bag for several trips and I really like it.  It is good quality, yet lightweight.  I would recommend this product.  Good looking.  Strong stitching.
 Convenient and well made laptop bag. The quality was better than I anticipated and it wasn't heavy, which made traveling really comfortable.
 Works well except the shoulder pad is a bit annoying. Will remove .
 So far so good. My 15.6 inch lap fits perfect, along with textbooks, chargers, pens/pencils, notebooks...
 Perfect size for my husband's laptop. Comfortable straps, too.
 I was trying to decide between three laptop cases and this won out in the end because of the price and because I was curious as to how well-made what an Amazon-branded product is.<br/><br/>I love it. It's a simple inconspicuous case that's light and sturdy and padded.There are multiple compartments and pockets to stuff full of electronics. My only complaint is the inner lining. They sound like crumpled paper and I fear one day I'll put a hole in it.
 This is a very nice bag for the price. I used it often,  everything fits nicely (ie: pc, power supply,  mouse,  game controller). There's also a front pocket that I don't use much, it's large enough for paperwork or the like but I only store flash drives in it.
 Very Limited protection<br/>Bag is OK. Price is OK. Design is not OK<br/>There is not enough padding if you drop your tablet inside the bag. To be more specific, not enough petting on the edges.<br/>If you are not concern about tablet protection, then it good bag.
 Heck of a lot of space, perfect for my 17in gaming laptop, and it fits literally every accessory I have in my possession. I could probably live out of this case if I wanted to, raise a family of four with all this space!
 Perfect for a macbook pro. I like this bag a lot, and have had not problems or issues with it. The design and pockets are very handy.
 Such a good bag. There is three main compartments with 2 mini ones in the laptop compartment aswell. Feels like its cushioned at the bottom so if you put it down with a laptop inside it should be ok. Good quality straps also.<br/>Should cost over 40 to be honest. Laptop fits very nicely
 Seriously LOVE my new laptop bag. For as cheap in price as it was, I was expecting lower quality. But I was very wrong. This is a hell of a steal at such a great deal. I've always been a bit of an Amazon fanboy, but this really sealed the deal. So much storage room with multiple pockets and very well-made.
 A true value and its function is reliable.
 Another great quality Amazon Basics product!  I'm able to fit my 13" MacBook Air, it's charging cable, small external hard drive, flashlight, handcuffs, small notepad and pens and other random accessories with ease and I don't feel like I'm taxing the durability of the case.  I highly recommend this product.
 This is an excellent quality computer bag and my 11.6" computer fits in it perfectly with plenty of room for a wireless mouse.
 The clips for the shoulder strap look a little iffy but we'll see how they hold. The bag has more space than I expected. It is a little too roomy for my macbook pro but it's not much of an issue. There are tons of pockets and really the only thing that feels or looks a little cheap is the clips I mentioned before. Great bag for the price!
 Very high quality and well made case!
 Bought to use as something of a work briefcase, and it's perfect.
 It's a decent case but it barely holds the Dell E6420 which has a 14.1 screen. Plus there isn't a pocket to pack a wireless mouse. I realize it wasn't advertised to have such a thing, but I still thought it would be a bit more spacious. I'm not out much money, so I'm okay with it but I'll still be replacing it at some point.
 good convenient size... not too big, not too small.... just right..
 Well worth my time and money!
 I use this bag daily with my chromebook. After about 4 months the strap has become torn and probably will not last for much longer, as it rips more and more each day. It still protects my chromebook very well, so I may just use the handles instead of the strap from now on.
 I love this case for my iPad <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/AmazonBasics-Netbook-Bag-with-Handle-Fits-7-to-10-Inch-Netbooks-iPad-Black/dp/B002VPE1Q6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AmazonBasics Netbook Bag with Handle, Fits 7- to 10-Inch Netbooks, iPad (Black)</a> My iPad fits perfectly.  What I really like about it is that the iPad goes in and out really easy. Not too tight and not too much room that it is sliding around.<br/><br/>The pouch on the outside is useful and keeps my iPad charger, Palm Pre Plus and charger (which I use as my wi-fi hotspot and my other cell phone all handy in one convenient place without anything scratching my iPad screen.<br/><br/>It is lightweight and easy to carry.  I just had an emergency and had to fly across the country at a moments notice.  Having everything right in one spot was a lifesaver and so easy during airport layovers, sitting in hospital waiting rooms and hotels.  People were commenting on my case and how streamlined it was, something that I have never had happen before.<br/><br/>I did purchase this product because a friend had one and said it was great.  Reading the other reviews hastened my decision to purchase it and I have never regretted my purchase.
 Cheap and convenient. I don't like the shoulder strap, the material is really cheap and low quality. The fabric of the bag is really nice, the bag is perfect for 10" - 11" laptops. You can put some other small stuff as well.
 Great
 Exactly the right size and capacity for my purpose. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/AmazonBasics-11-6-Inch-Laptop-and-Tablet-Bag/dp/B00DUGZFA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AmazonBasics 11.6-Inch Laptop and Tablet Bag</a>
 Excelent
 Ok
 This is really a well made, heavy duty tablet case.  I purchased it to put my "ASUS Transformer Book T100TA" touchscreen laptop into.  This size case offers just enough extra room without being a tight fit.  There are plenty of dividers and pockets to put cords, chargers, manuals, etc. into.  Great buy!
 needed a bag for my ipad air 2, didnt want to spend too much .. found this little gem.. perfect solution for my ipad. carry my charger, styus, cleaning pad from targus and my external batter from jackery.. love this thing !!
 Works
 I havent used it. Its not what Im looking for, not their fault. Product as advertised.
 Perfect fit
 Great bag!!
 its a case... works fine
 This bag is the perfect size for an iPad or in my case an iPad 1 and an iPad 2.  This bag is large enough to hold both iPads in their cases with a little room to spare.  The extra pocket is perfect for holding a micro fiber cloth to clean the screens.  The way that the zippers work makes it very easy to insert or remove an iPad.  This is a well made product that is exactly what I was looking for.
 Attractive but cheaply made and uncomfortable. Mine ripped within a week of normal use commuting to work on the train. I should've just spent the extra few bucks and gotten something that wasn't total garbage
 This is  a really nice, roomy messenger bag - not too big,not too small.  It is of better quality than I was expecting. I would definitely purchase other AmazonBasics products if they are like this.  You can't go wrong!
 Bought for my wife she loves it. Plenty of room for iPad and all accessories.
 These bags were the best investment for my grandsons.  They are always losing their DS games, cartridges, their kindle, ear buds, etc...all that techy fun stuff that kids need these days..which they cannot keep up with.  I had the bags monogrammed with their initials, and now everything they need to keep themselves entertained is easily contained in this handsome bag.  Nothing gets lost now.  We love his gag...and the price was so right!
 I originally was very pleased with this Laptop Bag when it first arrived and into our infrequent need for it's use.  We didn't have need to use it very often in the 6 months we owned it, yet after just a few uses, a section of the zipper recently "buckles" and we couldn't get the bag open.  Of course our laptop was in it and we ended up having to use scissors to cut open the bag and get our laptop out.  I'm debating if I will try ordering another of these bags and try again...or look at something else.  I did like the bag and the price was good...but maybe it's the saying "you get what you pay for?"
 Great. Has a lot of pockets and compartments. Lots of room for all my office stuff as well as my laptop. Cushions well too.
 Good quality. I've had it 3 years now and it still feels new. I like the compartments for organizing my things. Feels a little like a briefcase, so I don't hesitate to take it to work meetings. Have traveled around the country with it. I'm glad I purchased it.
 Surpassed my expectations.
 A great value, basic laptop bag. Nylon material is a little lightweight and I wonder how it will hold up in use, but being light has it's advantages too. I like the fact that the inside is a light gray color - makes seeing  inside the pockets easy.
 The laptop bag is an excellent value.  Held our laptop, AC adaptor, Wireless Mouse, Kindle Fire, Train Tickets, and assorted other charging cables, papers, etc.  Used it on a 12 day train trip and couldn't be more pleased.  It's sturdy, well built and never failed to provide protection.  It's a good deal.
 I'm very happy with this case. I wanted something to protect my new Microsoft Surface Pro and hold the power cable and other tiny accessories. This fits the bill! The zippers are high quality, the handle feels substantial, and the front zippered pocket is perfect for the power adapter, pen and a portable mouse. All at an unbeatable price. And the orange inside is a nice touch!
 Does the job, seems well constructed.
 The bags are a great value. I use them in particular for the 13in Samsung Chromebook 3 devices. They fit perfectly. The build quality is great, and they included enough padding to keep the devices safe. I highly recommend for an affordable laptop bag.
 Just right
 Perfect Size for My Son's Dell 11.6 Laptop!!
 Nice. Plenty of compartments. Love it. Classy, pretty, and sturdy. Love love love love love love love love love! :)
 Very nicely made and handsome, too. Good value for the money.
 Best
 So much nicer than I expected!  I have since purchased several AmazonBasics products and was more than happy with the quality not to mention the outstanding price.
 Another home run for AmazonBasics. A well-made, simple, well-organized, no-nonsense laptop bag for a great price.
 Beautiful, sturdy, just what I needed. Fits my dell xps 13 just right. However, it is a teeny bit too small for a regular sized binder
 This bag is simple, yet sturdy. It has just enough room for my computer and, for the cost, I couldn't have gotten a better bag.
 I get a lot of nice compliments on the bag!
 No complaints about the bag so far. I needed it in a hurry to travel by plane. Worked fine. Not so sure about the quality of the fabric over time, but for what I paid it’s fine.
 Great bag, fits all my accessories too.
 Was a gift for my hubby, he loves it
 My father uses this to put his iPad, and books and so far it is a good product, he doesn't use it everyday, and has it for about 2 months so I can not tell about durability. But so far, it is a good product, not too heavy, enough pockets for pens and papers.
 Grate little bag
 For the price, slimmer quality case! Still has plenty of room and decent padding. Obviously my 12.5" laptop fits perfect (in 15.6 case)  ..Older bulkier 15" laptops may not fit well in this case.
 The bag is too small for a 15.6 laptop, you need the bigger size. Check dimensions before ordering.<br/>The bag itself is of high quality, the seller and the packaging were good, it's just that the size is wrong.
 As someone who has always had a desktop computer and just recently purchased their first laptop, this case is shockingly good. I've always had great experiences with AmazonBasics brand, buying cords and HDMI cables from this brand, but wasn't sure what to expect from such an inexpensive laptop case. Build quality of the case is excellent, very compact yet roomy enough to fit your computer and the charger and an external HDD easily. If anyone is on the fence, buy it. This is the first laptop case I've ever purchased, and I don't see any reason to buy another one.
 This bag is low-cost, yet well-made and functions as described.  It is perfect for schlepping my 17.3 inch HP Envy Laptop between my main residence and vacation residence.  It is light-weight and does not take up a lot of extra space.
 Gift for my son, but he liked the size and durability for travel.
 Excellent quality computer bag for an amazing value.  Fit everything I needed like a glove and with some room to spare.
 In the 14" version I am carrying a Macbook Pro 13, Razer Blade 14, and iPad air. The chargers for all three easily fit in the outer pocket. All at the same time! It's the perfect size for an easy no-struggle fit, with just the right number of dividers for what I needed.
 Really nice I like it very much
 Thank You.
 This bag works pretty well. I am concerned about some of the reviews on it with the shoulder bag breaking but it does have a handle that you can use.
 A good case for the money. Our widescreen HP laptop fit fine along with some accessories. It's not as well padded as our other case but at 1/4 the price it was an acceptable trade off. We never travel by plane, if you do I would recommend a heavier case.
 fits laptop just fine
 Chemical smell from the case won't go away, and it's been weeks now since I bought it.  Also, too much extra space when I put my iPad Air2 with full case in it.
 Nice bag. Not a lot of padding. But serves the purpose. Reasonably priced.
 We had an older PC and it was too thick to fit into one of the sleeves now on the market.  This works out well and the price was much less than offered elsewhere.
 It's roomy, and has got plenty of space inside and out. Grey inside of the bag. Admittedly it is a little thin, but I'm not flinging my stuff around night and day, so I'm fine with the lesser padding. It's a very low key bag.
 If you're looking for a simple well designed netbook bag you can't go wrong with this one.<br/><br/>To me it's padded "just right" and snuggly holds my Acer or Samsung netbook. I just purchased one to hold my brother's Gateway netbook.<br/><br/>I've had mine for some months and it's held up well to the abuse I can accidently dish out.
 Great laptop bag. Nice quality. Perfect for our laptop
 Very nice laptop bag
 Very nice.  Well made.  No frills but this bag gives me all I need.
 Protects my laptop perfectly.
 Sturdy.
 Excelent quality and inexpensive i bougth 2
 It could be just a little bit bigger ,otherwise it's fine.
 Good quality but MSI Titan 17" can not fit in.
 Quality case for the price. Still in great condition after months of use!
 I bought this to use for my chromebook and I love it. Its a perfect fit and isn't too bulky when I'm out walking from place to place. There is always a small notepad, pen, and headphones with me in this bag. After all that, I can still fit my charger, if need be, in here.
 Way too small, it is advertised as to hold a 13" laptop and your devices but it doesn't. They fit very tide and my stuff got scratched. I am returning it.
 GOOD, fits my Laptop perfectly. Like the quality and lots of bang for the buck, two thumbs up Amazon :)
 Great bag. My laptop fits in it perfectly along with mouse, headphones, some papers and charger. The only con is the strap it has a really cheap plastic parts holding it together so it can't be to heavy or they will break. Besides that its awesome for the price!
 This is an awesome bag! It fits my Acer Aspire really well. I can put papers and accessories in it with ease. I have to walk with a cane which only gives me one hand to carry things, the shoulder strap is long enough where it easily goes over my head and shoulders so I can carry it.
 The bag is simple, but I'm impressed nonetheless. There are enough pockets for the Chromebook, and for the charger, as well as a couple for miscellaneous other items. I'm surprised how much use the whole kit gets.
 well made. sturdy. exterior side pocket (vertical zipper).  a great price compared to brick &amp; mortar stores. plenty of room for a 10 inch tablet plus some extra cords &amp; a collapsible tablet stand.  orange interior color. i'm pleased.
 Good quality and adequately padded for laptop protection.  Highly recommend.
 Satisfied with product!
 Looks very substantial.  I bought as a gift for my grandson, he seems fine with it! Price is great!
 Need this bad for my new job. Happy to get one cheap. I’ve used it every day. No issues.
 I recently purchase this case/bag for my brand new iPad Air after reading so many great reviews about it here.  I was very disappointed when I received in the mail.  The quality of the bag isn't bad, and its price is very good.  However, the size is simply too large for iPad Air (even with Smart Case and Logitech Keyboard Case on).  I think it's misleading to put iPad Air in the title just because an iPad can be store in it.  It's simply not designed to hold the iPad.<br/><br/>If you are planning to buy this bag for a larger(wider) than iPad tablet or Netbook, I think it is worth the money.<br/>However, if you are like me and looking for a bag specially for the iPad Air, then this is NOT the one.<br/><br/>I have to give Amazon credit for their awesome customer service!  They refunded me immediately after I expressed my disappointment.
 I have used this bag for months and months and it still works wonders! I love this bag and it's affordable. I recommend this for anyone who needs a compact messenger bag.
 I had my doubts about whether this would fit an 11.6" laptop, but its perfect for the Asus KA200 11.6. Just enough room for your power supply/charger cord, a small mouse, and boarding passes.  OK, and a few pieces of paper. Well made, perfect.
 For a cheap bag its designed really well and its sturdy. Has the main storage which has a sleeve in and several smaller zipper pouches that have sleeves as well. Really good for carrying a laptop plus accessory, such as phone, tablet and the like.
 I like the bag and have been happy with it for the price.  I don't like how the loopy things that the strap hooks into don't stay in place which bugs me sometimes, but it has been a great bag overall.
 Seems ok for the price
 I purchased this bag for my new iPad air 2. It's perfect! It has plenty of room for things like the charger cord and earphones in their own separate zippered compartment. Notepads fit nicely so long as they are not too large. The zippered compartment in the front is great for storing my iPhone. It's well-made and good looking!
 I've probably had this for 7-8 months now and carry this many places with my ipad inside.  it is generous enough to also hold a book. and I keep a screen cleaner and pen in the adjacent pocket.  It has a nice size zipper that seems robust enough to last for years to come.  It is still in perfect shape.
 Great laptop bag for my Lenovo Y50 15.6" I am able to store my power cable and a full size mouse and mouse pad for the computer along with a tablet and coloring books, etc for my little girl when going on trips.
 The shoulder cusion could be more padded. But the compartments are nice and decently sized. Perfect for me.
 Very nice. Big compartment fits asus c200ma chromebook perfect. Plus a 10" netbook ( asus 1000he) fits in the middle compartment.<br/>And still that leaves the front compartment to put stuff in. So, 2 laptop bags in one.
 This little laptop case is actually quite nice. Seems durable, and the build quality is solid.
 Perfect fit for my Toshiba 17.3 inch laptop.  Padding could be a little thicker to accommodate today's thinner laptops, however I am very happy with this product. Front pocket easily stores the power supply without bulging. Two interior pockets for cs, documents, etc.  If you don't need a full briefcase and just want protection for your laptop as I did then this is the product to buy. Very sturdy construction and lots of padding.  Equal in quality to bags I've paid over $40.00 for.
 Durable, light and compact enough for light travel. I could fit in my Sony headphones which are pretty bulky along with the macbook pro, charger and a foreign plug adapter.
 I bought a new laptop, it needs a new Laptop Bag.  I wish it had metal clips instead of plastic, but for what it is, I like this bag.  Thanks AmazonBasics.
 Good
 nice quality (fit and finish), looks nice too. just roomy enough for a 14.1 laptop. amazon basics never lets me down.<br/>no complaints at all with this case.just enough room and compartments for light travel and well padded. go for it.
 I always carry my laptop like a suitcase so I can't say anything bad about the bag. But because of my deep fear that one day I'll drop it, I shoved some old pajama pants in there for extra padding. Works like a charm.
 +9
 Perfect fit and can't be beat for the price!
 This if perfect for my laptop and has just enough pockets. Not too many but not too little. All around great case.
 Holds up good
 excellent quality bag
 I bought this in July 2014, it is coming apart now in September 2015 (shoulder strap attachment area is breaking off), so I got more than a year of use out of this. Not too bad. However, the padding is really inadequate for any serious laptop, it is completely unpadded at each of the corners. It's a miracle my laptop hasn't been damaged by this, I have had to be super careful.<br/><br/>Buy a bag with protection at the corners, this is where most of the stress will concentrate if you happen to drop it.
 Perfect for carrying our new DBPOWER portable DVD player.  Stores everything in one place so it's easy to grab when we're ready to go camping.
 Perfect size, perfect price
 My HP 15.6 Laptop fits in. But cannot zip. Because corners will not fit in. But still works for carrying laptop and I-pad. For the price was good.
 wonderful case, not flasy but does the job\, I was surprised have nice it was.
 Works prefect as a bible case!
 Good for iPad
 This is a great value for the money.  It holds my Lenovo Thinkpad E545 and the pockets have plenty of room for accessories and miscellaneous items I need to carry.  It's worth more than they charge which makes it a terrific deal.  I will update if I have any issues.
 I love this laptop carrier bag. I use it very often and it does a great job of protecting my laptop!
 It needs a little room room, if you want the power chord for your 11 inch laptop to go in this bag also.  Seems to be well made though.  I guess I will be purchasing a bigger bag, not work cost of shipping this one back.  Would probably be OK for 10 inch laptop and power chord
 Great computer and iPad bag. Love the material and very durable.
 Great product
 The bag is nice but the shoulder strap pad ripped within two weeks of use.
 Everything you need at a great price
 I bought this to carry my Sylvania DVD player in. It's a tight squeeze, but I can get the it in there, but can't zip it up. So, I decided to carry my KindleFire in it instead. There is plenty of room for the Kindle and the charging cord, so I'm happy. I can always stream shows through Prime on the Kindle.
 Lint magnet. Looked awful within a half hour of taking it out of the shipping package. And it developed those ugly pilt things, or whatever they are called, all over all its cloth parts, which is most of the bag's exterior.
 Love this bag has all the pockets i need and fits my huge Asus Rog G751JT very snug, I use it daily for work commute, I wouldn't drop it on the ground while carrying my laptop but it's good enough for me.
 The padding and look isn't as solid as I thought it would be, I think getting a computer bag from targus or something on sale for 15 would definitely have better quality. Seems easy to use, zippers and packaging aren't a pain, just not as good as I thought because the photo looks much better.
 had it for four years an still works great
 Nice size for carrying manuscripts. I was looking for something on the smaller size. This does the trick. I was concerned that the Amazon product patch would take away from the look of the bag, but it's not very noticeable.
 Works as described.  Well padded.
 Well made sturdy bag.  Excellent product at a low cost. Better quality than bags I have looked at that cost a lot more money.
 Excellent! Fit perfect my laptop
 If you want a bag to hold your surface pro 3, mouse, charge cable and still have room for some misc computer gizmos, this is the one.  It is very sturdy, has a ton of storage spots for various gear, pens, etc. The shoulder strap is removable if you want more of a briefcase system.
 Needed a case for my mom's netbook. This was the lowest price available. The padding (neoprene?) is the same as the other name brands such as Targus/Caselogic. The zipper pulls are easy to use and are a soft plastic material. The zippers work fine and the handles are padded. Shipping was fast and the frustration free packaging really is frustration free. Couldn't be more happy with the purchase.
 Good bag roomy but not oversized at all, simple efficient design, good price quality seems good or better, can see no downside.
 Love it. Bought to bring my iPad on the airplane, worked better than I expected.
 Good design but not durable. Lasted about 8 months before zipper fell apart because the stitching that keeps the teeth aligned came loose from everyday wear and tear. Giving this 3 stars since the price is unbeatable but beware. Won't last long under normal use.
 Lightweight and easy to carry.
 Very good basic case for my new laptop
 Lots of room incl. Chromebook, Charger, Cables and Phone. Works as described.
 Works great, fits my laptop perfectly and the pockets fit everything else I need. I've used it for two college semesters so far and it still looks as new as day one.
 Great case! Especially if you are traveling! You can carry it over your shoulder like a purse! Makes it easy to tote around especially if you got more than one thing to carry and it keeps my chrome book safe!
 PROTECTS MY LAPTOP F/DUST &amp; DIRT
 Good bag.
 Works great. The bag feels like good material and protects my laptop. I like the two extra zipper pockets in addition to where the laptop goes to store a notebook and other materials. Overall I am pretty impressed with this Amazon Basics bag.
 Just want I was looking for to hold a 17.3 laptop as efficiently and inexpensively as possible.  Good bargain and less cumbersome from the more expensive one that I bought for the other 17.3 laptops that I have.
 Well built
 Good price
 I bought this so I was not carrying a bookbag to client meetings. Within only a few uses the laptop strap had ripped. Disappointing. Proves that you get what you pay for.
 Laptop fits well and I like the extra storage pockets on the front.
 Stylish
 It has a lot of space in it. It fits my 15.6 inch laptop, charger, 2 notebooks, a large planner, with tons a room to spare. The shoulder strap isn't the most comfortable but that isn't a deal breaker for me.
 Great little bag. It holds my ipadAir2 inside with room to spare, and I can put my chargers, spare power, sunglasses and small wallet in the side pocket.  zippers are strong and open smoothly. Great product at a great price.
 Shoulder strap ripped after two weeks
 like it
 Don’t expect too much
 Live these laptop bags. I bought them for my teenagers so they would stop laying their computer on their bed and actually put it in a safe place. They like the cases and now they even use them to bring their computers to friends houses. I am ordering one for myself now, too!
 Good for the price
 Excellent, light well built. One star down for size it is really 13".<br/>Love that it has a place to put the shoulder strap when not in use.
 One of the best bags I have ever purchased!!
 for my needsPerfect
 Light weight &amp; plenty of room for the laptop I purchased through amazon a 15.6 inch. Many spaces to carry other items too. Great construction &amp; easy to wipe clean.
 Excellent!
 the plastic strap brackets made me nervous when I;m carrying around a $700 laptop with no cushion around it.  Ok for what it is.
 This is exactly what I was looking for. Nice bag for my 15.6 inch laptop and accessories. I do not think you can beat this value.
 Bought this along with a neoprene laptop case. I expected the neoprene to better fit my needs. Turns out it was too big for the laptop. This case fits my HP 13" laptop perfectly! It also has room in the side pocket for my I-pad and plenty of room for the other charging type accessories you need. I didn't want a big laptop bag (that's why I initially chose the neoprene). This bag is much smaller/compact than it looks. It also provides more padding for protection. The quality seems great for such a low cost too. Highly recommend it!
 Création value and exactly what I needed.  Compact but pas extra storage.
 Perfect
 Its well cushioned, but compact. Fits the 15inch Laptop perfectly with additional compartments.
 The bag itself is great but the padded shoulder strap is really bad, already loosing the stitches.
 Could appear fragile but works well. Been using it for a month or so daily. Starting to wear off though.
 Update on March 3, 2017. Subsequent to my prior review, I invoked the Amazon warranty process and received the usual excellent service. Within 2 days the replacement had arrived and is now being used. I have modified the rating from 1 star to 3 stars ... still disappointed that I had to go through this.<br/>I had purchased this same laptop bag from Amazon a few years ago and was quite satisfied with the quality and functionality. After years of daily use, the zipper to the main compartment of my old bag started failing so I purchased a new replacement on December 10, 2016. The new bag arrived on time; but I decided to keep using the old bag for as long as possible and I finally declared it had reached the end of its useful life this past weekend. Today, Monday February 13, 2017 I used the new bag for the first time and transferred the laptop and accessories from the old bag to the new one this morning. On picking up this new bag by its carrying handles (not by the strap), one end of one of the handles simply detached from the bag as if it had not been properly sewn in place. I have just checked the order online and find that the return eligibility window for this item closed on January 31, 2017.<br/>I am usually a satisfied Amazon customer; but in this instance I an very disappointed with the quality of the product and options for return of a dud.
 I am amazed at what this bag can pack in it.. This really is a bag to go..I keep mine packed and ready at all times since my job has me on the road so much. Amazon hit a home run with this bag.
 Basic, but does the job, roomy for my 15.6 Dell Inspiron w/sleeve.
 These are great!  Got 4 of them and they work terrific for day trips with the computer when you don't want to haul everything with you.  The only issue has been the zippers which seem to snag, so far they have not failed.. just have to move them slowly!
 fits lop top and all my extras
 I bought a bunch of these for small detachable computers and while the fit the computer fine, there's not much room for a charger and/or bluetooth mouse.  Get the 14.1 size, you'll be a lot happier you did.
 Holds quite a lot more than just a lap top! I can fit multiple sketchbooks or a college textbook in it. The straps have been holding up fairly well considering I have been carrying​ this bag all across the country.
 Works great for what I needed it for. It does the job well. A great choice for a case/bag for a 15.6'' laptop. I highly recommend this. 5 stars from a very happy customer.
 Now that I'm going back to school, I needed to get a laptop....and of course, I need a bag that can hold a 13" MacBook Pro, charging cables, thumb drives, and two texts.  Perfect size bag for what I need!
 Basic bag for basic use. Havent had any issues
 This bag is perfect for my BOSS BR-800 digital recorder.  I love it.  It would be perfect for a small laptop or netbook.  This HAS to be made by Case Logic.  It looks and feel just like my more expensive CL Bags/Backpacks.  Thank you, Amazon, for making high quality available at a great price.
 This one didn't fit my Toshiba computer-off by less than an inch but I bought the next size up 14.1 and love it! there is about 2 inches all around, extra inside my new one (14.1) but at least this way I am not ripping it trying to shove my computer in it
 I am using this to carry my chromebook to meetings. It has several compartments to store items and is light to carry.
 Good
 Just a basic bag with not many frills for the price. Fits my 17.3 inch laptop just fine. For the price, this is a nice bag to carry a laptop and a few other items.
 Very good quality...perfect for intended use. Size was as ordered. Would buy again in a heartbeat...
 great laptop bag! I've used it for a long time now and it works very well!
 When small is expected we downgrade a lot of things.  Not in case of this product, it does justice by giving you lot of space without adding the bulk of weight.  I bought this for my Asus T-100 and it holds the tablet, its keyboard, mouse, external hdd, power unit in the main pockets.  Apart from that it also has additional pockets for key rings, pen, notepad and other things.  It is still light and easy to handle around.  The only improvement could be with lot of travelling around, I fear the plastic buckles of the shoulder strap may not be able to last long.  It would be better if replaced with metal.<br/><br/>Thanks Amazon once again.
 Received package earlier than shipment date, so that was great. Product is very well made and it holds my Chromebook 11 and a 7" Tablet nicely and secure. Plenty of room for chargers, cell phone and stylis pens as well. Plus additional slots for a pad of paper or whatever small items you may need to carry on a trip.
 So speaking of bags, I recently got this. Not only was it just $8 it's also made well, lightweight, and fits an iPad and my Kindle and still has room for extras in a relatively large and well hidden outside pocket. Hugely functional, very small and the large and smooth zipper alone must've cost $8. Awesome bag if you don't carry too many things around.<br/><br/>Amazon, you're still keeping it real!
 What a great case for my MacBook Air. It's simple yet perfect for my laptop and all the gadgets I have to use with it.
 This is a really nice laptop bag that fits our laptop perfectly and has a good number of pockets to store accessories.  Seems high quality and exactly what I wanted.
 The bag is nice and if you don't have to carry around too many things it would be good. It is small and light. I returned it though because it would not accommodate all my electronics and cables. I had to choose bag with more compartments, which unfortunately is more bulky.
 Wonderful case for that much money, suits my needs perfectly.
 Perfect for my I pad air and lots of storage for misc.
 This is a great little netbook bag. It fits my 10" Asus netbook perfectly. The handles are a nice plus and make it easier to carry around. It seems to be made well and the zippers work fine. I like the front pocket because it's big enough to hold the charger and a memory stick without a problem. The color on the inside is Amazon.com orange, not my first choice, but it's on the inside, so not a big deal. Overall I like the bag very much.
 I was skeptical of a bag made by Amazon, I have been converted. This bag is very light, has pockets that hold everything that you would need. It seems to be very well made. I have the Targus 45 dollar bag, this one is much better. I might order a second one for my work lap top.
 I highly recommend this bag.  There are compartments to store items it is just the right size to hold my DVD player safely.  It is easy to carry making compact several items
 Bought product about 6 months ago and initially loved it. It has now started ripping in multiple places. Good for the price, just not very strong material if you use often.
 I had purchased a new case from a chain store when got my new laptop. It cost about 3 times what this one does and wasn't nearly as roomy. That one didn't last a year before the shoulder strap came apart. When I found this on Amazon, it was just what I wanted and at a great price too.
 Feels sturdy, and it needs to be because I will be using it a lot. I really wanted something with a handle so that I can feel secure I won't drop it. And the handle seems like it is going to last.
 I LOVE this bag....it was an outstanding deal.  It hold my chromebook, a 7" tablet (in a case), a mouse pad, a wireless mouse and it's usb, plus all the charging cables, a cleaning cloth and styluses.  I would highly recommend this product!
 Nice lightweight bag that I can easily carry my laptop with enough compartments to carry files plus disks.
 Well made laptop carrier. Roomy enough for a 17 incher. Has several convenient pockets and a shoulder strap which I haven't needed to use yet,<br/>but glad to know I have it.
 Unless you don't mind your tablet moving around a lot in this bag, get something that is specifically designed for a non Apple product. The bag is built good for the price, but my 10" Samsung Tablet does not fit snuggly, and moves around too much. So the rating on this bag is a good one, but just not what I purchased the bag for. Probably good for Apple products as it fits much better, but not for Samsung products, and definitely too big for anything 9" or lower.
 Its a simple laptop case and it works well.  Good price and functionality.  Only reasons for 4 stars is because there really isn't room for the charger.
 For the price this bag is a good value. Quality materials were used and has a good amount of space for storage. Has two pockets which are zippered shut, the zippers are easy to open and shut. Holds my tablet with room to spare in the main pocket. Secondary pocket has enough space to store my charger and headphones. Perfect for carrying your tablet<br/>and its accessories with you.
 just what I needed for church
 I love this case
 My husband likes this bag for the price.  It has all the pockets, padding and straps of more expensive bags.  He uses it around home and traveling in our motor-home.  Would by again.
 very comfortable to carry laptop, I like it
 Easily one of the best laptop bags I have ever had. It is slim, and yet fits my Lenovo Thinkpad T-420 laptop snugly, my tablet, a few folders with papers, and my phone - along with the connection cables for the devices. A good construction and waterproof, too. A perfect bag for the go.
 light-weight, flexible and multiple compartments
 Great value. Nicely made with plenty of room for my notebook computer and accessories. The material seems to be durable, good amount of padding, the stitching is good, and the handles are strong. I couldn't ask for more.
 Really impressed with the quality. Got my laptop, external hard drive, wireless mouse, cords and paper documents to fit comfortably.
 I bought this for my Asus 12 inch Chromebook to use when we go on vacation and the computer fits it well. There is a pocket large enough to carry the included charger. Appears to be of high quality material and seems to be constructed well.
 Product is very thin, basically a bag to carry the laptop in, but does not provide much protection.  Very minimal padding and no padded slot for laptop
 This laptop bag is so amazing. For the price its a steal of a deal. Many compartments. Its light weight, not padded but its not bulky and with the many compartments, both Laptop and Tablet together with additional cables can all fit well.<br/><br/>Its comfortable and I love it.
 Good quality, good price.
 Don't use it that much. But happy with it when I do use it.
 Best laptop case I've ever owned. Everything fits nicely. The bag is well made, compact, and very light in weight. It's a pleasure to carry. I continue to be amazed at the value of the Amazon Basics brand. I definitely recommend it.
 Works great for a laptop carying bag
 I've used this daily for over six months now and it continues to exceed my expectations.  Just enough room for all of my many extras (power cord, mifi, hdmi cord, extension cord, work specific forms, pens, etc.) with out ever being bulky. When I felt how light it was I was worried about durability, but so far it is performing just as well (if not better) than the much more expensive swiss gear case I had.
 Great case for a netbook or chromebook, would have gave 5 stars but the pictures showed 3 spots for external drives and case only has 2 no big deal but don'e show me 3 and only give me 2.  Given the quality for the price I would highly recommend it.
 I have the Zagg keyboard/iPad case on my iPad 3 and it still fits in this case with room to spare!  I am also able to store the iPad cable in the side pocket, and even tuck my iPhone into the side pocket - fits nicely!  Initially purchased 2, but like this so well, have purchased more for other devices.  Highly recommended!!
 I use it for my Surface Pro 4.  it's light weight and can hold/fit everything I need inside...
 A few missing aspects, no umbrella pocket for example, my 17.9 work laptop fits with an inch to spare total.  very nice bag, they've almost got everything I want in a bag, and that's good enough. very much worth it.
 Purchased these for my children and they are very durable.
 this is a great little case with lots of room, made well and my 11.6" laptop fits great in it . zippered side pockets were a great concept add on by amazon to store corda and other accessories in ...Can't go wrong with this purchase, very pleased.
 I bring this to work everyday and love it.  It fits nicely around my full-sized iPad and a small notepad that I bring along with it.  The pocket holds my stylus and a pen--but could easily hold more items if need be.  It had a slight odor when I first took the product out of the plastic but that went away pretty quickly.
 perfect fit my 17 inc lartop
 Very satisfied with product and transaction!
 I use this for my dell inspiron. There's tons of room for charging cables, etc.
 Great bag. Read other reviews about strap breaking at clip. I had to load this bag much heavier than I wanted to -- equivalent to 3x weight of 17.3 inch notebook + power supply + accessories. I was careful. Bag worked great.
 This is  fantastic bag I have purchased two of these bags ,one for myself and one for a gift !
 I am able to fit all of my laptop accessories inside.
 It is small. The pictures indicate something else.
 Have had it for a month now, and it works just fine.
 Great computer bag and a great price!!
 Just got mine today; really nice sharp looking bags; great texture-material which I'm sure will last a long time, plus a good price too.
 Really nice carry bag.
 AmazonBasics  perfect size💻💼
 Excellent low-cost laptop bag with good padding and extra inside/outside pockets, and carries my 13" Macbook comfortably.  Would be perfect if it had a pen/pencil pouch.
 Bag is a perfect fit for my Lenovo laptop and accessories. Sturdy zippers and enough pockets inside.
 Execelent quality, especially for the $. Very pleased with size and features.
 Great case for carring/storing my MacBook Air.  Provides ample protection for my Mac while, at the same time, providing me with enough compartments to place the power cord, and other peripheral devices such as an external DVD/CD drive, smart card reader, etc.
 Bag holds my netbook, power supply, and wireless mouse.<br/>It is a little too big, though. A bag for 7-10" netbooks should fit a 10" snug. This one is about 1.5" taller than the netbook, so there is an unnecessary amount of space left over in the main compartment. Not a deal breaker, but annoying IMHO.<br/><br/>Zippers are nice and big, and feel of good quality (I would have preferred velcro, but that is a personal preference). The material feels soft and supportive. Handles are useful. Overall, I am pleased.
 I've had this bag for about a year now and I would say it's alright. My laptop is 11.6 inches and it fits snugly in here. There is barely room for my mouse and charger; I have to force the zipper closed when I want more than my laptop to fit in here. Overall it's not a bad bag, I just wish it were a little bigger so that items that are typically carried with a laptop (i.e. charger) actually fit without having to force them in.
 Perfect
 It's just what I wanted, size, features, etc!
 Excellent case for rough conditions.  Nice pocket in front.
 Works great plenty of room for big laptop and stuff!
 Great bag. Cool design and good amount of space to save stuff.
 Good quality bag fits a 13.3" chromebook perfectly. Enough pockets to store charger, mouse and more. It's lightly padded but I like how lightweight it is. Great price point for a great product.
 Very good computer case.  Thank you Amazon!
 I put my Ekindle, Fire book, GPS and cords in...perfect size to use for travel
 This Laptop bag has plenty of room for what I need. It holds my laptop, the charger, a mouse, my notebook, my planner, and 2 books. The only thing I could wish for would be a little thicker padding. It is a great bag that is light easy to carry and does all I need it to.
 This case is excellent for my mac book pro, it will fit nice and easy, the quality is super for the price! things that fit inside: my mac, the charger, external Hard Drive,  paper notes and pencils.
 Great product! it caries my 8" tablet with case and bluetooth keyboard with every accessory i need for it.<br/><br/>It rates 5 stars!! Same quality as more expensive brands.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a case for you tech, do not hesitate to get this.
 Just what I was looking for
 I have a lenovo thinkpad and I was having a hard time finding a case for it and took a chance on this bag because the tablet is 10.1 inches. It fits inside the bag with the charger. It's nice quality for the price, the zipper is a little on the cheap plastic side and it sticks sometimes but for the price I don't mind. It feels well padded and the handles are convenient.
 This case is extremely well padded and has plenty of room for the Surface Pro 2 and power cord.  There is additional space for two or three other accessories.  The zippers work well and the strap is secure.  This is a must have for anyone who has a Surface to protect your investment.  The price is exceptional for the quality of the product.
 Good quality laptop case, would vouch for amazon basics.
 Great bag.  Plenty of room for my laptop, mouse, charging cable, and a few papers.  The strap adjusts quite a bit which is great for me cause I a big guy.
 Easy to carry
 worth every penny, has different compartments to keep you organized and has padded interior to protect your computer.
 Great price and amazing quality! Still using it a year later
 Perfect bag for my laptop.  I can even fit my pad in.  Plenty of side pockets too.
 Fits a Xperia Z2 Tablet and a Kindle HD at the same time--both with cases installed. Has room left inside for cables etc, and a nice zippered compartment on the front to store additional items.
 good sturdy bag for traveling
 I use it for school books not a laptop.  It great for what I'm using it for.  Laptop might be a little heavy for it.
 Just what I need.  One complaint..it should have metal instead of plastic clips on strap.  I worry strap might break with plastic ones.  But so far so good.  other wise nice bag.
 Very quality bag and inexpensive. Holds my computer, charger, notebooks, pens and everything isn't smashed in to fit. I really like this bag!
 Cure little bag for my iPad.
 My daughter uses this bag for college. It holds her laptop and charger with room to spare. Great quality, especially for the price.
 Fits my 13in mac book air perfectly with plenty of space for a few folders and chargers
 My daily bag. Holds all I need and then some.  Had a zipper break off and without a question Amazon sent out a new one.  Fits 13' MacBook Air with a plastic case great.  Very light bag and made strong!
 I like this bag!  It's durable, and just what I thought it would be!
 Nice product for the price
 Nice simple laptop bag. Not the best protection, but for use around the house or limited travel functions nice. Fits my 17" HP without problems, plus cords and a wireless mouse.
 I've had this just over a year and I'm just now writing my review, but the handles started ripping probably 6-7 months after I bought it.  On top of it,  this is not a computer bag I used on a daily basis.
 Nicely made
 This is a great small aid for your tablet. It will accommodate small keyboard, mouse and power supply in separate top pocket and you'll still have plenty of space for small bits and pieces.<br/>The only drawback is that it has some unpleasant resin type of smell which, I hope, will fade way with time.
 Cheap, alright, it works for me
 Well made - good quality. and looks good. My held more than the laptop - also a mouse  and small speakers. ( still room )
 Perfect and strong
 This little bag is just what I needed for my Acer Aspire Switch 10.  I have room for the blue tooth ultra thin mouse and ear buds case as well as a Logitech USB speaker.  Even so, there is still room for an iPad or tablet.  Nice little case.
 This little bag has been a life saver. It's a perfect fit for a tablet and the power cords. It's well made and holds just enough STUFF to keep me from over packing. Forces me to take only what I really need for the day.....sometimes! Well worth the price I paid.
 Nice works well
 I bought this for my dad, and it is great quality, and the perfect fit as he wanted.
 I simply love this bag. I'm able to easily put my MacBook Pro, iPad 2, iPad Air 2, iPhone 6s, and their power cords/accessories with room to spare.
 Great bag for low price!
 Fit laptop well with plenty of storage for accessories.
 Excelent. Extra pockets on front for everything I need for tablet. Power cords,data cords, power supply and cleaning clothes. Inside roomy enough for my Galaxy Tab 2.0 7 in the Otterbox Case, and still room for my Gear Head Android keyboard. HAS METAL TABS FOR ZIPPER PULLS. Will not break like plastic ones on other bags. Interior measures about 11.5" wide by 8.5" tall, I throw that in because that was one of the things I wanted to know when I was Shopping for a bag.
 I purchased this case for my new Lenovo Yoga2  11.6 computer. I looked at cases at Best Buy, Staples and Walmart and nothing can compare to the quality or price of this rugged little case. It has room to store the power cord and anything else you need to haul along. It has 3 zippered compartments and a shoulder strap if you desire. It has an easy carry handle attached so I don't use the shoulder strap. I love it and I love the price.
 I bought this bag for my New Ipad and it works great.  Even with the larger than normal cover I have on my Ipad it fits in the bag easily. The bag isn't overally big so it's easy to pack around . I love the smaller zip pocket on the front.  I keep my cables and connectors in there.  The material seems to be good quality and I trust that my Ipad will be safe when I have it in the bag.  It also has some heavy duty zippers that are easy to zip open.  And the price was unbeatable.
 It's hard to knock any points off this bag, because it's simple, yet solid, and that's that.  It is what it is, and it does it well.  My only style point is that I wish the "amazon basics" logo wasn't so prominent.  I'm a frugal shopper, but I don't like announcing it.
 This is an excellent bag, I carry my tablet, charger with cord, and head set.  It has a lot of room yet it is small enough.
 I bought this to use with an (approximately) 10 inch notebook (Asus Transformer Book T100TA) and I am pleased with its utility, construction and appearance.  The zippered main pocket and the smaller accessory pocket opens and closes easily and the cushioning is adequate with normally careful handling.
 Amazon getting it right.
 Great unit
 perfect size
 Holds what I needed it to.
 Does not fit a 16 inch DVD player.
 Amazon speed. Amazing quality! This is a fine bag, and it looks great. I use it for work (as a University Professor), and it looks nicer than many of the bags my coworker use. Get this bag.
 Amazing<br/>I wish it came in different colors. Perfect<br/>Highly recommend
 Perfect with an 11” laptop computer
 Best buy and wise choice
 Arrived on time and is exactly what was promised.  Basic carrying case at a great price, lots of room for power adapter/accessories, laptop, and files/notebooks.
 Very nice
 Good
 I have a 10.1 Notebook and it fits perfectly. I have room for my husbands Kindle, cell phone, and my billfold. Everything in one neat case, easy to carry. I don't use a keyboard so this works very nicely to carry all the things I need in one easy to carry case.
 Good for the price.
 Carries my HP 17" nicely.  Seems to be enough padding to keep it safe.  Lots of pockets!
 This exceeded my expectations! I love AmazonBasics! I have to get one for each truck for my litechure!
 To small
 Needed a smaller case for a new laptop, this works great. Had it for a year still looks like the day I got it.  Great quality for the price.  Everything AmazonBasics I've ever purchased has been a great investment.
 What a wonderful little bag! It is just the perfect size for the iPad. I keep my iPad in an Otterbox case (no cover) and fits inside perfectly. The handles make it easy to carry along, and the small pockets on the outside are great for inserting earphones or a charger. Great product for a great price! Highly recommend it!
 I love this bag. It fits laptop, charger, cleaning solution with soft cloth, paperwork, and with still plenty of space left.
 Starting at 5 after receiving it...I'll update after I've used it for a while.<br/><br/>Size is what I wanted (small).<br/>Fits what I need it to (11 inch MBA, charging brick, Blackberry, Nano, earbuds, 2 USB drives, wallet)<br/>My laptop is in in a Built sleeve and still fits.<br/>Construction seems good (not cheap).<br/>Good shoulder strap, but small enough to carry with the handle if preferred.
 This is an amazing bag at an incredible price.  My son purchased it for his new Macbook Air 11.6".  He is also able to put his ipad mini in another internal pocket (it would fit a full sized ipad as well).  It is slim, well padded and has a nice exterior pouch for accessories.  I was incredibly impressed.  It arrived literally the day after it was ordered.  Amazon never ceases to amaze!!
 cheap and practical
 good case
 Like all other Amazon Basics products this one is not an exception.  Adequate space, decent stitching and choice of handles or a shoulder strap.  Great for a tablet or, in my case, a portable scanner.  Zipped pocket on outside, pocket section on inside.
 This laptop is just right for my iPad with separate compartments for iPod and all my device chargers.  I use it when traveling to keep everything together.  Plenty of room and price was less than I would have paid at local office retailers.  I'm very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it.
 I am pleased with this bag which seems to have most of the design features of the more expensive ones. The only thing that remains to be seen is durability, but so far, so good.
 Great bag for the money. Bought it for my work computer and it fits perfectly and seems sufficiently protected.  The internal/external storage pockets are really convenient for keeping everything together in 1 spot. Happy with the purchase.
 Perfect laptop bag. I ordered a ten pack plus two to add to the other dozen plus we've been using for a couple years. Excellent solution for taking our Dells to trade shows. Small footprint and very durable. Handsome looking bag too!
 I love this bag! I can fit my laptop, anything small like pens and batteries, my mouse, mouse pad, and charging cables.And even after all this is packed, the bag doesn't seem to get very fat and it's easy to carry around. I admit I dropped my laptop while it was in this case (Unfortunately I'm very clumsy) but nothing happened to my laptop! It didn't crack the screen or anything and here I am writing this review with my laptop (:
 This is our go to bag for everything that will fit.
 This bag looks like a very good value for the price.  Its not as nice as an $80 computer bag but it protects the computer well and sheds the water of our Seattle winters.  This is an excellent value.  I bought a second.  Wish it came it more colors
 I really love this case (been using it daily for about 6 months). I use it for my Microsoft Surface Pro 2 and it allows me to carry my surface, the wall charger, surface arc mouse, ear buds, phone, wallet, stylus and some papers in a light, convenient package with a shoulder strap for minimal investment. No issues with the construction...seems to be built to last.
 Great buy, great price for the buck
 Awesome bag! Cannot believe the quality. Amazing price and amazing product. I can fit my laptop mouse charger a laptop cooling pad and still have room. I like that the shoulder carrier detaches. Great buy.
 Nice bag for the price
 These bags are good for the price. We have at leat 12 in the office, they last a long time and they dont fall apart<br/>there is not a lot of room for notebooks etc. really just a carrying case for a laptop and its plug.
 We use this bag for our two tablets. It's perfect and offers great protection!
 Get for taking my iPad to work daily. With plenty more storage.
 This Amazon Basics 11.6 inch laptop case just meet my need.<br/>Besides,,it looks slim,,it just fit my 11.6" ASUS notebook.<br/> I remove the shoulder pad (too wide)  ,,so it won't bother my feeling!!<br/>I cannot wait to buy the 2nd one bag,,because I got another 11.6 notebook.<br/>Also the price is great !! I must give 5 stars.
 My son bought this for his laptop. It is a good quality bag for the price, especially for a young adult. It has a lot of nice compartments and pockets for all the extras, and it has good padding.
 Good quality case, but was very disappointed to find out that it does not fit the Lenovo Y700 17.3 inch laptop. It can zip shut, but it bulges at the zipper making it very difficult to get the laptop in and out of the bag. With such a tight fit, I can see the zipper eventually damaging the laptop's edges. Will be returning. I'm only giving it a 2 star because of the decent quality.
 This is a VERY nice case!  It's well-made and roomy and the fabric looks sturdy. I bought this one as a gift; I think I may have to get another one for myself.
 Quality material at a fair price point
 Great quality and price
 Awesome! Thanks for the fast shipping and a great product. Would buy again if needed. Super job, thanks so much!!
 Bien
 I used this as an accessories bag for my harmonica brace and harmonicas, as well as other small items. It fits inside a larger gig bag and allows me to find everything without removing the big stuff.
 Its perfect thank u
 Can't tell how well it protects the laptop because we don't travel much with it, but it does fit well with a 17 inch screen laptop.
 I use this bag for my dive paperwork! My dive computer's and charts! I also have a few books on ship wrecks and bottles, that are for reference. Durable and lite! Lots of storage!
 Perfect fit for my 13” laptop
 Beautiful case that fits everything
 perfect for my 17" hp laptop
 Use it for my table and tablet keyboard and they stay well protected.  Gave it four stars because the liner ripped without much effort when I put a file folder in with my tablet and the shoulder strap seems to want to slip off when I'm moving around.  Otherwise solid.
 This is a good quality computer bag. It was cheap and my 15.5" Asus computer fits in with a little room to spare. Decent padding and plenty of storage for the power supply and wireless mouse and some cables and stuff. Can't ask for more for $15.00.
 Cheap stuff to carry a 14 inches computer. Nothing of other world but necessary.
 What a fantastic bag. I thought it might be cheaply made, but no. Well constructed and carries my laptop, charger, kindle, a trapperkeeper and more just fine without being bulky. Buy with confidence.
 Better than I expected for the price! I got it because it has handles, and was priced well. Zipped pocket is handy for charging cord.
 Love this bag. Carried it on my trip and was easy to move around with.
 I Love this Bag! It is a HEAVY DUTY well padded adjustable bag to carry my items in. My Chromebook, mini mouse and cord fit in the bag so nicely with room left for other items. Lots of pockets too! You get a BIG BAG for Your $$ on this buy!
 Nice bag, however the strap started to fray a month in using it. The rest of the bag is okay but you can tells it is going to start to fray also. The bag design is nice just wished it had been sewn better.
 Product exactly as advertised
 I got this for my Surface 2, and it fits perfectly. I was worried it wouldn't be quite wide enough, since the aspect ratio for the Surface is different than an iPad, but it works just great. The small pocket on the front fits the charging cable and my Bluetooth mouse (Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse) pretty well.<br/><br/>All in all, great bag.
 I love this bag. My large iPad fits in it perfectly along with cables &amp;a plugs. It's easy to pull out of my larger bag as it has handles.
 Bag itself is nice quality with dimensions exactly as advertised. Not sure how long plastic clips and rings on shoulder strap will last but I will only be using the carrying handles so that is of no concern to me.
 Threading already seperating.
 Very good bag for laptop and other paper documents. Bought it for my cousin who is a teacher and she loves it. Different compartment available to store lots of stuff
 This bag had just the right features for my needs. I doesn't have extra things I won't use, but enough to fit my needs.
 This is the perfect laptop bag because I have struggled to find one that will fit my 17 inch laptop without being overly expensive. This one is affordable and lightweight and I use it every day.
 Loveeeee good bag
 Just the right size. Padded well and not very large enough pocket for accessories. And most of all not breaking my pocket
 Good bag for the price. It is not "high end", but is a solid, well built item.
 Good streamlined basic computer carrier.  Holding up to my teenager's use!  Just the right size for his standard Dell laptop, and good sturdy material.
 The bag perfectly fits my Lenovo X1 Carbon laptop. It's light weight and carries just enough for me to travel. The only issue was the carrying strap/shoulder pad felt cheap. I swapped it with a carrying strap from a 20 year old IBM Thinkpad case and all is well.
 As expected
 Serves its purpose and well made
 Amazon hit a sweet spot of price/utility with this little satchel. Good protection, perfect (not too big, not too small) size for many devices + their accessories, simple and straightforward, and very well made.<br/>H. Ford* would've been proud...<br/><br/>*(any color as long as it's black - but that's not a problem)
 nice bag good fit
 I kept my kindle PW 2 in the box it came in for a few months before getting a case. This bag fits the kindle in the box, a tablet, wallet, keys, writing utensils, etc. That being said, if you are looking for a tight fit for your kindle in a case, this is not it. If you want some moving room (which is better imo anyway) for your kindle, then this is fantastic.<br/><br/>There are no tears, no stitching issues, and no zipper issues.
 Very well made and useful for transporting my laptop. I'm very happy with it and the only reason I'm only giving 4 stars is that delivery took over a month. So, if you're in a hurry you may want to take that into consideration.
 I got this for my Asus Transformer Pad Infinity. It fits great with enough room to slip my Kindle Keyboard in there as well (the kindle is in it's own Timbuk2 sleeve). It's a fairly protective case with convinient handles and a little zippered pocket that I put a screen cleaning cloth and in ear headphones in. Great value for the money.
 Just right for my Lenovo Y700 17" laptop. A tight fit, but it works. The pockets are good without being overly large. A different 17" case I purchased was too small.
 Love this bag. Plenty of storage and made sturdy. Never a problem, and ive used them for many years.
 Exactly what I needed for my laptop!  Thank you Amazon for providing a cost effective way to carry my laptop.
 Great laptop bag. Already flown with it twice and is holding up well. Has plenty of storage for additional cables, mouse, notepad and pens.
 Great product. Totally functional. Awesome job Amazon.
 Great laptop bag
 Very nice bag, can't beat it.
 Another good purchase as this takes both my IPad and my Kindle Fire HD...yes, I have both and use them differently. Prefer the Kindle for reading ..the Ipad for most other things. This carrying case even holds a wallet, if you don't want to bother with your purse.
 Excellent fit and finish.  Good durability.
 I find this simple little back padded case to be everything I expected it to be as well as everything I needed it to be to protect my investment in my ipad.<br/><br/>For me it solves the "dropsies" I have due to my tremors causing me to loose my grip on my ipad when I move from place to place.<br/><br/>Folk's, I think this little black case is just swell !!!!
 I bought this laptop bag to replace the bag I had just purchased a few months prior from case logic on which the zipper had broken. So far this bag has held up, no complaints.
 I just got my bag in the mail, so I have yet to test it out thoroughly, but the materials seem sturdy. It fits my Lenovo G50 15.6-inch laptop perfectly in the sleeve of the main compartment, and by that I mean it's so snug that my laptop only goes in one way, which is great since it keeps my laptop from jostling around. There's enough room to fit everything else I would need (charger, some food, notebooks, etc.) --except maybe a water bottle-- without it taking up unnecessary space.
 I've had alot of Laptop Bags over the years. This is by far the best of the best, at an incredible price. Other bags that I've had been either too bulky or too flimsy. This is the perfect compromise: not to flimsy but not too bulky. I can carry it to work every day and have everything that I need.
 Fits my MacBook Air 11" even in a protective sleeve! Great buy for good quality! Always happy with all my purchases when buying anything from Amazon basics!
 great bag. Liked it so well I bought another one.
 Very nice laptop bag. Roomy with lots of pockets. Good looking material and construction. Seems like a great bargain.
 Bought this for my 15 year old son and he loves it.
 Good quality laptop bag at a great price.  It has multiple compartments for storing the laptop and all your accessories.
 Love this bag. Great price for what you get. A nice, perfect size bag that has great sizes and prices with each size. Has a slight smell that quickly dissipates. I however do wish they have a size smaller than their smallest and one size bigger than their largest. Very lightweight and feels expensive. I have more than one bag of various sizes, some for over a year and so far lasting with no major complaints!<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat.
 Holds a 13" Macbook Pro (non retina) AND an iPad, all in one VERY small case. I put this inside a backpack just to make sure my very expensive electronics stay safe. The materials inside feel rather cheap, but there's tons of padding.
 Very roomy, so holds all my electronics when traveling, laptop, Kindle, camera and batteries, plus their cords.  Light-weight but sturdy and well-padded.  Love it!!!!!
 A good decent bag for the price. Enough padding to protect the laptop. Not much room for anything else other than power cord and external mouse. Shoulder strap seems to be securely attached so it will not break.
 Bag is very nice and so far, very durable.
 Great bang for the buck - it isn't extremely high quality but for what you are paying it is a very good bargain.
 More than what I expected. The quality is really good for the price you pay. I ordered the 17.3" even though my laptop is 15.6" because I figured I would have more room for other items such as notebooks and cases. I am very happy with this purchase because it fits and feels like it would protect my laptop and at the same time, allows for even more items. I fit a 3-subject notebook and still have plenty of room for various other items without the worry of the weight being too heavy for the bag to handle. Thank you Amazon!
 good
 Good price; quick delivery
 I still don't know if I would be willing to drop my tablet inside this thing. The padding is not as firm as I had imagined. Also, it feels a little bulky for a 7" tablet. On the good side, it has a zipper pouch that you can put thing in.
 Great bag for the money.
 very exciting shipping experience!!!
 Price was nice. Decent quality.
 Works well/great price
 Its a case..doesnt do much..but lay on my floor...wont fetch me a beer or anything, useless case..only protects my laptop,
 I use this for a Dell Latitude ST2 tablet.  When I bought the tablet I guess they upgraded me to the extended battery, which was nice but there are no folio style cases that fit it.<br/><br/>It protects the tablet, has extra storage on the side and has worn well.
 Perfect case for the small Acer laptop that I purchased from Amazon.  It has enough pockets for the adapter, my Wi-Fi, a usb mouse, and flash drives.  Included shoulder strap makes it easy to carry, especially when travelling.  I already recommended it to a friend who has a tablet.
 Great quality
 I bought 2 of these at different times.  They hold tablets perfectly.  Keeps them protected and easy to carry.
 Fit perfectly
 This bag is super sleek and comfortable. And for the price, you really can't beat it. It's exactly as pictured and came in on time. I've been using it for a few months now and I haven't had any problems at all!
 very nice case has lots of room to fit all the cable and mouse and the tablet
 Fits my Thinkpad X200 like a glove (standard battery, no-tablet). Also holds 7 inch tablet, AT&amp;T Unite, emergency charger. I use docks for my Thinkpad, don't schlep around a mouse or power adapters. Excellent solution for minimalist needs
 Hands down a good buy--high quality--nicely padded and I can take along not only the essentials but all the stuff I think I could need and often do not. The AmazonBasics products are as good or better than similar items from the name brand gang. If you're looking for a Netbook bag this is a great one.
 excellent product very good desig
 Just what I needed for work and travel.
 Low price equals low quality but my 17" laptop fit nicely. It's just not a lot of cushion built into the case.
 I bought it for a Dell Inspiron 15...3000 Series.  It fits perfectly.  It's just the right size...not too big and not too snug.  A good bag for the price.
 This bag is absolutely the perfect size for my Chromebook 3.  It has several zippered compartments and can also carry my tablet, a mouse, flash drive, and charger.
 works good for price
 A perfectly nice case, with pockets inside and out, for my great big laptop--and the price was right!  (By the way, somebody finally figured out you don't need a case that opens up all the way like a clam shell, so if you grab it in a hurry, your computer won't go flying.)
 This is just what I needed. It's sturdy, lots of pockets and straight forward, not all fancy and frilly. I love it. The price was right too.
 This is an excellent bag for the price and works better than expected for the application that we needed it for.<br/>I was super impressed by the quality of this bag, so impressed that we bought a second one as a gift and will most likely purchase more.
 It is not a ‘top quality’ product - it is a cheap, ‘I just need something to put my laptop in’ type product. Cheaply made but if you just need something to store your laptop in, it will do.
 Perfect for my Chromebook 13"
 This is exactly what I was looking for and the price was amazing!!!
 Best 14-inch brief I've used. I prefer AmazonBasics to the more expensive 14" cases I've purchased because it's slimmer. Other similar cases have two large compartments, where this one has one larger compartment and two smaller compartments.
 It’s a nice bag, but the shoulder pad frayed so badly that the padding started coming out, and I had to cut it off.
 Prefect fit for the HP 13.3 notebook. Stylish and lots of pockets. Great protection. Built well. Highly recommend.
 This laptop bag was automatically matched to the laptop I was purchasing and is a perfect size match. It has room for the power cord, mouse, a booklet and papers I tend to carry with me.
 it was a good deal and is well made
 I also bought the Case Logic LAP-113 13" laptop case which fits inside this Amazon bag beautifully and gives great travel protection and can be pulled out at anytime you want to travel really  light.  It has plenty of room for all the extra item that support your laptop and a few meeting folders, etc. Great bag for the money.
 Bought these for my children (2) and I was impressed!  Definitely better than what I expected.  Great quality,  perfect size,  and different compartments!  Worth every penny.
 Squeaks like crazy! Not very soft.
 Bought this as a present for our son, the teacher. He just got a new Chromebook and it fits perfectly!  There is also room for his iPad and other stuff.  This is a well thought out, well constructed case. A great value for the money which should last a long time!
 Diseño con poca protección, mucha colcha espuma. Pero hace el trabajo por el precio a pagar.
 You can't go wrong with this for under  $20. Very well made and fits my 17.5 laptop perfect.
 Practically a perfect fit for a Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 11e machine. Appears to be well made and durable. Especially nice to have convenient built in handles along with an included strap.
 Muy buena calidad  y resistente
 Super light, reasonably durable. Handles are just bag material with extra stitching, which can be annoying when carrying heavy books.laptops for long distances. I use it for textbook overflow on heavy class days, and can fit about 2 thick textbooks and a thin spiral notebook in the main compartment, but it ain't easy, and the way the bag is constructed that means I can't put anything in the smaller compartments when I do so.
 Nice quality soft bag ...  Does the job of protecting my Surface 3 from general wear and tear and makes it easy to carry along with accessories ...  It will not (and is not intended to) protect from a fall onto a hard surface from several feet ...
 It is a good bag but it is a pretty tight fit with my 15.6 and a trackball and the power cables.
 I've had this bag for less than a month and the support pad for the belt is already damaged. I was excited for the great price I was able to get the bag for but when I saw it damaged I was disappointed.
 Great product!  Fraction of the cost of other similar products such as Case Logic.  Fits my 13.3" MacBook Air perfectly along with its accessories.  I would definitely go Amazon Basics for my future computer needs!
 Use it everyday, great for work.
 Perfect
 Fantastic quality for the price. Fits a Surface Pro 3 and (MetricUSA) sleeve perfectly. Pockets and compartments are low profile, yet very useful for the occasional accessory. Great for the minimalist tablet or ultrabook user who might want to pack an accessory or two. Nylon material feels very solid and reinforced in the right places. I use it as my daily bag.
 This has nice padding and many pockets for the stuff we have to have along. I have a 17.3 inch laptop which fits nicely into this bag.
 Great 👍 I didn't try it yet. But it seems to be working for all my intended needs. Thank you
 Hu what I needed
 It's pretty good. I bought it about 2 years ago and still use it.
 It is made of good material and has the ideal size for my 14 "notebook.
 Loved this especially after monogram was added by another local vendor.
 My favorite feature is the Amazon logo on this! Ha this is perfect. Feels like it offers protection if dropped too. Kinda stiff, which is good for fragile electronics. I'd still recommend you leave your case on your tablet for extra protection.
 De acuerdo con la descripción.
 It's great but it tore along the inside seams in 2 weeks time. I only carry one soft cover textbook and my MacBook in there. Kind of disappointing but it was cheap. I'm going to crazy glue the hell out of it.
 As many others have indicated, the padded section of my shoulder strap started unraveling.  It is an eyesore and basically impractical now to not have that cushion on my shoulder.  Had I known it would unravel so quickly, I never would have bought it.
 It's okay.  But doesn't offer very much protection for the laptop.  I dropped the bag with a laptop in it onto the street from about 1 foot up (fell off my rolling suitcase) and the corner of the laptop became damaged.  The padding in the bag is minimal/nonexistent.
 Nice laptop bag at a decent price. So far holding up well.
 I bought this for my Thinkpad.  The case is nicely made with lots of pockets at a great price point.  The laptop, power brick, mouse, and accessories all fit easily and are well protected and easy to carry.
 Spectacular no frills bag. Easily fits my 15.6 HP Envy along with charger and wireless mouse. I typically keep an HDMI cable and various adapters along with a standard legal pad in the bag with no space issues.  The included padding definitely gives peace of mind that your electronics will be safe while traveling.
 I can certainly appreciate Amazon's need to advertise, but Amazonbasics printed 5 times (4 zippers and on the case) seems a bit much.
 Good material holds the iPad as well
 Perfect fit for my HP 11.6 Stream. Can also store mouse pad and wireless mouse in other compartment. Strong and sturdy case. Excellent quality for the price.
 great product
 The bag is fine with the exception that it does not fit a 15.6 laptop.  I wish I had paid more attention and read the internal measurements.
 Quality is wonderful!
 Roomy! Well worth the price.
 Works great! Love the compartments, I am a college student
 I had laptop bags before but this one is well cushioned and the right size for the laptop.
 Very happy with this laptop bag. Fits my 15.6 laptop perfect.
 Hubby love it
 Great quality for the price!  And perfect pockets and compartments, etc. I also like it's grey inside so it's easier to find small items inside.
 I treat this bag like crap and it seems to hold up pretty well. Zippers still zipping, fabric still fabricing. Zero complaints.
 I use that every day - high quality material, very durable, and holds the surface pro, a Bluetooth mouse, the power supply, the touch pen, MiFi, USB-to-micro-USB retractable cable  - a bit tight, but not too tight. Everything I need on the go.<br/>Could enjoy probably 0.5" larger, but do not complain; excellent buy.
 It is everything as advertised, but the quality of the fabric used is terrible and to me is like nails on a chalk board. as soon as i opened it i just threw it back in the box, ill never use it. wasted money.
 great quality for the right price
 I tried to squeeze a 11.6 netbook into it.  It fits, but is tight around the corners.  My fault, but I thought I could get away with it.  I got a bigger one so as not to scratch up the finish on the netbook.<br/><br/>This is a nice case and would fit a 10 inch tablet or something that size nicely.
 great
 I will be getting another one of these when I get a Kindle Fire HDX soon. I bought this for my mom to use with her DragonTouch, and it's amazing. She's got room in it for a notebook, which she's always using and losing. It's also really well made, and can be used for things other than carrying devices.
 This was for my husband's big screen laptop. Worked very well, it's spacious and I like the fact that it's not stiff.
 It has worked very well for us
 Really happy with the case.  Good protection for laptop or my 10.1 inch tablet or both at same time.  I read another review about the plastic clips for shoulder strap breaking and I only plan on using handles.  For me, this isn't a problem.
 Using in an elementary school very sturdy. 6th one purchased.
 Good bag for a good price.
 I use this everyday.  Works great with the Lenovo Yoga 13" computer.
 works great
 Nice bag.  Fits my 15.6" Dell m3800 with plenty of room for storing power supply, cables, and all the usual junk that seems to leap into my laptop bag before a trip.
 I use this bag for my laptop at university and has done the job quite well. I carry my laptop and a 1" binder as well as other assorted items and a charger. I like the front pocket's organizers and pockets.
 perfect for my laptop
 It's truly amazing that Amazon can offer such high quality products for such a cheap price. Really well made. Caselogic would probably charge $25 for this.
 Delivered on time. Nice product
 This has been a perfect buy and I've transported my big iPad Pro many, many times! It's also held the iPad Pro and mini iPad with no problem.
 Perfect for the price. Went to staples, office depot, etc to look for a laptop bag for college but they were all well over $50!! Didn't want to spend that much on a laptop bag so I went to Amazon where I found this one! For the price, it's awesome! Also durable and love the multiple pockets where I can fit my books into one of them and my laptop inside.
 This bag seems to have been designed for my 10 inch HP notebook. The computer and charger, the external DVD drive, mouse and a few other odds and ends (flash drives and memory card reader0 -- everything fits. Love it!
 Great team, very handy when traveling on plane or in the car.
 Nice way to carry a laptop, pens and paper, and book or two, including laptop charger.
 I am extremely happy with the purchase of this bag. I received what was expected in terms of quality and size.
 Great bag for larger screen laptops at a great price!
 I bought this bag to use with my Kindle Fire and it works great!  The small pouch works well for ear buds and other small items.  I've also found that my wife's ipad fits in it...along with the Kindle.  Small, compact, light and well made.  A great way to comfortably carry along our readers.  Highly recommended!
 Wonderful.  I use it every day.  Great value.  Bought this after I cracked my Lenovo Yoga Pro this laptop touch-screen.  Have not had a problem since.  I highly recommend.
 Price is great and bag is awesome came packed perfectly in a box. I do recommend came with shoulder strap too
 Like
 Excellent article. I recommend it.
 Nice bag fits my iPad Air perfect I have a Otter Box defender case on it and have lots of room the front pouch gives you room for your charging cables and wall plugs cant beat it for the price highly recommend this bag
 Great product. It fits my notebook perfectly. There's room for extra stuff like my external cd drive, notebook paper, ect. It's made very well and seems sturdy.
 Excellent quality from Amazon. Tough materials and attention to personal comforts as well. Plenty of room and smartly divided internal pockets, very well padded as well. Thank you Amazon, well done!
 Perfect size. Durable and lightweight, it has all the advertised qualities. Highly recommended.
 Works very well
 Purchased this bag for my fiance. He is really rough on electronics. He says it's a "Nice sturdy bag."
 Lots of storage space, and definitely protects my laptop. Definitely recommend
 Decent bag at a reasonable price. My 17" laptop fits right in the bag.
 Holds my Surface Pro 3, power supply, outboard DVD and HDD, a powered USB hub, thumb drives, mouse, etc. all at once for travel, and still is light and has a small travel footprint.  Items remain easy to remove when needed.  Padding is good around PC.
 Overall a good laptop bag. Has room for a charger, some cables, and a notebook or even two. Strap is fairly sturdy and it seems durable enough.
 Perfect fit. Slim profile.
 Quality case.
 Does what it was meant to do. Good price.
 This Amazon Basics 11.6 inch bag is very nice looking and has the padded protection you need to keep your laptop from getting scratched up. It is very roomy and has plenty of space for your needs.
 WORKS PERFECT............GREAT PRICE
 Bought a new 17" HP computer which was a bit larger than I expected and would not fit in my existing bag and sleeve.  The Amazon bag is perfect.  Well made, roomy and a great price.  Couldn't be happier !!
 There are so many laptop bags out there I was trying to find something compact with just the necessary number of zippers and pockets to accommodate cables and gadgets. This bag is perfect in size for my 13 inch MacBook Pro and literally wraps around the laptop leaving little room for it to be dancing around inside. This is perfect for a 13 inch laptop and highly recommend it.
 This is a great bag for my surface pro. I have extra room in the other pockets to fit file folders, my phone, a Microsoft arc mouse, and pens. This is a great value for the price.
 I loved this bag when it first arrived, but after several weeks of use the shoulder strap pad started losing its stitching...that eventually came off.  Now, the inside of the pocket where I keep all of my cords is starting to come undone...ripping out from the seam.  The bag itself is a great fit for my 14" laptop, very slim, light, etc.  Unfortunately, the quality is sorely lacking.
 Great product. Well made.
 I am very happy with my item Thanks for fast shipment.
 This bag is fantastic ! I ordered for my 11.6 computer. I actually picked this bag because of the reviews about it. It holds my device plus the accessories and even a small notebook. It has short and shoulder handles. LOVE IT ! Thank you Amazon for coming with this line of bags that are practical and affordable.
 Perfect fit for my 17" laptop
 Awesome bag for a tiny notebook or utrabook.<br/>Has enough pockets and sections to fit most of the essentials.<br/>Good stitching quality and good fabric.
 The "AmazonBasics Netbook Bag" is the perfect iPad carrying case! I keep an "ICON iPad Essential Black Book" on my iPad to protect it during daily use, but I needed a bag with handles that would make it easier to carry the iPad outside of my home. My iPad in its cover fits easily inside this bag, which is padded for extra protection. The side pocket is the ideal place to store the chargers, cords, and camera kit. It's a great value for a great product.
 Good price and does just what it needs to.
 This is a very good laptop bag. I was hesitant to buy AmazonBasics in the past but now I've purchased a ton of stuff with that brand name and I'm impressed. I highly recommend this item and the brand in general.
 Perfect for my son’s 15 in laptop.
 Absolutely satisfied! Great buy for your money, right size for my 13 in Dell, my papers, charger and mouse. Light and durable!<br/>You can't miss it! It's much better than those bags in Bestbuy which cost you around 20~30bucks!
 It is the perfect size and design for my needs. The quality is much better than I expected for this price. If I ever need another one I would buy this again.
 Everything OK.
 It is well made.
 I'm really surprised how good of quality this case is considering how inexpensive it was.  There's a lot of zipper room on it as well, something that not a lot of other cases offered.  Would definitely buy this again.
 This is an excellent case and seems to be made of high quality materials.  I bought this to hold a BiXPower 153 Wh external battery and it was the perfect size.  The exterior zippered pocket was just right for holding the battery charger and adapter cables.
 Bought 2 of these and our office laptops perfectly fit! Exactly what we're looking for. Not too bulky but has enough room for some office stuffs.
 Good, basic case for a small netbook. Provides some, yet not great cushioning. Good size for an 11.6 inch computer, power adapter, plus a cable or two, some flash drives.
 great case for my hp 15" laptop
 Looks nice. And it can fit a 14 inch laptop. But that is pretty much it. It has very little space for anything else. And it has minimal cushioning in case you bump it while carrying your laptop around. The overall construction of the bag is good. I used for 4 - 5 months and switched back to a backpack since it was awkward to carry this around.
 Great case and fit for my sons 17' new HP laptop
 WELL MADE, GOOD ZIPPERS, QUALITY.
 I've had this for nearly two years now, and it's every bit as good as the day I bought it.
 Perfect for Macbook Air 9".  Though it looks way more like a purse than a computer bag, so if you are a self-conscious manly man you may not like it.  I also have a larger bag for my 15" Macbook Pro which works well but is way too much extra weight for a small computer.
 Bag works like a charm. Able to fit everything I need into the laptop bag. Makes it easier to carry everything I need in the one bag. Seems to be made of a durable material and zippers work just fine.
 It's exactly what I wanted it to be and a solid product.
 Just what I needed for my Acer Aspire One 14" Laptop. Perfect fit.
 Perfect addition to help protect my new 10.1" Chromebook. Product is well made, light, padded, and well thought out. I purposely ordered the next larger size (11.6 in.), which negates having to cram peripherals (e.g.- mouse, charger, etc.) into such a small space.
 Nice little laptop bag. Multiple pouches and feels sturdy.  I beat things up, and with 6 months of moderate work use, the bag still looks new.  More padding for the computer than i expected, too.  For the price it's a fantastic bag.
 Impressed with quality, use this for a 9 inch portable DVD player,have room for the charger,and everything.
 quite adequate for the price but a bit large - would have preferred something that fit my ipad air more snugly and fit in more of my purses...but I don't use the case that often, so this will definitely do the job. The amount of cushioning seems just right for carrying the ipad in my purse.
 This computer bag fits perfectly over the handle of my roller and is the first bag to actually BE as big as it is described and so it actually did fit my enormous desk top replacement laptop. Finally I can travel without having to open my roller to get the computer out to go through airport security.
 I have purchased a few of these. One I use on my tablet, another I use on my art tablet, and I have also bought one to use for my blood pressure cuff and stethoscope. I am going to buy a few more to use with a few other things. The bag is super soft and works for many uses.
 it is not what I expected it to be but I use it til I can get a new one, that I like did not pay a lot for this but was not what I wanted really
 Excellent protective case for my laptop! Plenty of compartments for equipment and accessories!
 This bag is well built, and well padded. It's big enough for my 15" laptop, cooler, mouse, and charger. There is still extra room for notebooks, etc..The carrying strap is sturdy and the clips are strong enough to handle all the weight. At the same time it is NOT bulky.
 Amazon laptop bag is great! Super light, plenty of storage, and separate compartments for accessories.
 This is a great bag and I love it!
 Good enough for my mini-laptop.  Room for charger, mini-mouse, slender HDMI cord, etc.
 I needed a new iPad case as I take my iPad with me everyday. This one is a bit larger than my older one and it has a side pocket to put extra things in. Seems well made and I can't lose anything in it because the inside is a light color. I would say this ipad case is a "buy".
 If using for 17.3, remove any usb’s
 Fits perfectly and durable so far and on my second semester of college.
 good buy
 Works great. Would definitely buy again.
 I bought this for my mother's HP Split laptop.  She just needed something to haul it in on the rare occasions the laptop would leave the house.  This is all she needs, a basic case with space for the mouse and charger.  For the price I can't think of anything better.
 Good bag but wish it was bigger with more space.
 Sturdy and very useful.
 Overall good case for my computer.<br/>Enough room for a binder, computer, mouse, and power cable.
 This is a nice, basic, classy device bag.  It fits my tablet, bluetooth keyboard, portable microphone, external hard drive, point and shoot digital camera, along with all the wires and chargers.  The rubbery smell however, is putrid, and I'm happy to add that fifth star once the smell has lifted.
 I should have gotten a better case. It loses 2 stars because one day as I picked it up out of my car, one side of the strap came off and my $800 laptop crashed to the pavement causing no small amount of damage. :(
 Please know that this case does not fit the Sylvania 13.3inch DVD player. I recommend against buying it.
 I'm happy with the purchase
 it does have a little more space in this one than my old one, plus the old one has gotten shredded on the top of it where my cat has been shredding it. but it was getting old anyway and I need a new one for my laptop.
 Works
 Perfect size for my tablet and other things. Love it
 I bought this bag for my son and have no regrets. My son can be rough on his things but the bag has held up for some months now. It's very similar to the case logic case that is for sale on Amazon.com. It fits a netbook, cord, and mouse all in it comfortably. The price is second to none and the box it comes in was nice for gift-giving.
 My husband needed a new laptop bag for his laptop. We tried a few hut none fit his laptop. This is perfect for his laptop. His only complaint was there is not room for anything else
 Seems to have a hydrophobic coating, which is a very nice bonus.
 Just received this laptop bag. LOVE IT. Perfect fit for my laptop, mouse and charger. It is so reasonably priced compared to the other brands. It is an excellent bag.
 Very nice!
 Perfect bag. I love Amazon basics for nearly everything
 Very nice, as described.  Well made.
 Exactly what I needed for my Surface Pro 4. Very happy.
 Awesome laptop bag!  My job gave me a huge suitcase type bag so I bought this one to downsize and carry on my shoulder...and it STILL holds everything!  14" laptop plus charger, portable wifi device plus charger, camera plus charger, pens and a construction clipboard!
 Nice bag
 Looks great
 Really nice, but it doesn't have much, if any, room for anything else.  It fits, as they say, like a glove.  Would have liked a little more room so the cord and mouse didn't seem so cramed/tight fit.  Good buy for the price.
 Perfect bag
 Very nice bad and holds up very well, had it for a year now and still looks like new
 Perfect bag for my tablet and a great price. I have a the 12 inch Samsung Galaxy TabPRO and I was concerned this would be too small with the case on, but it fit great. I like the extra pockets too.
 Had this case for awhile now and it is holding up very well! It didn't cost a lot either when compared to a comparable case you'd buy at Staples or Office Max.
 Excellent product and exactly what I expected.
 Very nice kids bag
 Simple and usefull . Great for price
 It's a bag. It fits my laptop. It works.
 Perfect bag - perfect price.  Easily fits my Acer Aspire R14 laptop plus sleeve and cords, accessories.  Great value.  Wish they had more colors.
 My son loves it!
 Got it for my dad and he uaes it everyday, very practical and afordable, i defenly recomend it, nice quality and enough spaces to administrate ur stuff there.
 The item came without a strap but the seller later sent the strap. It is light weight and very convenient to transport laptop, tablet, charger and a few papers/notepad.
 Functional, durable, and inexpensive.  This laptop bag is great and protects my laptop well as I travel.
 My son uses this for homeschool. Carries his HP 15.6, accessories, and all his school supplies comfortably with room to spare. No need to look any further, this case would be hard to top.
 Although I was very pleased with this bag when I first received it, in 2 months, one side of one of the handles was ripping out to the point where I no longer trusted it to carry my laptop. I'm very disappointed at how quickly this product failed.
 A good value but not as roomy as the case logic 17" bag. If all you want to carry is a 17" laptop with a spare battery and the power cord, it will suit your needs. Had it been roomer, I would have given it five stars. Too soon to see how durable it will be.
 This is well made and priced well .<br/>My 17 " laptop fits with room to spare
 Very nice case for carrying a laptop.
 Fit perfectly for my TOSHIBA 17inch. Amazon makes good quality stuff I am not disappointed at all.. I would recommend this to anyone. Perfect price and Perfect fit thanks Amazon
 I gave the wrong review on the stand, thinking it was this bag which I like really well as it holds the stand and my iPad.  I like the convenience of keeping the iPad and accessories together in the bag with a handle to transport them.
 This is a great case perfect fit for my 11.6 laptop, pocket for mouse and charger,<br/>comes with shoulder strap,case is made with excellent material, works with my<br/>luggage carrier, very pleased-- will order more amazon basic items.
 The make is great, feels like it would last a while. Love the thick zipper, hefty straps. But this thing is SUPER baggy on an IPAD. I mean, my IPAD had a thick bluetooth keyboard on it and it just swims in it. Returned for sizing issues.
 Peferct fit for my chromebook and very well made.  The price is so cheap for the quality.  It is fully padded and affords decent protection to the chromebook.
 The girlfriend loves it!!! Fits her 10 inch tablet perfect!!!
 just what I wanted takes the laptop and the rest of my stuff.
 nice looking, great size, sturdy
 Exactly the right fit for my ThinkPad Yoga 11.5" laptop/tablet. Quality construction with ample features, shoulder strap, side pockets to hold charger and wireless mouse. Great product for the money!
 Fits my Acer E3-111-P8DW perfectly, and has room for all of the accessories I would ever want to pack.  After a year and change of use, I'm seeing only minimal wear.  Was well worth the money.
 I really don't like to write negative reviews and likes this bag but like the other reviews this bag is not well made.  It will come apart and not worth carrying anything of value.  It's cheaply made cheap bag.
 Nice little bag
 I'm Very Happy I bought this. Especially I love Shopping on Amazon. I Give 5 stars because it was on time and it even came very early that day. Very Happy how the item turned out. Like the colors and Good fix for my Laptop.
 It's a basic messenger bag, padding is minimal.  But it fits my laptop as expected and charger as well.
 nicely padded
 Exceeded my expectations, very nice.
 this case works very well i just wish it was made of a more sturdy and safety padded better. i use it for a mini 7" android netbook laptop we shall see how well this will hold up and how well it will protect my device. all in all for the price it should work well and hold up from use. only time will tell.
 Great quality. Lots of pockets. Smaller than it appears in the picture, which is a benefit. Fits my iPad and Macbook Air perfectly, and holds cables and power supple with not trouble. Well built.
 It fits well my laptop I like it
 A really nice bag for the price.  Fits my daughter's ASUS 14-inch laptop great.  She previously had a bag intended for a 15-inch laptop and likes this much better since it's less bulky.
 This is a very good quality case and is handling a beating well.  I use it to haul my iPad to work and all over the place, and it has plenty of room for a charge and multiple stylii in the external compartment.  It's easy to get the iPad in and out, and this offers plenty of protection for it.
 I really like this bag.  It fits my 17 inch laptop with Mouse and cord.  It could not fit much else but it is perfect for the few times I want to transport my large laptop outside the house.  Can't beat it for the price.
 Worth the money
 Great size for Surface Pro 3 and 4. After buying this for my sons chrome book and liking it so much I picked up two more our Surface Pro.
 fits well and looks excellent
 Great bag and arrived on time.
 I bought this bag for my new tablet and docking station gear. Most impressed with the quality, padding, and compartments. Carry handles and strap are good quality too. Very nice carry bag.
 i like this case. its light and feels sturdy. Good for the price! So far so good! fits my 15 inch lap well
 was trapped in a rain, and it protected my computer from getting wet!<br/>was impressed
 Fits my Dell 17" laptop perfectly.  Extra compartments allow me to travel with a mouse, Passport and several other accessories.  $20 well spent.
 very good
 Great basic laptop bag, just what I was looking for. Highly recommend it
 My laptop did not fit in this case, as I needed it for relocation purposes.  The bag is basic, though my 17.3" laptop was ready to explode out of the soft case.  This product is a means for minimal shelter for your less than stated dimensions of a laptop.  It is back to a towel, brown grocery bag, they work fine.
 This bag works perfectly with my new Toshiba Satellite C55-C5241 15.6 Inch Laptop! The bag appears to be sturdy and has enough room for additional storage of accessories.
 Adequate for the price.  A little more padding or rigid sides would be nice.
 Held up for 10 months with mild use, then stitching started to unravel.
 Nice material and lots of compartments to put your stuff.
 I purchase the bag for my dad's tab since he likes to go around with it but he carries it in a plastic bag. The bag easily can fit his 7 inch tab. When it comes to a larger tab such 10 in it may seem at bit crammed but its alright. It has an extra space for any other things that he would like to carry.
 I wanted to have big enough case to fit for my iPad with keyboard and this fits perfectly and small front pocket can hold some more stuff life charging cable, charger, stylus and so on.
 It's the perfect bag for the laptop I got for my husband for his bday. It's compact but roomy inside with lots of pockets for cords &amp; a mouse &amp; stuff.
 Very basic bag but works well for our purposes.
 Bought this for my 11.6" laptop and is really a great bag.  Seems well made and has several pockets.  Holds the computer, a mouse, medium sized headphones, and the power charger, plus my eyeglasses case.  Also, has a good padded shoulder strap.  Very happy with it.
 Bought this bag for my 11.6in laptop. It's durable and convenient, comfortable carrying.  I love this bag. Even has space for my 5 subject book and also has extra pockets. Thank you Amazon
 its basic and affordable
 Just what i needed to carry my work laptop. Good quality for the price
 I use this for bringing my laptop to work. It's not worth it, to be honest! I can't say there's any problem with resistance, but there's a screeching sound it makes every time I step. It gets very annoying, almost like carrying a bell with me.
 Well made and it's very useful when I take my tablet out in public. It fits my 10inch tablet just fine. I also use it for my note tablet as well.
 My convertible laptop fits great and this allows room for my mousepad, mouse, and charging cord. While I wish it was a cute pattern, the plain black is well worth the cheaper price while maintaining quality and space!
 Exactly what I needed.
 Very nice look and material!
 Very happy thank you
 Bag is small, yet carries a lot, has been durable for me.  The D rings leave a bit to be desired, as does the shoulder strap clips which do not rotate as easily as one would hope.  Overall, happy with this.
 When I hand out a laptop I always like to include a bag
 I got this for my wife's HP X 360 15.6 " laptop. She just needed something to place it in when not in use. The laptop fits in the bag without issue. It also has room for the charger with extra storage places for the mouse and slim portable dvd writer.
 Love it
 Great quality and great price. Accommodates my  laptop perfectly with room too spare for other office supplies.
 No la recibí
 I like the design and the different compartments.
 My laptop fits perfect and snug. Very well built and offers protection. I looked at 25 bags at bestbuy and target and can't come close to this for the price, a similar bag at best buy was $50
 Lightweight with just enough storage space. The shoulder strap pad has frayed and looks awful, after only a short time. I will have to remove it, or find another shoulder pad.
 Very nice carrying bag for the price!  I ordered this for my daughter to carry her school issued iPad in so it would be protected in her backpack. It fits a full size iPad comfortably and has a front zippered pocket for charger, accessories, etc.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
 This simple bag is everything we need! It has lots of space!
 Fits my 13 inch laptop perfectly fine.<br/><br/>If you use an external mouse like me, it may or may not fit without a bulge depending on the size of it. I guess this would affect mainly gamers, as my gaming mouse fits but with a bulge.
 NICE - awesome, fits my iPad Pro like a charm. This will also be perfect with a laptop for sure.....
 Good low-cost alternative. Holds everything I need including papers and books.
 If you are looking for a bag on a budget, this is your bag. There is not much storage on it, but it works perfect for carrying a laptop, power cord, and a few other small items if needed.
 The arm-strap connectors squeak.
 El material externo no es muy bueno, comenzo a deshilarse con poco tiempo de uso
 I bought this for a 15 inch HP laptop and it fits perfectly. And has plenty of room for cables, mouse, chargers, etc.
 Awesome, I love it
 LIked most of the bag's compartments. Disliked that the small handles flopped into the closest pocket, blocking the zipper mechanism.
 Have taken it on several trips, holds up well.
 Great case for an iPad Air with a keyboard. It is slightly larger the the iPad Air but if you leave the iPad Air on the keyboard the case is almost a perfect fit.  The additional outside pocket will fit not only the power cord and transformer but anything else you may want to include in it.
 Great for my laptop
 Tried this bag instead of my backpack. It looks so formal and nice. It has 2 zips, a small one for things like ear phones and chargers and the other for some hand books and documents. Also, there are two pouches on either side of where we put laptop, so that we can accommodate lots of office stuff in it.. Not your lunch box though
 Excellent bag for the cost.
 I little big for the 10" Apple with Armor case, butthe 10" doesn't have id. specs. But the extra pouch came in handy so I like this one a lot more. In fact I bought four more for fellow workers and their I pads/cords etc...
 Perfect for my Samsung 10.1" Galaxy tablet. Convenient handles are sturdy. Zippered pouch storage helps with earbuds and charging cables. Zippers are also solid and feel like quality.
 NICE BAG FOR THE MONEY
 Excellent bag, has slots for my folders for school, slots for my calculator, pens, and laptop.  The front pocket holds my charger and mouse.  I can also keep some femme products in the other pocket.
 VERIFIED PURCHASER-For the price it's a nice little case ( not highly protective) but looks nice and keeps things organized with a separate zippered pouch for accessories etc.  I use with a 7' kindle and it has more then ample room.
 Very nice case. It is well made and fits most 15" laptops easily. We plan to buy several of them.
 Does what it needs to.  Does not have great all around padding.  It is nice for the price.  If you are at all rough on equipment, you should invest in a better case.
 nice
 Very well made product, Just what I was looking for and Cheaper than any local store around me, Has plenty of room for everything I need to carry with me when away from home, You will not be sorry with this product.
 Just what I needed for my 11 inch Dell notebook. Excellent quality and a great price. I also purchased one for a Dell 13 inch laptop.I couldn't be happier.
 We bought this to hold my daughters school laptop​. It was padded and it fit her ChromeBook well. I highly recommend this
 LITTLE TO LARGE, BUT OK FOR THE MONEY
 Light weight and roomy. Love this bag. Can't beat it for the price. Wish the pockets in the middle section were a tad wider. My 11" Air fits; files fit; even putting files in the bag doesn't make it too heavy. That was a problem with my other favorite bag. And the loop on the back that slips over a luggage handle is great.
 Good bag but slightly tight fit for 17 laptop
 I got what i wanted, all i need now is a new laptop for it, although I can use it for my current laptop, but feels like a waste since its breaking down. Anyways its a great bag, and it has enough room for whatever I want to put in it. It serves its purpose as intended.
 A lot better quality than I thought definitely worth the 15 bucks
 It's not leather.
 Very nice &amp; Sturdy Bag!<br/>Oddly enough, it fits a 15in MacBook pro &amp; also a 17in MacBook pro!
 GRAT BAG, SIMPLE AND WELL MADE.
 perfect size fit's my 17" HP NOTEBOOK  GREAT
 Works perfectly with my ASUS T200 transformer with all the cords, bluetooth mouse, and other accessories. I can even squeeze my bluetooth speaker in there if needed. Good padding at key points.
 Love this case  it protects my tablet and has a nice pouch for all my connectors and cables.
 If you need something for light travel this is your case (it probably won't stand up to day in and day out commuting). It is light weight and relatively compact. However, it has plenty of space for cords, your mouse, etc. Best of all the price is unbeatable.
 I have both a 11.2 notebook (nearly a netbook) and a MS Surface.  This bag fits either of them. When I put the surface in the bag, there is a little extra room at the top of the bag.  The outside pocket is great for stowing the power supply and a couple cables.
 used for new rca tablet
 This was a gift for my niece. She seem to like it as a high school graduation
 I was so plesed with this purchase.  It was reasonably priced and is  well made. It holds my laptop, 2 tablets, &amp; all my cbles, cords, plus phone charger and doesn't look overstuffed.  It looks like it costs way more than it did. Definitely 5 stars.
 We have purchased dozens of these at my office for iPads.  They are a very good basic bag.  They look nice.  They are very durable.  No real complaints.
 Pretty happy with this bag, simple and organized. No frays yet after 6 months of ownership.
 Perfect
 Within a very short time, with very little use, the handle tore away from the case. Quality is inferior, and money is better spent on products that will last more than a few weeks of very light use.
 This bag is great for my dvd player'
 Quick Delivery. Works as advertised. Good material.
 This bag works well and performs its duties.
 My Ipad2 and my husbands Ipad mini easy fir in the main pocket.  In the small outside aippered pocket, I keep both chargers and my phone charger, along with my traveling reading light.  It is easy to carry on a plane or a bus tour.
 Great bag—roomy compartments with plenty of space. Handles are comfortable to hold even when bag is full. Didn’t use shoulder strap, but seems adequate.
 Very happy with this bag.  It is just what I needed for my Kindle Fire 7 with my new Kindle keyboard version 8.9 which are mis-matched size-wise but work great together.  Gives me a way to keep these items protected when traveling.
 T530 fits good. Cant beat it for the price.
 Broke 3 months later . Great style and pockets
 nuff said.  holds a laptop
 This case is a really great value for for the price, it's durable &amp; has adequate space for my current needs, I will need to upgrade to something larger later on &amp; I'll be buying it from Amazon!!!
 Great bags good size. Looks professional
 I bought two of these. It is attractive, very inexpensive bag with ample room for a laptop, tablet, charges, mouse etc.  It is well designed and made.  It is hard to believe an item of this quality comes with such a low price.
 I have this bag only for 3 months and its wearing out. I should expend 10 more buck to get a higher quality product.
 Its a simple, compact laptop case, but it works wonderfully.  My laptop fits perfectly inside and there is room for a few papers.  It feels durable so hopefully it will last.
 Somehow sturdy, I've seen better, I didn't expect much, so I'm not disappointed with the bad. It's great, used it for travel. Now I'm looking forward for a semester. Let's see how it holds up.
 Inexpensive, and has pockets and everything for my laptop, including instructions and discs fit in.  It works perfect for my Lenovo laptop.
 works as intended
 Nice bag, but no shoulder strap
 Ok
 Kind of cheaply made cushioning, but designed well, and fits my 13.3 mac-book really well.  Like the small interior pockets for accessories, large interior paper sleeve pocket, as well as the larger front pocket for extra storage. Light weight and compact.
 Perfect! Great value. Well made for the price and shipped much faster than expected
 The Amazon Basics laptop bag is THE best deal on the market.<br/>I have several of these from laptops as small as the MacBook Air all the way to my Dell 15" laptop.<br/>Plenty of room in side pocket for AC adapter, spare cables, etc.<br/><br/>Very well made.
 Fits perfets
 What A Great Bag-<br/><br/>This was a Gift for my daughter and she loves it.  It great for her to carry back and forth and she really loves the way it handles and protects her Laptop.  Great Buy!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>F.E. Manuel
 This bag is great and I am happy with my purchase.
 Love it
 Fits the 11.6 inch laptop like a glove, and has some extra compartments for other school/office supplies. Simplistic, yet stylish.  Fully recommend.
 This bag is fantastic. I saw similar bags for more than $260.00....The quality of the leather is second to none, it's small but It can stow plenty of my files and work accessories with the multiple compartments.
 this bag is exactly the right size and just as advertised. seem to be well made.
 This bag was a perfect fit for my tablet. Its sleek and lightweight, and had pockets for all my stuff. Feels well insulated as well!
 The description of this product is on point. The only thing that I really hated about this, is the material it was made of!!! I recommend investing on a higher quality product. But if times are tough, then this will do.
 Great item, has plenty of pockets for everything and then some.  My son uses it for his laptop, the adapter, his ipad, and other things when going somewhere.
 Good quality and fast delivery.
 I use this case to get 15.6" screen work laptop from work to home.  Does the job for what I use it for. Two spare pockets hold powers cables and other stuff.  Inside pocket can hold a fair amount of work papers.
 It's not a firm built
 Very good and inexpensive carrier for your iPad and a few extras. Gives a little extra protection. Side pocket useful for carrying the charger. I also have a charger for the Zagg keyboard attached to the iPad. Glad I purchased. Keeps it all from slipping out of my hands.
 Everything was ok
 This product would be most helpful to someone who may not have a ipad cover already.  Bought it for a work ipad which came with a very sturdy cover on it.  Have used it for out of town travel and will probably use it more as time passes, but have not given it a lot of use so far.
 Not much to it, and the clips/buckles feel a little flimsy.  I really only feel comfortable carrying my work laptop in this bag, not my $2,000 Alienware.
 I WAS HAPPY WHEN I GOT IT BUT WITHIN A YEAR THE SEAM ON THE HANDLE IS COMING APART AND EVEN THOUGH THIS IS AN AMAZON PRODUCT THEIRS NO OPTION FOR A REPLACEMENT.  TAKE CARE OF MY THINGS. SO NO ABUSE ON MY PART.
 Perfect for 11 in screen laptops or larger tablets but not both at the same time. If I put my mini laptop I can only put my small 7in tablet also. Good design.  Love it. Best deal,
 Just as advertised and perfect for my 11 inch Chromebook
 perfect
 I have always  had great shopping experience shopping on this site and this time is not exception.<br/>Thanks for providing shoppers with such clear insight to a world of wonderful reasonable price products.<br/>Eric Royes
 Roomy. Looks great.  Room for all my stuff besides my laptop. Seems durable.
 I like the convenience of being able to have tablet and tablet stand in one location.  Like the assortment of departments.  Like the fact that it has carrying handle and shoulder strap.  Would highly recommend it.
 Holds hubby's laptop just fine, looks good, and has room to hold whatever he needs with him when he's out and about.
 Great bag for the money.  Holds my MacBook Pro 15" and cradles it in comfort.  I can also throw in my iPad and iPad mini, although it gets cramped with all that stuff in there.  The entire case is padded except for the front pocket.  Definitely worth the money.
 Very well made. The 14.1 inch fits my Surface Pro 3 in a Metric USA sleeve perfectly! Room for the power supply, portable HD, VGA and HDMI adapters, some Flash Drives, cables, and my Nexus 7 for playing music and reading on airplanes. :) Great value.
 Great bag for the price. Fits my ASUS F555LA-AB31 perfectly, has plenty of pockets, and the shoulder strap feels great. AmazonBasics is KILLING the online shopping game
 Very good product, A +
 Great quality! Lots of space. Love it.
 Standard issue, basic bag for my laptop. No frills, but built to do it's job... laptop transportation. Adequately padded.  Does what it needs to.
 Loved this little bag; gave it to my parents with a Chromebook I bought them and feel comfortable that it will protect the machine well.  Has nice extra storage for charger, cables, and such, and is really solidly done for such an inexpensive bag.  I have had good luck with AmazonBasics before, and this is no exception.
 This bag is super functional and light. It made traveling super easy and organized. It's perfect!!
 Since when did Amazon start making bags? This bag is so cool that you won't believe its price. It is great in quality and big enough to hold an ipad or even a bigger notebook, but small enough to fit inside your backpack without much ado. It has another pocket where you can keep the charger, etc. I use it when I have to carry my ipad around the college but don't wanna carry the heavy backpack everywhere.
 Fits mt Lenovo Chromebook 11.6" perfectly !
 As expected
 Perfect. I use this for an old acer netbook I have. I've had this netbook sleeve for a year, and it's still a-ok. Power cord fits in the zipper pocket with room for a mouse and flash drives, if you want. Nice quality plastic zippers. Two zippers for main opening a huge plus. Would buy again. Highly recommend.
 Almost perfect.  Would have loved to have more front poutlch room for laptop accessories
 this is a amazing bag for the price.  it has 3 inner pockets, and 2 on the outside that that also have separate compartments.  I could put 3 tablets and all of their accessories into it.  it also comes with a shoulder strap.  it is definately worth the money.
 Perfect size and compartments for my hubby who needed something to keep his notebook and Bible and papers together for a class he is teaching.  Sturdy and the price was good, too. Not overly stuffy - and good that it can be wiped clean.
 Received this case today and love it.  Got all my laptop "stuff" inside, as well as my ipad and still have room left over!  Feels very well made, nice and sturdy with an adjustable padded shoulder strap.  Would definitely recommend this case to anyone....especially for the money!
 Love this bag, thanks to all the positive reviews..I have 2 kindles and charging plugs, ear plugs..plenty of room for more..great bag
 Excelent product
 Fits small laptop well
 Bags for 17" machines are hard to get let alone for an affordable price. This is great cheap, durable, serviceable bag
 I bought this case to hold my iPad Air + accessories.  It is a well made case with sturdy zippers.  The main compartment has plenty of room for the iPad with keyboard case attached.  In the side compartment  there is space for headphones, charger and stylus.
 Exactly what I needed and wanted.  Has lots of extra "pockets" for the cords and other things.  My laptop computer fits perfect so I know it will be totally protected.  Very, very happy with this laptop bag!
 My bag broke after a month of use. Fortunately​, Amazon was happy to give me a new one.
 Excellent product
 A friend of mine has had this bag for quite a while. When I got an iPad Air for Christmas, I immediately wanted a carrying case for it. The next time I saw my friend (who is never without his older iPad) he showed me his carrying case bag. It's holding up good as new after all this time and has a 2nd zippered pocket with enough room for the power cord and block, small notepad, pen and misc. paperwork. I was happy to see I could get the same bag style for my Air. A fantastic value, it's feather-light and durable. I love it.
 Good price for a good quality case
 Love it
 I got this item last month and I love it. Just what I been looking for to carry my laptop.<br/>NO more pillow case bags.
 I am in the senior..senior area.  I liked things when I grew up without computers and cell phones. Now it is a way of life, so I have adapted. This laptop is my first one, and so far it is working great. The case is useful and holds everything.  Now where did I put my pen.... Oh well, as they say try it and you may like it. Also, Amazon is the greatest company .... it is like a cloud company where if you want it they have it !!
 Works well, good quality.
 This is exactly what I was looking for. Large enough for my I-pad air OR my portable DVD player with all of the various cords and do-dads. It does everything I ask of it at a very reasonable price.
 Awesome case. Has a lot of hidden pockets to put in pens, etc. It also comes with a pocket that fits the extension cord for my HP Chromebook. I didn't know Amazon was in the accessory business until I bought this -- and I haven't been disappointed!
 This seems to be of good quality and It serves the purpose.
 Good product.
 Well worth the price.
 Fit my 17 inch HP laptop !
 It's ok. The design of the bag is good but the quality is not great.<br/>The zippers have started to tear after 6 months of use.<br/>For the money, it's ok.
 Got the 11.6-inch bag . It's really great . I use it for my I pad and some other stuff I need for work . If you want to put your laptop , I recommend a bigger size
 Definitely enjoyed the space it has. I love how it has a handle and strap.
 This isn't a bag for everyday use. However, if you just take it out every once-in-awhile (like me), this is perfect. The materials are adequate and the build quality is actually good. It doesn't look horrible, either.
 Good quality for the price. Might have more accessory pockets. (it has one)
 Great bag! Bought this for my dad to carry his iPad, glasses, phone, etc. This bag is big enough for the iPad 2. It's not too heavy for him and he really likes it for his "everyday" stuff. Sturdy and easy to carry.
 This bag was just right for my laptop.
 This item is listed as a buy together with the Sylvania SDVD1332 13.3-Inch Swivel Screen Portable DVD Player suggesting it is the correct size for the DVD player but it IS NOT. It's too small. Buyer beware.
 Outstanding value.  My go to when we go on trips.
 It is just ok. Light and no padding in it like what I have had in the past.
 Used this for an entire semester it was a excellent bag for the price the only thing that i had problems with was the strap kept twisting and no matter how many times i straightened it out
 I was looking for a sleeve type case for my Surface 3 Pro and couldn't find a suitable one here on Amazon. Came across this one and took a chance. Perfect Fit! With room for charger and more
 got this for a portable DVD player and it fits well. Nice size. Paddings not great but it was a good price and delivery was fast, it works well for what i got it for.
 Great value. I pulled and twisted the strap and do not see anyway it can pop off. I am very pleased with the quality received for the price paid.
 I bought this for my hp revolve 810.  It fits perfectly.  I have room for multiple dongles, a charger cord and my wireless mouse.  East to carry and has great quality.  I'm really impressed especially for the price.
 I bought this bag to carry my HP Chromebook 14, and so far I only have positive things to say.  The bag is sturdy, and simple but professional looking.  It's nothing special, but it's everything you need out of a laptop bag at a very comfortable price.  You could spend more for bells and whistles and fine Corinthian leather, but this is your best value.
 This bag is great. I recently took a trip to Ireland and used this as my carry-on bag. It held my iPad, documents, and a couple of books. It was perfect. The price is unbeatable.
 Great product and service, Amazon Basics is my go to search - really good price point as well as top quality.
 Bought this for our son. He didn't rave about the bag but did say it had sufficient padding and lots of compartments. And that he liked it overall. However now that he is off to college he's switching to the surface pro 3 and makes this unnecessary.
 Very nice fast shipping
 Excellent!!! Thank you
 As we only occasionally carry our iPad2 to another location,  I'm very pleased with this case as it does the job.  We have a CaseCrown Bold Standby case (Black) for iPad 2 which is outstanding, and even with the thicker dimensions,  it fits the Netbook Bag very well.  This is an outstanding value for a basic carrying bag.
 Even though it does not have locking tabs on the zippers, I figured how to lock it.  I have a Cooler Master U2 notebook cooler which just barely fits.  But really, I can't complain for $15!  For $15, it's pretty good.
 Worked great for my notary supplies, light but yet sturdy. Zippers and material are great quality!
 Good quality, good price; who could ask for more ?
 Nice bag. A lot of little compartments. Fit my Asus 15.6 perfectly.
 Ordered two of these cases and was very happy when I opened the box. They are very nice and were inexpensive. Nice material, not hard like the old cases. Came boxed very well in two different boxes inside and one outside box. Very nice!!!!
 Excellent. Little bag. And cheap. Great purchase. Holds the basic accessories.
 You will not find a better one, great price!!!!<br/>SUPER DEAL!!!!<br/>Thanks!!!
 Great quality and everything fits in it perfectly.
 It is a great carrying case for my new computer and other items
 This Tablet Bag comes in handy for carrying your laptop around to different places. The Bag seems to be well made, and I haven`t any problems with it yet.
 This fits the laptop mom got. Can carry all her stuff. Great for traveling and hospital stays. Good  material. Well put together.
 Didn't work for me. Bag is to small for my iPad Pro. If you have a smaller tablet it seems to be just fine.
 Great sturdy bag with great price.
 LOVE IT!  Especially for the price.  This product is great. A no frills do what you need bag.
 Perfect!
 Very nice product. Somewhat on smaller size but good for class or light work needs.
 Good
 Good product for the price!  Not super sturdy but it will get the job done &amp; it is a lightweight bag.  It was a tight squeeze to get the 17" laptop into the bag but it did end up fitting.
 great price and the perfect bag for my laptop and papers from work
 Bought this for my husband for his tablet. He's a man every opposed to a 'man bag' but thinks they're the best thing since the invention of sliced bread now, after using this one. He stuffs it fuller than I stuff my purse!
 I realize it's a "Basics" bag, but it is really small.  I can only fit my computer and a business checkbook in it.  I wish it had a little more space in it.
 Very good basic laptop carry bag.
 My son uses this as a backpack for school and it is holding up really well with how much he throws it around.  Holds all of his supplies no problem in it.
 I am a little disappointed in this case. It's super thin and I'm not overly confident in its protection power. It will do for what I need right now, but I wouldn't buy it again and will probably be buying a better quality one in the near future.
 Very nice and lite. Good quality with lots of space for different kinds of accessories.
 It was everything as advertised . I trusted the evacuations of those who had purchased it, and I am g,ad I did.
 Very useful and convenient.
 The bag does its job effectively but the plastic straps feel a bit weak and make a very irritating squeaking noice when rubbing against each other. If you're not planning on using the shoulder strap then it will be fine but the shoulder strap plastic is what brings me to my 2 star review.
 nice bag for the price.
 nice bag seems to be of decent quality. A 15.6 in laptop barely fits. Absolutely will not hold A larger one
 For the price, this really is a great buy. It has many minor cons, but most aren't functional negatives. First, this fits a Surface Pro4 with keyboard, charger, and a few books perfectly.  It has decent padding, three zipper compartments, organization sleeves in one of them, and all the standard features you would want from a laptop bag (including luggage holder strap on back), all in a pint sized bag. This bag is perfect for those that own and travel with a smaller sized laptop such as an ultrabook, Macbook, or Surface Pro and don't want to negate the compact size with a traditional laptop or messenger bag that is meant for the older style larger, thicker, and heavier laptops (3+ lbs, 15-17" screens, more than an inch thick, etc.).  It isn't necessarily the best looking bag, with a very odd bulge designed on the front (I'm guessing to allow for expansion in the front pocket), but overall, the bag is a very minimalist design (typical of most Amazon Basics products) with all black thick canvas and minor orange detailing and looks like most other black laptop bags (just smaller). I find it perfect for my traveling needs.  It isn't a very refined bag, but not gaudy and childish looking either. This is not a boardroom or interview bag, but a workhorse regular use bag that you want to work and not spend a lot on.<br/><br/>The only real con I have are the plastic swivel fasteners for the shoulder strap.  They don't swivel, at least not well, once weight is applied.  This means that I have to constantly manually readjust them when slinging my laptop bag on my shoulder because the swivel function doesn't work and causes the strap to be crooked.  This is a minor annoyance, but one that I actually think will get worse with time as you really just want something like this product to be an afterthought. With this annoyance, I have to think about it daily, every time I use it.<br/><br/>However, for $16.50 as purchased, you really can't beat the product if you are looking for a compact laptop bag that is durable and doesn't give up anything in the form of function.
 Not enough cushion.  It will carry the laptop, but not sure if it will protect it.  Also, the clips where the strap connects to the bag is plastic.  Feels like cheap plastic too.  I would look elsewhere.
 Great and roomy bag.  Use it when I travel for my laptop.
 I bought it for my sister and it was great if she just wanted her laptop and a few papers, pens, etc to go. It served its function, but she ended up wanting more room for other things and looked at getting a larger one that has more room for other items so she doesn't have to carry more than one bag.
 Very smart looking carry case.  Not a heavy protection bag so would suggest some other type of direct cover for the iPad or<br/>Netbook together with this "foamy" type of bag.  More of a traveling case than solely for protection.
 Very nice servers the purpose, after buying I see they have other choices of hard shell bags. They would protect ipad better, but for the price this is nice...
 I can fit my Alienware Alpha, power supply cables, controller, motorola lapdock, small keyboard, mouse, portable hard drive, laptop cooler, and a few other knick knacks in here without a problem.  It fits inside my carry-on and my backpack or you could take it by itself so it's easy to take on planes.
 Pretty cool bag that I use interchangeably as  a briefcase.  I do keep in mind that the insides can be ripped when I add folders with the computer.  It is a good size and pretty strong.
 This gel-like bag is going to protect anything inside if dropped.  The zipper pulls have a rubber coating, which makes it very nice to open with arthritic fingers.  I love this bag, and recommend it to keep your electronics safe &amp; sound.  The value is excellent for what you get.
 Great bag for the price!  It fits my 14" laptop along with all accessories plus notepad, etc perfectly.  Love that it is so light weight.  Looks to be very good quality and will be giving it a good workout soon!
 Come on amazon how basic can you get, cheaply so much so that you are afraid to use the for fear you might damage the product or in this case your laptop computer please don't buy this product you will be surely disappointed.
 This bag is great! Extremely reasonable price for the quality in my opinion. Have only had it a couple weeks so not sure how it will wear over time but as of right now, would highly recommend this to someone looking for a travel laptop bag.
 Fits my wife's HP Split X2 laptop with more spare space. AmazonBasic did a great job on this bag. It's a good quality laptop bag.
 Not bad for the price
 Great laptop carrying case for a low price.
 Perfect fit for the IPad, and what little paperwork I carry.
 Was looking for a nice bag to carry my 2 iPads, some paperwork.  I sometime drop the phone in the front.  Very happy and the case is well made. It's not huge, so check your sizes and make sure it will carry what you need.  I don't use the strap, just carry by the handles.
 Very nice.  Good quality.  Can't beat this price point for such a quality bag.  Bought two of these for our MacBook Airs and they fit great.  Ample cushioning on the inside as well.
 Amazon Basic bag is indeed basic very basic not worth it's $16 price tag. It's quality is like bags that comes free with stuff. Save your $16.
 Great little carrying case for my asus transformer t100! Enough space for the tablet with a smart case on, the keyboard, my jbl clip bluetooth speaker, the laptop charger, and a few small accessories!
 A little thin but serves it's purpose.
 Good laptop bag. The laptop section has two extra dividers to keep papers, it's a nice feature. With my old laptop bag I had to put my papers in the same compartment as the laptop, they always got mashed up. The three small pockets in the middle section are great for my mouse, charge adapter, and business cards. There is also a pocket on the outside that's great for small stuff. 30% less than my old clunky bag. Love it!.
 It fit my 17" computer perfect and good price!
 I really, REALLY wish this bag had a strap, but the bag "as is" is very nice.  It works perfect for my daughter's iPad Air, and it helps to ensure its safety as she walks the halls and carries it to and from her classes and the bus.
 Great product!
 VERY GOOD..
 I kept losing or misplacing my stylus, so I wanted a bag for protection and papers too.  This has a side pocket that is handy for that, and the padding protects the iPad nicely.  Slightly large, but works great at a great value.
 This laptop bag is just perfect for my small laptop ( 2015 Newest Model Lenovo Thinkpad 11 Business Laptop).  I am really pleased with the quality and the price.  It is too small for file folders, but that's not what I wanted it for.
 We got a laptop w/ a large screen for my son, and then could not find any bags locally that fit it.  This one is great.  Fits well, padded well, good storage, sturdy.  Great product.
 Ordered this for a work laptop because I wanted protection but didn't want to spend a fortune. Looks professional and Carries nicely with room for everything. I got the black one, my coworker got the pink one, which is a great looking bag. Had I seen the pink one first it might have been a difficult decision. Either way, black is always good and looks professional - and you just can't beat the price!
 Get's the job done. I travel a lot for business and am paperless, so I didn't need a huge briefcase. It is so easy to travel with if you don't have a lot of components or paperwork and a small laptop. Convenient, inexpensive, useful.
 Perfect size, perfect amount of pockets, it's just so perfect! I love the size of it and I can carry my charger, my mouse, and the keyboard in this bag.
 This is an excellent bag. Not too heavy.its sturdy and fit my 17" laptop with room to spare.
 For the price this is a great laptop bag! Holds the power supply and all the cords that you need in the second zippered pocket. Only thing I wish they would change is the small pockets in that second zippered area - they're too small for a mouse (well, maybe one of those tiny laptop versions would fit). So, a little more ability to organize would be nice, but really can't complain. It's pretty lightweight too.
 bag is fine in quality but shoulder strap pad is useless. It has no grip so it just slides around your shoulder, off your shoulder- does not stay put so if you decide to put it over your shoulder, it wont stay there long and you'll end up using the regular carry handles all the time.
 Thanks
 Convenient and durable
 God basic case for my laptop that gives room for a mouse, flash drives, cords, etc.<br/>Made of durable material, well put together. Strap is strong and clips won't in lip prematurely. (I don't know what other reviewers were talking about--???)<br/>Will not protect against dropping the case, but what does for the $?
 Simple
 I got a new laptop for Christmas. The bag I had for my old laptop was too small so I had to get a bigger one. This laptop bag is amazing quality.
 Fits a 13" laptop perfectly and additional pockets can be used to store other accessories.
 Very well made, well designed and light weight for traveling.  The best I have seen.
 Bought bag for my portable TV/DVD player
 I like this bag, it's just as good as a lot of 50$ bags I have purchased.  Lots of storage space which is great for traveling.
 I love Amazon Basics!  I have bought several items from AmazonBasics and been very pleased with all.  This little bag is just right.  Good quality construction.
 My laptop is a snug fit in this bag, and there isn't a lot of extra storage space for any bulky items, but the bag is well equipped and well organized for smaller items such as pens, highlighters, etc.
 Sturdy yet soft and light. Great quality. Very happy
 Worked perfectly for my ministry bag.
 Perfect for the new fire 10 tablet.
 Wonderful! Very roomy!
 This case fits my Kind Fire 8.9" perfectly. I have a bluetooth keyboard case that fits right next to it, so I can keep all of my accessories in one place. It is nice and soft, so I won't have to worry about it scratching anything. What a great value, well done Amazon!
 Great bag for  a 17 in laptop at a good price.
 This is the perfect IPAD 1/2/3/4 Case.  You can carry your IPAD in soft and secure comfort and it has a front pocket that will hold the power cord, pens and even a small notepad.  Gotta love it, especially at the price!  One thing that would make it perfect is if the edges were hardened just a bit.
 I had the smaller size of this particular bag.  I bought the bigger one like this for my wife...I liked it so much, I had to get one too.  These are high quality for a great price.  The two additional pockets are perfect for your cords and accessories.
 This case arrived today (two days early, kudos to Amazon). Upon unwrapping it, I immediately tested it out with my iPad 2. I found that, as some others have said, there was a decent amount of extra room, but it still felt streamlined enough that I was comfortable carrying my iPad around in it. Also as some others have said, there is a chemical odor in the inside of the case. However, it can only be noticed when your face is very near. Finally, I noticed that the wire holding the zipper pulls onto the zipper was fairly thin, and I think there is a VERY SMALL possibility of them breaking in the future.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very good product and I look forward to carrying my iPad around in it.
 Have always been very happy with AmazonBasics products, but cannot say that about this bag. Unable to zip close. Acer 17.3 laptop will not fit into this bag. Build quality is excellent, but very little, if any, real protection at all 4 corners. Very disappointed. Cannot recommend.
 Great mini laptop case for the money spent! Our 11.6" mini fits in it perfectly! Can't beat the free 2-day Prime shipping. Plenty of room in this little case for the small portable DVD drive, laptop power supply, a few writable DVDs, portable mouse, USB stick, phone charger, small headphones and extra cables, etc. It looks just a little stuffed after all that, but the zippers still close easily. This little case has made our flight and car travel very compact and easy!
 great for longer trips. Can hold all of my chargers, USB drives, portable charger, papers, and even a one-subject journal. Highly recommend!
 This bag is pretty compact and made well for the price.  Not a ton of padding, so I would recommend some sort of neoprene sleeve.  This bag has three compartments on the interior and 2 outside pockets for accessories.
 Great laptop bag. AMAZING price. Honestly thought it was going to feel cheap and flimsy. Its build &amp; material quality, is close so maybe a Victorinox or Swiss Gear, laptop bag.
 Holds tablet + keyboard comfortably (Asus Transformer), with room for my Kindle Paperwhite in a leather case of it's own. Side pouch is perfect for phone, chargers, wallet, etc. Well built and highly recommended.
 love it great value
 The only case that actually makes sense.
 I purchased this case for my Samsung 12.2 tablet and it is wonderful, especially the price!  It is a little big for the tablet but that's OK, I would rather have it a little loose inside than tight. A lot of extra zippered pockets too, quality is tops!
 Amazon for the win here.  An excellently designed bag.  Front pouch, center pouch, plus the middle interior for the laptop.  Mild padding and solid stitch-work for the price.  A definite winner in the value category.
 My Acer c720 fits prefect inside this carrying case even while being inside Amazon sleeve b for Chromebooks. I also have a home and portable charger and aux plug in the bag and it's so light. Great for the money.
 This product arrived with expected quality. It fits my Chromebook perfectly with additional room for notes or a book. I like its design and simplicity. I am going to find out it's durability as well.
 good stuff
 Is what is should be.
 I had wanted a case for my iPad that made it easy to carry around, provided basic protection and had a spot to store accessories.  The first two were easy enough to find (at 2 to 3 times the price of this case), but not all three.  There is nothing fancy about this case, but it works and it is inexpensive.  I am a big fan of Amazon Basics now
 This is a nice case, especially for the price.  It actually fits my laptop and iPad due to having divided spaces in the main compartment.<br/><br/>The only thing I wish they had added would be a clip for my car keys and pen pockets.
 good bag grate size and dose well for what I need it for
 Great little bag for my 13" laptop and teh  necessary external harddrive (for photos) and all the  cords!
 I honestly like this little bag more than I anticipated. the material is great, neoprine, and the size of the interior zippered part is large enough for my iPad with the Zazz keyboard, a small book, and a small notebook. Just right!
 There is NO PADDING inside the case!  I dropped the bag 2 feet from a concrete floor and the corner of my Macbook that was inside the case was slightly dented, plus the case actually was cut through in the corner.  The case offered NO PROTECTION!
 Works well , very handy and easy to pack up computer for travel.
 I love all the different compartments.
 Not a lot to say about this bag.  It works great, and amazon sells it at an amazing price.  If you go to a place like Target or Walmart, the same type of bag with all the same features is 3-4 times as much money.
 Ok so the back looks great and is exactly as pictured. However two weeks in the padding for the shoulder strap had the seems fail and caused a tear in the stitching. Slightly disappointed.
 This bag was good but it was a bit bulky for what I needed it for. It has extra space at the top and along the sides. I needed a slim bag to transport my Surface Pro 3 to and from work. Its an amazon product so returning item was smooth and quick. If your looking for slim try the Case Logic bag. It is what I bought after all and I love it!
 It's aight. The inside pockets are kind of a pain though.
 Perfect fit for the Acer 11.6" Chromebook. Well padded and has enough pockets to carry a few extras. Well worth the price.
 I purchased this as a travel "bag" for my 7" Samsung Tablet.  The case is somewhat large but after reading other reviews, I added 2 layers of 3/8" foam, shielding all sides and holding the Tablet securely.  I had previously tried other smaller cases but my Tablet would inevitably turn on and drain the battery.
 This is a wonderful laptop bag.
 Love it
 I have a 17.3" Acer Aspire V17 Nitro. I goes in the bag but stretches the bag at the end corners of the laptop alot. I expect the stitching to give out very soon on the zipper due to the bag being too small for my laptop, maybe the zipper will just blow out? Doesn't really fit 17.3" laptops maybe... at least not mine.
 This is one of the best purchased I've ever made. Don't let the price fool you, this is an amazing bag. It is big enough for my MacBook Pro 15". It also fits the charger and even an iPad. The case is also durable. I've dropped it, got it dirty, and it still holds up.
 Fits 11.6 Chrome Book perfect
 This thing is an absolute steal for the price.  My 15.6" laptop fits in there perfectly even with the sleeve that came with the laptop.  Well padded and has plenty of space for the essential accessories.  Then you factor in the price and this is a must have.
 decent low cost bag, works...
 Good, sturdy bag.
 Nice basic laptop bag- no frills workbag.
 It was fine but returned as we returned the DVD players as it didn't meet the recipients needs
 Bought this for my 5th-grade son to carry his laptop, folders, etc. to and from school. It serves him well; I'd give it five stars if it weren't for the fact that the pad on the strap has already begun to fray. The rest of the unit is holding up well, though!
 Works well
 Bought this to put my Microsoft surface tablet in.  Made well, price was great and tablet fits well.
 This is exactly the right bag for me. Nothing fancy, just right for today's 13" laptops, ample room for a power brick, wireless mouse and a bunch of little things, papers, pens, etc.
 Perfect for the laptop I just purchased.
 Perfect fit, and light weight.
 This 17inch lap top bag thus far has worked well with my 15 inch dell lap top. I use it daily,  It has 2 extra storage compartment that zip up for cord and extra stuff , plus it's light weight but durable. So happy thus far, I would recommend for sure, was reasonably priced too.
 fit perfect for my lap top gateway nv73
 I simply love it
 Perfect for my needs--small enough for the PC, which is small, and enough pockets to carry what I need and an unbeatable price.
 No Comment
 You get what you pay for. This bag is not heavily padded, its not fancy. It's bare bones and will get you by fine if your not hard on it. It seems to be put together well. I expected it to be a little more padded though.
 Great Value for the Money, Perfect fit for the 11.6 Chromebook. Additional compartment for a 7 inch tablet.Room for power cord and mouse.High quality materials very well made and a nicely thought out design.I never bought an Amazon Basics product I didn't like.
 perfect for the Sylvania sdvd1332 13.3 inch Portable dvd player.
 Nice case and fits my Acer chromebook 15 just right and has a zipper compartment for my I-pad!  Highly recommend!
 Very good bag at an outstanding price. No fashion statement here, just good quality &amp; functionality.
 Roomy and holds laptop, power cable, mouse. There are additional pockets and room for anything else you may need to carry with you.
 bought it when my dog ate my work bag, works well with additional pockets for notes, lunch
 Great option
 Very nice - fits my tablet perfectly
 The reason for the 4 stars is that I purchased this for an iPad air however when the iPad was not in a thick smartcase (ie. Logitech case with keyboard) it was swimming around in this bag without adequate protection so unfortunately the product was returned.  However if you are purchasing to hold, house and travel with your iPad air in a decent size iPad smartcase then this is the right product for you!  Plus it has an exterior pocket which is very convenient for the charger!
 Nice basic bag, not too bulky but sturdy enough for its intended use. Comparable to my case logic.
 I like the material and the layout of the bag, however after using the bag for less then two months the pad on the shoulder strap has started to to fall a part at the seams.
 Fantastic price &amp; honestly a lot stronger quality then I thought. I use this bag everyday &amp; I even use it as my default bag &amp; no longer use my Swiss army brand bag.<br/>LOVE THIS!!!
 Great bag for a great price. I wanted to get a bag in a different color, but this bag is way nicer for a much lower cost.  Worth the sacrifice hah!
 Fit perfect for both laptops
 A perfect fit for my Dell 2 in 1 laptop/tablet. Sturdy, well constructed and lightweight it is exactly what I had imagine I wanted. I find it to be perfect for my use as a teacher and sometimes board member and trainer on I T matters.
 For the price, this isn't a bad option for a small laptop.  The front pouch also provides plenty of room for your charger.
 I got this for my mom and it is exactly what she wanted and needed for a fraction of the price. Good quality and storage. I would recommend
 I bought this product for my 13in laptop and it also fits my school stuff. Definitely worth the money and the material used is pretty amazing too
 Nice low price bag. I fit my 15" laptop, lapshelf, mouse, and charger in it just fine. Seems to keep everything in place and protected. Bought one for me and my girlfriend. Best bang for your buck.
 Perfect fit
 My computer fits perfectly in this bag.
 I wanted something that would protect my precious new iPad when I wasn't using it, and also a place to keep its recharger to keep my cats from getting it.  This is the perfect fit for what I needed.  I keep my iPad in it when I am not using it (I can hardly put it down, though) and keep it next to my chair.  The cats can do no harm!
 Reliable, well made. Simple and plain with no fancy stuff. Great value for the price.
 well this will work for my 7'' tablet but i think it would be better suited for a 10'' tablet or netbook. the main reason i bought this one was it had an extra pocket for the cord, as we all know these days we have all these different cords laying around our places and forget which goes to what.
 I read a lot of reviews on bags to carry my iPad air in and decided to give this one a try. What a great carry bag at a truly awesome price. Amazon hit the nail square on the head with this one..excellent padding, great heavy duty zipper and the handles seem heavy duty also.
 I got this for the laptop I gave my brother and not only did he love the laptop.....he LOVED this case.  It fits the 15.6" laptop beautifully and seems to be very well made and rugged.<br/><br/>GREAT for the money.  Does the job, nicely.  Thank you.
 Really impressed with the quality of this case for the price, love all the compartments for storing accessories also seems to have added padding for protecting laptop
 Perfect for my needs, low cost and well made
 Not bad for this price.  Very light and contains many helpful compartments for work.  Seems weather proof.  I walked out in the rain with it a few times but you can pretty much wipe it off. Wish I could've ordered a more feminine color though.  I'd still recommend this over the standard bulky, heavy and ugly bags.
 I bought a Targus padded iPad case for my iPad that I loved.  Then I dropped iPad and cracked the very edge of glass so bought the survivor case.  It is great but did not fit the Targus padded case.  Soooooo I ordered this one and iPad with survivor case fits great with a little room to spare.
 Really good value for money laptop bag.<br/><br/>The material used is nice and the interior of the bag is quite spacious for its size. Not too bulky but slim and spacious.<br/><br/>The bag is only $4 more than the notebook sleeve, better buy the bag!<br/><br/>Laptop barely fits my Acer V17 nitro, but 17.3" laptops vary in size and there is no set standard since they often always are desktop replacements
 Found it sturdy made. The inside pockets sleeve for placement seems hard sometimes to put your laptop in. Had to add an zipper pull to the existing one. Problems pulling it open or close. For the price was reasonable.
 Excellent buy! Good Job Amazon! Well made plenty of space, light weight, good for the office, good price and more! Beats some name brand cases that are similar. They better start being more competitive. :)
 Great product.  Well made.  Very strong fabric. Very functional.  Has everything needed for a 15.6 laptop case. Can't beat the price.  Highly recommended!
 The handle broke after 2 weeks of use! Unfortunately i was too busy and on the move too often to request a refund
 I got this bag for my fiancee so he may use with his IPad.<br/>Great product, fits your IPad perfectly in there, the zipper in the front even allows you to put a camera there when you travel. I bought this about 4 months ago and we are using it a lot. The product is great.
 The laptop bag was better than expected. Well worth the money, and worth paying the same day delivery - keep up the great work
 Amazing bag for the price! Holds my laptop, charger and mouse very easily and is never bulky. Its also very sterdy and light weight which was a must for me, anything to heavy duty would add to the weight I have to lug around. An all around great product!
 Nice fit for a Samsung Chromebook 2 13.3.  Inner sleeve pocket of main compartment fits it like a glove.  Using the main compartment leaves about an inch, total, at the ends and 2 inches at the top.  Nice fabric.  Bag is thick enough to carry recharger, but it will bulge out the side a little.  I give it 5 stars for being the best VALUE.  You might find one a little better but it will cost 2 or 3 times as much.
 Great! Simple / ergonomic design, affordable. Offers sufficient protection for your expensive investment. You can't go wrong with it...
 So far so good  -  I am impressed that it hasn't torn or had the stitching undone.  Nice job.
 Works great, and for the price is exactly what I was looking for, for my laptop.  Padded on the inside for a little extra protection, but it is not super protective, just a little.  Nice bag though.
 Well constructed computer bag, fits all of the cords, the computer AND the cooling fan!!  Yea Amazon...another score with your products!!
 All right  for the money. Has number of compartments to accommodate charger. Not fan of the fabric but it is practical and holds my chromebook just fine
 The bad is poorly made and flimsy.  The strap twists and the pad is also poorly made and is extremely uncomfortable.
 Great bag for lugging around a MacBook and 9.7 iPad with case.  Plenty of space for chargers, cables, and mouse.  For the money, this is a hard deal to beat.  It met all my need and proved reliable.
 I use this for my ipad air2 with its protective case and still has plenty more space.Light weight,easy to clean, has an outside pocket which is great for any items that might scratch your electronics.
 everything is fine
 I was thrilled when I saw this case in different sizes and ordering the proper size for my particular application was a breeze. The quality, materials, and workmanship are top class and first rate. A beautiful case at a reasonable price. How could I lose?
 I bought this fort my Surface Pro 3. It does work, but it is a very snug fit (with a case and the pen holder) and it takes me a while to get it in there. I wished it was a bit bigger.
 Excellent room for on the go / Getting ready to take a trip out west / Looking forward to everything I can keep neat and easy to find.....Did I metion the price was AWSOME.  My  wife paid double for hers and likes mine twice as much.
 Great bag, basic but if you are looking for a good affordable lap bag, this is it.
 Looks great. Feels great. Very functional. You can easily fit your iPad, chargers, and other items in the main pocket or in the side pocket. We use this when traveling or just when we're on the go. AmazonBasics makes some very good products and this netbook bagis no exception.
 Great size - wish it had the softer fabric that the smaller one I purchased a few years back had inside, instead of the cheap plasticky type fabric lining this one.  But it fits my phone, ipad, and kindle dx beautifully!
 great bag, quality.  holds bot and more
 Extra compartments for mouse, cables etc. keeps everything together.
 This is the perfect case for my new laptop.  It is lightweight and yet sturdy.  I only wanted a carrying case to protect the computer when we are traveling.  This worked great!
 Good
 I purchased the 11.6 inch laptop bag for school. The laptop fits perfectly in the bag, but it is a tight squeeze to fit in my graphing calculator and laptop charger, much less any other accessories. The very compact size is the only drawback of this bag. Otherwise, this is a very well-constructed product. I most likely purchase a slightly larger Amazon Basics bag.
 Great Product! very pleased A++++
 Impressed with the quality of this laptop bag. I believe this will outlast many laptops.
 The bag really did what it was supposed to do with no issues whatsoever as I took my laptop with me in it for a vacation overseas, it performed perfectly!
 Great laptop bag and a such a low price
 Product really looks and feels awesome. Didn’t know if it would be the right size, but it worked out perfect.,
 This bag is the perfect size for my 10.5 inch tablet. It has plenty room. I also store my usb cables with charging block and Bluetooth headphones. The bag is really small but men it does not look like a murse just a mini computer bag. Great job Amazon.
 It's just the right size to carry 2 Kindles and miscellaneous items. Great value.
 Was as stated. Was all that I need to carry my Dell 17.3 computer. Was concern that computer would not fit. No problem.
 I am a fan of Amazon basics products and this one is a really good laptop case. It's been a year and it's still in good condition.
 Great little bag, for $10 it does it's job very well and looks and feels good also.
 Great bag for the laptop at an affordable prize.  Finding amazonbasics items to be of good quality at a decent price.
 Seems like a great, basic bag. Nice amount of protection in a relatively lightweight package and a cheap price tag.
 I got this to go with an 11.6 Acer and it's great. I go to work early (15:00 am) and it's nice not to have to carry a big bag with my computer. It has just the right amount of storage for mouse, cord, pins, paper etc....<br/>Thanks<br/>J MGL
 A quality padded bag that can be used for any number of electronic devices, or whatever you want to carry and protect.  You can't beat the price for such a high quality product.  Get one, use it, and you'll find a use to justify getting another.
 I use the heck out of this thing when I fly.  Be advised though, that the trade off you're making is space.  If you pair this lightweight bag with a lightweight device such as a 13 inch macbook air or tablet, you can also comfortably fit a notebook, pens, and other odds an ends in here.
 Searched everywhere for a case large enough for my 17 in laptop and then found this. Does the job just fine. Enough pockets.
 Love it, very spacious
 This is a lot of case for the money.  I bought it for my Acer Aspire E 15.6" laptop and it fits perfectly.  The case is well made with plenty of compartments and pockets to carry accessories.  I would definitely recommend this product.
 A very nice case comparable to other more expensive cases.  My Levono just slips right in as if the case were made for it.  Very pleased.
 I bought this for a Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 and it fit perfectly.  I wanted something small that actually fits inside a larger carry on bag if needed to travel.  Plenty of padding and a bonus side compartment for cables.  Price is great also.
 Fits my 15" Toshiba Satellite C855D perfectly.  Does what it needs to do.<br/><br/>Has more than enough pockets for the charger and my car diagnostic cable.
 I bought this so I could transport my Acer Iconia A500 (inside of another case / keyboard combo) between a friends house and mine. It has served those functions perfectly, and there is a ton of extra room I was not expecting. Would definitely recommend this item.
 This bag is great we have it for my sons Nabi dream tab  and it works great the handles are awesome because he can carry it to wherever we're going there's also a little pocket in front that holds his charger it works really well
 I have a 17.3 inch laptop and the bag holds the laptop without a problem. Nice bag for the price! It will do the job.
 Perfect fit for my Acer C720 Chromebook. The power cord fits in the outside compartment, and there's even just enough room for a book to fit in there.
 I bought this to use with my Archos 101 tablet.  I was looking for a case that would protect the device and have a spot to store the charging cable.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- This bag is just long enough to fit the Archos 101<br/>- The side pocket on the outside works for the charging cable as well as other small items.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Minor con is that the width of the case is a good bit larger than my tablet but it doesn't appear to be an issue other than extra size.<br/><br/>Also, I didn't really think I needed the handles but have actually used them more than I expected.
 I love this holder! It is so convenient for me. I now have 2 of these. Holds my iPad, phone &amp; my small notes. I keep a few other items in the zippered compartment as well.
 A very inexpensive case and really provides the basic amount of protection and storage. It works for me because I don't carry my laptop much.
 very nice for the money
 This case looks like your standard laptop case but is the correct size for an iPad. The main zipper section has two dividers in it keeping notepads/docs organized.
 Very sturdy  carrying case I like it very much
 Perfect size for the kids iPad air/II w/ charging components (battery pack/cable) &amp; accessories (skullcandy headphones w/ headphone splitter). We do a lot of educational time on the iPads.
 Excelente producto!!!!
 Really nice bag. Perfect for the office and on the road.
 excellent
 Amazonbasic bags are well made, I have several different types and they don't disappoint.  I recommend to others.
 We got this to carry a small, portable DVD player for when we travel.  It works great and well made for the price.
 Great price, well built, and has all of the space and pockets I need for my giant 17.2 inch laptop, papers, pens, business cards, calculator, etc. Also has a sturdy and comfortable strap.
 Perfect bag.
 Great value... works as advertised. I highly recommend this item.
 Nothing special about this bag really, it just simply does what you need for a good price.<br/>I use it for my Ipad and MS Surface Pro. Just the right size, with alittle protective padding without being too bulky and large.
 Exactly what I needed.  It's the perfect step up from a laptop sleeve, carries more stuff without being too bulky. Price and quality can't be beat
 Nice bag.  Holds my 11 inch laptop plus papers and folders.  Just the right size.
 good
 Perfect bag. Great price! Convenient
 This is a great bag. It fits my tablet, 11 inch chromebook, and 14 inch work laptop.  Its not a big bag but it fits all of those items.  Definitely recommend.
 Our 17" Toshiba laptop, Tenswall 17" cooling pad, Microsoft Mouse, power cord, and mouse pad all fit very nicely into our AmazonBasics 17.3" laptop bag with room to spare if it's needed.
 This bag holds my ipad 4 and keyboard case. Chargers, cell phone, and other items with plenty of space left over. The bag is heavly padded, offering me peace of mind if I drop my bag. Very pleased with my purchace.
 So far pretty solid construction. Not as fashionable or nice as a sleeve but gets job done. Has enough pockets for even the heaviest user. Well thought out.
 Perfecta  y cómoda para la computadora
 Great bag. Lots of pockets, plenty of space for your bulkier laptops
 AMAZING product! It is a great price and very well made!!
 it's so so
 wooks well not much room for anything else
 This is a nicely insulated case. However, the accessory pocket for the portable mouse and power cord is not quite deep enough for the bother the power cord and portable mouse. The tablet storage is pretty tight too.
 Love my bag! Durable so far, good pockets for chargers and wireless mouse and nice size handles to hold it while carrying. The size I got holds my smaller size laptop and an iPad (or Kindle) easily without feeling over packed. It is lightweight and does exactly what I need- protects my laptop when traveling.
 Not bad
 Great laptop bag and it is very light and durable.
 as described - very useful
 Excellent quality
 Perfect.
 This bag is perfect to store &amp; haul around my iPad with keyboard and portfolio case. The fit is right on, and it has a pocket for my cables &amp; charger. The over all quality is way better than I expected, and you just can't beat the Amazon price. I must admit, if I were to use it for just the iPad this bag would be a little to big, but for my needs perfect.
 I love this bag! My 17" laptop fits great in it, as well as my power cord and mouse, and it is light and well made!  Good price, good quality!
 Works great and quality isnt that bad for a cheap bag.
 Computer with plugins fit fine.
 Excellent value.
 I bought this and the mouse, they are great.  For the price you cant find much better!
 An amazing laptop bag for the price. Durable material, lots of pockets and compartments. Dual handles give option for carrying.
 Has a lot of space for accesories (mouse, cds and cables), I even carry my 10.1 tablet and a portable hard drive inside without struggle , fair quality for the price, it does not look bad either, pretty happy with it.
 Fits a 10 inch and two 7 inch tablets with cases on them! Plus there's room for styluses, a mouse, a portable keyboard and then there's also a side pocket zipper. This is the nicest tablet case I have ever had or saw.
 This bag was perfect for my new Chromebook 14.  Everything fits into it perfectly so I am able to carry all of it together.  It is also padded and has a padded shoulder strap which is most helpful when traveling.
 Perfectly sized for a small laptop, almost too perfect.  Could use an extra 1/2" all around for my Lenovo 140E.  Adding a charger, mouse, and small accessories is possible but very tight in this bag. Good value
 I expected it to feel and look pretty cheap, but I was wrong.<br/>For the time being, I believe this product is worth the money.
 I am very pleased with my purchase of the Amazon basics laptop carrying bag. Plenty of room for my laptop and I can even put my tablet in this same bag. Comfortable shoulder strap, I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for an affordable and good working laptop carrying bag. Again I am even surprised my tablet and laptop fit in this bag with no problem.
 I bought this for my grandson and had to purchase another one for myself!  Quality is exceptional and it is big enough to store my iPad along with the keyboard and my notebook for school plus other supplies!
 Perfect price &amp; product except that the inner lining is a little thin. This isn't a problem for a casual user, but could be for a heavy duty user. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE that it has so many pockets inside and two outside.
 All of the Amazon Basic Bags are great! I have several and they work for my laptops and tablets. You can't do any better for the price!
 it's okay. not great quality just enough to get the job done. the strap and the loops it attaches to are lacking.
 So far so good. My husband uses this bag daily to tote his work laptop.
 Great little bag and a very good price. I only wish it came in different sizes or were a bit smaller as it is a little baggie for the iPad Air otherwise it is an excellent product at very good price. Highly recommended.
 The name suggests it all amazon basic. The bag seems cheaply constructed especially the handles along with the fabric used inside . does not seem like it can bare much weight. Thought because it was amazon much more . guess I expected too much.
 This is a "no frills" laptop bag just as advertised. It works perfectly for transporting a laptop and some miscellaneous items (mouse, etc.). This bag clearly isn't intended to take abuse, so if you are looking for something to offer significant protection I wouldn't recommend this product. However, if you are just looking for something that will help you get your laptop from point A to point B, there's no reason to spend more.
 Great value for the money. I have been using it now for over a month and it is holding up very well.
 Bought this for my IPad Air 2. My IPad is in an Fintie  case and there is plenty of room, I also keep a small keyboard and all chargers in this case. Also, love that it has a shoulder strap.
 Straight to the point, seems like a decent bag...took a risk, 14inch didn't fit my 15.6inch laptop so I'll shell out some extra bucks and order a different size.
 Grat bag for laptop I bought my grandson for college. He wanted something that wasn't too big or bulky.
 Very well made, and at this price.  Many pockets inside and out.  Very functional at 1/2 the price of branded bags.
 it fits all my attachments that I have for my lap top
 Exactly what I needed for my 17" laptop.  Really well made for the money.  Excellent value!
 Very good bag.  Hold my laptop.  Just wish there was more pockets thus 4 star.  Otherwise good.
 This is absolutely the best buy for best value.  Holds my 17 inch laptop perfectly.  The extra pockets help to store cords, phones, and cordless mouse.  Anyone should be pleased with this AmazonBasics 17-3 inch Laptop Bag.
 Quality material. 13" Macbook Pro fits perfectly inside the bag. Has extra pockets for other laptop accessories - flash drives, external hard drives, chargers, etc. Strap is comfortable when slung around shoulder, and the product itself is made of lightweight material so it doesn't really feel like you're carrying anything in addition to your laptop.
 Very protective and nice! I like its compact size and many pockets. Like it better than my case logic laptop bag, which is considerably bulkier for the same size of laptop
 Great!
 needs a little more padding in the lap top area.
 I could not be happier with this little bag.  I have an HP Touchpad and it fits perfectly in here for taking places.  Its the perfect small size bag and the outside zipper holds my touchstone and house chargers plus a couple of styluses.  Great great bag!
 It fits my 11.6 chromebook very well! I'm not a sleeve person and I like to have more pockets with the case so I can bring my business cards and pens and stuff. This fits my needs very well although my girlfriend complains it's a bit too big for her. Well I have to admit that this is not very girly but it works on me.
 great value
 Good laptop bag.  No extra frills and no real inside small compartments however.
 Just got it, seems ok
 I searched all over for a case to keep my 10" &amp; keyboard together.  All I could find were cases with a built in keyboard.  Why would the tablet maker sell the combo without  having a case you could get for them.  This one is economical &amp; perfect.
 So if you are looking for a bag to hold a tablet; this may be it.  Remarkably<br/>well put together, nice and soft.<br/><br/>It's not fashionable, but extremely practical.<br/><br/>And just to repeat; the quality is much better then we expected.
 Another great AmazonBasics purchase from yours truly!<br/><br/>I just took a vacation and loaded this thing with my little 11 inch laptop, in the other zipper compartment I put my 10 inch tablet, and in the front zip compartment I put my New 3DS XL.<br/><br/>I know... I probably didn't need to take it all. Don't judge me.
 Great tablet case and you can't beat the price.  My ipad air has more room than I expected, but that left me space for a bluetooth keyboard. I also like the little zipper pouch in the front for battery chargers.
 Love it
 Light weight, holds my notebook well<br/>Thanks
 Love this case for my laptop!  It's big enough for my laptop, a notepad, the charger cord and other accessories, but still slim and lightweight!
 These are absolutely great laptop/tablet bags! Plenty of room for multiple devices or folders. Nice and durable!
 Good
 Amazon basic products rule.  Ive bought several for myself and gifts. Great product, highly recommend.
 Great bag looks and feels to sturdy. No downsides to it. Have used it lightly so cannot advise if it will holdup for day in and day out use.
 I would have like the zipper to open like a brief case but it works great. It will likely out last the computer I use it for so mission accomplished.
 Pros: compact, lightweight and good material.<br/><br/>Cons: the corner padding is missing, so you have to be very careful while keeping down.
 super nice for very inexpensive price
 This thing is great !! It not only fits my laptop but also my charger, usb mouse, I can even put a tablet in it, my 3DS and so on. Great buy, AND it'll get to you in a few days !!
 Was not sure about ordering this case but I measured the 14"1" Lenovo laptop before ordering the case and it seemed like it should fit. Got the case today and I have to tell you that the case fits perfectly. There is also room in the case for storage with the compartments that the case has. Would surely recommend this case.
 Basic but very functional - it has more features than I expected and does the job of keeping my laptop safe and cushioned.
 Works great to safely secure my laptops as I normally just put in my car and it slides around sometimes and it still stays secure.
 I wanted something small, but padded to carry my iPad 2 in, and with the iPad cover on it as well. This fits the bill perfectly!!! It holds the iPad 2 and it's cover just right, plenty of padding, but not too bulky. There is a side zipper pocket to store the power cord, or whatever. And the carry handle is great!! I would recommend this to any iPad owner!!
 Great bag and value priced. My 17.3 inch Laptop fit perfectly in it,
 Rips way too easily
 work well for the kids chrome books for school
 Compact, clean, Amazon logo was discreet. Study for price and was more spacious than expected.
 Super lightweight carrying bag.  I bought it for my daughter's google chrome book, and she loves it.  It has also been very durable, and is priced very reasonable.  What's not to like?
 Lots of nooks &amp; crannies for the iPad. Room for chargers, cables, small office stuff away from home. Good packaging, easy open box. No smell, seems sturdy! Thanks Amazon for another home run.
 very piratical for what I need
 I have my iPad in a case and it can still fit in the bag with room to spare. I think as long as you don't bang it up against anything when your walking the bag will be fine. I also think it's good to just store your iPad in.
 Product as discribed
 So far I've been very pleased with this case. It is easy to handle, has pockets for other items, no problems.
 Plenty of room for charger and extras
 Fit like a glove.
 Purchased this bag for my nephew's B-day and he loves the fact that it holds so much all in one bag.
 Very nice quality very reasonable price and very comfortable as it is expensive one
 I bought this for a 11.6 Toshiba netbook and the fit is perfect.  The ballistic nylon case seems well made.  It has enough additional room to store your power adapter, mouse, and any office stuff such as notepads, pens, etc.
 I purchased the 15.6" laptop bag.  The laptop fits in it perfectly and there is lots of room in other compartments for peripherals.
 nice case at a reasonable price
 Super light weight, ample room for laptop, mouse, cord, and a few files. Nice quality.
 Perfect for my laptop, ipad, and folders. I can even fit snacks in it with all those other things, which is a plus!
 this bag is big enough to fit a lot of stuff and help protect your 15.6 laptop. I take a back up batter, phone , chargers, and can even fit a other stuff you might need.
 Zipper broke within a week, isnt deep enough for my son's laptop.
 Very bulky but that's what I expected. I can fit my laptop, charger, mouse, and much more in this carry case. Convenient as can be
 Good
 I bought this bag for my Kindle Fire HD.I had it in my possession for 2 days when my wife saw it and she thought her Kindle looked better in it. So as of this rating she has it and I don't, but I will be getting another. Highly recommend.
 Did not fit as advertised and was not very useful....but what do you expect from anything marketed as being for an Apple product.  We learned our lesson, if it says "iPad" expect that it won't actually work for a good tablet.
 Nice quality and I will buy more for my students as I need them
 Perfect fit, very comfortable
 Perfect for my Vaio T Series ( no longer being made). I work in IT full-time​ and go to college at nights. Lots of compartments for work and school related stuff, padded, durable and easy to clean!
 This carrier bag is just what I needed for my HP Laptop. There's also little pockets inside for chargers and wires. This thing is great.
 I fit my 11" laptop, power cords, mouse and 8" tablet in this.  Great product for the price.
 To all buyers I'm telling you this product is the best for your laptop special when you want to look high class this is suitable for this
 Excelente material
 Pretty nice for 15 bucks. Gets the job done. Seems sturdy so far. shoulder strap is detachable which is perfect since I don't like using them.  So far so good.
 I wasn't expecting much. It is a cheap laptop case. You shouldn't expect much either..
 Very happy with it. Excellent value.
 Excellent quality bag, I can't believe how affordable it was. Compared to all the stores around. I personally take my Asus T300LA Transformer Book 2 in 1 everywhere now with me with extreme ease. I love this bag. I wouldn't trade it for anything
 It's a nice size and has plenty of pockets.  But it is not good in rain, the water does not repel whatsoever.  Seems like they could easily fix this.
 I really like the bag.  Perfect size for the laptop, mouse and charger, with space for a small pad, etc.  I like having both the shoulder strap and the handles.  Seems to offer good protection for the laptop.
 lots of space and compartments - for laptop - other devices - plugs - notebooks - pens pencil
 This holds my iPad, ZAGGkeys solo, and cords perfectly. There is even a little extra room left, so this might not work for someone who is wanting it to fit nice and snug. But this is exactly what I was looking for. I'v had it for a month now and I have not had any issues with the zipper...thank goodness.<br/>Great buy!
 Very happy with this bag and all the room it has.  I would definitely recommend.
 15.6 in. Laptop was very tight fit. Would accommodate a smaller laptop better.
 Great basic 13in laptop bag. The bag is much more economical than similar items at local stores. Don't pay full price for name brand basic bag.
 very nice bag well padded and plenty of room for 15.6 laptop also includes shoulder strap or handles and plenty of pockets definately recommended
 Light weight but adequate to add protection while you are transporting my 15.6 inch laptop and accessories.
 Worked good for my laptop.
 This is really well made can use on the plane great quality so glad I got it a lot for the money
 Great knock around bag. You don't have to worry about scuffing or staining it. The functionality is perfect.
 I have a smaller laptop and it fits perfect
 This was perfect size for my Mac !  It has so many pockets and it small but protective!  Would buy again!
 Does the job as a good laptop case. The clips are plastic and I don't like them.
 Nice Product!!
 Good product, good price point.
 I love this bag! It is really worth the money. I can fit my Asus Tablet/laptop in it, extra cords, my kindle, and any other items I feel I need. It's very sturdy! Can't go wrong with this item.
 Great bag that fit two full sized laptops, power cords, and mice; with leftover room for paperwork.<br/>Better than most available at big box stores and less expensive.
 Would order again
 meh, quality
 I love this thing. Bought it for my 13'' macbook pro w/ retina display. More than enough room for accessories and my Cintiq 13HD tablet as well! SUCH a good price, great quality. LOVE THIS BAG!!
 Very comfy bag. And it's durable and easy to carry.
 This is absolutely perfect.  Roomy and lots of extra pockets to carry stuff.  Looks expensive but was reasonably priced.  Love it!
 Great bag
 Good
 Feels cheap, but alright for the cost. Need better quality options for such a nice Google Chromebook computer. Quality Chromebook, cheap "basic" case.
 Cheap product - the brand name actually feel off the bag a few months after owning it. The material is very cheap and the stitching falls apart very fast. I would not purchase again.
 New laptop needed new bag
 I am not disappointed after using this for a while now. Still comfortable to carry around and lightweight. The thing that surprised me is that the bag is not as stiff as the other laptop bags I own from years before, but that doesn't mean the quality of the material is lower. In fact, the bag is holding up extremely well (I do take great care of my belongings either way). It is a great laptop case to use and I carry it everywhere with me.
 Good quality bag expecially when others in the store can cost twice as much.
 I purchased this laptop bag for my Macbook Pro. It fits well and the padding seems to protect the computer from minor damage. I am also able to fit my iPad, headphones, and chargers into the bag without too much of a problem.
 great perfect size
 This is a great laptop bag, has compartments for everything I need, durable design, was able to fit my Macbook Pro with plenty of space left over, I recommend this Laptop/Table bag
 Burst. Good while it lasted. I guess I needed a stronger bag.
 Nice design, very light weight, plenty of compartments.  However, one side of one handle ripped off during normal use during travel!!!  I only had this bag for less than 2 months!!!!  I have had other laptop bags, and luggage for years.  Very inconvenient when traveling.
 Awesome as decided
 I have the kindle tablet and was looking for a small bag that was not too expensive. The bag is great I added a wirelss keyboard, and there are extra pockets and enough space for cords phone etc.
 This is a nice sturdy pack that has been in use for a month or so. It of course hold the laptop, but also contains my mini-toolkit, charger, external drive, headphones, wireless mouse, work papers and network cables. Everything I use for personal and professional all in one mostly comfortable bag.
 It's the perfect size for my 11.6" Chromebook. Love the shoulder strap and it's got enough pockets for miscellaneous accessories you might need.
 Very good matriel
 For an entry level laptop bag this is well worth the money. I used it infrequently and it is great. Fits all my accessories and looks good.
 Feels a bit less sturdy than I would have wanted. Not much shape or structure to it, so I don't expect it to be able to protect my devices well.
 Wonderful bag!  I neede something to protect my iPad from weather. While this is not waterproof it will keep the elements at bay. My iPad is in a case but had sides exposed.  Perfect fit!  Great quality and so soft. Highly recommend!
 This was a gift item for a student for an Acer computer. She tells me by email she is very happy with this product.<br/>Thank you for shipping it in a timely manner.
 It's got room to store other things obviously and it does that really nicely and the bag has foam or something on the walls of the bag which protects the laptop or tablet or both!!
 I keep  my 17 inch Toshiba laptop at home and travel with my 14 inch Toshiba.  This is perfect for travelling.<br/>I fly alot for business and always need my computer with me.  The price is a no-brainer.  I am very pleased.
 Nice Case
 Does the job. Average product. Fits 15.6 laptop with plenty room to spare.
 Fits my 11.6" Acer perfectly + room for charger, stand and mouse. With a thin notebook against the open side of the webbook everything fits snugly, it's light, easy to carry, and reasonably well protected.
 This is a cute little basic black bag that fits my iPad and its cover nicely. I also throw my keys, phone and a few papers in and I use it daily. I am not quite sure about how much protection it actually provides, since I have not had any mishaps yet, but I feel the padding along with my iPad cover is adequate. You can't beat the quality for the price.
 Amazon Basics is a good product and does a good job protecting the computer. This bag although good has no room for an external keyboard.
 The shoulder pad started to rip wiht just 3 days of use
 Perfect fit for my laptop and light weight, too. Much preferred to my expensive old Samsonite. Roomy for peripherals and files, etc. Great value.
 This handy bag was purchased to protect and carry my iPad, and I love it. The price is reasonable, and the neoprene padding gives me the protection I need.  The zippered external pocket is really handy for storing the charger &amp; cord.  Perfect!
 Great for work!
 Just as described! Very spacious.
 My son received a Kindle Fire for christmas and bought this bag.  Loves it!  Nice to have the extra protection to go along with the SUPCASE. Great product.  Extremely happy!
 Excellent bag for the price.  Plenty of room for accessories. Zippers work well.
 Quality bag with plenty of space for a small laptop.  This product fits the bill for a simple carying/storage case for a small laptop with room to store the charging cable a few small accessories.  Not a lot of space for extras.
 Everything fit neatly and securely
 Not well constructed
 I've no complaints.
 Perfect for a 10.1 Tab A
 I wish the strap was longer but it's a good bag
 It's too big for iPad Air 2 so I also bought a Verizon Leather/ Nylon Tablet Sleeve With Modem Pocket and Form Fitting Construction for All 10.1 inch Tablets(888-0001) and they work great together.
 Not as expected
 Great basic bag for laptop. I have had it for months now, and it still looks brand new.
 I use it as a small man bag.<br/>I take books, pencils, paper, files when I go to sit in the doctor's waiting room.<br/>Lots of pockets for cell phone and such.<br/>Excellent construction.
 Perfect for my son’s new laptop, he likes it.
 CaseLogic version is a little sleeker, this one is maybe a smidgen less elegant-- zipper pulls are comically oversized on this one. But half the price, 95% as good? Can't complain!
 Product was exactly as described. Thank you
 For the Price this is perfect for what I need it for.
 Great product.  Handles are sewn on the outside so can zip close the case.  will purchase another.
 17.3" for THIN LAPTOPS. Not meant for think laptops.
 nice and light bag
 Great for the price.
 Amazon knocked it out of the park with this tablet bag. The material is great! the extra storage pocket is really nice and my Nextbook Premium 8HD fits great in this bag. I recommend this to anyone that wants a soft briefcase for their tablet!
 Works great for the Kindle HD 8.9. We have even put the Kindle in a case with Keyboard and it still fits in the bag easily. Side zipper pouch, holds many accessories too, like a stand, charger/adapter, cords and headphones, plus more.
 I was very excited to receive this product.  When I did, i was not disappointed.  The bag is very good quality and well made.  The zippers work easy and plenty of space to put my odds and ends.  I'm going to get one for my hubby's netbook.  It's perfect for a man or woman to carry. I put my 10" tablet in there inside my RooCase.  Perfect fit!
 Great bag. Not to large
 I like that it's inexpensive and just what I need to hold my netbook. The orange lining makes it easy to see if there's anything floating around in there and the pocket (with side opening zippers) is useful to store AC adapters. Really like the handles. Get it.
 How does Amazon keep beating the Laptop Bag folks.  This is perfect.  I have my Chromebook in it.  My Kindle, two sets of power cords, along with the various odds and ends I take with me each day.  GREAT BAG!
 Gray bag for my MacBook air 13. Is very light. I think having both strap options is good. I think you'll like it. Wish it  came in more colors.
 I've used this everyday for work for about 6 months now and its held up great. It's a bit on the large side for my Surface Pro 3 but it's full of loads of unnecessary crap that I wouldn't be able to fit otherwise. Would definitely purchase again.
 Fits my 15.6 inch laptop perfectly. Holds everything that I need it to.
 Exceptionally well made...just the right size for my Dell 3000 2-n-1 good strong material, zippers are god quality.......... Works for me..!!
 very hardy, holds 4 ipads and chargers, very useful
 Great value in a simple case.  It has two pockets which hold the essential accessories.  No complaints.
 Using it for our personal dvd player and fits perfectly.
 I have to wear compression stockings and cannot put them on myself due to some paralysis in my hands.  A co-worker helps me and I always carried them in a plastic bag from a fast food place.  I wanted something that looked better but not like a purse. This bag fits the bill.
 excellent
 perfect for my iPad Air 2. Good fit and I put a built ny sleeve on it then put it in this bag and I feel good about it being secure.
 Very nice. Great quality.
 Nice back, fit my needs with lots of pockets and just big enough for my computer.
 The iPad fits just right in this bag, and I have been using it for five weeks now. The liner inside is soft and protective. The material outside seems well-made and attractive. The outside pocket has sufficient room for the charger and cables. It's a pleasure to store and carry the iPad in this bag.
 This is a good product, was delivered in the time that was promised
 Great, Great, Great. Thanks
 Great Laptop bag. Holds everything I need.
 Easy to carry with Kindle Fire, charging cord, and my other basic needs. No need for big purse with all my junk when just running around town.  Wish it had a strap for over your shoulder.
 Very nice n functional
 Case should be slightly larger, once you put all your items into case, (power cord, external drive, mouse) case seems to tight.  Case is well constructed.
 Very nice entry level case that performs well in any setting. Why spend more?
 Its a nice carrying case for my laptop it has useful pockets to store the charging cables of the laptop a mouse a mouse pad and eventually some paperwork...<br/><br/>its also a nice design, the bad/sad part about it is that the hand handle the one on the top is a little flimsy mine got ditched as soon as 4 months of normal use... ill have to take it to a tailor to fix it...
 This is a very nice,handy tote bag for your small iPad or Mac Book.  Well constructed and easy to carry, I recommend it's purchase.
 This is a decent back - especially when you consider the price.  I bought it as a temporary bag until I could find something really nice, but I may just keep this until it wears out (or gets dirty).  For $16 you can't go wrong.
 I don't like the strap, but other than that it is quite the nice bag.
 My iPad Air fits in this with room to spare.  It is of very nice quality and the price is great!  I carry my iPad Air, charger, cord, reading glasses and still have room for more.  Great purchase.
 Very sturdy. I was looking for something to carry my MAC and this fit the bill. Well made and reasonable price
 excellent quality
 Solid little bag for my Notebook with good padding. Strong zipper needs a bit of working to loosen up but its well made and convenient.
 This is my second purchase of this bag as the first disappeared on a trip to Fl last spring...I love this little case..it is compact, quality built, and an excellent price/value purchase...
 At first I did not like this bag at all. Thought it was to light weight, but after finally getting out of the box and using it it was just the one I wanted it for, plenty of room for papers, cell phone and I-Pad. And the price was good.
 This is an excellent product and was purchased as a gift for Father's Day for my Son-in-law and he was thrilled with it.
 This is the perfect size for a mini iPad or even a Kindle.  It is big enough to carry the charger and any small accessories needed for these products and even a small "mouse" and mousepad if one does not like to use a touch screen.
 would order again<br/><br/>perfect size for laptop
 Great computer carrying case. I bought a size bigger so I can carry school books and other items needed for school. Great bang for the buck!!! Holding up well so far. Better than Walmart.
 I bought this with a 13.3" DVD player. While the bag is nice for the price, I cannot easily fit the 13.3" player into it without stressing the zippers. So the size is a little misleading. It would be more stars if rated for a smaller item than 14.1".
 Just rite what I needed. plenty of room and compartments to carry accessories. Very economical for price.
 The product shipped fast and fit my laptop perfectly however the product was supposed to come with a shoulder strap as shown but my purchase didn’t come with one. I really need it!
 This was a perfect bag for my work on the weekend.  I have shared this information with a number of my friends.
 good quality! very light
 It is perfect for me it works great with my laptop I have a 15.5" it holds everything I need and then some I'm very happy
 Wanted to hold my small Laptop for travelling. It holds my laptop and iPad and associated cables but is nice and small and compact. Made very well of good quality and excellent value.
 Just what I was looking for...
 This is a very good, affordable computer bag.  There's room enough inside for the laptop and all my other stuff.
 I bought this for my son's 14" chromebook. It fits wonderfully with room to spare. And for the price its great. Judging by the pictures, it is thicker than I expected, which is a good thing!
 It's EXACTLY 15.6 in... No more, no less... Fits tight, but fits.
 works well
 Product matched description and happy with my purchase.
 I purchase two. They are are a perfect size to carry my tablet as well as charger and other misc items I like to have tag only when I take my tablet with me! You can't beat the price!<br/>It's nothing fancy, but it absolutely is a great utility case for my 10 inch tablet!
 Works great. However, the strap clips are made of plastic and make funny noises, which is quite annoying to me, and they are not as sturdy as metal ones, although they prove to be reliable up by now. Some commenters also reported unintentional release of the clips, personally I didn't encounter such problem, but be aware if you carry heavy things.
 Perfect fit for our slightly larger laptop. Great pockets for accessories and for travel documents, as well.
 These are great bags, look good and quality is top notch.
 AmazonBasics has never let me down.  This bag is so good that my girlfriend took it for her.  Time to order another.
 love it. use it everytime I go out of town and have to take my lap top
 Glad I bout it.
 I was looking for a bag for a laptop that isn't carried all that much, so I wanted a thin, lightweight bag. Shopping in local stores, the only bag I could find was a Samsonite at $49.95 (and it wasn't as nice as this). This bag is perfect for me, well constructed, and did I mention price?
 Perfect size for my Surface Pro 4 for work.  Holds my power adapter, mouse, and a few other basic items.  Small enough to carry anywhere or stow in carry on luggage when traveling.  Can't beat the price!
 Straight to the point, this slim laptop case is good enough for the price has room enough for your laptop, power cord and yes all you need for medium to small tablet even laptop mouse
 Very good case and I look forward to using in the future. I recommend as there not expensive and are padded enough
 High quality material and very durable and fits my laptop perfect
 Great product for the price.  I bought this as a gift for my husband and have now decided to buy one for myself!
 easy to use
 Hand grips  get in the way of the zippers.Bottom of bag not padded so lap can withstand a bag drop to pavement (3-4 feet) Please see HP bags for better solution.
 Fits my 15.6 inch asus laptop very well, along with a book, charger, and a couple smaller accessories.
 I received today and as everyone can see at the photo it's all broken and tear apart I just don't know what to say if I can I don't even want to give any stars
 Very good price for a good bag.  Extra pockets for cords and manuals, etc.  Not too roomy so laptop bounces around, but enough room for some DVDs and books and such.
 Met all my expectations. Use it every day.  It was slightly bigger than I expected, but that is a good thing.
 I bought this for my iPad Air, and it fit perfect, room to put my power cord in the side pocket. This is better than a sleeve.
 Stylish it isn't, but usable it is...  Good quality materials and construction, adequate storage for a laptop and accessories.<br/>Good value laptop bag!
 ok
 Just an excellent bag! Lightweight, well constructed, stylish. The side pockets are well placed. By far the best laptop bag I have used. And of course you can't beat the price.
 Works great with my 10" laptop.  Also, it is big enough to also store papers, magazines, the power supply, and my iPad Mini at the same time.  It also holds its shape very well and has sufficient padding. What else could you want?
 Great reasonable bag for my laptop &amp; work papers - lots of room
 I love this bag. So well build. SO cheap. Perfect number of pockets. So sleak. I just love all the reinforcing threads. Highly recommended bag. Looks like new even after 1.5 years of heavy daily use.
 nothing at all close to the video but it does the work for the price
 Great quality and price
 Delivery was on time. product is what I expected.
 My 11 inch Dell fits in it perfectly, with plenty of room for accessories. Nicely built.
 Laptop fits perfect and well secured. Better than expected!
 I've been using it for a few months now. It is big enough to carry my laptop. The strap is a bit annoying at times, but it has survived wear-and-tear and meets my needs. For a simple case, this is it.
 This bag is perfect! It has so many different pockets for anything you might want. The biggest thing to me is the actual clips on the side that hold the straps. THEY ROTATE! For some reason that is what got me hooked. You can put it on in any way and you can just twist the straps and they'll lay flat.<br/><br/>The bag also feels very secure. I can throw my laptop in my car without really worrying about its safety.
 I am very impressed with this bag. Fits my laptop perfectly and has lots of storage for my accessories plus papers, pens, magazines, etc. Nice high quality and tough material. Easily competes with bags costing 3, 4 or more times as much. Highly recommended.
 Great bag, I can carry my lap top and my tablet with chargers in the same bag, and still have room for my phone in another padded pouch.  HD zippers and handles are a plus.  I wish they made it in leather, because it is exactly what I like in a bag.
 This is the perfect travel bag for your iPad and Chromebook!  My husband and I travel occasionally and were looking for a handy bag that we could carry our tablets in, along with their charging cords, etc.  This really was exactly what we were looking for - can't recommend highly enough!  Perfect for car or plane travel!
 GAVE IT TO MY GRANDSON. SEEMS TO BE FINE.
 works perfectly and seems to be made well. has enough pockets to be functional and helpful.
 It's a basic laptop bag that has great pockets.  I do like them since they're perfect for cords.  It attracts dog hair super easy.
 ...it would have been a perfect 5-star. As a strapless 4-star it is still great, with a smaller outside pocket to carry a wallet and cell phone. Larger pocket fits my ipad3 with its lether case, plus a little room to spare so you don't have to work at getting it in and out.
 Feels strong and great value for the price. I recommend this product.
 Great bag! a bit large for my iPad, it is probably big enough for an iPad and a cover, but I feel that the iPad is WELL protected... The Side Pocket is big enough for the power plug and maybe a few extras... I also keep a small point and shoot camera in there and it too is well protected! Again, Great price, would recommend it for iPad users!
 Works well
 Sleek Bag.
 Very good quality product. i am using this everyday.
 I really like this bag.  It is sturdy, just the right size, and a very good value.  The side pocket is big enough to carry my 8" tablet so I can keep everything in one place.
 Thank You for THIS GREAT Laptop Bag. It's the 4th one that I'm buying from you.<br/>All my Nephews have those bags.<br/>Great Great product.<br/>Thank You,<br/>Gili
 could have more padding between outside zipper pouch where I have to put the charger and the actual laptop, but all in all works for me.
 Bought for my son's laptop. Perfect
 Great produt and very low price! Love it
 Pretty much everything I wanted in a laptop bag. It's lightweight but durable, and protects my Mac Air very well. Plenty of inner and outer pocket space as well. And the price was insanely low.
 Great little bag for my new HP laptop.  Fits well and extra room for the rest of my stuff!  It can be carried by the handle or on the shoulder with the strap.  Good price for a good product.  Nice.
 Better then I expected for the price. Roomy and lots of pouches
 Not delivered as promised
 Awesome bag for my Chromebook 11. It's a very high quality bag with a surprising amount of room and pockets. Better than a neoprene sleeve. You will like it too.
 I bought this for my Acer 500 tablet.  It's too big for it and the tablet flops around in the bag.  Otherwise, it's a nice little bag.  Protects the tablet and holds the charger in a zippered compartment.  If the sides were a bit sturdier/stiffer, it would have helped.  I would recommend.
 Nice and simply laptop bag. Lots of cushion and padding back and front.
 Received this Laptop bag right on time. Very good quality and appearance. Glad I purchased the largest size offered. Fit perfectly.
 I'm happy with this case.  It's made well, has plenty of storage and was inexpensive.  Another quality "Amazon Basics" product!
 If you wish your iPad had a carrying handle, look no further! I love this bag. It has a big pocket on the front for cables and other accessories and in additon to the iPad can carry lots of stuff with it. I rarely use a purse if I have this with me.
 Got this for my Kindle 8.9 HDX. Had a bag, but no handles. Love! Love! Love! those handles.  A little big for the Kindle, but no problems. Protects the Kindle nicely. Also very useful outside space to hold cords and ear buds.
 Good looking strong carrying case. Works great.
 It is well constructed with plenty of room for extras besides my laptop. This will even hold notes and extra paper  with a front pocket that will<br/>be perfect for all my extra on the go school needs.
 Very well-made and very good value. Lots of space for cords, books, and other things you'll need to carry with you on the plane, to school, etc.
 Very sturdy bag.  Well made and has held up great being used almost every day since it arrived.  Highly recommend this to anyone looking for this size computer bag.
 Just right for the price
 Holds up well to heavy books
 Perfect. Quality materials, workmanship, and light weight. Three compartments and room for the computer, notebook, charger and mouse. Its what Amazon Basics is about.
 Amazon did it again, great product. My MacBook Air fits perfectly, along with my charging cord, iPad mini with a new Trent Bluetooth case, headphones, and an apple Magic Mouse. Oh I also forgot about my samsung 500gb external hard drive and cord. And it's not bulky at all, I give it a 5 out of 5
 Just what I was looking for. A well made case for my Macbook Air 11" with plenty of storage space and not too bulky. Reasonably priced.
 as good as expected
 I got a small Dell Inspiron11 laptop and wanted something to protect it while traveling.  The AmazonBasics Tablet Bag is perfect for this task. I'm able to carry the power supply, a few pens and a small notebook in the bag with more room to spare. Great bag!
 Perfect case
 Cheap quality
 Excellent quality at a very good price.  Bag is sturdy, but light weight.  It fully meets my desire to lessen the weight of my laptop and notebooks on my back and shoulders.
 Excellent item, thanks
 Delivery on time and very functional, the most cheap and nice suitcase..for a 15.6" laptop !!!!
 sweet deal...love mine
 Awesome bag, well made, perfect amount of padding for causal use, not too bulky.  I can't believe the price!  Perfectly fits my Dell Inspiron 17.3 laptop.
 Great sturdy little bag. We're using it to carry an ipad. Having both the carrying handles and strap are handy. Great price, shipped fast.
 excellent
 it fits my 9" dvd player perfectly  :-)
 Very nice laptop case, computer fits perfect
 GREAT QUALITY
 Perfect for ipad air 2!  Exactly what I wanted. Fits ipad with otterbox defender case. Plenty of extra storage space but compact.
 Perfect fit and very well made and good padding
 Perfect fit for our HP ENVY. Well made considering the low cost.
 Great padding just needs some more In the corners but amazing overal Amazon never lets us down
 Well-made for the price. I don't know how well it would travel, as we just use it as storage while the laptop's not being used.
 Able to carry my iPad Pro 12.7" comfortably.  I don't use the should strap but prefer the carrying handles.  I like the extra zippered storage for my charger and other accessories.
 My son loved it.
 Simple bag. Easy to Use.
 This is well made and nice looking bag and very well worth the price.
 I had to return the first one since the shoulder pad started to come undone after just one business trip. The return was easy with Amazon and I got my new one in no time. Nice, compact.
 I love the material that this is made from and it is perfect for a new dell tablet it is the perfect fit. I love that it is soft and has a handle it just makes it a bag I continually reach for. would love this type of fabric in a small backpack. kudos.
 This bag served its purpose for the 5 months I used it. Unfortunately, The handle ripped off after about 3 weeks of use. I would buy it again, especially for the proce, but I decided to upgrade to a higher quality leather bag.
 Perfecto
 I love this bag.  For 14 bucks it has been just right for my 13 macbook pro.  Its quality has held up as well as any other Targus or name brand bag I've had in the past and it looks decent too.
 A bit on the thin side, but it holds my laptop-sized 2-in-1 tablet and all of the cables and other accessories that I carry with it pretty well.
 The bag isn't the best,but it will accomplish what I want it to do.I only need it to keep my laptop secured and protected when not being used.
 Good space for what I need.
 Bag was everything I needed and wanted to carry my iPad around. Just the right size. Use it all the time.
 This one holds this monster laptop well. It doesn't hold everything under the sun but I wouldn't want to tote it around if it did. It will hold all you need along with the laptop
 I have 3 of these, from small to large. My first and smallest one was made by Case Logic (and purchased here), but these are nearly identical.
 it is a bag. it is everything you expect, at a great price. it does not glow in the dark, give you love live advice, or give you facebook updates.
 Perfect fit for my new MacBook Air and all of its accessories! Love it!
 Good construction and attractive, this basic case is a great deal.  Zippers, pockets, everything works great.  I highly recommend this product if you need something to carry around a 15.6" laptop and accessories.
 Great quality laptop bag. I purchased over 2 years ago, and I still use it today! I highly recommend this bag for carrying your computer across campus, to school, etc.
 Good quality.  It works for me.
 Simple, useful, and surprisingly durable!  I've had mine for almost two years now, and I use it frequently!  A good buy!
 I've been using this product for more than three years and it's still working well. My net book fits perfectly with it. One problem was that a little iron inside the case was sticking out. So I had to cut it off. I would buy it again!
 good for the price
 Great value!
 Got this for my boyfriend; he loves it - puts his little alienware laptop in it and fits perfectly with his charger cable, mouse, and files. has lots of pockets and is cushy for protection. A good inexpensive purchase.
 I truly enjoy this laptop bag. It looks real small, but I love the different compartments that fit everything I need! The shipping was great, within a few days my item was delivered. Thank you!
 I love this bag it fits my laptop well
 Not fancy.  The quality seems good.<br/>The price is excellent.<br/>I would recommend this.
 Had the bag less than 2 weeks and the shoulder strap pad is tearing. Other than that handy bag for the price.<br/>I also own the 11 inch version and no problems with it.
 Finally I figured out why I was getting a headache after coming from the office. It was because of the heavy backpack I was using. This is very lightweight and now the headache is gone! It is so good!
 This is a decent transport cover for Gateway netbooks. Computer fits perfectly and goes in easily.<br/>The stretchy outside pouch has plenty of room for the AC adapter, cables and even a full size mouse.<br/>Seems well made, zippers work well. Great deal for ten bucks.
 Fits my large print version of The Old Scofield Study Bible.  Soft with plenty of storage for extra notes.
 Nice light bag.
 it is OK but the shoulder strap pad was sewn too close to the materials edge and it frade the first time<br/>I put it over my shoulder with the laptop in the case.
 Good protection
 Used for my Chromebook, this lightweight bag is outstanding.  The compartments, padding, pockets, and zippers are thought out in design and excellent in construction.  Although inexpensive, the bag meets the demands of functionality and durability.
 Great quality, like every other amazon basics item I have bought. Just as good as the name brand ones you have to pay $$$$$$$$ for. I love it.
 Great
 Easy to carry
 WOW, you just can't beat the quality for this price!
 Great!
 works great - the handle is starting tier a bit
 no comment
 Perfect size for my 13-inch Toshiba Chromebook. There are 3 compartments. One for the laptop or Chromebook, and the other 2 for accessories. The quality is very decent
 Nice case, would purchase again.
 Received the netbook bag today. I was surprised its very nice. The only thing is my 10" Asus netbook fits in it but it is a little tight, but it does fit. The side pocket is ample for a mouse and power supply. So all in all I like it. For the price and qaulity I dont think it can be beat. Thanks
 It's a really nice, quality bag. Also, this bag is half the price of most similar bags. It shipped separately from the other amazon items I ordered, and very fast.
 Great value.
 There are two sleeves in addition to the laptop storage space in the main compartment. That can fit papers,  files,  tablets.  And the front zipper compartment for pen, small accessories and charger.
 Worth the money. Nice and roomy and lots of pockets.
 Really nice case!! I was very surprised that it was as nice as it was and it not being very expensive.
 This bag is great! Fits my 15.6 inch Laptop perfectly.  Looked at other lap top bags and they were so expensive and not even close to the quality of this one.  Highly recommend this bag to all.
 I haven't been pleased with some of the Amazon Basics stuff I've tried, and have even returned some of it, but this bag is very nice.  It is just the right size for a 10 inch netbook and I can store my mouse and powersupply in the extra pocket.  I recommend this for netbooks.
 This fits my iPad Pro 13 inch tablet very well and has room for all the accessories
 Great bag.  Exactly as advertised
 By far the most sensible valued item on Amazon. There are about 6 pockets to utilize. Fits my Acer 14 perfectly! Plus extra docs. Strap shoulder is comfortable and not too rigid.
 perfect
 i have been looking for a small case for my ipad for quite some time. this is exactly what i have been wanting.  love the handles and especially love the front pocket for holding accessories. the case is totally compact and perfectly functional
 Perfect, and lovely quality for the price. Great for back and forth to class.
 Very handy.  Lot of pockets. Microsoft surface fits perfectly.
 For the price awesome
 Pretty flimsy bag.  Mine came without a hook for the inside zipper.  Could be made better, perhaps if not in China.
 Great little attache for my new Dell Inspirion 11 3000 2-in-1, which fits perfectly.  Very light, but offers good protection.  Great for carrying the laptop on the plane.  Excellent  value!
 I purchased this case for the DVD player I recently purchased, it works but is a bit tight, but otherwise it looks nice and I think it will fill the need<br/>I had for my DVD player.
 As advertised.
 Could be an inch or two bigger. Fits my 15.6" snugly, and doesn't leave room for much else.
 Good buy person loves the bag
 Perfect fit for my 17" laptop! The 2 inner pockets and front zippered sections are a nice feature! I can put my cords, mouse and there's room for more!
 Good computer case cheap and worth the price of course the quality is not the best
 Perfect fit for my Lenovo Yoga 11.6 inch laptop PC.  Really liked the style.  The bag had ample space for all the basic computer accessories.
 Basic but great. Lots of pockets &amp; room. Sturdy &amp; easy to wipe off.
 This light weight, sturdy computer bag is perfect for managing my computer while traveling.
 Great bag for the price! Holds ASUS detacahble 12 inch laptop perfectly. Good quality materials. Would highly recommend! One star off for plastic strap holders which MAY break (but did not yet).
 I didn't appear at first to fit my HP ENVY, but it fit right in.
 I have actually been caught in the rain with this and my computer has stayed dry. Thanks amazon for making great affordable products.
 Well made, good size, nice pockets. Only bad thing is that the shoulder strap is made for tall people. It doesn't shorten enough for petite high school or college girls.
 We bought this bag for a slightly smaller laptop and it works great. Very sturdy, great value
 cheap but nice
 Great for the price!
 Perfect for the price!!
 I carry my important papers in it. Plenty of room for files.
 un buen maletin
 great
 Great bag, fits my laptop as well as a textbook and 5 1-subject notebooks in the center pocket. Front pocket fits pens, calculators etc. If you have a charger that is bulky the bag will most likely be a little bulky wherever the charger is but it doesn't cause any issues for me. Strap is strong and comfortable, though the hinges do squeak a bit; less now that I've had it a while. Amazon logo is not big and does not take away from attraction. Overall fantastic bag for the value, would buy it again if ever needed.
 Really nice quality for the price. It's very basic and straightforward which I like. One big pouch and two littler ones and a bunch of smaller compartments. I do wish too though that it came in different colors or something to spice it up instead of plain black!
 Love this bag!!!! I use it basically every day for work.  It is strong, sturdy, and holds a lot!!!  I love all of the compartments.  It very helpful with keeping one organizaed.
 bought for traveling with my cromebook , a little snugger than I thought it would be but generally ok
 Does what a bag should do but too expensive
 Perfect, this is your basic computer case. Carries my Hp 2000 and I love the bag to death already.
 It is great for work and looks great too.
 Nice quality, great fit, handles, strap all of nice sturdy quality. Great price. Very pleased
 Spacious
 its an awesome bag for laptop my ipad iphone a note book (paper) and my macbook air 13" fits perfectly along with cables etc perfect for the price
 I just needed an affordable laptop bag to protect my laptop in travel.  This met those expectations at a great price point.  It has extra inner pockets where I like to store my mouse pad, and also extra outer pockets to store my charger and mouse.
 This laptop bag is ok but could be a little bit more roomier. It is a tight fit for the laptop described.
 Well made and very affordable.
 For the money ($13.49) this is a high quality case/shoulder bag! I am very satisfied with it &amp; I recommend it for all who use the Delll Inspiron 11 3000!
 Perfect for what I needed, simple storage bags to prevent scratches/dings/nicks/cracks etc. THANKS
 Nice product
 Perfect case for someone who doesn't want a lot of bulk but wants the portability and protection when bringing your laptop places. Love this case.
 I recently bought a Lenovo ThinkPad P71 Mobile with 17 inch screen and needed a case for it.  This was a perfect choice.  Very light and goes well with my laptop.
 Holds ...1. my pens and pencils in top pouch 2.. My calipers, my usb driver, power suppy, skull headphones ..in lower pouch. 3. My Asus 11.6 netbook  and bill envelopes ..in main pouch.  Goes and comes to work with me everyday.
 For the price this is a great little bag for when I want to leave my bulky one behind.  The quality and construction are great for the price.  It fits my 15" MBP laptop with a neoprene sleeve over it.
 Excellent bag for the price. Amazon is doing a great job with their AmazonBasics line. It looks good, looks more expensive than others for a fraction of the price. Also has a lot of space inside where the laptop is, and have two bags on the outside.<br/><br/>Maybe the only downside I can think of is that all is plastic and maybe in the future could break, but as for today I am more than happy with the purchase.
 Great quality. Tons of storage space and pockets
 love it
 very lightweight and convenient.  wish it opened up fully though. and it is not airport safe, you still have to take your laptop out at security.
 These work great for our notebooks.  We have 3 of them and I send them out with our attorneys when they travel.  The notebook is well protected and the attorneys love the compact size.
 Nice, soft, comfortable bag. Can be used not only for notebooks, but also tablets, media player and hard drives. Fast delivery, good communication. I recommend to use this sellers service!<br/>Thanks,<br/>Emin
 Hard to believe this case was so nice for the price.  It fits my new I Pad air perfectly and as a bonus, I can squeeze in my Apple keyboard as well.  The outside pocket is great for stylus, pens, and even a 6x5 small notepad, or whatever other small items you want to carry in it.The material is nice and the double zipper works well.  Love it!1
 As described. Is a wonderful little messenger bag.
 I got my husband this bag for his birthday. He needed a new bag for work. He loves it! The zippers slide easily and very comfortable and affordable!! Highly recommended!!
 The title of this product may state "iPad Air", but it really should just be for netbooks. The iPad Air and other generation iPads fit inside of it, but have too much room to move around. The bag doesn't hug the device so it moves around inside. Other than that, I highly recommend this bag.
 Ordered 15 for my group at work.  For use with Laptops, keyboards and mouse.  It was perfect for the job.
 Good bag for a good price. It's not luxurious and doesn't feel extra professional but it does the job and it isn't expensive.
 Fits my tablet perfectly and has pockets which is great for my accessories!
 Nice bag for my child's computer.
 very nice, incredible price. my kindle 8.9 hdx kinda swims in it, but that's ok. pleased with the quality.  has a little zipper pocked on one side, perfect for my charger and cord.
 Perfect fit. good extra storage for mouse, and power cords. Easy to carry and I like the shoulder strap which lets you get it out of you hands. The laptop is well protected by good cushioning.
 Thanks! As described.
 My HP Pavillion fits perfectly inside with no bouncing around. it also has ample space for my charging cord and a few other small items.
 Great quality and fits great!
 When I  place the laptop in the bag it hangs up on the big pocket.  A snap or piece pf velcro would help.
 Great bag for the price!  Enough pockets for most things you would carry with a laptop.  High quality.
 Just as described. Very happy with this.
 good product<br/>i didn't use it at all<br/>i needed getting a bigger lap top so i need a bigger bag
 Very good quality bag.  Good padding.  Plenty of compartments and shoulder strap. I use it for my Samsung Tab4 10".  I went with a little larger size because I have the Kuteck case and Otterbox Latch II on it and it works great.
 Great for my laptop. Nice quality and lots of room for 15.4" screen. Love this product.
 Just the right size. I can fit my iPad with case on, kindle, small notebook and a planner inside. I still have room to fit my chargers in the outer pocket. Like that is has some cushion.
 This case does the job for the price. Fells to be on the cheap side but it will do.
 Love this laptop bag! I was super excited to find this so cheap and even more excited when it came and I saw what great quality it was. Has pockets for my charger and mouse and looks very nice.
 These bags are great.  Why spend more.  I've bought 8 in various sizes
 I really love this bag. It's sturdy, clean and sharp and fits my IPAD, Galaxy tab and Sharkk keyboard perfectly. Thanks also for your awesome speedy service.<br/><br/>I bought two because I was so happy with the first shipment.<br/><br/>It's for this reason that I buy everything on Amazon.com these days.
 Holds the new lap top securely, holds the power cord as well.  Also holds the wireless mouse I purchased.
 Works great on my new Amazon HP Laptop and the fit is right and the price was right too.  Looks great and serves its job just right.
 It is light weight and can hold my laptop and some folders. I like it.
 The perfect case! Padded, nice fit to a tablet, handles.  Having cracked 2 screens despite protective cases, I was looking for a small case with handles:  found this, exactly what I needed to prevent a third accident. It also has a zippered side pocket.  I recommend this to anyone; but especially to those who try to carry too much in his arms, since the handles slip easily over wrists. The price is right too.
 This product started ripping 2 days after it was received. Don’t buy. You get what you pay for
 Recently purchased this to hold my Surface 3 and accessories.  Nice size.  Looks like a mini-laptop bag - great quality and lots of pockets / room.  Very good!
 Has many pockets for many of your essential needs. Can fit my laptop well and has a comfortable cushion for my laptop as well. Great for any student and even for books!
 Product as described, fast delivery
 Very nice bag at a great price. My husband bought me a laptop and I needed a bag to carry it in. I'm glad I chose this bag there are a lot of pockets in it to carry all of my items.
 Excellent. Must buy considering the price of the bag.  Very good materials.  High quality feel.  You can store quite a bit of items other than the laptop.
 does not properly fit devices that are 14 inches and the plastic shoulder strap is terrible and will break over time
 Great case never has let me down
 It's big and even with everything in it it was easy and light to carry. I'm gamer so being able to put everything I need in one bag is a big deal. It fit the computer, control, headset, extra hard drive and all the cording.
 This case is well made and is super cheap for the quality. Fits my laptop perfectly, and I love the extra compartments for pens, notebooks, etc. Not a super protective case but perfect for my use. If you are looking for a cheap well made case I recommend this one.
 This is a perfect size for my kindle fire 8.7 and my Bose sound link speaker  and with the handy side pocket. There is plenty of room for all of my chargers and cords. I won't leave home without it.
 My husband needed something to hold 2 laptops and a tablet. This does the trick. The over-the-shoulder strap saves the back.
 Perfect size for new hp computer. Strong with pockets and some padding. Price was a factor for me and this tote is great.
 This is a good one.  It has capacious pockets efficiently arranged.  It holds all the stuff associated with a laptop; cords, drives, a mouse, etc.  I can't imagine a better one for me.
 Nice bag. I like it
 Good quality for the price !
 I really like this case. It holds my iPad Air with keyboard cover perfectly. The protection is good, construction is solid, styling is attractive. The material is dirt resistant. This is a great value.
 Good bag...computer fits perfectly!
 Starting to tear some, fits my 17in gaming laptop and not much else like the power adapter, external hard drive, mouse, etc
 nice product
 I purchased this bag along with a Grid-It organizer to use with my Surface Pro 3, and it works perfectly. Great little bag for a small laptop or tablet at a great price.
 Great for my Dell laptop especially all of the extra side pockets Thank you.
 Great quality and useful bag. A lot of pockets so satisfying
 The only bag I could find that worked with a 17" monitor and it is well made but not unreasonably priced.
 For the price its a good value and will do the job.
 This bag has great padding and plenty of room for a laptop, tablet, paper, and pens, etc. I originally ordered a $50 bag, returned it and bought this one which is much better!
 Very basic laptop bag, no frills. But after two months the handle where it attaches to the body became frayed and tore completely.
 Bought these for the kid's LeapPad Platinum.  This was the best find for the best price.  Plenty of room for the tablet, charger, and games.
 Great quality and fit. I just wish it had a tiny bit more bulk to fit things that may go along with a laptop like controller, mouse, hard drive/disk drive.
 Good carryall for the Levono Yoga tablet. Fits perfectly with many extra compartments.
 Fast delivery great product
 Fits my iPad perfect and made of excellent quality.
 It is basic, and that is what it is supposed to be.
 A great bag for the price. It fit my big laptop with cords and controllers with ease. I thought the bag and padding would be thicker but it's not bad. The shoulder strap has a swivel on them so it won't get tangled when you are carrying it which I thought was a cool feature. Overall, very good value and I would recommend this to a friend.
 It was just what I needed for my new chrome book.
 Excellent
 My daughter loves it.
 I sewed some mesh pockets onto it to carry bottles and such and it's perfect.
 Great product, works as expected
 Good.
 This is really a great bag for my IPAD AIR and I love the zippered pocket on the outside.  It is large enough to hold the charge plug as well as cleaning pads.  I gave one to my son as well.  Excellent purchase
 to small
 this Amazon basic bag is really good, i was pretty surprise at how good and durable it is. Currently using it as a laptop/iPad Air bag and other papers in there for work.i love it
 Fast service. Product as advertized. This is very well made. Definitely worth the very low price for this level of quality.
 Got here fast. Great item. Very pleased.
 Love it
 Very pleased with the quality of products AmazonBasics are making for customers! I will continue to check to see if items are available by AmazonBasics  prior to future purchases.
 This bag is the ideal bag for a student. Sufficient room for laptop journals chargers headphones etc.
 Everyone that received these bags has enjoyed them. Just the right size for our Lenovo idea pad 11" computers.
 I love this bag for my computer.  It holds everything I need to carry for business with room to spare.
 Nice item, Ok quality
 Good quality, can fit more than my laptop in it - love it.
 Nice case.  I use it for portable DVD player.  Nice!
 Great quality for a reasonable price.
 I thought the case would be more snug but I guess it works if you plan to put more than just your laptop in it. It's a decent size and does seem to offer protections. Good quality for the price but I think next time I'll spend a little more for more protection.
 Pretty well made, plenty of room.  When I am in the market for a new computer bag i'll be looking for Amazon Basics again!
 Great!!
 I love it, came in 12hours early. Very spacious. Love all the pockes.<br/>If i need another one i will definitely buy this one again.
 Looks good and does the job
 Ordered this size because a review mentioned that the extra space was good for cords, a tablet/iPad, etc. This is perfect for class and everything fits. Shipped fast with prime and I'm beyond satisfied.
 Able to fit my 11.6" netbook, backup battery, MiFi, mouse, and 2 power cables. Good construction. Can't complain about the price and the quality appears excellent.
 his is exactly as described and works well
 What a great bag. Easily fits my 17" laptop plus the cooling tray.<br/>Lots of pockets for those pesky extras (cords, mouse etc).
 My laptop won't fit inside the pocket where it is supposed to go. It is a 17.3 inch. It does fit in the bag,  plus the cooling pad so I will keep it.
 I was looking for something basic to hold my laptop and this bag fit the bill perfectly.  Its padded with plenty of pockets to hold extra items and has a strap if you wish to use it. It protects my computer and is professional looking. Great product Amazon!
 its a nice bag holds my acer cb3-111 perfectly like a glove several pockets for usb cords and adapter not  a bad bag loos good and works good for the price its awsome
 I like the bag but it it look rather cheap
 Perfect fit well worth the money
 I use it as man bag not carry my briefcase. I use it every day and looks like day I got it.
 Perfect, just what I needed!
 Perfect bag! I'm able to carry my laptop, tablet, chargers and even books! Doesn't feel bulky or cheap. Would definitely recommend!
 this is a nice pouch and I carry my Surface RT, Surface Pro 2, and a Dell Venue Pro 8 in it.  I'll replace that Dell with a Surface Mini when it comes out...  I'm hooked on Surface.  Did I say I like Surface computers yet?
 nice
 I love it
 Like all AmazonBasics products I've purchased, this is thoughtfully and nicely designed, works perfectly with my 11.6 in. laptop, with the right amount of extra room without being too bulky.
 Good bag at a good price.  I have purchased many of these bags.
 Works as it should. Purchased this for my boss and has held up fine.
 Was very impressed with the quality and stitching of this bag for what i paid.  Looking forward to long term use of this bag.
 THE INTEL CORE I5-6200U JUST FIT IN IT.  VERY SNUG FITTING.
 Perfect for my Samsung 4 with 10.1 inch screen. Well built and very versatile. Exactly as advertised. Would not go smaller than this if your screen is 10,1 or so.
 Inexpensive bag, but works like a charm! Plenty of pockets, attractive and priced right.
 Case came exactly as described. Very nice and appears to provide a lot of protection for my laptop. I am a home health nurse and will be carrying my computer from my vehicle to various homes each day, so I needed something durable. I think this will do the job very well.
 Great product. Laptop fits perfectly. Enough space for accessories, very comfortable.
 Really good quality and fits perfect
 Got this bag for my mother's laptop. It is very well made and looks like it could stand up to the rigors of my travel so I may order another for myself.
 Great product! Although not very heavy duty. It's made from a very light material, polyester nylon type. But the computer fits nicely and has room for many things.
 Best bag I have ever bought for any of my laptops. Very pleased with my purchase!
 Love this bag fits work laptop very well with room for accessories.
 This is a nice laptop bag. Lightweight and durable. I like it.
 Very Nice bag!! Holds my 16" Laptop well.  Only complaint is the lack of padding on the inside bottom, but I remedy this by inserting a strip of foam rubber on the inside bottom of the bag.
 I constantly use the lap top that I purchased this cover for, so I haven't used it yet.
 great bag, nice an compact. Perfect for my dell tablet. Even has a strapping brace along the back side to clip on an attachment pouch for an external mouse or something similar.
 Wonderful Very well constructed
 Roomy, holds laptop and more
 nice
 Great laptop case!
 I have a Toshiba netbook that I bought this case/bag for. This particular netbook has a battery that sticks out the back about a half an inch. I was a bit worried that this case would not fit it, but it did. The front pocket also held the charge cable with no problems. It was worth the buy especially since it didn't break the bank.
 Only had it a month and the shoulder pad is frayed and fell apart.
 Solid laptop bag that fits my pretty-big work computer. The pockets work well for carrying files, chargers, or other gadgets like a a tablet.
 You can't beat the price for this little Netbook case, and I actually sort of like that the zippers say, "Amazon basics." If I'm going to make a statement, I want that statement to be, "I'm into function over form, and I still find it kind of novel that Amazon slaps its own name on products now."
 I had to carry this in pouring down rain and my note book came out good &amp; dry. I also like the extra pocket for storing a mouse or charging cord. I would definitely  refer this product to a friend. In which I have already done so.
 Size as described.  Good quality and good price.
 I love this and it is worth the price that I paid for it.  If anybody is interested I would advise ordering it.  Because it is worth every penny you pay for it.
 The bag is perfect for the laptop and other items needed to be carried around comfortably
 Excellent!
 Tis bag is well made with lots of department space I highly recommend
 Awesome, love it
 My husband is loving his new work bag!
 Nice price, now I feel better to carry my iPad around. Without the fear of dropping it.
 Really nice laptop bag, very roomy and nice for my laptop
 I TRAVELED WITH MY LAP TOP AND THIS BAG WAS GREAT.IT HAD ALL THE PROTECTION THAT IT NEEDED.
 Bag is too soft, no padding. Not protective enough. I set it down a few times and I could feel the computer being damaged. My macbook has little compression scars now. Buy this if you don't really give a crap about your computer.
 Really nicely built. Plenty of extra space, yet not bulky. My 2-in-1 tablet power supply fits nicely into this, as does the main unit. Build quality it very good.
 Nice case, would have given it 5 stars had it had metal clips and rings on the carry strap.  I wont use the strap for that reason.  They break too easily.  Other than that. The case is fine.
 Perfect fit for my HP laptop. Plenty of pockets for accessories. I like the way this bag is made. It seems very sturdy. Handles and straps are comfortable.
 Awesome!<br/>Perfect size for my Erin Condren planner!<br/>I'm going to order one for my sons electronics!
 GREAT ITEM
 One of the best things ive purchased on amazon!
 Can't beat this bag for the price, slim, lightweight, very durable, would definitely recommend !
 Arrived on time, brand new as expected and holds my 10.1 tablet perfectly.  Other accessories fit just fine as well. Nice build quality from amazon basics... good job
 Good quality no frills bag. Holds my MSI leopard pro perfectly. Pricing is where it should be with nothing elaborate about it. Has a little extra room for the charger and a few other items. I'm looking at this from a protection stand point. Keeps the dust off and the pc scratch free. Kudos to Amazon on this one.
 I tried others, but kept this -- as good as the more expensive ones. I like the simplicity of the case -- who wants to have a flashy cover over a computer hanging on your shoulder?
 Just the right size and great price
 Ok.👍
 Love it! Spacious and comfy to carry.
 Perfect, affordable case. It has the two pockets in the front as well as sleeves on the inside of the main pocket. It has handles and also comes with a shoulder strap. For the price it's the best option.
 Well made and affordable.  I have a 10 inch Lenovo tablet that fits perfectly inside.  The tablet compartment is well cushioned and has nylon dividers to separate multiple items.  Highly recommend.
 The bag is neat and easily accommodates my Lenovo 2-in-1 tablet/laptop
 Nice case, especially for the price. Lots of storage.
 Nice simple bag. Laptop fits in it perfectly. For the price it an excellent buy. Why pay more for something only marginally better?
 Nice quality bag ,does the job.
 It works good.
 This is the second AmazonBasics case I have purchased. Sturdily made, handsome in appearance and highly functional case that is unbeatable for the price. Love both of mine!
 Nice bag, fits my 15.6" laptop perfectly with a little room to spare. Seems well made and at a decent price
 Great quality bag! Lots of room.
 I really like the look and feel of this bag. I just recently bought a new Tablet and I needed a bag and decided on this one. I did not want to get one the size of the Tablet itself in case I wanted to carry a notebook for writing and it makes it so I don't necessarily have to carry a purse. This bag is the just right size not too big and not too small.
 very nice
 My chromebook fits perfectly in this case.
 Pefectly fits Acer C710 Chromebook.  Nice feel.  Looks good too, but I would have preferred their logo to have been on an interior tag.
 Traveled with it only one time so far, through airports and rental cars. So far so good...
 This bag serves the exact needs I had: small, portable, durable and fits just right.
 Really liking this bag for my 11" MacBook Air. I have a laptop, the charger, a USB to Serial adapter and four 6' cables in the bag and there is a little bit of room left.
 It is just a bag, but it has extra compartments and the laptop fits fine.  The price is very good value.
 AmazonBasics does it again with a nicely designed, well-constructed laptop bag with plenty of pockets for storage, small enough to be used as a laptop sleeve inside a larger bag or backpack.
 Very nice case for the money.
 Constructed well enough. I bought this for an 11.6 in tablet (which has a Bluetooth keyboard "case"). *** I would not suggest this for anything over a 9 in tablet *** The case is too tight for an 11.6 in tablet (Mine was a Samsung Slate 7).
 Perfect size for my Dell E6410 laptop even with the larger battery. Compact unlike my other laptop bags. Sturdy handle and well made.
 Bought it as a cheap alternative for carrying my sons leapsterGS. I read other reviews for the leapsterGS cases that the rechargers do not fit in with the gams system and games so this will be perfect for carrying everything.
 Thank God I got this bag.....stylish and very sturdy<br/>I would recommend this to anyone<br/>The padding is very nice and keeps my valuables protected.More than two years later and it's still going strong! Great purchase!
 Great
 Is good to carry and organize everything you need but doesn't protect your laptop very well. Plus I kind of feel dumb carrying a briefcase around. I would rather take a backpack.
 Amazing for the price and totally is worth the low price for this bag!! Have had it for over a year and is going strong!
 Ordered this on the 25th of January and it arrived on the 27th of January. Delivery took a day and a half, WOW!! And to top it off the bag is just perfect. It fits my 17" laptop with ease and it looks and feels very durable. I am very satisfied with both the delivery and the product. Thank you.<br/><br/>Paul D.
 Nice quality bag for a cheap price. And I received it in 2 days. Wow that was quick. But seriously, if you just need a bag for your laptop and don't want to spend so much, get this one
 fits 15.6 laptop great protects well looks good cant beat the price
 this item works great for my laptop computer and my husbands, we can fit both inside
 Amazon does it again!<br/>The bag is Strong, it feels like i'm gonna get some years out of it<br/>It is also light, surprisingly so.<br/>It is also well padded, provides good protection for your devices.<br/>I would definitely recommend to anyone!
 This bag is light weight and just the rught size for the laptop and extra papers, cords, mouse, etc. we've even used it as a convenient carry on bag for small items. Great price.
 nice
 works great with the asus chrome book. Lots of space for storing the mouse and cards and such.
 Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for. Holds everything I need when I'm on the go!!!
 Fantastic bag for the money. You really cant go wrong with this one. Comes with pockets and dividers on the inside to sort and store your items. It's great for my Toshiba Satellite. The quality is comparable to a Case Logic bag. So as long as you don't mind a bag that has "Amazon Basics" embroidered on it, one should be happy with this bag.
 Excellent for the money.. a little more padding would be nice but at this price point its fabulous.
 The bag itself works as expected.  The size is perfect for a 14" laptop (Lenovo Thinkpad T440S).  The compartments could be a little better organized (I have a smaller bag that helps me organize more things), but it's perfectly functional in this bag.  The main complaint I have against this bag is that after a month or so of usage, the strap became very squeaky - would be a 4 star review if not for this unfortunate and annoying issue.
 Good quality.  Exactly what I wanted to carry my iPad in the case and some accessory items.
 My 14" Dell Laptop fits perfectly. There is even room for the power supply and a wireless mouse. Very compact and nice looking.
 just ok
 it works
 It's a solid basic bag, looks like it'll hold up. Not a lot of spare space once you put the laptop in.
 Great price. My 15.6 inch Dell just fits. Room for the power cable and a mouse, although the mouse kind of  causes the bag to bulge a bit. Can also add a folder in the main compartment.
 This bag fit my Kindle DX and would also fit my iPad too. What I like about it is that it is slim like a sleeve but has handles to carry securely. Very hard to find a bag like this made of quality materials with a separate pocket for accessories as well. Great value and I intend to get another.
 Great as a briefcase.  Many dividers &amp; pockets.  Would have been nice if there was another outside pocket where there is a non functional nylon strap.
 Worked great for several months. One side of the strap tore at the seam. A little disappointing because it was getting very light use.
 Great case for the price. It seems to offer relatively good protection and fits 15" laptops perfectly.
 Great bag does the job...
 Just the right size, my new man bag! Ideal for keeping up with my wallet keys and cell!! It's a small satchel!
 fits perfectly
 It feels very cheap, very thin. I don't feel confident enough that it would protect my laptop. The material feels very cheap, almost like plastic.
 MY HUSBAND WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE BAG FOR HIS LAPTOP.  HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH EVERYTHING I PURCHASED FROM AMAZON.
 This case is great. It holds a lot of things. Like cords papers for the tablet you want to keep. Its sturdy and durable. I would recommend this product to anyon .
 Not bad....pockets should be deeper.
 Very light and sturdy. Like it!!
 Great little compact bag that fits like a glove. No wasted space, and has ample storage beyond he laptop itself.
 Nicely padded - and with an additional zippered outside compartment.  This thing fits my Dell E1705 perfectly.  Good price and would certainly purchase again if needed.
 perfect, can hold charger, mouse, and lots of dongles.
 Pretty durable, could use a bit more padding to protect the computer, but, not bad for the price!
 Good
 I like it
 This one fits the Alienware 14 very well with room to spare for accessories and power supply and mouse.<br/>Great for the price. Will purchase another one for my wife's AW 14 also.
 Highly recommend this bag because of its quality and its price.  Moreover, it is durable and easy to carry.
 Have been using it for a year now. Great!
 I have the Acase Pure Genuine Hand Made Leather Case Folio and it still fits inside.  There's plenty of room inside there too! I'm sure most cases that fit the iPad can remain on while placing in this bag.  The construction is durable, feels like this would be sold at the Apple Store for $30-$40
 I use this like a small suit case, perfect for me!
 Great Laptop bag... Very well made... Impressed!... Everything I expected.
 Perfect gift that accompanied the lap top for my daughters 13th birthday. She loves it.
 I ordered this for a friend who is going to spend a month in Paris.  He bought the 11" MacBook and it fits like a glove.  He loves the big pocket for the charger and accessories too.
 The product can unsnap if the strap gets in a bind, like when you get it out of the car or even sitting on a chair. I have dropped my laptop twice, and this time, the $70 battery (New 800049-001 KI04 replacement battery for HP...) I bought (also from Amazon) now doesn't work<br/>Disappointing
 Good product
 Its quite hard to find 17.3 inch laptop bags. Most shops stock 15" ones only. I like my Amazon Basics 17" bag. Its a cheap bag so u won't get premium materials or heaps of pockets &amp; padding. Still, it does the job for my laptop. I wished the shoulder strap was longer though.
 This bag is a perfect fit for my IPad Air. It also fits smaller IPads and tablets. It is soft, has an outside zip pocket for a stylus, charger, cleaning cloth or whatever you want to take along. It also has a zipper to close the bag and handles. You won't be disappointed with this purchase. I bought my husband one for Christmas for his IPad. I don't want him to take mine!!
 Perfect for the computer.good quality
 What a deal for a great bag.  Fits all the essentials and looks to be durable.  Very pleased!
 This is a real find. A padded carring case for tablet type devices. I really like three things here; well padded, handles and a small sippered pocket. Slight points off for the orange color inside, but not a deal breaker
 a place for everything, durable and worth every cent
 It meets my expectations and the inner pockets are very useful. My 17.3 inch laptop fits perfectly.
 love how small and not bulky this case is.<br/>Made of a wet suit like material.<br/>Has very well made zipper that holds up to a lot of usage.<br/>Nice front zipper pocket for cords, headphones etc.<br/>I highly recommend for those who travel with their ipad a lot.
 Good bag.
 Perfect. Just what I needed. Great size and well padded.
 I love the added protection this case provides for my IPad.  It has a small area to put my cord and wiper in.  It even works with the case on it which is leather.  There is a good amount of room.  I plan to take it to Florida and Disneyworld.  This will provide extra protection while on rides.
 This is a really nice laptop bag and well-worth the price. It's well-padded and has several compartments, some with zippers. Bought another one for a gift.
 I purchased this as a gift for my son.  It was a good product at a good price.  It's adequate for his needs, and he carries it to work out in the field every day.
 The grip is easily broken after a few days of normal use, for a 13" Chromebook.
 Super nice case. You won't be disappointed with this one. It has nice padding in it to protect what ever you carry. I use it for my iPad with an Armor box cover on it and it fits perfect.
 Perfectly functional. But I wish there were options to add flair or different colors to reflect individual style.
 Perfect for my 14" laptop. I took this one to Portland and it was just the right size for everything. Compact, well padded and solid construction.
 I purchased this laptop bag along with a laptop for my mum. Im in love with this bag and think I will make another order for my laptop. Spacious bag, durable, lovely compartments for charger, mouse, stationary, books etc.I would recommend
 Holds a lot of extras. Easy glide zipper
 good room durable so far laptop, chargers, tablet, mouse,power banks, portable HD, cables, class books, usb drives and adapters, misc stuff
 Great price point, exactly what I needed, ample space for the extra cables and battery charger. Good quality.
 Hold my laptop very nicely and cameras
 I like that this bag offers good protection to my iPad and the side pocket is handy for the cords and other stuff. If it had a shoulder strap I would give it 5 stars.
 This really isn't the best lap top bag. It's pretty small and feels pretty flimsy. But then again look at how much it costs.
 Very nice bag to keep the DVD player and all accessories in when not using. Would highly recommend.
 Nice case with pockets for accessories.  Comes with shoulder strap.  My laptop fits nicely in it.  Better than some of the more expensive ones.  Well made-can't go wrong with this one.
 Works perfectly
 Great product
 The fit was too tight for my new laptop.. Spend a little extra and get a better one. used this one time and should have sent it back.
 does the job fine
 This is my husband's "murse." He carries all his daily possessions in it, including his 10" Kindle tablet.  It has worked perfectly for him, and he likes he small separate zipper pocket that lets him keep some items apart.
 Nice bag
 Good enuff not much room but does the job..
 Very nice product, for the money. Fabric is fine. Compartments are fine. OK for public use. Thank you.
 I love this laptop bag, it fits my macbook perfectly. The quality of this bag is amazing and I'm very happy with this purchase.
 No what I expected ....but it’s my fault for being cheap
 Really nice and inexpensive.
 You get what you pay for. Still, I expected more from an Amazon Basic product. Everything about it feels cheap.
 Product was shipped fast and came as described.  Works great!
 Laptop bag is exactly as described. Great value.
 Love the price  it’s worth it !!!!
 I just wish it wasn't squeaky when walking.<br/>Other than that's it a good bag. Can also hold a small folder for note taking.
 The bag works okay for what I need it for.  it's a little cramped for space, but it works well if you just have a laptop and powercord to store.
 This was a gift for my mother last year 2015 and it seem to be holding up. so thumbs up
 Sturdy, does the trick but could use a bit more padding. All in all it's a very good item. 17 inch laptop fits perfectly.
 Muy bueno
 Perfect bag for a computer and other items.  High quality! this even fits my 17 inc laptop plus lots of other stuff.  On top of that, when I did get a small tear Amazon send me a new bag overnight at no extra charge!  Highly recommend it.
 I bought this bag for work. It's still going strong months later. The strap is very comfortable too. You just cannot, CANNOT beat the value you get with this bag elsewhere. I love Amazon Basics items.
 Great bags and decent price.
 I intentionally ordered this size even though I have only a 9" tablet. I now have my tablet in a leather case with bluetooth keypad and it all fits perfectly. The pocket lets me carry all the cables I will need. Nice and compact now. Forget travelling with my laptop.
 This is a great bag for my Chromebook. Plenty of room and pockets, while still easy to carry and not bulky.
 Plenty of room and extra pockets!!
 I bought this bag for my husband and so far he is very pleased with it. The bag is spacious enough, light and smartly organized. He took it on a trip and was able to git all his gadgets into it.
 Plenty of useful pockets for pens, my wireless mouse, papers, etc. Sturdy too.
 Look very nice!!
 Excellent. Excellent laptop bag. Has every imaginable compartment needed with great padding. The carry trap has extra padding as well. Very comfortable. Great price too
 This is just perfect size and feel. It has soft side for some buffering bangs. The handles are handy, and the small front zip pocket fits for the plug and cords/and or your cellphone. Good pricing, and arrived fast.
 Great product and it was much better than I expected. Has plenty of storage room for earbuds, smartphones and other accessories. Would recommend to other buyers to purchase.
 Very useful and thin. I put my laptop, charger, and flash drive in here plus more. I HIGHLY recommend buying this.
 Very useful for carrying your electronics for your laptop, handheld consoles, and anything you can think of to place your belongings to live out your day-to-day basis.
 No issues.  Fits Ipad but not much extra room for accessories.  I wanted a small case and this is what you get.  Padded which helps for a little extra protection.  Fits with the keyboard case I have on the Ipad.
 Nice case, Well built, Useful features.
 Just as described.  Great seller and A+ customer service!.
 I found this item to be quite useful and practical. It has one main pocket, with three pockets inside it, and any laptop up to 15.6" will fit absolutely perfectly, with pockets for the charging cord, mouse, headphones, and mouse pad. Also comes with one external pocket, great for a mouse, mouse pad, or other accessories. To top it all off, it comes with a perfectly sized neck strap for carrying around on the go. All in all, I thought this product was amazing, and I would recommend it to anyone with a laptop or tablet.
 Great Bag. Compact and fits my particular needs.
 Holds my big, new first time purchase laptop and the items I need to go with it.
 I purchased the 11.6 carrying case for my iPad 2. It holds not only my iPad but my extra cords and mini speakers as well. It is a sturdy tuff case that will last in my opinion for the life of my iPad.
 It's exactly how t is described. It's a nice bag.
 love it
 This bag is perfect size and works fantastic, especially for the money.
 just as advertized
 Quality, quality, quality. Well made and fits my Aspire V15 perfectly. Plenty of room for extras and well padded. Very happy with this product.
 Nice
 Purschased as a gft for my grandson.  He is "super happy" with it.  Thanks for the great service.
 high quality. all the right compartments.
 Good, simple, laptop bag. I look professional when I walk around with this.. lol.. can't beat it for the price.
 it's only be roughly 4 months and the padded shoulder piece starts to rip ..... not really nice. But other than that it's an okay bag, fits my laptop and all it's accessories plus extras perfectly.
 Fits a lot of accessories and my GoPro Hero4 Silver.
 I have only used it a couple of times but the protection seems more than adequate and the laptop fits very well.  Not a lot of extra room for accessories but a mouse and the power cord do easily fit in.
 This is a perfect match to carry a laptop.
 I liked the bag. It used it a lot and the zippers and pockets worked well. But after 16 months the strap broke. Now the bag is useless.
 Might not get 5 stars if it was 30 bucks, but for about $12, you get a bag that holds an iPad perfectly, does a good job of protecting it, and it is easy to insert and retrieve your iPad. Like the little pocket on the side - that's where I keep my microfiber cleaning cloth.
 great
 I like it. It was the perfect size I was looking for as I don't like bulky and stuffy bags.
 I LOVE this laptop carrying case!  It's roomy and thickly padded for protection of the computer.  This was an excellent purchase!
 Fits my ever chrome book 11.6 inch laptop like a glove
 Have not really had much occasion to use it, but a nice bag.
 Nice, really cool.
 Great quality for the price! Fast shipping! :)
 I like this bag because it has a nice handle and a zipper compartment for the cord (or whatever).  It did smell awful when I first opened the box, so I aired it out for a few days.  It seems like it will hold up well.  I didn’t care for the color of the inside but for 10 bucks, its a good deal.
 Three zippered compartments to hold mini mouse, cord and charger and plenty of room for the HD 15.6 Envy laptop. Has secure handle and a stowable shoulder strap. Seems as sturdy any of the brand name cases that I own.
 Perfect for carrying both of our iPads along with chargers, etc. Very well made. We've gone through a few cheap ones that came apart. This one is sturdy.
 It is nicely padded  and the material is sturdy, however the outside zipper  does not work properly and it  is not tall enough to put a wireless keyboard in.
 I have used these bags in several sizes and they are high quality, well made bags.  After 3 years of using the 10" daily the only damage is that one of the pull tabs came off the zipper.  This 11.6" bag seems even better made than my old 10" one.  For the price I don't see how you can get a better bag.  The 11.6" has plenty of room for the computer, charger and other items.
 Is a good product
 Love this bag for my Lenovo Yoga 11.6. It holds the pc and all the accessories very well.
 Very affordable and nice bag.  Fits everything for my 15 inch Dell laptop and has a comfortable shoulder strap.
 Well made, rugged. A nice value for the $$$. Plenty of pockets and nice, thick, quality material.<br/><br/>Are there fancier bags out there? Sure. Do they carry your laptop any better? Of course not.<br/><br/>Buy this!
 I was even happier when I got this than I thought I would be.  This exceeded my expectations.  Great bag to carry my tablet and charging cord.  Plenty of room, easy to carry, and very well made.  A great product!!!!!
 Fit perfect looks great
 I love this laptop bag. It fits my laptop, cords, and mouse with room to spare. Similar laptop bags go for three times this price.
 Yes, BASIC but at a basic price so OK for me.
 Nice for the price, extra storage nice.
 I've used the bag daily for a few months. Only complaint is the shoulder pad, not very comfortable or as good ad other bags I've purchased.
 My laptop is 16in and it fit beautifully. Sure, you need to break it in, it may be snug for the first couple of times, but then it fits great! 5/5!
 This case is excellent - except there is not a grippy surface on its bottom. It tends to slide down flat on the floor if the floor is not carpeted.
 This bag is truly perfect for the iPad with the Apple case attached. It's excellent added protection for travel. It's affordable, a nice fit, and the pocket works well for charger, headphones and a cloth to wipe the screen.<br/><br/>Even the "frustration free" box it came in is great.
 Works well if you are just working for a simple, inexpensive bag.
 9 months and my bag is broken.... ;( any can point me to write for warranty or something like that ??
 Love my new Laptop Bag!  Very sweet.  It even has Amazon on the zippers like the photo.  Fits an 11.6 inch laptop perfectly.  Very well-made and attractive.
 Great product! I bought this for my brother for Christmas, and he loved it. It's roomy, and very nicely made.
 Came quickly, and fits just perfect.  Thank you!
 Good size, looks nice, good fit!
 The bag has great space
 Excellent storage for my iPad and a few other items needed to use it when flying. Great quality as usual from Amazon. I bought an LG tablet carry case from Amazon before and really like their line of AmazonBasics products.
 This bag is awesome and plenty large enough to fit an iPad of all generations as well as the charger, charging and sync cables, ear buds and any adapters. I highly recommend if you are going to buy a bag thus us the one to buy. The bag is nicely padded and will protect your iPad.
 This bag is one of the best computer/tablet bags I own and I own quite a few. This bag offers the protection you need plus the utility pockets come in handy for storing accessories. You can't beat this bag for the price.
 Well made, strong, and perfect fit.
 This was one of the only bags that actually fit my dell 17 inch laptop. The compartments are good, but the bag began to rip just 2 weeks into using it. Overall I like the bag, but wish it were made a little more sturdy.
 I just read a review by another customer about this bag, and agree 100% with that review. The strap suddenly got loose, and the bag fell on the ground, damaging my few $1000+ laptop inside. Needless to say, I am furious. I would never ever recommend anyone to buy this bag.
 I haven't used this much, but it does the job for my 15" laptop and holds the power brick in a side pocket. It's just what I wanted it a laptop bag, inexpensive and no frills.
 Very good thanks
 The shoulder strap squeaks when I'm wearing this bag and walking. It's annoying.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's a pretty good bag.
 this was a gift for a student to carry her laptop and she loves it.
 This is a great bag with lots of pockets and zippers and all kinds of things that make my life easier  when I have to take my laptop.
 works as discribed
 Good value for a basic product
 As advertised,  seems pretty durable. Super fast shipping. Though it was a little hard to figure out sizing. I definitely could have gotten a smaller one for my two tablets and small netbook.
 Good bag at a good price!  It works for my portable DVD player or one of our laptops.
 Perfect size bag for my 10" tablet with keyboard case. My tablet fits perfectly inside this bag with the keyboard case on and two pockets in the lining for papers. Second compartment has room for a few cords, portable charger, tablet stand, and a few small accessories. Even a small compartment in the front for a cleaning cloth, flash drive, stylus pen, etc.. Good padding on both sides for protection against bumps. Well made, removable, and adjustable shoulder strap for easier carrying.
 Wonderful carry bag for the price!
 I wasn't sure the size will be right and it was!  The bag looks very nice, light in weight, yet sturdy and the price was perfect!  Thanks.
 Very durable laptop bag. Great quality. We had to buy this because my husband's laptop didn't fit in the bag we had. This works great!
 I use it as a travel bag for my passport etc when i go on vacation. Very neat and handy.
 great item
 Great value! Love the front pocket to store charging cable because I always misplace mine.
 Excellent value for the price
 good quality and easy to install
 Very efficient bag. Loved it!
 This holds my Venue Pro 11, along with charger, mouse, HDMI cable, charger, stylus cover, and tablet shell case PEFECTLY. It seem well built too.
 This is a great small bag to slip this inside another bag or tote. It really adds a layer of extra protection with out the bulk.
 Nice product.
 I am prone to let the sleek form of the iPad or iPhone slip through my hands when I have a lot of stuff to carry.  This case is great for quick trips at work.  I throw my iPad in it and head to my meeting.  The pouch carries my charging cord, my cell phone, my stylus and cleaning cloth - all without bulk or weight!
 I love this case for my iPad and bluetooth keyboard. The accessory pouch on the front wasn't as big as I was expecting, but it fits my charger perfectly.
 This is a great case for carrying computer and assessories.  Great price too
 I love this case it protects the I Pad when I have to transport it any way. It is roomy enough for the I Pad and the keyboard I bought for the I pad. It has a pocket in the front so you can put the charger in.
 It's a cheap bag and I knew that. I feel my Macbook Pro is not well protected. It's a nice bag for the price but I feel like the bag needs a padded bag when the laptop is in it.
 It's a good bag, sits a little weird when using the strap but that's just a personal preference.
 This bag is made well. Enough room for my laptop and my Tablet. Zip pockets so the charging cords never get lost.Carrying handles are comfortable and shoulder strap comes in handy when hands are full.I also noticed the protective padding. Well made. Very happy with this purchase.
 It is well built and good for the price. But if feels like there is little to no padding to protect the items inside and everything feels too tight. everything is smaller than it looks. I probably have some reaponsibility since i never check sizes related to depth.
 My laptop fits fine along with cords and extras.  I even used it to hold 2 laptops when I traveled to Europe this spring.  Seems well sewn and strong fabric.  I would buy it again.  Good value.
 Very pleased with this purchase. It was reasonably priced and very well made. I use it for my Ipad Air which already has a Zagg keyboard cover on it. So, I wasn't sure if it would fit but it did.
 Slim, lightweight, well thought out design at a great price. However, strap connections are not riveted, box-&amp;-crosstitched, nor bar tacked. So this could be a durability issue.
 fits samsung chromebook perfectly
 Works great for laptop book and more I fit my 200 page book ipad, laptop and pens and Persian inside this thing very well build this thing isn't cheaply mDe good quality I'm Guna buy another for my wife
 Using this for a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9" and Bluetooth keyboard.  Fits well with room for more. Appears to be constructed well and the pockets are large for most items you might carry with a tablet.
 This is easily the best laptop bag I've ever purchased let alone price is amazing. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a simple, sturdy and protective bag
 Great bag for a very cheap price.
 Great Bag, small profile, Fits my 11.4 laptop. Fits also the charger and couple of other small things. Looks nice and feels good too.<br/>Recommended,<br/>Great price.
 This bag is awesome it fits my IPad with the case on and it is so easy to carry. The handles feel strong. I like that there is a zipper compartment so I can easily store my charger, headphones, cleaning cloth, etc...It is simple and works great for me!
 This bag is a very convenient way to store your tablet and accessories in one place. The fabric is cushioned to offer max protection while being roomy enough to hold everything. More color options would be a definite plus but you can't beat the price.
 Fits my Dell.
 Perfect for a 12 year old!
 I love this cover for my iPad.  I was looking for something lightweight, small and adequate for the job of protecting my iPad.  I have been quite satisfied with this product for a number of months now.  It is most convenient that there is an outside zippered pocket for holding the recharger and cord.
 This laptop case fits my laptop perfectly! Lots of room for my power cords, wireless mouse and assorted other items. And there is even room left over for my tablet!
 Nice little netbook/tablet case! Sturdy, soft handles, and a very roomy flexible outer zip pocket that can fit an iPad power cord and a mifi unit with its power cord with room to spare. Note that the inside is bright orange, and it's *loud* for those who might care.
 We purchased this item to carry our Kindle Fire and IPad. It is perfect for both of these together.<br/>It is made very good and is a great value for the price.<br/>We like the front zipper front for storing cords and other things.
 I really didn't need this for I also bough a cover which is what I use, but this bag is very nice, although I never used it.
 Perfect slim bag for a student!  The macbook fits in well and there is ample padding to protect it.
 So far I have experienced no problems with this product. I haven't used it a lot. It is a nice size and holds my laptop and cords with plenty of room for a tablet, binder, and more.
 Perfect
 This a great bag, especially for the price!  I love all of the pockets. I would only change the strap's shoulder pad.  I would like more flexibility and a non-slip backing for the shoulder side.  But still a really great buy!
 Used this everyday for over a year. Still going.
 Surprisingly high quality for such a cheap thing<br/>it doesnt offer great padding or protection, but this will get your devices, as well as a few books, wherever you might want them
 This little bag was perfect for my ipad air and a few basics (wallet, phone, a few cords etc), makes carrying everything around much easier in one place vs both hands trying to juggle items.
 Great gift for my grand daughter who wanted a lap top case just like dad's. Small enough for her to carry and for her lap top but all the details of her dad's big one.
 Very nice case. I use it for my tablet and as a mini briefcase when I go off to the doctors. It has a lot of pockets and it's very convenient for carrying a tablet and all of its accessories.
 Excellent product, very study with nice metal zippers. I plan to use this for a long time. Great amount of space for my 12" Macbook, although I got the 14" it's still a great fit. I can store all of my chargers and papers in the side pockets. Shoulder strap is also very secure. Excellent product.
 I did the usual run around looking for a computer bag and actually bought one at Walmart. Brought it home and it was the wrong size :( . Then I ordered one from Amazon and am thrilled with it!! PERFECT FIT. Very classy with 2 extra zipped pouches in addition to 2 sleeves inside. Lightweight and fully protected. Love it!! I will be looking at AmazonBasics for future purchases.
 This is a very light and basic 14.1 in laptop and tablet case. My MacBook Air and iPad Mini fit in the bag. I think my full size iPad will also fit in the bag along with the power cable. I like this item. There are better laptop bags, sure, but this is reasonably priced and well designed.
 Well made.
 Excellent... all good, i like it
 This is a GREAT little case (especially for the money). I've always used far more expensive cases for work, but I'm as happy with this as any costing $100+. Feels sturdy with quality zippers with 5 compartments (that I've found). Holds my laptop, charger and ipad.
 I own a Lenovo Flex 3 11.6" Laptop/Tablet and it fits snugly in the case. There are two inside pockets which can hold 8.5 x 11" papers or other items.  There are two outside zipper compartments.  The longest one has a slot for two pens (I usually carry 4), and 2 pockets.  I use one of the pockets to hold my mouse but it makes for the compartment to stick out a little when zipped up.  The other pocket can hold my USB drives or even a small wallet or hotspot.  I wish the compartment would zip all the way down the side for easier access but it just zips across.  The other compartment is great for holding coin change, glass cleaner wipes, or other small items.  I have a 15.6" laptop case but I didn't need anything that size on Sunday mornings when all I need is my tablet and Church School booklet, so this is fine for that purpose.  I can put my cord in one of the inside pockets, but again, it is a tight fit but the bag is easy to close.  The quality of the bag seems to be equivalent to other more expensive bags.  I have had no problems with the closures or shoulder harness.  All in all, I am pleased with my purchase.
 For carrying your iPad, this offers additional protection even for those encased in a cover, pocket to store chargers, adaptors, etc. A zipper that won't break or get jammed.  Little flimsy, but at this price, gotta love it.
 Hmmm.....what can I say about this bag? Haven't had much time to use it yet but took a quick minute to open up all pockets and examine the size and how it feels when carrying it around my shoulder. Much smaller than I thought but overall good quality. Will write a review once I try it out more with my books and laptop.
 Perfect fit for my laptop.
 A laptop bag that's good-looking, functional, practical &amp; can double as a carrying bag for paperwork..for under $20?  Are you kidding me?
 Perfect size for my 17-inch laptop. Plus all of the pockets are great for laptop accessories and such.
 Sent back. Cheaply made with little padding.
 Enough soace for anything, and very durable. Great product
 This works perfectly for my ASUS 11" notebook. Has additional zippered pockets for stationary and things like chargers.Another great AmazonBasics product.
 Worst purchase ever. Hardly any padding. One of the zippers broke after a few weeks and the should strap tore - somehow.
 Great build, tons of extra pockets for notebooks and other things for school.
 So many pockets, yet not stupidly large.  It's got plenty of room for a laptop, charger, mouse, 2 notebooks, and a bag of dice.  And it's holding up very well to daily toting about.
 Excellent product and design, I use it daily. Carries my tablet/s all the accessories comfortably and secure.
 I bought this for my dad. I was pleasantly surprised, considering how inexpensive this bag is, in the quality. His regular size iPad fits  very comfortably in the carrier, even with the Smart Cover on it. I love that there's a large zipper pocket on the front, too. Ear buds, a smart pen, cloth screen cleaner, and other small accessories, can conveniently fit here. For this price, absolutely can't beat it.
 Great bag for the price! This well laid out and cushioned bag is perfect for my need. They have several different sizes and this one fit my Surface Pro tablet very well.
 Perfect little bag. I was gifted a Dell Venue tablet at work; this little bag seemed the perfect home. And so it is. Durable, lightweight, unassuming black.
 Just the right size for my laptop. It bears strong and durable straps to properly sustain the weight.
 Well made and the quality for the price is pretty amazing.
 I returned the first one because the shoulder band strap started to rip and the second is doing the same thing.  It's not an essential part of the bag so it's not that big of a deal but I'd recommend going with a different bag.
 this one is for grandie to protect her laptop
 great for travel
 Great
 Laptop fitted in well, very light weight and seems constructed good
 I bought this to fit my Pavilion touchsmart 14 sleekbook and it fits perfectly. I wanted something to to travel with that wasnt to bulky and found this as a great option. Great Price and very well made.
 Purchased for Christmas gift.  Recipient is very pleased.
 We bought 2 and do like them
 A really nice designed carrier at a great price! It has place for everything and is still compact and lightweight. I did buy a 17" bag for a 15" computer and I am glad I did. The 15" bag would have been too tight a fit. This is more roomy without being bulky.
 This case combines the finest quality in both fit and durability while providing protection for my Chromebook during travel. In addition, the pricing is competitive and less than traditional brand names.The storage pockets for accessories is more than adequate. Thank you AmazonBasics for making this product available and enhancing my Chromebook travel experience. Exceeds expectations! J. Barth
 This is nothing fancy, but it's sturdy and serves the purpose of protecting our laptop.
 I am using this for my surface pro 3. Originally I kept the device in a sleeve then carried it my messenger bag. I am now using this instead to reduce weight and space. The device fits perfectly. There a spot to keep the pen and changing cables. I even keep my kindle paperwhite in the side pocket.
 Perfect for conferences/business trips.
 I love this product very much Cardine L.JORDAN
 So far it's holding up to normal use with no signs of ware, zippers work, no tears.
 Got the 11.6 inch version for MacBook Air. Fits perfectly. In addition to the main compartment, there are other extra pockets for other items. Fits regular sized papers as well. Has a strap - I can still put my hands inside my pockets during winter months.
 Very well made and durable.  I needed a case for everyday paperwork, not to carry my lap top.  This is a perfect size.  Very pleased with this purchase.
 Good tote for the price--
 Perfect for my MacBook!!!
 For the money this is a great laptop bag. With normal use it has stood up quite well.
 I bought this bag for my 3rd Gen iPad, which fits perfectly, even with a Logitech keyboard/cover installed.  In addition, it holds my user's manual and the charging cords for the iPad and keyboard, the latter items in the front pocket.  The bag is very well made, nicely padded, and extremely inexpensive.  Nothing else even comes close.  In view of the Amazon logos on the zipper pulls, I assume it was made by Amazon.  Nice work, compadres, a terrific bargain!
 I chose this because of the price. I needed something to take my laptop and accessories from A to B.<br/><br/>It gets the job done and seems to be made well without any corners being cut.<br/><br/>My only con is that the inside does smell a liiiiittle funky. I'm no sticking my face in there every day so it's not a big deal but there is an odor probably from the materials used. It however does not deter me from buying the product.
 This case is perfect for my Toshiba Satellite tablet, 11.6". It is not over sized like some cases, yet it holds the mouse and power supply easily.
 This is exactly what I expected. No complaints, I would buy it again.
 Christmas gift - good price - fast shipping
 Not wide enough to fit my 15" Laptop
 Actually I expected something cheap. The quality of the bag is really good. The protection isn't the best but then it is just for normal usage and for that, it is doing the job! Just fine.
 Nice case
 Compared to other bags, this one is at a good price point. My only complaint would be that the zipper doesn't work as smoothly as it should and it sometimes sticks on the inside fabric.  Overall, I got what I paid for and it's functional.
 It does the job, the fabric seems thin. Its alright
 Good quality, and inexpensive. We use ours at work to house the company ipads and associated cords. Keeps everything together for each new user. The soft case and handles make it super portable.
 nice design
 well made and roomy, carry a lot in it.
 Fits my Acer chromebook 11 perfectly. Made well with storage pockets. Just what I needed to store and protect my chromebook.
 Looks good and feels great...I have had many compliments on this neat bag that I store my Samsung chromebook and a few other documents.
 Our daughter needs a brief case for a school play.  It was easier to get this case and she can use it for her iPad!
 A good value for the price, arrived quickly and protects my laptop.  Fit was excellent, and it has loads of room for all the accessories.  The shoulder strap is very comfortable.  I wish it came in other colors.
 3 stars for the price and size, weak stitching at handles had to return the first one
 TOO SMALL.<br/>Good material<br/>Not totally pleased.
 it was ok
 This item is advertised as a case that with fit the 13" screen Sylvania DVD player.  It is too small and there is no way this case will fit the item.
 The bag is an excellent weight and high quality; it can withstand the weight of the laptop and any other essentials allowing you to work easily when traveling.
 Does the job
 I love Amazon, but I have never bought an Amazon Basic product before. I am so glad I did, the price was unbeatable and the bag is very sturdy with a lot more pockets than I thought it would have when I purchased it.  Great Quality product and I would highly recommend!!
 Looks like good quality product, protects iPad from bumping against things, handles, secondary compartment for Stylus, micro-fiber cleaning cloth, etc., and when zipped, serves to almost eliminate sounds from iPad if you forget to set the 'Do Not Disturb' function on the iPad.
 It was nice ....i should've gotten the bigger one but my bad ...
 Not a lot of protection so don't toss it in the overhead!  I guess you get what you pay for. Macbook Pro fits nicely but makes me nervous.
 very pleased
 I got this to carry my iPad along with a HDMI cable for class presentations.  It would probably work better if I didn't already have my iPad in a case - but it still fits.  It's probably a better solution for those of you who don't have an iPad case.
 I would like it more if it didn't have such a strong chemical smell. I wanted something that would hold my glasses, a Nexus 7, and a smart phone. The size is just right.
 Great bag. I ordered a lil bigger so I would have room for other stuff....... Plugs, discs, memory cards....... I just wish that it did not say Amazon on the bag as it makes it look cheap.
 This bag fits my iPad perfectly.  It is well made, light weight, has a strong zipper and a sizable pocket for extras.  All of this is available at an excellent price.
 Good overall carry case. Decent price.
 Surprisingly well crafted, and they fit our two chrome books perfectly.  I purchased these to go with my daughters new chrome books, and they are a perfect match.
 Great Item for the price
 This bag is awesome. I use it for my Surface Pro 3 and power plugs, mouse and other accessories. Definitely impressed with Amazon especially the price point!
 Durable and the separate compartments fix everything I need perfectly. Not just my laptob.
 Arrived in a timely manner and is exactly as described.  Love this case!  I would recommend to others.
 This is an excellent product and a great price. I just love the Amazon basics product line because the quality is extraordinary Thanks Amazon for great product.
 We use these for all our students K- 12 and they are holding up very well after two years.  Could have more padding on corners but for 99% of the students they are fine.  Pocket carries the charger for our 11" Chromebooks.  Can't beat the price.
 Which it had some protective padding inside. But as it stands its ok
 Very nice case for the money.
 Love this case. Perfect size for everything I use it for: iPad 4 in Brookstone keyboard case, Kindle Paperwhite, a notebook, iPod Classic and assorted pens, chargers, wires, etc.
 I have one that I keep my mini iPad in and stylist and chargers and I bought 2 more for my grandsons so they can keep up with all their stuff better ... I love this and highly recommend it to all .. Thx JL
 This is perfect for our Fire tablet and accessories. Nicely padded and nice looking. Definitely a good purchase!
 I have been using this bag for a 14 inch Alienware Laptop I got, it is fairly good, I just wish I could expand it a tad more so i could fit more cords and such in it,as it is it is a very tight fit, but it gets the job done fairly well and it is built solidly
 Actually better than I had imagined for the price, definitely fit my 17" HP with room to spare.
 Great for my 10" tablet and 10" netbook computer.
 Perfect small case for the full size iPad.  Pocket has room for accessories like the charger and cables.  Great value for the price.  Well designed and built.
 A very nice basic case. I picked it up for My Acer chromebook and it is ideally suited for the 11.6 screened  machine. The price made it a great buy
 Just what I was looking for, good protection for my iPad at a good price. It's well made also. Happy with my purchase.
 This is very well made, with various pockets and compartments. A solid choice! We are very happy, thank you Amazon!
 Well made. Perfect fit for my 10" tablet and accessories.
 Exact match
 HECK YES YOU SHOULD BUY THIS! I'm loving the bag so far
 Used with 8 inch HP 5002 Tablet to travel coast to coast.
 Works for what I need but a complaint I have is I carry around a $1200.00 laptop and one of the shoulder strap clips came undone and my laptop hit the pavement and caused some cosmetic damage to one of the corners of my laptop. I am just thankful that my laptop still works.
 100% satisfied.
 Perfect for traveling
 Just-right case.
 It is a lightweight sturdy bag that looks nice. The case does not have any protection though for your ipad or notebook. So i ended up buying a case to cover the ipad before carrying it in this bag. I only had it for a month, but so far so good. I would recommend this item especially since the price is good as well.
 I love it. I can fit my Chromebook, my Fire 7 tablet and my Dragon tablet in it. Very well constructed and sturdy enough. Excellent price.
 For the price this bag is everything I wanted or needed.  Light weight, spacious and pockets to fit the cord, mouse and other  items.  I use this bag to meetings and I can fit not only the laptop and accessories but file folders as well.  I was very, very pleased with this bag.
 I already had a small bag that I bought a while ago, but this one is so much nicer.  It has more room, but really doesn't bog me down travelling at all, and now I can put my little ILC camera in there as well.  Great value.
 Wow.  A great value for a cheap price. The quality is great. It is comparable to $50-$60 cases from brick and mortar store.
 This is a very practical laptop bag with right fit, and 2 front zipped pockets to keep charging cable and mouse among other things you my need for the laptop. I like it very much
 This is not anything fancy but it does protect my laptop.
 bought for wife. She is very satisfied with bag.
 Fits tablet as needed and has room for a few xtra's.
 Increadably good for it's price.  You will have to pay 60+ bucks to get a better quality bag.  The only probleMy is the strap pad is a bit thick and not plush padded.
 Bought this to go with the laptop I bought my daughter for Christmas. Excellent quality and construction for 15 bucks. 'Nuff said !!!
 Great price. Delivered on-time. Good packaging, with no damage. Very light weight. We'll see how it hold up.  It is what it is!
 Nice item!<br/><br/>Great Price!!<br/><br/>I like the AmazonBasics line! No frills packaging and great quality for what I need it to do...
 Very nice! Light weight, easy to carry!
 very nice fits perfect
 great
 Well made case, offered by Amazon for an irresistible price. The case has enough pocket room for my laptop, an archaic day planner, a graphic calculator, all my papers, and a legal pad or two. Perfect for students or travelers. It is durably constructed and well padded, though not too bulky.
 Worth the price. I use it for a 5lb 15.6 in laptop. I can also fit my Nexus 7 tablet, and a bunch of my chargers. However, it began to fall apart after about 3 months. Still usable, but not as aesthetic.
 Could not ask for anything better at this price point. I throw my iPad in the main compartment with my stylus and charger in the side pocket. Even then, there is plenty of room for other items.
 For the bucks, the best thing out there. Never a problem with an Amazon product with the low price and overall value. Lots of room for the laptop and other gear.
 Just what I wanted and only what I wanted. It fits my 11" laptop perfectly.
 My children are all in an online school.  We bought these for their school laptops.  they're roomy and perfect. Thanks
 simple and effective
 Too light Could be better to protect your investment of you laptop
 Perfect for carrying my KINDLE Fire HDX 8.9 with charger, my phone charger, pens, stylus etc.  Well made and lightweight but strong enough for protecting my "STUFF"
 Ideal for purpose; keeps every thing needed for chromebook safe and tidy.  We like the handles for  transporting and find there is plenty of exra room for pads, phones and charging accessories.
 great bag for the price
 Basic bag that has room for not only my laptop and necessary extras but I can also fit a book or two in it.
 WOW THIS IS A PERFECT REPLACEMENT FOR MY OLD ONE.IT IS BEAUTIFULLY MADE AND HAS POCKETS FOR ALL MY STUFF.CONGULATIONS.
 Perfect size for all Microsoft Surface tablets and their chargers, with extra room if you also have an iPad that you carry. Pockets in the side hold the cables and USB blocks nicely.
 my gaming computer is 17.3 in, but this bag just has little small,
 Fits my Aspire netbook very well, with power cord etc. Strap is comfortable and the handles are strong.
 Does everything it needs to, well built.
 Great computer bag. The pockets are big and there is space for the computer and other item (tablet, notebook, small book, etc).
 It's the perfect size for my needs. I love it.
 Excellent buy, compact yet provides protection for my IPad Air 2, great value, I especially like the compact size.
 perfect for my 10.1 inch tablet...
 Great bag. High quality, lightweight. It competes with and wins against much higher priced bags. I highly recommend it.
 Quick delivery, good quality. I needed this for my daughter's 10 inch laptop and the fit is perfect.
 Great bags for basic use.
 I fit my HP chrome perfectly, a little snug at first, now perfect.  Really like that I can include my Kindle and smart phone in the other compartments.
 Comes in handy for carrying small computers
 Bought an 11" HP Stream for my son. This bag is perfect and fits his laptop and all accessories, simple, basic and light weight enough not to over power his slight 10 yr old frame. At the price, you can't beat it.
 Worked great on a business trip where I had to fly out on a commuter jet and my briefcase wasn't an option. Carried just enough stuff!
 This is just what I needed.  It is light weight and will hold my Ipad plus other things just right. I purchased one for 3 times the amount for my husband, and side by side they are just about the same.
 Fits the iPad great. Well made.
 A slim fashionable  and compact 14'' laptop and tablet carrying bag with accessory compartments and padded shoulder strap at an affordable price. I love it.
 Very nice case for the money. Set up more like a combination briefcase-laptop case.
 Has kept my laptop well protected, with plenty of room to carry necessities for school (notebooks, pencils, etc.).
 Exactly what I was looking for.  Well made, simple, works perfectly for travel and work needs.  Protects everything well.
 Durable, comfortable and plenty of room.
 This worked out great for my needs, recently went.on a trip, the case is fully padded. Packed it in my luggage between some shirts, upon my arrival at the hotel, I didn't experience any damage to the case or my iPad.
 Very happy with this carrying case for my iPad.  Makes a nice gift also.
 Nice cases. Sturdy and well made. They fit my 10.1 inch with plenty of room.  Very basic which is great if that's what you're looking for.
 Great case for my laptop, and plenty of pockets.
 Fits my 2014 Asus X205TA netbook perfectly. Nicely sewn and padded with good zippers and sufficient storage for a cordless mini-mouse and the X205TA's power adpater
 Great bag, at great price with free shipping using Prime. Strap on backside and carry handles make this perfect for carrying attached to the handle of my roll along carry on bag.
 Ok. Not as much insulation as my old bag, or as many pockets, but hopefully will work well. Will post again after some time has passed.
 excelled
 This bag is as describe.
 I love it!
 Great little case, fits my acer chromebook perfectly and has plenty of room for my charger, a mouse, cords, and pen/paper.
 My first laptop, but this bag seems to have all features that you could want. For the price, it's got to be a winner.
 I love the laptop itself but hate having Windows 8 on it.  I would  much prefer Windows 7. I would not purchase this again if I had to take Windows 8.
 Great minimalist case for on-the-go.  Enough room to store everything I need (Laptop, charger, and external BD drive).
 This is a really nice bag for the price. I gave it as a gift and liked the way it looked when I saw it.
 Looks great and the laptop and extras for great. Very satisfied.
 This works so well and for the price it does stand up amazingly well to the wear if constant transportation. It's my daily travel bag for work.
 This bag was awesome for only $10. Ive had it for some time now protecting my tablet and it has no rips or tears anywhere. Seems like pretty great quality. Although it did smell new for some time before the scent went away. Awesome!
 Good product and good service.
 Gets the job done
 Replaces a nice leather one tat finally wore out - lacks character but protects well
 High quality, sturdy and fits the laptop well.
 Great
 This bag is the perfect size for my 11.6" Acer Travelmate. It has a couple of pockets so I can carry my thumb drive, laser pointer/clicker for presnetations, and several dry-erase markers, making me well prepared to give a lecture on the go. Nice and compact and convenient!
 Very nice product.  Fits HP Stream 11 perfectly.  Would buy this or other Amazon Basics cases again.
 great bag for a great price... I use it to carry all work manuals and more in it....
 I love everything Amazon basics. The best for the greatest price point. 3 cheers and applause for Zon
 the bag is a lot smaller than I expected it to be. Other than that its a good bag for the price.
 Great value. I use it when I don't need my main computer bag and it works out great.
 The case is very soft, and yet is seems to be made out of a very durable material. It has good quality zippers, and it is a great case for the price!
 The bag worked out perfectly.  Nice quality for the price.
 I got what I paid for. Simple bag that fits my lap top. Nothing special, as stated its a generic basic lap top bag. It does its job.
 Don't sway from basics. This is a great bag. Durable, thick, and supportive.  You don't need a fancy expensive bag to do the trick. Save some money and purchase this AmazonBasics bag. Makes for a great gift as well.
 Simple, functional, great price, and minimalist. Love it.
 Nice Case
 Nice like it
 Nice bag for the money. Fits our laptop great. Have not done any kind of drop test but it works fine.
 Great product and service
 Very functional &amp; lightweight
 We use if for our Clinicians to take items into patients homes.
 This review is honest and I wasn't bribed to comment!<br/>The product arrived on time and is perfect for my HP! Provides great protection, light on my shoulders, and very reasonable! I love it! Great purchase!
 Got it fast. It holds a lot of stuff. It's sturdy. I will buy again for a family member.
 Great product with plenty of storage areas
 Was hoping the outside zipper dept would be longer,  just a bit to short for my small kindle but can carry both small and large kindle inside. Great for travel
 Great, compact bag for the price.  I needed a bag to keep up with paperwork for Dr visits with several compartments but not too bulky and this fit the bill.  It was a great investment.
 This fits my laptop perfectly. It's not overly large, or heavy, but is sufficiently padded to properly cushion. The price beats anything comparable I've seen.
 As Advertised!  Not the best looking bag, but for the money THE best bag.  Roomy, sturdy, backed bt Amazon<br/>You absolutely cannot go wrong with this case.<br/>If you ever had to carry an IPad in a thick notebook sized case, this is a dream come true.
 this  works for Lenovo Idea pad  100s  and is not only well made but very light
 Great, inexpensive protection for my iPad. The price is beyond perfect. Highly recommended.
 Pretty decent bag for the price. Provides protection and even saved my laptop when left near the rain. Would recommend
 gave to granddaughter she loves it.
 Great Bag!! Has very sturdy handles, lots of compartments space, and a strap that is made of the same material as a seatbelt. There is padding between the two outside compartments, but there are interior pockets for additional storage in the Laptop compartment. Looks like it would be water resistant and probably will have no problems with staining. Very satisfied, especially for the price.
 Bag is holding up surprisingly well. Perfect size for someone that doesn't like carrying around a lot stuff.
 Nice bag
 Great price.  Fits my 14" laptop perfectly.  Lots of storage space.
 Holds power cord, wireless mouse, silicone keyboard cover, couple of USB drives, and the shoulder strap, and still has extra room.
 Will work for what I use it
 Excellent value, and well designed and constructed to protect my new IPad / tablet purchase. Ample storage for pens, and side-pocket storage, for charger cord, etc, with strong-durable handles. Also, comes with a detachable shoulder strap.<br/><br/>*Excellent value from an investment stand-point, and would definitely buy and recommend another one !<br/><br/>My best,<br/><br/>Tom Bozeman<br/>Charleston, SC.
 This is very basic but is just what I wanted!!  Not too big but just right for my purposes.
 It is well made and has lots of internal pockets and the two outside zipper compartments are just right for the extra "sticks" etc.
 Excellent protective addition to my laptop and my iPad. The side zippered pocket on the exterior easily conceals the charging cable to both devices.
 Absolutely LOVE this bag. Lightweight, durable and protects my laptop very well.
 Great , durable case with lots of room
 Perfect and affordable
 High quality bag for the price. In a store, I have no doubt this would retail for 2-3 times as much. There's room for the charger (something that a lot of sleeves lack) and a travel mouse in the outer pocket if you're traveling for a few days.
 For the price range, this is probably the best laptop bag that I have owned. It's very padded to protect and has a lot of extra storage space for whatever else you may need to pack along.
 Placing charging cord in bag makes it stick out awkwardly. There's barely room for anything other than that.
 Fits my Dell 7000 13" laptop perfectly with extra pockets.
 Good product, well made and reasonably priced.  You can have custom embroidery on the material.
 This is a great case for my macbook pro, fits real nice and a ton of side pockets for a lot of things like wireless mouse and charger.
 Perfect RCA tablet bag. Fits like it was made for it.
 great case, great price, and fast shipping, as described..  can't beat it for the money..  would highly recommend.
 You can't beat the price on this bag.  I purchased this about 6 months ago, and haven't had any quality issues with it what so ever!  I would highly recommend this bag!
 Bought for my Asus Q200E laptop. Fits wonderfully, seems well made, Price was excellent. Adds a little bulk to a very small laptop, but adds a lot of protection and has pockets for charger and accessories.
 Got as gift for my husband who travels by bus and train for work and he loves how light weight it is!
 It was, either, this or $75 Staples bag, I got this! Staples bad only lasts so long anyway! This has enough room, for now anyway!
 It's cheap.  It works well - multiple pockets and well-padded.  Don't expect a lot of room too much stuff; it's not a suitcase.
 Great basic laptop bag.  Just enough padding and a couple of pockets to put accessories in.  I am happy with this.
 Great
 holds everything I need. though the strap feels a bit cheap, i swapped it out for a different one. However for the price its a great value.
 perfect bag for my ipad2, headphones, stylus and stand.  fits great even with my gumdrop case on it.<br/>love the amazon zippers and amazon orange inside
 Looks good, works great. Could have been a bit better on the materials but the price is so low it's not that big of an issue.
 Excellent bag, perfect for bringing my work lap top home each night.
 It work great for my laptop, it is not too big and heavy. It's worth the money.<br/><br/>Keep in mind this bag does not protect very well the laptop. It works fine to carry the laptop but it is not very protective.
 Perfect
 I like this carrying case it is the right size for my notebook and it has enough room for other things.
 Good
 Basic laptop bag and fits the bill well for the price
 Great buy for the price, durable and has lasted a good while. will most likely buy another for my husband's laptop. Good buy for the price!!!
 Great bag and perfect size. Not to big, but yet handles what you need. Very sturdy!
 Needs a dedicated pocket for battery charger &amp; mouse, otherwise waste of large, width-wide pockets provided.
 Good construction and features for the money.  Why pay more?  I'm not sure I need a shoulder strap with something this small, will usually just stick the cased netbook inside other luggage when traveling.
 I bought this bag for my daughter, who was about to start her first real job in the tech world. She reports that she is very happy with the bag and the job!
 Just the right size
 The product is very spacious in compact size; the quality looks good and I would recommend it to others
 Great bag for the price. Not too many pockets or compartments but it’s ok. Very light.
 Good basic laptop bag. Not much room for additional folders.
 I like this bag a lot. Great size and nice durable material!
 This is a wonderful bag--many compartments.  Could not be more satisfied
 I acquired this carrying case for a 15.6" Acer and am glad I went for the next size larger. The smaller bag wouldn't have given me the room for charging cords, mouse, and associated papers needed to travel with the laptop.  The padded section of the shoulder strap was flawed in the stitching when it arrived but shouldn't be too much of a hassle to have repaired. Fairly pleased with the purchase.
 More than adequate space for computer, extra battery, power cord. Seems plenty sturdy as long as you remember it's for a computer and not a book bag.
 Fits perfectly!
 Very versatile bag. Just what we needed while waiting for the Caleb Case to arrive for field service!  Perfect size for our son, and we like the number of compartments.
 It does the job. Nothing fancy but it is well made.
 great value in well made no frills bag
 When I travel I put my iPad, with it's leather case attached, as well as a Kindle and GPS in the Netbook Bag. It has a separate pocket for chargers and the like. It has big zipper pulls and a nice soft handle. Perfect if you're taking all your electronics toys in the car.
 This is an absolutely great product for an excellent price. Offers plenty of protection for my small laptop.
 Digs into my shoulder and doesn't leave a lot of room once the laptop is in. Lots of padding and seems protective, though.
 Love this lightweight bag! Fits my 15in screen Dell laptop easily.
 Good
 Everything about this bag is perfect for me.  It is well made, sturdy, spacious; holds everything I need and is lightweight.  I couldn't ask for anything better for my needs.
 I used the bad five times over the course of two weeks. The strap was ripping by the fourth time I used it. Super cheap. Never ordering anything Amazon Basics again. I returned
 Very nice
 As described. Nice bag at a good price. Lots of room for extra things.
 this carry bag is awesome for the surface pro!!!!! the bag has plenty of pockets and zipper compartments and is 11.6 inch and the surface pro is 10.6 inch so it fits snug and is protected very well
 nice laptop bag but the belt scratched immediately after i used for the first time....
 Does what it's suppose to.
 Looks very professional and fits everything I need
 For the price its a good bag.  Spacious for two laptops
 Excellent protection for your little laptop or tablet!! Amazon hit a home run here for the price is great for this level of quality!
 This Laptop bag fit's perfect with my laptop and mouse. It even holds some of my school books and spirals.
 I like it very much. It is just what I was looking for. Good fit too!
 Much higher quality than expected, purchased another one a week later. Would buy again!
 Good bag!
 Fit s my needs: holds my 9.7” ipad, a writing notepad,  and a couple of gadgets. Light, with a comfortable shoulder strap. Satisfied customer.<br/>Using it for a few weeks, seems sturdy enough.
 works great
 Great quality
 Buen producto
 Very nice bag. Everything fits well.
 I was looking for something soft enough and not too big.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I was traveling on an airplane with it, so it worked out quite well, plus it held the charging cord in a side pocket.
 Well done and excellent product at a good price.
 My Surface Pro fits quite nicely in this bag, it's not too tight like my previous bag. I can also fit my external battery, mouse, and some cables without hassle. The quality is excellent for the price.
 Great bag with so many uses.  The quality is great.  I am so glad I bought this instead of a $60.00 - $100.00 laptop bag.  Don't let the price fool you.
 Love it
 After my the handles on my old leather briefcase (which cost more than $200) fell apart from a year of daily use, I knew I needed something more durable. I was pleasantly surprised to find this neat little bag on Amazon. Not only was it super cheap (Less than $20 - wow!), but it also is very lightweight and has a comfortable shoulderstrap. This is perfect for every day use - lugging my laptop back and forth to the office. It also has a number of pockets - perfect for my powercord, notebook, pens, etc.
 Not much to say about it. It's a case and it does it's job. I've had it for about 3 months and moderate use and no rips or tears or anything. Great product and protects my asus transformer book well.
 Most laptops won't fit, but works fine for tablets
 Fit my needs perfectly.
 Needs more compartments
 Very nice Bag with lots of compartments
 Good replacement for my Bible bag with room for my steno note tablet and pen
 Great size, great quality. I recommend.
 Quality case! Arrived on time. Pefect for what i needed. Thank you Amazon!
 Second one bought for use with small electronic 12" small laptops or carrying plugs, USB , or computing accessories.  Great for the price and will last.  Multiple uses.
 Excellent quality and will work very well with my Lenovo Yoga 2 (11.6). It is sturdy and provides great protection. The extra pockets will be helpful to transport items that I will use with the 2 in 1. The handles and shoulder strap will make transporting easier. It is also small enough to fit in a briefcase or my regular computer case. Great product!
 De muy buena calidad lo recomiendo
 received in excellent condition and allows me to carry my laptop and other necessary item with me as I am serving as caregiver for my son who is undergoing stem cell transplant for cancer.
 A bit flimsy and not very protective but it keeps the laptop dry and clean at least.
 Cheap.  But doesn't look it.  Well made.  Just works.  If you need Prada bag look elsewhere.  If you are into utilitarian .  This is for you.
 Great laptop/tablet bag.  Plenty of room for both of my laptops, tablet, e-reader and power cords.  Simple professional design, and seems to be pretty durable.  Looking forward to traveling and working with the bag.
 I bought this for the Sylvania DVD player and its a perfect fit
 This case is just the right size for my Ipad with enough room for easy access.  The zip compartment on the side is also just right for the plugs, etc I use for the Ipad.  I just wish it had a shoulder strap, but the handles go over my wrist so I can carry it easily.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/AmazonBasics-Netbook-Bag-with-Handle-Fits-7-to-10-Inch-Netbooks-iPad-Black/dp/B002VPE1Q6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AmazonBasics Netbook Bag with Handle, Fits 7- to 10-Inch Netbooks, iPad (Black)</a>
 it is a nice bag, but almost too small for the dvd player i purchased with it. it has several pockets and is padded for protection.
 Fits a 10" tablet very well.. especially like the pocket in the front, keeps my charger &amp; cord together with the tablet which is great for traveling
 Great price
 This bag is very light weight, bit still offers great laptop protection. I recommend it to anyone.<br/><br/>Have only owned it for a month.
 Already saved a Sony VAIO (so pretty and so fragile) from a 3 foot fall on concrete and the bag itself is very light. Perfect for anyone on the go and on a budget!
 It was better than I expected.  I needed a case for my 14 inch laptop and this one fits perfect.  It has plenty of pockets and is well made.  Works as well as any I've had that cost much more.
 good little bag for my dell inspiron 11 3137 2in1. it fits the laptop and charger perfectly and makes it so i don't have to carry a huge bag for a little laptop.
 Fix my laptop perfectly and has plenty of storage space for my mouse and charger as well as other needs I normally keep with me
 works well for my lap top
 Perfect
 great basic bag for a great price, quality piece of luggage
 This is exactly what I have been looking for! Small and light, yet many pockets. Sturdy when put down on a flat surface.  Balanced when on my shoulder. I do not use it for a computer or tablet.  I use it as my everyday work bag. It's perfect!
 This is a great little case!  I bought it for my ipad and used it on my recent trip to Norway.  I got drenched during a downpour on one of the days of my trip.  My backpack got soaked, with many of my paper items soaked and damaged, but my ipad was protected with this case.  Highly recommend this case for travel.
 Basic bag but with a pretty decent amount of pockets and compartments that made it a pleasantly surprising value.
 This is an excellent carry case for my iPad, 4th generation. It has several zippered pockets for separating the middle section, pens and pads, and cords,etc. I'll reorder another one when they become available again.
 size is just right for the dvd player or other small electronics.  Has many pockets, and nice shoulder strap.
 Only thing to make this better would be to have color options.  Works great for my tablet and also has pockets for other items.
 Very sturdy and easy to clean.
 Pros: everything is good from materials to comfort.<br/><br/>Cons: it's a little to tight for my 15in hp laptop I sometimes have trouble sliding it in the pocket.
 fantastic! i use it for my ipad air 2. its great! fits well, has a zippered pocked with plenty of room for extra thinge. it feels great, the zippers feel sturdy. and all for less than $10! fantastic, i love it :D
 You get what you pay for, case is ok
 Great bag, great price.
 This bag is great.  Looks well made and is functional.  If it had metal instead of plastic rings to hold the strap, I would have given it all 5 stars.  It was a great price as well!
 This is a great basic bag. Everything you need fairly compact and some basic protection
 Great bag. I didn't expect this nice of a bag for the price. Lightweight with lots of pockets. I like its slim profile.
 Fits the computer like a glove, plenty of extra storage
 Great. I carry this bag all the time. Very light and fits a lot of stuff in it.<br/>Very practical
 THIS ISNT WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE. IT FEELS CHEAP AND REALLY THIN AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADVERTISED AS A SLEEVE AND NOT A BAG<br/>THANK YOU<br/>KATRINA
 Perfect!
 Wears like iron so far....  Thanks
 I thought it would be a little bigger. I can fit my cased iPad air 2 and business cards but not much else.
 It fit my wide screen laptop perfectly.
 Good bag for price point
 The case isn't as thick as other laptop cases I wouldn't trust it if it fell its really just to carry it
 This is a perfect sized bag for my iPad (in it's case) to take when I travel. Has a separate zippered size area which is handy to store the charger(s). Easy to store in your suitcase or just carry when you need it. Very happy with this.
 this is just perfect for my new laptop  it is very light weight which I was looking for and can put the battery inside and a little extra room.  Just what I wanted thanks
 Just what I need for the care of my laptop. More than adequate space and well made.  Now I can carry around my things without worry of any damage to my computer.
 I gave this 4 stares because it does keep Avery thing you have for your computer or electronics together. this item is very amazing but I didn't give it 5 stars because if you drop it and it has that it will still get damaged in some way. you should get this item because it is awesome.
 nicely constructed and basic. price was great. I am using this one for my everyday work. I liked the slim size when I traveling on a plane and unlike some others it is fairly light weight.
 This bag is a great value for the price
 Has worked pretty well for my husband except for the detachable strap.
 ASUS gaming laptop won't fit.
 Great laptop bag for the money.
 Great quality! Plenty of space and bags to pack the essentials. Good padding to protect your small notebook or tablet. I do recommend this bag.
 My pastor sure likes it. Just the right size for his laptop.
 Excellent product for little $
 Great bag for an incredible price!<br/><br/>my only complaint is that the strap makes a squeaking sound when i walk around which is very annoying<br/>which isn't a big deal because the straps can be replaced
 Use for notebook computer and travel documents. Works well. Has plenty of storage for my use.
 A good, not great, buy. Not quite as much storage capacity as I had hoped, but it meets my needs adequately.
 Excellent laptop bag. My new HP 360 11.6 fits secure and perfect. Received it in two days because I'm a prime customer. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a great laptop bag.
 nice case! it fits my laptop just right! thanks for the fast shipping. I ordered yesterday day and got it today I didn't even pay for over night shipping
 So far it looks great! And perfect size for my son's chrome book for school! Just hope it holds up. :-)
 Can't be beat! holds my Acer 17" with room for charger and limited stuff. Nice quality, great price!
 Inexpensive pad, perfect for my current i-Pad, and will also fit the original larger sixe.
 It fits a 15.6 Inch Laptop. and its charger. That's what it advertises and that's all it does. There's no room for anything else so if that's what you were looking for then buy a bigger bag.
 excelente producto
 I like the design and the extra storage, its not big enough for my laptop
 Laptop slides in and out easily.
 Its a $15 bag, so its nothing mind blowing, but I would definitely recommend it - its a very well built bag. I use it for my micro keyboard controller, which it fits perfectly.
 very nice  lots of room and pouches
 Great product, cant imagine a better bag if you want something basic, and sturdy. Plenty of cushion to protect a 15 inch screen laptop. Fits snug in bag with room for mouse and plugs and any other things you may want, like a portable hard drive. Cant beat price.
 Quality product, especially for the price. Very pleased with this purchase.
 Great product at a very low price.
 Great value from Amazon! Have had a number if compliments o<br/>And inquiries from people who see it.  Fits the iPAD well.
 really love the case. keeps the ipad safe and easy to remove the ipad..
 Great price, fits lapop perfect, good quality.
 Great for my laptop. Very pleased with this item. Sturdy and plenty of space to hold my laptop and accessories.
 I have a 8" tablet that I purchased a key pad case for, I like the case but it has no pockets to keep the headphones, stylus and other extras in, this case is a perfect fit, has good protection and a large zipper pocket for those extras.  I love it!
 This is a very simple but effective car head seat mount. Uses Velcro, so it's very easy to put on and get off. It it fits my DVD player perfectly and is very secure.
 Very nice bag. Good material, zippers seem high-quality. Very nice purchase for only $14 dollars. Fits my Toshiba thin laptop very well.
 Basic computer bag.  Nice for the price, but not a lot of room for your other stuff. I like it.
 my wife loves this bag, she said it's strong and durable and you can fit multiple items in the bag.
 Convenient lap-top carrying case with several useful pockets and a shoulder carrying strap.  It seems sturdy and is an attractive bag.
 Great works as expected
 The description of this item describes that it is for the ipad Air fitting 7 to 10 in tablets, however the bag is way to large for the ipad Air. It swims in this bag, too big and bulky, defeating the sleak design of the ipad Air. It was even too large for the ipad 2 in my opinion. I returned the bag and will be getting a bag that properly fits.
 This a good accessory for a small laptop of large tablet.  At an economical price, it offers adequate storage and protection for your device while traveling.
 This bag is exactly what I needed. I have plenty of room for my laptop and other documents. The front compartment is very convenient too!
 Very durable bag. Great value!
 The straps twist a lot, but I get so much use from this.  Lots of pockets - I recommend it if you don't want to spend a lot of $$.
 Great value and fairly well made. I ordered 17" size so my iPad and kindle fire would all fit when traveling
 Great laptop bag.  Holds the laptop, cord, mouse, and room for other papers / items.
 Great for traveling.
 What can be said other than this laptop case is exactly what I wanted.  It will the purpose for which it was bought at a very good price.  Amazon service is outstanding!!!
 Excellent
 My daughter in law is the hardest person to buy for..  I bought this for her to put her I Pad in.  She loves it.  It is something she would not have bought for herself but she is happy to have it
 ok
 GREAT SIZE WITH ROOM FOR CHARGER UNITS .. HIGH QUALITY!!
 Received quick and product was just as expected.
 It was exactly as expected--and my expectations were HIGH. It's a quality product. I would recommend whole heartedly.
 Just as described and is a good bargain.  Fast shipping.  Would recommend
 Very good product for the price
 Good price.. nice sturdy bag
 Perfect for 11" Asus laptop.  Good protection, just the right amount of storage.  Shoulder strap is handy when your hands are full.
 I got this bag for my Acer Chromebook 15 and it fits perfectly with plenty of room for power cord and other electronics. Very pleased!
 I love the Amazon Basics 11.6-inch Laptop and Tablet Bag. I keep my Tablet in it, when I take it somewhere, and when I am not using it. Also, I do not want to break my Tablet.There are several sections to keep the cord and etc. in. I like the long strap, but you can use the short strap also. It is lightweight.  Janyce L. Young, from Milwaukee, Wisconsin
 This was a gift for my dad and he really likes it. The case is soft and light and fits his iPad Air 2 well with room to spare.
 Meh- this bag's alright. It's not as nice as I though it might be, and it seems kind of cramped with a 14" laptop, power supply plus mouse. I'd recommend getting the 15" laptop bags from Monoprice.
 wonderful product exact to discription
 This is by far the best deal for a 14 inch laptop bag. The bag has exceptional build quality and perfect thick foam padding for extra protection. At this amazing price, its a perfect deal.
 This is very well constructed and will provide great protection.  There's plenty of room and I love the accessory pocket.  The zipper pulls are great.  I got one for my mother's iPad too.  Great price too.
 Perfect for my 11.6" laptop
 A 17.3 laptop comes with a big charger which doesn't fit very well in the outside zippered pouch.  Forget about a notebook, mouse, and charger.  Other than these, its a pretty bag.
 It seems just right to carry your laptop. Down side I think it needs a little bit more padding to avoid those accidental drops, I wouldn't try doing that test.
 fits a galaxy 2 10.1 in an otter box just  fine. also can fit my asus transformer infinity 10.1 with keyboard in a poetic leather case but it is a tight fit. seems to be well made and the price was right
 Received as expected.  Big enough to have legal pad, mouse, cords and other items.
 Perfect size.  Comfortable strap.
 Love it.  Great product at great price.  It's nice to have a small bag for my small tablet.  A great walking piece.  Everything you need and nothing you don't.
 Bought as gift- nice, sturdy bag.
 Great computer carrier with lots of space for cables, mouse, and pad.  Would highly recommend.
 Perfect case for my son's laptop! Excellent price, and very solidly made. It has compartments for lots of things. It shipped fast, which was a plus!
 The fabric is ok: firm and strange to touch. The case also tear easily with a significant tear in the smaller pokey after two weeks of use. Furthermore the case barely fit my 14 in Lenovo laptop. There are better options then this product. In conclusion, this product is iffy so buy at your own risk.
 Real good product, price and delivery.<br/>I'm really enjoying it.<br/>It makes a great organizer for my computer et al.
 I ordered this in anticipation of a trip to see relatives. I got it and opened it up it is able to hold everything with ease. No problems at all with it.
 I wish it had padding at the bottom of the bag, but other than that...it serves it's purpose.
 Works perfectly with the portable DVD player I bought.
 It holds my two tablets just fine.
 great bag.  I can fit a kindle 8.9 fire hdx in here in addition to my chromebook.  why spend more for a basic cag?
 This is one of the most practical, functional and reasonably priced laptop cases I've seen.  Well insulated and moisture resistant. I like the xtra pockets for accessories.
 This is a very nice bag, computer ond acc. fit in it nicely.
 Sturdy case with several different compartments to hold not only my laptop, but a mouse, power cord, pens and important papers. It's just what I needed!
 Love it!! Fits my Lap Top perfectly and the side pockets allow me to carry the power cord and wireless mouse easily.
 A little tight for 14" size, but maybe it will loosen up a bit after use.
 The strap isn't entirely comfortable with the bag and it doesn't come off as sturdy as I want it to be, but it is otherwise an excellent bag for the price.
 Love this laptop bag! It fits my laptop perfectly and has a good amount of cushion for protection.
 Looks good.  Well made. Holds my iPad 3 in an Otter Defender case and a Logitech bluetooth keyboard in the main compartment.  The pocket holds a bunch of cables, adapters and a Line 6 guitar interface.
 I bought this laptop case for my 13.3" Dell 2 in one.  It's a great fit.  It holds the laptop, cable, mouse, and a few other items.  It's very lightweight.
 The perfect bag for my 14" Toshiba Chromebook!  I ordered the Toshiba bag at the same time to compare and this one won hands down.
 Very nice
 Fits my Surface Pro 3 and all its accessories nicely. I haven't had the bag that long but it seems to be well put together.
 Great bag,  great price.  It's serving me well.
 Very nice, exactly what I wanted. Lightweight and seems durable.
 Perfect! Good price.
 Low quality and makes noise. It has plastic inside.Clips on strap are chintzy.I would have returned them but I had to give them to my kids. Pay more and get better quality.Another thing is there is little or no padding on the bottom where it is needed most in case of a bump or drop.Pass on this!
 Good quality bag.  Easy to carry and holds my 15 inch HP laptop and its accessories quite well.  In addition to the laptop, I even fit my 10 inch tablet and its charger in the bag with ease.<br/><br/>It was affordable as well- you just cannot beat that!
 great bag
 Perfect size for my Inspiron 11.6 laptop, but no more. Carries a mouse and charging unit well. Compact and well-built. No regrets.
 Good case!
 :-)
 Sturdy and well made my 17inch laptop fit in it perfectly.
 Very reasonable price and the bag seems well constructed. I really like the extra pockets for adding cords and other equipment.
 Using this for a Lenovo Yoga 2 13.3"<br/><br/>Case has a decent amount of padding and isn't bulky at all.  I've been very happy with it
 awesome
 Perfect! Just the right size for my 15" Chromebook
 Everything fit as expected.  My Dell 11 inch Inspiron and all of the chargers, mouse, portable hard drive, and power supply fit nicely.
 Looks, works and feels great for half the cost of other ugly or bulky laptop bags out there.
 I bought 75 of these for my high school's chromebook program and they've been a hit. Spacious enough to act in lieu of a backpack to carry utensils and a few papers, cushioned enough for day to day use.
 Nice laptop bag.
 I have a HP Chromebook it fit with no room to spare i was better buying a 13 inch laptop bag
 roomier that I expected. Can fit an ipad2 and ipad mini - both with case - comfortably on the inside pouch. The smaller pocket outside is perfect for cellphone, keys and accessories. Love it.
 I love this little guy, I take my IPad Air in it Everwhere I go. I keep my charger and headphones in the outside pocket and know that everything is always together. For the price, you can NOT beat it.
 Exactly what I expected with an inexpensive laptop bag. Fits everything I need nicely.
 4 1/2 stars!  quality!
 It fits my iPad 2, keyboard, and a small coloring book (with chargers for keyboard and iPad), ALL very easily. Well made, zippers in great working order, and handles are sewn on well.<br/>Would definitely buy again!
 This bag is the perfect size and is designed for excellent storage and transport of my laptop, iPad, cell phone, office supplies, documents, pens, etc.
 Just the thing for carrying portable computers and paperwork
 Light weight, fits my Acer Chromebook perfectly, rugged, and low price too
 This bag is perfect for my wife's laptop. Holds everything she needs and it all fits perfectly. Very well constructed and I see this lasting a long time.
 Amazon did it again.  Another quality piece for a reasonable price. It is sturdy and has lots organization pockets. I would definitely recommend it.
 Great value for the money.
 Good for the price.
 Love it! Seems sturdy, has tons of pockets. My 11 3/4" by 8" BT keyboard, 10" tablet, power bank, cables, etc, etc fit perfectly with room to spare.
 Nice bag, works fine.
 Laptop fits perfectly
 This is a great Notebook case has room for everything! You can carry a tablet along with the notebo9ok too!
 Wow for the price you can't beat this laptop bag.  I am able to fit my laptop, iPad, mouse, cables, and plenty of other accessories inside this bag.  The build quality is great.
 Fine laptop bag!
 It is a simple bag, light but appears durable. The compartments other than the main one are.less useful.
 This case is protective, easy the carry, and has lots of pockets for charger, mouse, etc. I love it
 Good quality laptop bag for lesser price.
 Inexpensive.  Simple.  Lightweight.  Perfect for the SINGLE task of carrying my laptop and a few accessories (power cord, mouse, mouse pad, a few misc. cables, even has room for a micro-projector though it's quite awkward).  Not much room for papers, files, books or anything else.  Exactly as advertised, no more, but certainly no less.
 It is good for it's quality and price
 Laptop fits but it is of a low quality standard.
 great case<br/>Ken
 one half inch more room to adapt my I pad Pro.  Having problem to close.
 for the price of this I'm very pleased and it has all the room of the higher priced netbook bags I use it mostly when traveling it fits right under the seat on the airlines and it keeps it upright so I don't have to do alot of bending over when I want it.
 Gotta say that this is the very first item that i have purchased from Amazon that has disappointed me. This bag turned out to be pure junk. Both zippers broke form day one.
 Very nice case.  There are higher quality ones out there, but for the money, I'm very pleased with this bag.  It meets my needs quite well.
 Great bag!!! Well made. Can't beat it for the money. Found other bags locally, with one less pocket, that were more than double the price. Excellent deal.
 Is a very useful product with wonderful quality
 For the price this bag is what you'd expect.  Not a high-end bag, but functions well if you only need it occasionly.
 Just what I wanted for my son to use as a book bag, sort of.  Pleased with my purchase.
 My 15.6 2016 Dell laptop fits perfectly. Attractive. Many pockets. Strong woven strap. Waterproof
 If you want a bag that works with pretty much any tablet and netbook this is a good choice. I'm taking off a point because of its smell. If you're chemical sensitive you should probably look elsewhere. Other than that, good deal.
 Exactly what I wanted! Just big enough for the tablet, over the ear headphones and cables.
 I'm starting to have a lot of faith in the Amazon Basics brand.  I have a few cables from them, and now this bag.  They're all really cheap and have the same quality you'd get from brand names.
 Excellent quality, as advertised. GREAT VALUE!
 The default setting on the wireless has a power save option. You need to update the driver on the wireless card and then go into the power modes. Once in the power mode, you need to change the wireless connection option to performance, not power saver.  Hope this helps out people!  Great laptop!
 Meets our business needs
 Perfect
 Bag worked out great for my 14in portable CD player
 You get what you paid for. If you want to get better design, and more padding for your laptop you should be looking higher prices I guess.
 Could have been more durable
 I was expecting something decent from its reviews, but I was impressed to see it IRL. It's really very attractive and well made and designed. For the low price, I'll buy more of these.
 durable and protective case, nice addition to my new laptop
 Well designed, does the job it's supposed to. I wish it had just a touch more space for accessories.
 Nice looking bag. Room for cords, mouse, a few files (not a big area).  I would have preferred a softer padding for my laptop/tablet, but good product for the price.  The only thing I was really disappointed with was the padding on the shoulder strap.  It is too stiff &amp; uncomfortable - does not give/bend, so it sticks out .  I simply slid it off and am not using it.
 Great little case. Good quality.
 A total bargain. Good quality and functionality.
 Well made, high quality and well put together. This is perfect for tablet, notebook and charger cords Etc.,.I have purchased 6 more as gifts.
 Nice bag, several pockets, well made, and comfortable to wear. Perfect for a light commuter bag for work.
 awesome
 Delivered on time and as promised
 Perfect for my Lenovo Idea Pad. Sturdy and the price was good.
 Very pleased...just what I wanted!
 Working fine, very happy.  Fits husband's 17" Acer laptop, great price.
 Nice bag for a small laptop, great price.
 Perfect laptop bag with plenty of space to store other items such as your battery, cords etc. Price was good too.
 Great bag. It could be slightly bigger, but the best I've found for my needs. My MacBook Air, a 1" binder and some misc. other stuff.
 Perfect I really like this bag, better than the more expensive ones I have bought!
 I love this bag because of its unobtrusive simplicity. It is lightweight, holds my iPad safely, has an outside pocket for the cord, and opens/closes easily. Great quality for the price.
 Very nice. Lightweight with an extra storage compartment.
 It's really nice and well worth the money.
 Nice bag i like that it is grey and not orange inside it goes well with my black hp could use more padding but for the money is a really nice bag good job amazon
 I love this bag. I have the new Apple iPad 4 w/ retina display and I have it in a case and it stills fits great with room to spare. So, this will fit a full-size ipad 4 even with a case on the iPad. The pocket has plenty of room for the cable and other accessories. I would recommend this to anyone!
 Very nice bag. Thank You
 I purchased this case for my son's 11.5" laptop.  It arrived faster than we expected and I was surprised by the good quality because the price was under $13.  It has compartments for his power supply and a mouse.
 Very nice quality. Looks just like the pix.
 I tried many many bags and this is BY FAR the best. It is very well thought out, extremely light, can be hung on a luggage, amazing quality. NO BRAINER
 This netbook bag is really cute. The only downside is that I feel that the handles are very small. I wish it had long straps so I could carry it over my shoulder. Overall it is a pretty decent netbook bag. I would recommend it.
 Fantastic deal. Very well made.  Great functionality. Will look first to see if Amazon Basics has what I need in the future.
 This case, especially for the price, is excellent! Well padded, and very well made. Holds our iPads and other tablets securely and gives us a nice pouch for the chargers and other cables we frequently need.
 Meets my needs and the purpose for which it was purchased.  I will use it to protect my new laptop when not in use,  but I , probably not take it out in public.
 Light, good-looking computer bag.
 This was a great buy. No concerns.
 I love it, it is my everything can fit laptop bag!!
