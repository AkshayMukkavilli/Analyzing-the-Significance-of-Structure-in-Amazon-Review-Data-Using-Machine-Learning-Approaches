 This is the second Kid's  Kindle Fire I've had where the charging port stopped holding a charging cable (and therefore the tablet couldn't be charged). The first one that died, they declined to honor the replacement warranty because a new version was out and the old, discounted tablet was out of stock. I had to buy a new tablet.  Then I adopted another child and bought another new tablet. The charging port on this one (number 3 in our household) lasted four or five weeks.  After emailing for a warranty replacement request, I was told I had to initiate a Live Chat for troubleshooting instead. I'm currently chatting with Amazon Customer Service, and I've been transferred three times so far in this chat that has already lasted 40 minutes, and I've been told that the replacement offer is only good for 30 days, and the remaining two years warranty is "send it in and we'll repair it", not at all the "if they break it, we'll replace it,  no questions asked" like it says right on the product image.  Very, very disappointed in this experience.<br/>All of this is second only to problems with the tablets themselves.  They are constantly running out of memory, kids have to delete app after app after app and have to reboot them at least once or twice a day, and they frequently freeze up.  Apps stall out while they're being downloaded (with a very strong wifi signal in our house) and are generally hard to work with.  If I didn't have a couple hundred dollars already sunk into these devices, I'd ditch them.  Pretty unhappy.<br/>*****They have agreed to mail me a new one after I mail the broken one back. They can't explain why their process to get a "no questions asked" warranty replacement takes 5 people, two emails, and a 45 minute Live Chat.
 warranty is a bunch of BS. I have bought 2 of these and the first one the charging port was wearing out. Ok no big deal they "repaired it" got it back and had to fight with the plug and set it just perfect to charge. That lasted a month or so then stopped charging again. I had a new charger but they insisted i needed yet another new one. This time with a big run around with customer service got someone who replaced it. Now the 2nd one just stopped charging suddenly. No wiggling or anything worked. Once again telling me i need a new charger and i must suddenly have the wrong charger??? How do i have the wrong charger when it is the same charger that came with this tablet? After explaining several times it is the factory charger that shipped with the tablet and explaining i have several of these factory chargers that all work on our other tablet just fine they still tell me its the wrong charger. You almost have to get upset first then they transfer me to a 3rd rep!! Very frustrating to get these things taken care of! This one the charging port is not really worn it just plain stopped charging. Fingers crossed this one actually comes back repaired!
 I have enjoyed shopping on Amazon and have been a prime member for a few years without difficulty. When needing a second tablet for our second son, I decided to give the Fire a chance. I purchased this at the end of  November 2017 as an early christmas gift. It has worked without issue until yesterday when it suddenly was unable to hold a charge or charge at all. I recalled that it is advertised as having a "2 year worry free guarantee. Well replace it for free. No questions asked". Well when I called customer service yesterday to report the problem and see about getting a new one since this one has malfunctioned, I spent well over 30 minutes going back and forth between service people answering question after question and told we need to troubleshoot and try various things first, only to be told that 1) my return window had expired two days prior and 2) they would need to try and repair this one before they issue a new one, which will take at least 5 business days, and then they will send it back. Well actually, they WILL send me another one right now if I want BUT it WILL only be a refurbished device and not a new one. Even if they take mine to repair it and cant, i will "most likely still get a refurbished one". It was very much a hassle honestly and not what I expected at all. Perhaps I just didn't read the fine print but I suppose I expected Amazon to stick to what they advertise as hassle and worry free.
 Up front, I must say my grandson absolutely LOVED this tablet.  He seldom parted with it... to the point of worrying an old grandparent that this can't possibly be healthy...<br/><br/>However, the device quit working after ~7 months.  Being a gift from my parents (elderly, in assisted living), I didn't have all the online purchase information.  The "Worry free, No Questions Asked" warranty/guarantee quickly disappeared.  The Amazon Customer Service agents will absolutely not deviate from their scripts and I have been shuffled from one to another(some identified as supervisors), and all operating off the same scripts.  Even the email was "canned", all with the same wording promising "to not want to panic you with questions" and to "please give us one more chance to resolve" and so on.  No progress made after two weeks of phone, chat, and email correspondence.<br/><br/>Filed with BBB, complaint #12348591.  I'm tired of pursuing this, and after the BBB filing this review means I'm done with it.<br/><br/>Summary - I'd say this to be an excellent product.  This tablet survived a three year old very well for months and was his favorite "toy" by far.  However do not put faith in "Worry Free" and "No Questions Asked" guarantee and warranty claims if you don't have you i's dotted and t's crossed for them.  Bear in mind you are effectively handing over this amount of money to a little kid.  But it was not damaged, it was not sank in a bathtub, it was not abused.  It simply stopped working one day and I'm just left with a blank screen.
 BUYER BEWARE..TRUE FACTS ARE HIDDEN IN THE 'READ MORE" .....When you see this kindle for kids it states that if problems arise, return it with no questions asked.  I was on the computer for almost 20 minutes answering questions before I could get a receipt to return it.  THEN.  What do I get in return for my childs kindle that had only been used less than 2 months...a REFURBISHED one.  I again called and was told I need to read the section that says "read more" if you need to return your kindle.  Did I click on that, NO.  The accolades for this kindle ran on for at least 3 pages, so of course I did not click on the read more on any of the paragraphs.  I was so impressed that my child could have a kindle to play educational games and watch movies that I just clicked the buy button.  Don't let them kid you, it will be refurbished.  I asked why I should receive a refurbished (someone elses problem) when I had a kindle used less than 2 months???  I could have bought a refurbished one a heck of a lot cheaper that what I paid for a new one that lasted less than 2 months.  Since this is the case, why does Amazon not state it in all the wording to encourage you to buy this product for your child.  They lead you to believe that this item is destruction proof.  My chid uses the device to play games, how destruction proof is that.
 6 months with the tablet, and we are VERY disappointed...<br/><br/>The concept behind this is good... but it simply fails to give enough control to the PARENTS! And in my opinion, that’s the most important aspect.<br/><br/>Let me explain that to anyone that hasn’t owned a FreeTime tablet before. Basically this device gives your child unlimited downloading power!! And they designed the user interface to be so dumbed down, that it doesn’t even show a difference between already owned apps, and unowned apps. It only shows a thumbnail image to represent the entire app. No name, no type description, no label of whether you own it or not....literally just a picture! So if your child is young, they see a cool picture, and click on it, assuming they can play it! Right? Except 99% of the time, it’s not an app you already own, so it begins downloading that new app. The child can’t play it because it’s currently downloading. Child doesn’t understand. Gets mad. Now the entire reason you got the tablet is moot! Because the child is constantly upset and in confusion when trying to play on the tablet!<br/><br/>Now let’s just assume that aspect doesn’t bother you much.... will it bother you when you let your child play on the tablet for 20 mins, while you cook, or shower, or clean. And when you check on them, you find that there is literally 100+ new apps currently downloading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No exaggeration people! I have spent countless hours, and nights, going into my sons profile and deleting new apps. And there is zero way to combat this issue as a parent. No way to disable it! Not even turning off all internet connection will stop it! It’s crazy. And absolutely reckless to give children unbridled and unlimited access to an App Store! I wanted my child to have a few games and apps to play when I NEED just a little time. But I did NOT want to forfiet all parenting rights for his content. And neither should you!<br/><br/>And a cherry on top here....there’s not even an easy or simple way to monitor the newly downloaded content, and delete the unwanted!!!!! Seriously shocking! Amazon requires that you search the entire App Store for apps you want to remove or block. Which is insanely inconvenient. But the big hang up with that, is that FreeTime mode doesn’t say the name of the apps!!!!!!! So there’s literally nothing you can do! Even if you are willing to put in the massive amount of time it would take to write down the name of 100+ apps every night. Switch profiles to your adult account. Go into settings. Then search for the exact title of each app. Then remove or block it.<br/><br/>But let’s just say you’re a Super Mom, with freak abilities, and you can do this just fine every night. After you get done deleting tons and tons of apps, then switch back over to the child’s FreeTime profile to check out the results. You’ll be very rudely surprised to find ALL the apps are back!!!! But this time in a new tab, THAT NEVER GOES AWAY, called “recent”. That’s right folks! The recent tab is here forever!! To haunt you! And be right up front and center on your child’s profile. Showcasing all the apps you worked so hard to delete! Begging your child to click on them again, launching them to redownload AGAIN!!! And then your hellish night from the day before, of deleting 100+ apps, gets to repeat again tonight! Sounds fun right???? If you answered yes, then by golly miss molly this is the right tablet for you!! But if you answered no, and you wanted a tablet to assist you in parenting, not take away all control you have to discern for your child, and what they shouldn’t have access to....then this is not a good product for you. And you should tell amazon what you think of their “limitless” tablet for kids, as young as 2 years old.<br/><br/>Dear Amazon; please please please, I beg of you!!! Create a FreeTime mode with ZERO access to downloading new apps. So for the discerning parents like myself, we can chose what to download for our child. Then hand it to them confidently, knowing they are safe, and secure, and we can breath a sigh of relief for perhaps just 5 minutes that day. Where nothing went wrong, and we could just rest, while our children play. It’s so simple. Please do that for us moms, because no one is. Thank you.
 Here's the thing, you're wasting your money when they charge you monthly for the "freetime" after the initial "subscription" is up. This is how they hook you and it ends up being a total ripoff! When you cancel it they remove all the content you downloaded and your child is no longer able to access prime free videos or books or any of the content you downloaded from the subscription. It's like a magazine or newspaper taking all your content back when you cancel. With all the money spent on the additional member fee (that's what I'm calling it, because it's really what it is) at 36 bucks a year, you could have taken all that money and bought a protection plan for any cheap tablet with games, books and video content. Don't buy into the unlimited content, it's only while you continue to pay for it. In the long run ithe ends up being a paperweight for a really disappointed child. I forgot to mention all the other problems people have are completely correct, the charging ports is weak and always gets damaged, the storage is sad and nearly impossible to remove content you child doesn't use. Spend money on an item that has better all around reviews.
 Update: we returned our tablet. After speaking with a customer service rep about how slow the tablet is, she told us it’s designed to be that slow and she herself was more happy with the tablet she bought from walmart. Maybe it’s befause it’s a base model, but I figure it shouldn’t run THAT slowly.<br/><br/>We’re really unhappy with this tablet. It’s very slow and confusing to use. We figured a little tablet for our daughter would be super fun for her but we can’t operate it! Restrictions  for the children’s profile isn’t nearly what it needs to be. Interface and design is clunky and unintuitive. We regret buying this and wish we had bought an iPad.
 Great toy\real tablet. It is basically a real Fire 7 tablet, with kid's built-in  entertainment center. There are 2 modes here: Parent (admin) and Kids (one or multiple accounts). When in Parent mode (password protected), the Fire 7 looks and feels just like an Android tablet with all of the Fire 7 functionality (Facebook, Netflix, Books, blah, blah), so all of us Android users feel right at home. In the Parent mode you can also manage kids accounts: how much they can use the tablet per day, what they can and cannot watch/play, manage their installed apps, ect. When in kid's mode, the tablet behaves just like it is on the pictures, easy-to-use, colorful interface. You need to click switch user to switch from Parent to Kids accounts.<br/><br/>Some confusion here I got from reading other reviews- the kids apps are not pre-installed; the main interface is an app store, just like Google Play, ect. The apps here are unique to this Kids Account, and are all free with the included subscription; which includes don't know how many games, Amazon Videos, reading and audio books. You still have to download each app before using it, so make sure to stock up on apps before going on a road trip.
 If you want to bash your brians in every few weeks, this is the tablet for you. We own 4 of these Fire Kids with Freetime. My biggest issue is managing storage.<br/><br/>See, all the Freetime apps are not preinstalled. They're in the Freetime cloud. Your kids will have the luxury of clicking on the apps to open them, but they are actually installing them on the device. Within a couple weeks your 12 GB (because 4 GB are taken by Amazon) are gone. Then the fun starts.<br/><br/>You'll get repeated notifications saying storage is low. The tablet slows down and some apps won't even run.<br/><br/>The truly exciting part begins. You have a notification that says tap here to manage storage. So you tap. Then you pick you child's profile. Then you see they've maxed out the application storage, the you click on application to see which apps are taking up the most space.<br/><br/>Now the brain bashing begins... because you select the app to uninstall and the uninstall tab is block by AMAZON. Guess they dont want me to uninstall stuff. All the apps that my child has installed are blacked out.<br/><br/>So you head over to the Freetime app. Open the profile and look through hundreds and hundreds of apps for the app that has a CHECK MARK on it. This means it's installed. Then you long press on the app, and press "remove from device" and watch in amazement as NOTHONG HAPPENS. Nothing.<br/><br/>Now you're wondering if you should smash the crap out this thing or WIPE THE ENTIRE TABLET.<br/><br/>Whether you smash it or wipe it, you'll be setting up a new one in now time at all. And then a few weeks later, you get to do it all over again.<br/><br/>So don't do it....save your self some agony and buy a regular Android tablet.
 I purchased two (2) each of these tablets.  One for my grandson and the other for my granddaughter.  Within the year of purchase, both tablets developed 3 major problems:  1) would not hold a charge for any length of time; 2) every time the tablets were powered down or left overnight, ALL of the games required to be downloaded, over and over and over again; 3) Consistently one or more of the games on both or either of the tablets, would disappear altogether.  Replacement "No questions asked" is  JOKE!  I spent hours of my time either on the chat or telephone jumping through hoops with a none technical "sales rep" who could not trouble shoot a simple thing let alone a piece of technical hardware/software.  Finally, I was able to find a customer service rep who was able to replace both of these kids Kindles.  Think I was done?  Absolutely NOT.  One of these two Kindles still would not function properly as the hardware or software failed to read the SD card so games would not download.  Only to find out that both of these Kids Kindles were refurbished - not new.  I spend my time trouble shooting all know possibilities only to spend another 1.5 hours on the telephone with four, count them, (4) sale reps who would not replace this second, defective tablet.  Approximately three (3) weeks before there was any possibility of replacement.  Ever tried to explain to two (2) kids why one has use of their Kids Kindle and the other does not?  No questions asked is a joke.  Jeff Bezos, CEO will be receiving a letter.
 This Kindle works great when you have it.  However the 2 year worry free guarantee is a joke.  I recently had to send my daughters in to be replaced because the screen was cracked.  I was promised it be back in 5 days its now going on 2 weeks!! I have also had to contact Amazon 2 additional times to see where my device is.  I hoping they can get it right this time.  Very disappointing.
 I purchased 2 Of these tablets as a bundle for 149$ during the Black Friday deals week. I looked and looked for important information before buying them but it was all over the place with the answers I found, even on here, the answers were... yes they worked without internet, another comment would say no the don’t, some say great battery life others would say wouldn’t stayed charged... so I hope these answers of mine after having mine a couple days will help.<br/><br/>First thing that I wanted to know<br/>Does this work without internet? No... only the books You download or games you download work without internet none of the videos work at all without wifi not even during the 1 free year of free time and you need to download the books and app way a head of time before you leave your wifi. Which leads me to my second issue....<br/><br/>Downloading! It takes forever! Actually took me over an hour to download 1 app! I’m so glad I opened these up before giving them to my kids because they would have be externally disappointed to wait so long to play games.. so as of now day 2 I’m downloading games and books I know they like so when they open these they can have some to play with, I highly recommend doing this if you want a happy child because they take a good while to download. Also you can not preview any app before downloading it so if you wait 30mins-1hr and then it’s not what your child’s wanted or you want them to play you have to delete it and download something else. Super aggravating!<br/><br/>Another thing I was searching for and never found a direct answer was, can you down load YouTube and Netflix onto this device ? Yes you can and add it to your child’s profile...<br/>You have to go to the adult profile down load YouTube or Netflix from the App Store and then go to the amazon freetime app and select child’s settings icon to the right of there name, then under manage child’s content you can add apps and books that you downloaded on your profile and share it with them. This is a huge thing because I can download Netflix and downloaded the shows on there for car rides and they don’t need wifi to watch downloaded shows on Netflix.<br/><br/>I hope this helps clear things up as far as if the child can watch things it was a huge 48 hr headache for me and not exactly what I expected they make it sound like shows, apps and books are all easy access and work always but that’s just not how it works you have to jump through the hoops to get it to work right. And take hours of downloading to get any game or book, Which is my only disappointment. I’m Not going to return but these are super expensive to be so slow and not work without wifi, not to mention that we will pay almost the same subscription fee after the 1 year is up as we do for Netflix being that I have 3 kids... just some major set backs but we can manage now that I’ve learned a few tips and tricks off YouTube.<br/><br/>Also downloading things deffinitly hits the battery hard but it hold up decently that’s not a huge issue.<br/>Screen quality Is great and the sound is very clear and the cases are nice and sturdy. I know my kids will love them once we get things downloaded and rolling but man it’s not exactly what I was hoping for.
 I am seeing on the reviews that kids have 100 % freedom to download apps. That is not true, you can control what apps your kids can download and controls which profile can use which app. I think this reviews come from parents that don't take time to read the instructuons.
 Parents!  Are you tired of your phone or tablet being commandeered by drooling sticky handed bandits?  Are you done with your apps and photos disappearing after a 40 minute Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Appisode binge?  Are you fed up with cracked and damaged phones by no fault of your own?  Well, let me tell you about the Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet!  At 1/7th the cost of an iPad and Lifeproof case, you can prevent your phone from becoming a $700 sticky cracked brick.  The Fire 7 is your affordable answer.  At just under $100, for the 16GB model, you can entertain your child for up to 8 hours.  However, our professional toddler testing center has seen times closer to 6 hours in real world testing.  Additionally, the charging time is a little slow; taking a few hours to charge fully.  However, no child needs to spend 6 straight hours looking at a screen.  The weight is lite, and with the case, it can withstand most drops from toddler height.  We have only had it for a week, but our team of toddler researchers will continue to test to bring you the best insight to this device.
 Bought as a Christmas gift for my grandkids. I was eager to get them set up, before I wrapped them. To my surprise I had to register for a membership in order to set up,that was disappointing. There should be an option. Once I was forced to subscribe, I could not get to internet. But I found that it took forever for the apps I chose to load. I tried a regular tablet and loaded the same app, and it was playing while the fire 7 was still loading, and it never loaded.Needless to say, I repacked and returned the two fire 7s I purchased. If it was too slow for me, I know it was to slow for a 4 and 5 year old.I called it my very worst electronic purchase for christmas. No more for me!
 Advertising on this product is misleading. VERY disappointed that I cannot download videos from FreeTime.<br/><br/>Per the product description on the Amazon website: "Available on-the-go<br/>Download your child’s favorite videos, apps, and books for access even when you don’t have Wi-Fi. When an Internet connection is unavailable, your child will automatically see available content that has been downloaded to their FreeTime profile."<br/>There is even a support article by Amazon with travel tips for this device, which recommends: "Download videos to watch while traveling – From your child profile you can download up to 25 FreeTime Unlimited videos for playback offline, plus unlimited downloads of Amazon Kids Originals. When you're in FreeTime, long press the video you want to download, and then tap download." (https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201829220)<br/><br/>HOWEVER, after a 30 minute call to customer support, in which the person I was speaking with had no idea how to operate the Kindle, I was informed by the supervisor that due to an "Upgrade" to FreeTime, I can no longer download the videos for my kids to watch offline. This is FALSE ADVERTISING!!! The main reason why I purchased this device is for travel - airplane and car rides - and my kids like to watch videos and shows - and now I'm being told that the feature is no longer available. That is ridiculous. While I can add videos that I've purchased or download them from Netflix, they will now have to toggle between profiles in order to either watch videos on my profile, or play games through FreeTime on their profile which defeats the purpose of parental controls and ease of use.<br/><br/>I was attracted to this product due to the advertised features, 2 year replacement, and the price. I really would rather not have to spend $300 on an iPad Mini, but given the quality of this product and my experience with "technical support," it might be worth it!
 We have always used Samsung tablets and so this took a little while adjusting how to navigate.<br/>So, far we have been using this for about a week and it does take some time to set-up.  You will need to go through and make sure all the settings are correct for your kid, and this will take some time (I think the effort is worth it)<br/><br/>This review is specifically for the Kids Edition tablet:<br/>The tablet:<br/>The tablet itself, is a good size for my (almost) 3 yr old.  It is not heavy and seems to be the right size for him to handle.  The protective case has definitely done its job because we have already had a couple of incidents. (update: this has been thrown against a wall and landed on tile, and no cracks or breaks)  The viewing quality is decent.  Otherwise, it is what you would expect from a tablet.  I have not had another Fire before, so I can only compare this to a Samsung Galaxy, and so far, it is what I would expect from a tablet of this class.<br/><br/>The features (the real reason for the purchase):<br/>is it worth it? YES. DEFINITELY<br/>Previously, we had been sharing our tablet and our phones with our little one, but more and more he would get into content he should not be getting into - everything from buying stuff and watching content not appropriate for his age - ie our downloads of Deadpool and Logan because these look like 'superheroes' but they are not the appropriate ones for kids - (side note: I loved how they portrayed Deadpool and Logan - we are big comic fans and they finally got their characters right!).<br/>I have even deleted YouTube from our tablets and hidden the app in our phones in files so that he can't get at them...<br/>But this tablet has been a game changer. It has GREAT parental controls.  I love being able to hand him the tablet and not worry about what he is going to come across.  (if you have a little one, you will still need to go through and filter content because there are older kid content that may be too much for the younger ones).  Personally, I spent about 2 hours going through the content.  I wish they had a better way to filter through the content - like have subject sections - ie math science history...  Most of the content is great and educational, but some, like learning about adverbs and adjectives is just not where we are at currently.  Filtering the content, I was able to let my little one get to the videos games and books that he would be most interested in faster without having to scroll through too much stuff.  There is also a feature that allows you to limit how much content, which content, and for how long they can do stuff. You can have unlimited reading time, and limit the videos and apps(games) to only an hour or so.  I have set the tablet to lock down 30 mins before bedtime to until mid afternoon (after nap time) which allows for real play time in the morning and then he has the tablet to occupy late afternoon as I am getting dinner ready and cleaning up around the house.<br/><br/>CONS: download speed. much content needs to be downloaded and that takes time.  The books apps and videos are not already pre-loaded and if they want to watch read or do something new, it will need to be downloaded.  We have a hotspot on our phones for road trips and I do take a lot of plane trips with the little one, so I would suggest pre-downloading favorites for the trip.<br/><br/>update: Does not work with Chromecast - I think this this goes for all Fire tablets.  Even though they are an android, it looks like you would need a Fire stick.  This is not a deal breaker for us, but it is nice to be able to mirror the content to the tv.<br/><br/>CONCERN: I would say at this moment, my main concern is I love the "FreeTime" feature, but how much is this going to cost me when my free year is up?<br/><br/>I have already been recommending this product to my friends with young kids.<br/>There are some cool content for older kids, but depending on your child's interest, a regular tablet would most likely be more appropriate.<br/><br/>I paid for my product and there has not been any incentive for me to do this review. I don't work with Amazon nor am I affiliated with them.
 This did not work for my family at all. Every app I tried to install either failed and gave an error message or would immediately close after opening. The device frequently shut itself off for no apparent reason. Honestly shocked at how frustrating this has been. There seems to be no way at all to load applications or videos to the child account, even on the parent account everything was a chore.<br/><br/>I have to assume I have a defective unit but I'm going to look elsewhere for a replacement because I can't put myself through this again.
 So, this tablet is like a standard Fire tablet with a built-in kids center. Parents are able to log-in to the standard Fire side and use it like a normal Fire Tablet. It is password protected and you are able to mange the kid(s) profiles from there. There can be multiple profiles on each tablet. I was under the assumption that all of the apps were already installed on to the tablet, they are not. I've had to go in and delete a lot from both of my kids' tablets because they ran out of memory. By the way, it happens very QUICKLY and I've had to do this multiple times since they got them for Christmas.<br/><br/>Is it a cheap option? Yes. Is it easy for the kids to use? Yes, but I've noticed the longer they've had the Fire, the more they are asking to go back and use my husband's or my iPad. Don't get me wrong, kids do seem to genuinely enjoy them. There are a lot of apps that they like and they discover new ones every day and I love the case they have on them because my son is a wild man and it's been great for when he gets rough with it.<br/><br/>My overall view on it: Yea, it's great for the kids, but for me it's more of a pain. When it dies or needs charged, you have to login to the main screen to switch to the kids' profile. It's just inconvenient more than anything.( Also, the battery is PITIFUL. It doesn't last long. I'm pretty sure we spend more time charging it than actually using it.) I hate that I have to have it registered under my account. It needs to be registered so that you can keep the warranty on it. I've thought about making a separate account because I hate that all of my stuff, books etc. show up on their tablet and it only shows up when you log in to your profile. Now, it does not download the books, but it will show up so that they can be downloaded on to the tablet if you want. I don't want my stuff appearing on the tablet. I've looked in to it and have yet to figure out how to make sure anything I put on my personal Fire doesn't show up on my kids'. Overall it's great for the money, but it's not my favorite. If I had the money to buy them iPads, I would, but I can't afford to do so, so this is a great option.
 Don't even believe the " 2-year worry-free guarantee: if they break it, return it and we'll replace it for free. No questions asked. " They had lots of questions. First they give 3 choices for contacting them , Email Chat or Phone. Don't waste your time on the Email, they replied:<br/> "I would be happy to assist you, however, over the email, I'm not authorized to decide about the replacement. Also, I'm unable to fill up some necessary information like shipping or the billing address, confirming the Credit Card details, and also how to return the original kindle. " (can't decide if it can be returned ? WTH ,what about the 2 year NO QUESTIONS ASKED ! ! ! ? ? ?)<br/>OK , so I called. after over 30 minuets and talking to 3 people I still can't return the purchase I made because I don't have the email and account information the device is registered at... No I don't it was a gift to a 3 year old grandkid, his mother set that up, but I spent the $ yet my Prime account and information won't get  the NO Questions asked return. As it's late I have to contact them tomorrow and  relay the information...<br/>TAKE  a  BIG GUESS where I won't be buying 4 grandkids presents from this coming Christmas...
 Updating my review bc of the incredibly fast resolution from customer support. The charging ports went out on them both within a few weeks of each other, in less than a year of owning them. While they are supposed to be built for child endurance and I checked my kids did not abuse the ports from liquid or physical damage (which I know from my own cell experience ports do not have much longevity), I thought these would last much longer. But customer support was great and within hours of my request they processed replacements to be shipped. Wow.<br/><br/>For the tablets themselves, I like them for my kids on road trips, and have recently used them w my kids as a reward system for going above and beyond their normal chores and behaviors. They can earn tablet time for 'extras' in which they go out of their way unexpectedly (mind you, not what should be expected normally). When I notice a surprise behavior I'll add an additional 5 min via another marble in the jar and you'd think they won the lottery. It's a great motivator when needed.
 The device is fine. my biggest complaint is that there is 100% freedom for the kids to download so many apps. Each time a kid touches an app it automatically downloads. I REPEAT, APPS AUTOMATICALLY DOWNLOAD WITH ANY TOUCH OF THEM. There is no extra filter like on most devices. Not even a page to tell you what the app is about. just a picture. they click it, it starts downloading. I HATE HATE HATE THAT! There also is no way to see what apps are already downloaded on the kid's side. The regular Kindle with adult supervision is way better to manage and use than the kid's edition. in less than 2h of use, my kid had over 100 apps downloaded. There needs to be some type info page for each app.
 This thing sucks!  It constantly has problems...several different kinds of problems that it likes to cycle through.  My kids are always crying because it's not working.  We've had to reset it to factory settings several times because we couldn't fix the problems but that only lasts a short time before the problems occur again.  Today, I kept getting a pop up that said an error occurred but it wouldn't let me close the pop up so that I could try to fix whatever the problem was.  Plus, the apps that my kids downloaded to play keep disappearing and they can't play them.  I bought 3 of these for Christmas so all 3 of my younger kids had one but they are all just a waste of money.  We fight with them more than they get to play on them.  Another piece of trash that we spent a lot of money on.  Don't waste your time or money on this!
 I really want to love this.  In theory, it should give us the distraction we need for travel or the rough days when you just need to give into some screen time.  I see so many good reviews, which makes me wonder if we just got a defective product.  From the start, my son's Kindle Fire charged and operated so slowly that I couldn't believe it was a new electronic.  It is very clunky to use--not at all intuitive or user-friendly.  Connecting to wifi is always problematic, so I download things onto the device before leaving home.  However, the device is now full, and our Kindle is not responsive when I try to remove downloaded items, so now we're stuck with the things that we previously downloaded.<br/><br/>The device does not hold a charge.  Even if it's not being used, it is using the battery and dies.  Then it takes a full day to charge--no exaggeration.<br/><br/>As far as content, I would like to see more, actually.  It feels like a closed universe, which is great for kids, in theory.  But my kiddo isn't interested in the games, so we really just use it for shows.  I would love it if we could access full movies for long air travel.  I'd also like to see more variety.<br/><br/>Overall, I would not recommend this product, and I haven't.  I think you can find something that is easier to use and that will last you longer for your money.  You might have to spend more, yes, but it will be a better buy.
 I was excited to receive this device for our two year old before our flight. It arrived today and after 6 hours and three Amazon customer service calls, the issue still remains.<br/>I am trying to download the videos that are available in the Freetime app. I have tried several different videos.  Amazon made it possible to download videos for offline use. I am not receiving error messages. When I hold my finger on the video I want to download, it only gives me the option to "Open" or "Add to Carousel". My friends tablet profiles for her child will the options "Open", "Download", or "Add to Carousel.<br/><br/>This has been extremely frustrating. All Amazon wants to do was send a replacement but it doesn’t help us for this flight in 8 hours.<br/><br/>I am so livid. I will be returning and not replacing.
 My three-year old loves it.  We got him one just before a trip and it was perfect to keep him occupied.  The Freetime is great as all the apps are age appropriate and no need to worry an app is not appropriate (the most frustrating thing with other tablets in downloading an app that is too advanced and my kid getting frustrated).  The case is thick yet lite, perfect weight and size for his little hands (and nice to know it has a replacement warranty).
 Very disappointed because you have to enter credit card information during the set up. This was a gift. The recipient family doesn't have a credit card.<br/>Update-the device stopped charging after 2 months. Working with customer service to get a replacement is a joke. They need the email address associated with setting up the device. Really? It was a GIFT I DON'T KNOW that information. I guess worry free and hassle free guarantee is NOT the same. Spoke with 3 customer service people to get shipping label. I hope my grandson doesn't like this thing too much because I am never buying another one.
 It was nice while it lasted, but it stopped taking a charge after about 6 months and the seller made me jump through hoops to replace it. They were insistent that I wasn't using the right charger etc.,etc. Per their instructions,I sent it in the protective case and they sent back a new one without it. It took over a month to get the case replaced and in the meantime my child dropped it and broke the screen. He's been using it, but now it has stopped taking a charge again and now its out of warranty.
 Firstly, we love this tablet for our 8 year old. He's had one off and on again for a few years now, and we know this thing inside and out by now.<br/>Occasionally you have to delete the cache to get more space, but a decently sized micro-sd card works wonders for this.<br/>A magnetic charging cable is also ideal because he's rough on the port, because let's face it, he's a kid. He doesn't have the fine-motor skills for a delicate hand about it, so it happens.<br/>The only issue I really have is the homepage carousel where he can literally load the friggin thing up with the most space-wasters available, and at any whim he pleases. Man, I hate that. I don't know how to change it, but I vow it will be doomed if I can manage it.<br/>Kid's non-verbal on top of it. While he has an Ipad at school, we prefer the Kindle Fire. It's more user-friendly and we've found he's more willing to communicate via the Fire than he is the Ipad. A little less expensive, as well. Certainly the accessories and the apps are far more expensive on an Ipad.<br/>What I'm seeing here in the reviews is a lot of people having beef with the 2 year warranty.<br/>People. They are NOT going to send you a free tablet just because you tell them yours is broken. They pay for the shipping, you print out the label, slap the device in a box, tape the label on, and as soon as they get it (it's pretty dang fast, don't fret) they send you a replacement.<br/>For two years, they'll do this.<br/>They're not going to let you keep the broken tablet. That is not part of the warranty. Honestly, how often do you think people would take advantage of this?<br/>Pretty often.<br/>Kid's drowned one in a tub, cracked a screen of I don't know how many, threw one off a moving bus on his way home from school (HOW?!), and they've replaced them every single time, with no stress.<br/>I love this tablet, hate the home-screen, but love this tablet. My kid's talking now, actually talking, and I firmly believe his tablet use, especially in therapy, has been a HUGE break-through in that.<br/>So, yeah, all-in-all, I would recommend the heck out of this device. If your child is on the ASD spectrum, it could very easily become an essential tool in their daily life.<br/>We've tried many devices, including the dreadful Nabi, and honestly, I think the Fire is absolutely perfect for what our kiddo needs.
 I ordered two of these for my boys ages 2 and 4. We don't do a lot of  screen time but I bought these to replace our DVD player in the car that recently bit the dust. DVD players seem to cost about as much as these did, so we decided to get these so they could do more than watch movies.<br/><br/>I love the Freetime!! Love it. My oldest little boy has recently gotten into minecraft and could play all day. I love being able to easily limit him without having to fight him on it. He knows when his time is up it is up.<br/><br/>I love that you can easily control the content they see. Most everything I've seen so far is kid friendly. I extensively went through it before giving them to my kids. I found just a few things I didn't want them to have access to and removed it.<br/><br/>I love that they can be sitting in the back seat and I don't have to worry about them getting into a weird YouTube channel or anything.<br/><br/>The case is great. Lightweight but very sturdy.<br/><br/>I also love the access to books! We've recently moved and our book box somehow has been lost in the depths of our garage. So we have been reading the same 6 books for weeks. I think we read that many new ones just this morning.<br/><br/>I'm still learning and figuring it out. And will try to update this review as I learn more
 I bought two tablets for my 2 kids Christmas 2017. I have replaced BOTH since then, and as of now, September 2018, one of my kids tablets is now not functioning. EVERY TIME the charging port is not working with the tablet. We have taken it in and confirmed this with a local electronics repair store. They stated that this is a VERY popular problem with this tablet.  I refuse to go through the trouble of replacing a tablet, AGAIN. If your product has failed almost 4 times, then why do I need to reorder??<br/><br/>Another thing....when your child starts downloading games, it will fill up quickly, but good luck on trying to uninstall enough apps so that you will return to normal function. I know that devices come with apps that they will not allow you to delete. But come on.  Even after deleting a lot of the apps they were using, it still showed that their storage was low.<br/><br/>I'm on a hunt to get a better tablet that I don't have to replace every 3 months. Not satisfied.
 The apps don't shut off when  you hit the power button. This is a bug that can easily be fixed, but until then our kiddo inadvertently drains the battery because of it. Otherwise it's perfect!
 I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my son and nephew, so it has been 8 months...<br/>The positives about this: they are inexpensive and the case makes them almost indestructible, it has a lot of options for games and videos, etc. I would have gave this a four or five star until Alexa was added!<br/>The negatives: the storage issues-  most of the items can't not be stored on the external SD storage and the system applications take up almost all the internal storage.  This wasn't too much of an issue until recently.  At some point Alexa was added to the tablet (not by us) and it takes up 241 MB plus additional all the additional alexa system applications that can not be deleted. This may not sound like much but with all the other system applications (many useless for a kids tablet, that can't be removed), it is just enough that we have a constant low storage message and some games won't play do to not enough memory.  Most of the time now, my son gets frustrated because every game or book he tries to use gets a constant message about low internal storage.<br/>It was worth the purchase at the time but now it is worthless
 "Parental Controls" are a joke. They do not allow you to control the content the tablet displays to your children. All you get to do is tell it what age level of content you want available to your child, and then Amazon's development team gets to decide what content your child has access to. If you don't want them watching something at Amazon thinks is appropriate to the age levels you've selected, too bad, they can't. You could change the age level, but then maybe you're losing a bunch of content that you do want.<br/><br/>These aren't parental controls, they're Amazon controls.
 My daughter is 1 yes old and she loves it. It is so easy to use. And the over night shipping was great since we where on vacation when I brought it.
 Update (Same day):<br/>Amazon called me within a couple of hours of making this post &amp; is replacing the device since it's still under its 2-year warranty. I had no idea about the warranty, which is fantastic if you think about how much kids beat these up, &amp; have modified my review to reflect that (they didn't ask me to).  While the power connector issue is a real one, they took extensive notes on our call to be given to their development team.  I don't doubt they'll get it sorted in a future model &amp; for the interim, the warranty they offer makes this a pretty solid purchase - not to mention the fantastic customer service.  If only all companies took such a proactive approach...<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>* 2-year replacement warranty!<br/>* The device itself, when working, is great.<br/>* FreeTime allows the kids to download whatever games/apps they'd like from the Amazon library.<br/>* The silicone/rubber exterior does what it's supposed to &amp; protects the device from your standard drops, scratches, etc.<br/>* The kids love it<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>* No SD expansion slot<br/>* The device will eventually stop holding a charge, even if the power connector port hasn't been physically/visibly damaged.<br/><br/>Original Review:<br/>This is our 3rd Fire, &amp; 3rd time we've had the issue of it deciding to randomly no longer hold a charge.  This wasn't preceded by a drop, power outage/surge, a breakage of the charge port or "act of God" - you just wake up one day &amp; it's bricked. I know for a fact it's not power outlet related because this has happened in 2 houses, &amp; we've always run the chargers off an APS.  Our other 2 Fires weren't used by the kids &amp; have the exact same issue.  None of the devices made it a year before encountering this problem.<br/><br/>Our son's just broke &amp; while I want to replace it since he loves it so much - I can't justify the expense again. Until Amazon addresses (publicly) &amp; fixes the issue, we'll be buying our devices elsewhere.  It's a shame because these have real potential.  I don't mind paying $100+/yr for my Prime membership but I'm not going to pay another $100+ to replace a faulty device.
 We really really wanted to like this tablet , but it Was terrible for us. It was not very user friendly for my 6 yr old who is a whiz with an IPad. We wanted more parental controls but this was a nightmare to try to setup. I spent hours trying to get all our apps and new ones setup. I am no tech expert but I'm not a complete novice either. Not only that our movie apps couldn't be added to the kids section so we would have to open up the parents section anyway. Even after trying every YouTube and other web fix we just couldn't make it work. They had to go back. Great idea but awful execution!
 We got 2 of these, one for each kid. We’ve had them a little over a week but we may have to return them. They just barely work. It’s just constantly one problem after another. I’ve had the following glitches in the 8 day’s of using these: apps saying we don’t own them when we do, screens freezing and needing to shut down, apps refusing to open with no explanation, slow loading, apps crashing, books disappearing after downloading, etc. My kids have used them 4 times and I’ve used them to set them up for them, and they’ve never worked for more than 60 minutes without needing restarted to fix the freezing screens. Also each one has needed deregistered and reregistered to make apps work again.  We bought these for a specific purpose, a long car trip that we’re taking soon. And I can already tell it’s going to be really hard to keep them both working for the ride without WiFi to fix issues. Ugh.
 Nice. I'm also a prime member but unfortunately the features don't work where I live in the Bahamas. So it was a big disappointment and waste of money for me. But I could imagine how lovely it would've been for my daughter if the features worked.
 People have low expectation if they think this is a good kids tablet interface. It DOES NOT, I repeat DOES NOT auto boot into kids mode. It boots into adult mode WTF (face palm). In "freetime" mode the kid can just click on apps to download, HOWEVER because there is a huge lag and it doesn't do anything to let the kid know something happened like any proper UX would, the kid just clicks on more apps waiting for something to happen. Who was UX lead who made this crap? (You suck!) Pop up some mini game while they wait or something.
 I'm returning this because it does not seem to hold a charge, but that's not the reason for the review.<br/>I bought this so that I could give our great-grand a tablet customized for her (age 2 1/2).<br/><br/>One major problem (and it's huge) is that there are simply too many options and no apparent way to control them. There's a 'carousel' that is parrt of the child's home page: It's initially populated with a bunch of potential choices.  You can remove them from the carousel, but once it's entirely empty they call come back.  And the actual home page is not the first thing a child sees; it's the carousel - with the home page a not-apparent swipe up.<br/><br/>A second major problem is adding stuff to the child's home page that you have downloaded from the store.  Once I had added something I could find it among the apps visible to me but not among the apps that were candidates for being visible to the child. Now, there MUST be a way to do this.  And once you find it, I'm sure it will be obvious; but there's darned little help along the way.<br/><br/>A third major problem is that the potential child resources (videos, books, etc) are represented by icons - page after page.  And they are not in alphabetical order - nor in any apparent order whatsoever.  And if you wanted to wipe them all out and start over by adding stuff one-at-a-time from the store, there does not appear to be any way to do that.  So these resource lists seem more like a giant marketing tool rather than a useful index.<br/><br/>I've had a number of Android devices in different flavors over the years.  This Fire tablet was the least user friendly I've ever met.
 Just picked up a couple for my grandkids, they were cheap, how bad could they be.  AWEFULL! I will be returning mine. Amazon’s half-baked android software is horrible.  You can’t set up tablet to default for the kids profile, always starts in adult mode and needs password.  Can not get get good apps due to Amazon having their own App Store, I mean run google play for crying out loud.  Take too long to set up due to the fact that is has lots of icons on the tablet that you need to either download or delet off very confusing for kids.  You get what you pay for, except in this case you get much less... I should went with my gut and bought a couple used iPad minis for just a little more.  YOU CANT EVEN PUT MUSIC ON THESE THINGS FOR KIDS. How hard would it be to have a music section and let parents download songs from prime music in the kids section.  Jeff Bezos should be ashamed for selling this, and I sure he is ashamed all the way to the bank seeing how many people he duped.
 This was the best decision I could have made for my son Cole who is 6 and is on the spectrum!<br/><br/>He gets overwhelmed, overall sensory overwhelmed with a iPad, Cellphone or Laptop!<br/><br/>This was extremely easy to set up , and it allows us as parents to control the content and time he can be be on the tablet!<br/><br/>I was worried he would be aggressive or agitated with learning how to get it up and going...<br/><br/>Needless to say Cole is in Love with it.. he has not put it down since he opened it this morning!<br/><br/>He feels like he has his own - easy to navigate- operate device where he has choices for playing, reading and watching some of his favorite shows!
 This Kindle is the worst, especially for kids. It freezes constantly, which requires us to restart it 6-10 times per day. None of the kids apps work if you are not on WiFi, and since we bought it to entertain our son while in the car it is useless. I tried Returning it, but Amazon won't let you return it! They send you to tech support, who tell you to do a hard reset and reinstall all of your apps. Guesss what? That doesn't fix the problem Amazon.
 This thing was a pain in the butt to set up. It's very easy at first but right away it was glitching and not loading the letters when I typed. Our information kept coming up wrong even after 3 factory resets fifteen minutes after opening. Customer service has no clue. They just repeat everything a million times until you hang up. We had to add a couple of faux profiles to delete the messed up ones because it needs some at all times on the device, download the games and apps from the laptop because it didn't work on the tablet, and the device gave weird pop up screens that never fully loaded whenever we tried to install something, and the kids functions weren't working at all. The touchscreen is off and Free Time doesn't load right away or when they kids turn it on. They can access anything on our profiles and anything else. I thought the point was so they couldn't. It's really slow on excellent internet and even before we connected it to it. The typing doesn't load properly and clicking on things doesn't work. It was more stress than it was worth.
 Make sure when u buy these for other people's kids you click on send as gift so your Amazon account dont go on it or else those tablets have access to your Amazon info. Learned that the hard way. Overall great tablets for my 3 year old and 10 year old when we travel in the car.<br/>Update: 7/10/18 - so after almost 7 months I had 1 tablet that cracked and another had its charging port loose and no longer charging. After I called customer service to take advantage of the worry free replacement warranty....what an awesome experience. I am getting the tablets replaced no questions asked and it was an easy phone call. I do advise everyone keep their original box as it makes it easier on Amazon and urself for product identification and return. Very pleased!!!
 I bought two of these, one for each kid.  They are absolutely terrible and I am going to sell them and get iPads.  First of all, they do close to nothing while not on wireless... I'm not looking to set my kids up for hours of screen time while at home... I need these for then we're on the road. Second, they are not intuitive at all.  Getting from one spot to the other is really hard, and if you want your kids to watch a movie you have to switch profiles and get it set up for them, and then at that point they have access to your amazon account. Third, these things are slow and sluggish.  Half the time the app avatars do not load so you have to guess what you are selecting, then even when you manage to get to the app you want... it is slow, buggy, and often shuts down. Fourth... the screens are terrible quality. Unless you are in a completely dark room with no direct light, you can barely see the screens. My wife and I just returned from a road trip where we had an 8 hour drive one way... it was awful. Every couple of minutes one of these awful devices would have some sort of issue and my wife would have to try to figure it out. Instead of having any time to talk or listen to things we wanted to... we spent the entire trip managing kindles. Up until this purchase we had iPads, and we will again have iPads... you get what you pay for. Drop the extra money for a device that works... and these kindles DO NOT.
 I bought four of these for my kids, the oldest (7) took care of his and that one charging  broke. I see no physical damage to the charging port, it just stopped working- yes i tried numerous chargers and wall warts. The "hassle free warranty" took an hour to process an exchange that will take about 2 weeks to send and receive the new one back.<br/><br/>It would be easier and better to just pay $50 for the tablet, buy the case separate, and save yourself the additional $50 for the warranty. Or better yet, buy a better tablet.<br/><br/>A review on the actual device:<br/><br/>Its very laggy,(not at first) They can download whatever they want with a press of a button and it takes numerous hours to manually remove them when its full, which happens quickly even with a 32GB memory card since alot of the apps won't transfer over.<br/><br/>Since I purchased four of these, I'm not looking forward to the cost Vs use ratio- What seemed like a good deal really isn't.
 Buy this. I felt all sorts of mommy guilt for getting my almost 2 year old one, but it seriously saves our sanity when we go out to dinner. I love that it comes with a ton of books. We usually read anywhere from 3-10 books at bedtime, but this has made it so much easier bc we can keep the lights off and still read. There are some amazing apps on there, including one of my favorite characters, Daniel Tiger. My son is potty training now and -thanks entirely to this app- he knows to flush and wash his hands afterwards.<br/><br/>I did knock one star off because it's sometimes a little laggy. We actually had to completely restart it because it was frozen. As for me really caring that much about it, I really don't. My kid isn't even two so he needs to learn to develop just a tiny bit of patience.
 Updating my review 1/6/18....NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE!!! changing my 3 star review to 1 star.  They received my broken tablet and determined my device needs to be replaced (duhh we know that it was not charging) now they are sending out a REFURBISHED TABLET....yeah I'm done and will NOT renew my prime membership this year.<br/><br/>Great Tablet for my 3 yr old son. Purchased this July 5 2017 because I  needed something for him as he always wanted my phone. He loves his tablet easy to use and the free time is great. January 1, 2018 I called the amazon customer service because this tablet was plugged into the charger for 5 days and not charging and I remembered the lovely "no questions asked guarantee" replacment warranty advertised with this tablet and ALL over the free time page. Well I must say that no questions asked is a complete JOKE. First person I spoke to I explained the tablet is not charging and we tried multiple amazon cords etc and its not working she could not help me and transferred me to person #2  I should have known it was going to go downhill when the rep asked me to turn the tablet on AND plug it up and wait 30 mins...NO MA'AM I had to remind her it has no power it will not charge and we attempted to charge it 5 days. I will NOT plug it in for 30 mins. I asked her about the "no questions asked guarantee" because she is asking a bunch of irrelevant questions low and behold she cannot help me and I get transferred to rep 3 who is no help only to be transferred to rep 4.  He recaps everything he was told before I came on the line. In his recap he understands I need a new tablet becuase this one was dropped and the screen was cracked (not sure what game of telephone he was playing) at this point I am upset and advise him that was not the case this is not holding a charge I need a replacment because we have not had this thing for a year.  Well this rep started the warranty process and says I should have a new one in 5 days from returning it.  We will see..I just returned the tablet today.  Overall its a good tablet for kids which is why i rated it a 3 but the warranty process is a hassle.
 The one praise about this product is that the hardware is good and the bumper protection on it is excellent.  After that, starts all the parent challenges with this product.<br/><br/>Freetime<br/>You get a free 1-year subscription to Freetime. Sounds like a great offer, right? The con here is that you can't easily deselect what you don't want your child to have access to. You can narrow down the content to age appropriate apps and videos.  But there isn't a whitelist option to only specify the apps and videos that you want them to have access to. You can blacklist items, one-by-one. It'll take you about an hour to blacklist everything (if you wanted to go that route) and then turn back on the items that you do want them to access.  Ah, but there's a catch!  Amazon adds new content all the time without your knowing it, so all your efforts to blacklist everything go out the window.<br/><br/>Post the 1-year Subscription<br/>Once your free year is up, you start paying for Freetime monthly. Or you don't have to and then it's just a child profile that only has access to the apps and videos that the parent account gives them access to. Sounds simple enough, right? Nope. That's when you learn that in-app purchases or in-app subscriptions become a problem. You can't purchase an expansion pack on the adult profile and expect that in-app purchase to transfer to the child's profile. Doesn't work that way! So you try to be clever and purchase it inside the child profile. You might get away with that if you turn on the in-app purchases option. But then you hit a wall with in-app subscriptions (ie ABC Mouse, Hungry Caterpillar Playschool); child profiles are never allowed to purchase in-app subscriptions. So how on earth do you allow your child to use a child-geared app on a child's profile??<br/>You also discover that the hard drive on this device doesn't go far. So you buy the largest SD card that the device allows for and install it. That's when you learn that the adult profiles and child profiles handle content a little different. Not everything can automatically go to the SD card from the child profiles (pictures, in-app downloaded videos from Netflix and Hulu). So your device is constantly running out of HD space even though there are 32 GBs of free space sitting on your SD card.<br/><br/>Ditch Freetime<br/>You get rid of the child profile!  Ditch all the Freetime limitations and set your child up with an adult profile. Now there is a limitation here too. You can only have 2 adult profiles and 2 child profiles on the Kindle Fire. So if you're going to ditch the child profiles, that means you're limited to just 2 adult profiles. Now the concern might be your child purchasing apps, getting on the internet, and getting into additional mischief. Thankfully, there are parental controls that you can turn on to limit a lot of content and purchasing power. What I did was create a folder and stuffed it with all the Amazon apps (that you can't uninstall). Then put it at the bottom of the apps displayed. So all of her kid apps are listed first. And even if she does get into one of the Amazon apps, the parental controls prevent her from doing most things with them. There is even a curfew option that you can enable inside of parental controls. By using the adult profile, you can handle all the in-app purchases and subscriptions without Freetime getting in your way.<br/><br/>Amazon App Store<br/>Now this may be the make or break of you getting an Amazon tablet. The reality is that you don't have access to every Android app on the planet. You only have access to the Android apps that Amazon allows you to download from the Amazon store. For those who just don't take no for an answer, you can get around this by Googling instructions on how to install the Google Playstore on the adult profile. This will extensively open you up to more apps. But ditch Freetime first! Don't go down the path of getting a Google Playstore app into a child's profile. Talk about a nightmare and a laundry list of regrets. It's not worth all the effort.<br/><br/>Summary<br/>If I had known all the Googling that would have been involved with this product, then I probably wouldn't have bought it. But now that I *think* I've overcomed most of the challenges, it's not a bad product for a child. It's affordable.  Durable. She has access to plenty of mainstream educational and entertainment apps. Will I replace this device with another Amazon Kindle? Eh, it is highly unlikely unless Amazon improves their OS and App Store options.
 The Kids' FIre is hands down the best deal out there to put an affordable tablet in little hands with great content.  I have 2 concerns:<br/>1.  WARRANTY - the 2 year no questions warranty is incredible and we've used it on a couple of different devices which children broke.  We replaced one with a broken screen Sept '18. The warranty on that tablet would expire in Nov '18. The replacement tablet lasted just 5 months then stopped charging. Now, the charging port is definitely the Achille's Heel of these devices. And, if you receive a refurbished device, that port has been activated hundreds or even thousands of times. When the replacement tablet stopped charging after such a short time I really thought Amazon's incredible customer service would replace it. They did not. So as good as that warranty is, the day after it expires you're on your own even if there was a pre-existing condition!<br/>2. We bought our first Fire about 4 years ago and have been extremely pleased. Then, as so often happens, the latest update broke what wasn't broken!<br/>One tablet updated to this several weeks ago and I wondered if my daughter somehow implemented it by accident.  But then the other one updated just last night - we had no choice in the matter and Amazon customer service has told me there's no way to uninstall the update and go back to the original interface.<br/>My biggest complaint about the new interface is the "Characters and Themes" category that is right there in their face...<br/>The children don't like the UI complaining constantly that they can't find the stuff they want to play or watch.<br/>I really feel like they are not getting all of the available content - because one of them doesn't yet read and even for the child that IS reading, he doesn't know what to search for. So unless the app/book/show gets into Amazon's recommended status while it may be available to the children it isn't obvious.  The old UI presented them with a ton of content which they could scroll through - that ton is pared way, way down with the new UI.<br/> Amazon:  Why couldn't you give us a CHOICE - why not introduce this new UI as an option?
 Just got off the phone with Amazon "tech support" over the issue. I couldn't transfer downloaded videos that are amazon prime to my kid's profile. Kids TV shows, that are in the Kids section of Amazon Prime...like Tumble Leaf.<br/><br/>Well, guess what? You can't. The entire reason I got the kids version of the tablet is so I'd have a durable video player for the kiddo while in the car, shopping cart, etc. The small downtimes where I can say "hey you've been good, here's your favorite video." NOPE. If you aren't connected to WiFi, you are out of luck. Same goes for any other services from prime that need an internet connection.<br/><br/>Apparently, I'm not alone and they told me this is one of their biggest complaints and apologized. They were very nice, but it doesn't do what I want it to and they REALLY need to inform people of this before the purchase. Seems like a bait and switch.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Talked to another tech support guy because the internal driver for the sound was on the fritz and needed to roll back or something then re-update. Well, while we had to wait for the download and do the whole "how's the weather" routine, I told him how annoying it was I couldn't use this for it's intended purpose, he basically solved the issue the other guys couldn't. Create a completely separate profile that is NOT FREE TIME. "Oh, free time is way too limited for what you want. It's not user-friendly. Just create another profile that isn't linked to the free time service, turn on parental controls to what you want, block purchases and such and use it to stream video. That should work fine." God bless this man. And don't subscribe to free time if you have a similar use as I do.<br/><br/>I'm still leaving the 2 star review (started as a 1 star, because it doesn't let you use a service you literally pay for) because I had to go through about an hour of talking to tech support for something they should have a ready answer for if they have so many complaints. The last tech guy gets 5 stars.
 Excellent, my daughter loves this. She can read books, do her school work, watch a few shows, and listen to music. She really enjoys having something that is just for her to use. She is 12 and this was the perfect age appropriate gift that is also extremely functional. I do use the parent settings for some extra security when she is using it unsupervised but otherwise, I do not have a set time limit. Great product.
 If you do not have a constant internet access at home the FreeTime app is borderline worthless. Honestly even if you have internet at home, it's only borderline useful. I'll go over all the reasons below.<br/><br/>First I got this for my niece as a birthday present, her mom does not have internet at home but I figured with the ability to download movies/apps for offline use this would not be a problem; I was wrong. My nieces mom, her older daughter and myself all have hotspot data on our phones so I figured we could just connect it every few days and let the tablet do it's thing and that would be enough.<br/><br/>When in offline mode, anytime you tap a movie to watch, it comes up with a popup message telling you if you watch the movie/show you have 48 hours until it expires. For a four year old who can't read or understand this message it just means the tablet does not work and is an instant meltdown.<br/><br/>The tablet is also slow as can be when switching things. So think about a slow tablet, plus popup messages and you've got a disaster on your hands when it comes to small children who want things instantly and repeatedly tap things trying to make it work.<br/><br/>Who ever is designing FreeTime has clearly never interacted with a child. They need to give us the option to remove the warning about movies. After the movies expire they should just remove the icon from all the menus until the tablet is connected to the internet.<br/><br/>The next issue is that just about everything you tap instantly downloads and small children don't understand or care. They'll fill up your memory just tapping aimlessly and you're then doomed to constantly remove things.<br/><br/>You can use an sd card for extra memory but not everything can be downloaded to the memory card thus you will eventually fill up your internal memory and the more memory filled, the slower the tablet will run.<br/><br/>Everytime you turn the tablet off/on it switches back to your profile instead of going to the child profile. This I can understand but there should be an option to change this. This was not purchased for adult use and is an annoyance.<br/><br/>When downloading items FreeTime will often bug out and not allow you to download anything and the same thing happens when you're removing items, it'll randomly stop letting you remove things. Sometimes if you wait long enough it fixes itself but more often than not you're forced to restart the tablet.<br/><br/>The tablet has started having problems showing items mainly books/apps that have been downloaded, they just don't appear anywhere. It has also started failing to show the images for movies while in offline mode so we have no idea what something is until it's tapped.<br/><br/>There is no way to search for specific movies/books/apps, they just have a massive list of things you have to scroll through until you find something. Some movies can't be downloaded and you'll only find out when you try and it fails with an error message.<br/><br/>The power button sometimes sticks when you touch it, I'm not sure what the implications might be over the long term but I've got two years to replace it so I'm not worried about it that much.<br/><br/>Overall the tablet is just borderline okay, it does its job but not very well. I have internet at home so when she comes here, she'll have a better experience but only slightly better. Amazon needs to invest more money and time into the FreeTime app because right now, it's not befitting of the Amazon name. They need to survey everyone who uses it and make some damn improvements because as it stands now, I won't be renewing FreeTime, I won't be purchasing another Kids Edition tablet and I certainly won't be recommending it to anyone.
 I have no real complaints about the tablet part - it's nice to know if my kids destroy it or something I'm replacing something cheap instead of an ipad. BUT, I'm about to toss it all because of the lack of intuitive parental control, and the presence of advertising that you cannot bypass everywhere.  Freetime makes no sense.  I want a password protected area of the device with only the audiobooks, videos, and music I choose.  But Freetime gives you access to everything they deem appropriate within the age range you set (and I highly disagree with their age appropriateness by several years) and then you have to go in and block what you don't want them to see.  Who has time for that? !  Also, it seems that once I've set everything or deleted games or apps they come back on their own.  Games I didn't want my son to play were suddenly available again after a few weeks.  You simply cannot customize Freetime enough to make it worthwhile.  Cumbersome, ridiculous.  And every time you power on the tablet you're looking at an advertisement for something, not always kid appropriate.  Same complaint with the Amazon prime video app...why are rated R movies previewing before Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood?!
 I bought this for my 3yr old autistic son to replace a Samsung Kids Tablet that he'd destroyed. Was really impressed with how tough the case appeared to be &amp; the amount of apps available on Freetime for kids his age. Also like the fact that it came with the 2yr protection plan at no additional charge
 I initially was impressed with the tablet. However, as time passed, I only became more and more frustrated. Let me first start by saying, we have two of these. Both began having problems regarding charging, freezing, no space available despite not having much on there and expanding the space. The issues grew so bad that the tablets would no longer even turn on. I tried everything to solve the issues on my own. Upon contacting customer service, I was surprised to find that their replacement with “no questions asked” policy is, in fact, a lie. They will ask you a ton of questions and then require that you send in the tablets so they can be reviewed or “fixed” and if it is determined they cannot be “fixed” then they will replace it. That whole process takes weeks. What a joke. It’s not worth the hassle; and my kids only use their tablets for 30 minutes before bed. We shouldn’t be experiencing the problems we are, in the first place.
 This is a great tablet for kids.  I bought this for my grandson for Christmas in 2016.  Actually purchased in July, 2016, but he didn't use it until Christmas.  Not only do you have FreeTime and the Amazon games and videos designed just for kids,  but you can also set up an adult profile and download YouTube or other apps for adults.  So, my grandson's tablet got extremely hot, then stopped working a week ago.  I checked and this was still within the 2 year warranty.  So I called Amazon and we did a number of things for trouble shooting.  Nothing worked.  The tablet would not power on.  So they sent me a label for free shipping  to send the tablet back by UPS and in less than a week, a brand new Amazon Kids Fire tablet arrived!  My grandson is happy again and I couldn't recommend this tablet, warranty and Amazon's technical support and customer service any higher.  Great job, Amazon!
 I'm giving this five stars.  Why?  Because my 17 month old loves it.<br/><br/>To be completely honest hardware-wise this isn't exactly cutting edge.  The screen isn't especially sensitive to your touches (granted it's usually covered in sticky god-only-knows-what so it'a hard to tell if that's the reason why) and it's not an especially fast tablet, but it loads games and videos fast enough for my 17 month old to enjoy it.<br/><br/>Really though what you're paying for is the no-questions-asked replacement policy.  My kid throws his down the stairs several times a day and somehow smears snot, ice cream, saliva, ketchup, and god only knows what (thankfully no poop - yet) and this thing still keeps ticking like it's a Timex.  I'm starting to think I may never need to exchange it!<br/><br/>But really... buy one for your kid.  You won't regret it... just whatever you do DO ***NOT*** LET THEM GO TO BED WITH IT or you'll be walking by their room three hours after bedtime only to hear some strange sounds and to walk in on them laying in their crib still playing Sago Mini games with the biggest smile on their face imaginable!  Can you imagine how grumpy this kid was the next day!!!!  It was totally unbearable!<br/><br/>I never thought in a million years that a baby could figure out how to not only play these games, but to swipe across the screen to navigate through the selections and even to swipe up to go back to the main screen when he was done!  It's INSANE!!!
 Update: immediately after this was published I received an email and a phone call from Amazon customer service offering to help me with the issues I describe. That’s very kind, but my perspective still stands. It doesn’t help that so many apps are “free” but once I add them to the child profile, it suddenly requires a purchase to even play (so I have to log back into my profile and pay for it). Perhaps they could be marked as “not free” from the start and the set up could be handled at purchase instead of requiring so much back and forth? I shouldn’t need tech support to use the basic functions of a tablet.<br/><br/>This tablet is marketed for kids, and comes in a case plus the replacement plan. Oh, and it's pink. My daughter loves pink. That is pretty much where my positive feedback ends.<br/><br/>I do not personally own a kindle for myself, so I cannot compare to the regular Kindle Fire, but my impression is the case, the replacement plan, and the subscription to Freetime is what makes this the "Kids" tablet.<br/><br/>What I wanted was a tablet that I could set up to easily let me 3 year old watch the occasional show or play educational games. What I received was an exercise in frustration in an impact resistant pink case.<br/><br/>First, everyone in my household's amazon account is linked (I guess through my Prime account) so there are 3 profiles automatically on the device. I do not want access to everyone's books, apps, downloads, whatever-- I just want to be able to pass the tablet with a game set up to my child for a few minutes without worrying about her pressing buttons and doing something else. So, for example, I installed a "learn to read" game. I access "Daughter's profile". I can't find the app. I can find a million recommendations, but not the 3 apps that I decided were okay, or the 1 new one. Somehow I can only access it from my profile, which also brings up every Kindle book I have ever downloaded elsewhere, but not from the profile for the child that I downloaded it for. Why? Why is it so difficult to just DO what I want to do?<br/><br/>Well, that's because somehow there is "Daughter's 2nd fire" that I sometimes can stumble upon, that is apparently a profile on the same device, which possibly works more like I expect it should. However, to get more content to show up, I have to go back into my own profile, and allow it on this other profile.<br/><br/>I appreciate the fact that it needs my permission, but here's the thing-- I bought it for a child, set it up for a child, went on my desktop and enabled the app for a child, sent it to the profile for a child, and then need to go through 5 additional steps that may or may not be needed JUST to freaking figure out how to get it to show up and then still not be entirely sure that I did it correctly. Just...why? Why can't Amazon make it more intuitive?
 The hardware seems rugged enough with the foam case. The content is very hit-or-miss, largely miss. There are some gems in there, but most of the default 'curated' content is very weak and much of it has large areas of the screen devoted to ads, including often very inappropriate adult ads or broken ads that only display a large web error message. Many of the best children apps are not available on the Amazon store, such as Dave and Ava, and there is no supported way to install apps from Google Play, so parents need to be a bit tech savvy to somehow get and sideload content that isn't available from Amazon. There is a way to unblock specific videos from the child's profile and build up a library of youtube videos, but it is very tedious and requires going to each individual video for the procedure instead of just unblocking a whole youtube channel or playlist. Basically, it works, but is not nearly as convenient or well curated as it could be. I bought it at a good discount on Prime Day, and I'm not sure yet if it was worth it but I'm glad I didn't pay more. They seem to have focused more on content quantity than quality, and because of the adult ads most of what we've tried so far is unusable, but again, there are some good ones. "The Monster At the End of This Book" is an example of one of the gems, it's even animated and interactive. Just be prepared to sift through a lot of content that's not as good.
 Really disappointed in the fire tablets. We got them to replace very old iPads that only kids were using and a larger one for my husband to use. They are not user friendly AT ALL. I thought I would like the freetime feature but I hate it. I can’t organize the screen the way I want or in a way that works for our kids. The kids have access to download whatever kid material they want to I constantly have to manage and delete materials when it’s full. I don’t like to blanket ban stuff but there are apps I prefer my kids not use, yet they can still get to them even after I delete them multiple times. You can allow access to things like Netflix but you can disallow access to apps you don’t like. Most importantly Amazon limits the apps you can access in their marketplace. I can’t download epic books for my kids which we LOVE. I assume it is because Amazon has a competitor app. I wish I could return these but it took a while of using them before I realized how much I hate these things. They are a waste of money and truly annoying to use. I will be replacing them as soon as I can.
 My son will love this for Christmas, he has been using an old cracked phone almost all year long and we are glad to have such a great product with a great warranty. Not to mention the year of free-time that came with it, we are immensely pleased.<br/><br/>Edit to add: Christmas has come and gone and my son absolutely loves this tablet! He loves the games, books, and videos he watches. I love that it is more kid friendly for the purpose it serves - to help my son to learn things such as counting and reading - along with good entertainment appropriate for his age without me having to hover over him all the time.  It's been bounced and dropped, and not a scratch yet. It is also wonderful in that it does not require wifi after you download the videos, books, and games. Granted some apps do require it, but almost all of the ones he uses do not require it, so he is free to play in the car and at his great-grandmother's house (which has no internet) and enjoy to his heart's content!
 It's good for keeping my kid in a kid friendly interface where she can't interfere with settings or access inappropriate content. Ours has a number of bugs, it freezes up often and sometimes won't do what we ask it to do, which can be frustrating.<br/><br/>Being able to set time limits is very useful. The parent dashboard is very cool and handy to see what our kid is engaging with most. FreeTime is fantastic because it offers tons of great apps for our 3 year old. I manage which apps are accessible on the home screen. I have a few wishes that would make this product much better:<br/>- Categorize apps on the Home screen. We can't easily tell if they are books, games, or videos.<br/>- Ability to categorize apps within each section by their skill. This would allow us to only show apps for a skill we're focused us, e.g. alphabet, counting, writing, etc.<br/>- Ability for parents to read what the app is about and the skill focus before downloading.<br/>- Offer a category for books that read to them within the books section. There is a section for this under characters, but it seems misplaced. Our daughter can't read yet so we like the interactive books that read to her.<br/>- The ability to prohibit use of less educational games until educational games are played with for a certain amount of time.<br/><br/>All in all we really like it, but definitely see where they have plenty of room to further improve the product.
 The Pink and Blue Tablet was GREAT.  I could easily find and download free games.  The Yellow Tablet seems to have an entirely different interface... very difficult to find free games, or to customize it at all.  You download games just to find out you have to pay for them anyway.  I also cannot remove things off of it's "desktop" so that my kids don't click on it.  I should be able to remove "Western Journal,"  for example but no uninstall option like the Pink Tablet.  It is like they are forcing advertisements on you.<br/><br/>EDIT:  It was 2 stars, but now it is 4 due to the customer service.  As soon as I posted this, customer service called me and fixed it over the phone.  YAY  ...  the reason it is not 5 stars is because apps marked as FREE really are not free.  There needs to be a way to search the tablet for games that are truly free.  I am a single mom with 7 kids.  I cannot buy games for all these kids.  I am spending far too much time trying to figure out which games are really free.  It would also be nice if the apps/games were marked with internet required.  I don't like my kids to have to always be connected to the WIFi in order to play.
 I bought three of these for my three young boys (7,4,4) and I can't believe there is no way to have mp3 music play on the kid's profile. I thought this would be a no-brainer so I never researched it. I am strongly considering returning these for a galaxy or ipad. How could amazon NOT include such a basic necessay feature??
 Pros:<br/>-Tailored to my kid's ages and genders<br/>-Limits or prohibits internet/youtube time (these can be very toxic), and movie time<br/>-Can set reading goals for kids to reach before they can game<br/>-Keeps them busy<br/>-Durable, has been dropped plenty and not broken<br/>-That two year warranty is golden. One screen managed to get cracked (took it a year to get broken, I was impressed) and Amazon replaced it. But they do ask questions, despite the website saying "no questions asked."<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Cannot limit each device to only one account. The devices list all the amazon accounts in the household, regardless of my efforts to "hide" the others.<br/>-Accounts are slow to upgrade settings (or maybe just don't keep them?). My kids quickly figured out that they could log into each other's accounts on their devices and steal more time after their own accounts had run out of my set time of two hours a day.<br/>-In order to thwart the above, the only thing that works is giving each kid a password at lock screen. WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM YOUR PARENTAL PASSWORD IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE SETTINGS. You have to remember your kid's password to even enter the settings, and then enter your own password.<br/>-Adding new content is a pain in the rear. Example: my kids wanted the furby connect app for their furbies, but you cannot simply log into an app store on their devices and get it. You have to download it on the main account, then go into each of their devices and remember enough passwords to get into settings, then "add content" that way. Not user friendly.<br/>-Sometimes the added content disappears. My kids complain to me that the nifty app they had me add is just gone. When I go in to add it again for the hundredth time, it's checked off like it's already there, but it's not.<br/><br/>Over all, despite some of the headaches, it's a neat device and my kids enjoy it so much that I can use it as leverage for when they misbehave. Rooms aren't clean? Tablets get taken away. Tears ensue. Rooms get cleaned. I enjoy that they can read almost unlimited books on the device, if only I had such magic at my finger tips as a child. Would I recommend to a friend? Yes, provided they can get through the account management headache.
 I've got a few negatives to share and tips to say about this tablet. One the memory is minimal so easy fix I'd say always buy an micro SD card with this. Two you can't use Google play on it so you're apps are limited to Amazon play(which has a much smaller selection). Three the controls don't really stop your kids from downloading games that are in the kids apps section which can be annoying if you only want them playing specific games and the educational games are limited. Four is they don't offer or even suggest a wireless charger that works through the case. On the other hand the case is probably the best one I've ever seen to stand up to what kids will put a tablet through. The only reason I really have an issue with the lack of wireless charging is any tablet my kids have had in the past they broke the charger port on it. We bought one and glued it to the outside and covered it with stickers. I understand that the thickness of the case is a problem for that hopefully they will find a way to build it into the case and offer an upgraded version of the case. All that being said it's still a great tablet for kids and I would be happy to recommend it to anyone.
 I really can't tell you how much of a piece of junk this is. We got it because our 2 year old was using our iPad more than we were and so we wanted something cheap so he could watch videos, etc. He could navigate the iPad fine. This on the other hand, this has way too many tabs and too much content that makes him frustrated when he can't get to what he wants. Furthermore, we tried to download YouTube (we have Premium so we curate a list of safe videos that we downloaded for him to watch offline), and to get a real YouTube app you have to connect to a computer and go through these long series of steps. I am a mobile developer. It should not be that hard. Spend the extra $120 to get a refurbished iPad Mini that you can configure however you want. Planning to look into return policies.<br/><br/>Update: Unfortunately they are charging me $7 shipping to return it. My son is going to love having is own refurbished iPad mini though.
 I always suggest that parents of children, especially young children, never buy any other tablet besides kids Kindle. In fact, the adults in my house use it too as they are full powered Kindles so why but a more expensive one that doesn't have a two year warranty unless you need the faster or larger capacity ones for a specific purpose (most people don't). You can switch between a regular Kindle profile and the included Freetime profile for your child. In fact, my child has one of her own where she uses some apps in regular mode and others in Freetime.<br/><br/>The Freetime subscription allows you to use higher cost apps such as the nice $5 Disney apps for free with no concerns of in-app purchases. There are TONS of normally paid for apps, books and videos, as well as now it has a kid-friendly and kid safe web browser. You can edit what your child is allowed to watch and how much time she can spend on certain activities (such as one hour of videos a day, but unlimited amount of time reading books). I was able to exclude anything with the words "Halloween" "witch" "ghost" in the title as we don't do those things in my house. I like that I was able to search for and exclude all apps, videos and books with specific words all in one shot (it gives a list of what it finds and you can exclude all or pick and choose).<br/><br/>As the Freetime subscription is based on your Amazon account, not the tablet itself, every time you buy one it extends your subscription by a whole year and you can download the Freetime app to other devices. My family is on a ~ three year rotation of buying these (child one year, me the next, mom the next) so we always have a subscription going.<br/><br/>The ONLY downfall to all Amazon tablets and phones is you can't access Google Play. For kids, that really isn't an issue, but for adults it OCCASIONALLY is. As long as you have a phone that can access Google Play though, that should suffice for most people.<br/><br/>And, yes, it truly is two year no questions asked warranty! Why buy anything else?
 Only had for 3 months and it won’t charge! Useless. My daughter is so sad she can’t use her tablet. I contacted amazon to let them know of the problem and They are just ignoring me.<br/><br/>Update ****** Amazon contacted me and they are sending a new tablet! Changed from 1star to 3 star hopefully the next one works!
 We got this for my four-year-old granddaughter, who tried it out, but rejected it the first day. She would much rather get on a regular tablet and go on You Tube and find stuff herself. This Fire 7 Kid Tablet does not allow you to go on the internet and find your own stuff, but rather, limits the user to very few options. We returned it to Best Buy where we got it. My granddaughter personally handed it to the cashier, saying that she does not like it. We got a full refund.
 This is our 3rd Amazon kids tablet that our family has ordered throughout the past few years. Both of our boys absolutely love them so we decided to get one for our 2 year old who would get jealous when he brothers would play with theirs. For younger children this tablet is great. Has limitations on what they can do and if a 2 year old can get the hang of it, it's a pretty good product. Our soon to be 9 year old is starting to grow out of it and eventually will upgrade to a real apple iPad. But his tablet has gotten us through 4 to 5 great years of not having to invest in a more expensive iPad so it has served it's purpose well.<br/><br/>Lots of game options, storage seems to be an issue but you can just buy a SD card to add additional storage which we quickly realized we needed with the first two we got for the boys. We were able to get this at our local walmart so it wasn't an inconvenience to do so. The cases on this really hold up well and unlike apple products, we have never had a scratch or screen break of many years of drops and tosses by the kids!<br/><br/>Has a camera feature which is no where comparable to an Apple iPad but gets the job done and the kids don't know the difference. Overall this has been a great product for the children in our family and I would highly recommend to any parents that aren't looking to shell out Apple prices for a child!
 Very upset at the function of this piece of equipment.  Very unfriendly user interface.  Poor performance, and buggy/ unreliable.<br/><br/>I bought two new Fire 7 Kids edition prior to long flight and road trip with my children.  Prior to the trip I spent time switching between the adult profile and children, which is a pain in the butt.  I downloaded several apps and movies that I paid for and then uploaded them to my kids profiles.<br/><br/>The problems started immediately.  One app in particular, Elmo Loves ABC's, did not work on either Fire and crashed every time I opened it.  I tried all trouble shooting remedies listed online and those told me by a Amazanon Rep, but none worked.  The Amazon Rep told me he opened a special ticket and Amazon would be in touch with me ASAP.  It's been two days shy of two weeks and I have not received a call or message other than this survey request.<br/><br/>On the plane both Fires had to be rebooted several times at the begins of the trip and throughout .  On another note, it's frustrating that every time you power on/off I have to log in and switch to my kids profile.  One the Fires would not play the movies becaus their was no WiFi.  After landing an at a WiFi spot, there was nothing to download because it was already on the Fire.  When I tried to play the movie later on the road trip, guess what?  Not working again.<br/><br/>I could go on an on, but it hurts my brain trying to put down into words how many tings have not worked on this damn things.  I got two Fires for the price of one iPad, but now I wish o would have not been cheap and got the iPads instead.<br/><br/>Very very upset and unhappy.  Still on vacation so I have not been able to deal with this.  Not have o wanted to.<br/><br/>Sorry for any typos or grammar errors.  Typing from phone while on vacation.
 I received this item one day and sent it back the next. I’m not sure if I got a bad device or what but I did not want to go through the hassle of getting refurbished devices for the next 2 years... When I opened the box, aesthetically the device was nice and the cover seemed worthy of a young user. It turned on quickly and the setup was simple to follow but my complaint is that it was SO SLOW!! The buttons to type in my name to initiate the device was even hesitant. I had a bad feeling right off the bat. Once I finally got past the setup, the download for just a single book took over an hour! Then, if you want multiple things, good luck! My other complaint about the use of the device was that once you select multiple items to download, it isn’t like you have a favorites section or somewhere to click to get ALL of the content you just downloaded. The home screen does show you about 10 of the latest downloaded items, but the other books and videos beyond those 10 are mixed in with everything else, so there is no way for you to really know if it’s already available or not. (And I never had the patience for the multiple items chosen to finish downloading, by the way.) For example, let’s say you want to go to your ‘read it to me’ books. They are mixed in with the 100 other options. And there is no way to know which have already been downloaded. I’m sure it would have worked eventually but I got this for my 4 year old for a loooong trip in the car and I knew this device was going to be an issue if she couldn’t just click on what she wanted...
 I purchased this yellow fire tablet in March 2018 as a Birthday gift for one of my toddlers. I also purchased one blue fire tablet for the second toddler. We’ve have had just a few issues with the tablet. Sometimes the tablet just freezes and you have to turn it completely off and on again. Some games don’t even download, there should be a control for the parents to stop certain games from downloading instead of going through the whole game/book/app parts to stop them one by one. Sometimes my toddler will obviously click on a ton of stuff to download and it won’t because of how many times and space. If you do purchase these tablets, get the biggest SD as possible, most games are big and kids want all the games they can download. Also, Jody this past month we have had problems with the yellow tablet charging, at first it would charge a cpl percentages and so we switched it to the blue tablets cord and seemed to work. Now the tablet will not charge at all, the charging port is wiggly, and it won’t restart when plugged in. I have talked to several customer service people and they ask the same questions and go through the same process. Nothing works. They said they’re are two updates pending and that might of caused it. It is connected to WiFi or hotspot all the time so that isn’t the case. They said they wouldn’t ask questions but they ask a lot just to try and not have to send a new one. They sent a label through email to print off and say you have to have everything that came with it. I don’t have half of it. Waste of time. Now I have to buy a new tablet for my toddler to use for the car and whenever. So far the blue tablet is still charging and working most the time.  Don’t waste ur time
 The tablet works okay. Nothing special (quite frankly, I much prefer iPad...but these are okay). Where these REALLY LACK is in the power plug. We have three kids, so therefore we have three kindles. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM HAVE PROBLEMS CHARGING!!<br/><br/>I would have thought that Amazon could take a lesson from one of the many phone manufacturers who use the same usb port, and make theirs good. But not the case. The power cord does not lock in. It almost feels like the cord is only half way in, but I've pushed and pushed and it doesn't go in any more. We absolutely CANNOT use the power cord that came with the kindles...it just will not stay in. It is VERY LOOSE and has a TON of play.<br/><br/>Overall, I would not recommend these. I would much rather spend some extra money and buy a used kindle that has more storage, more practical uses, and a power plug that actually works. Buyer beware. Again, we have three and all three are the same. It's not a lemon issue, it's a kindle issue.
 UPDATE: we ended up returning this one and got the Beneve 10" children's tablet and it was the best decision ever.<br/><br/>After much thought and consideration we ended up getting this for our 2 year old. The kindle so far has been ok as it has lots of apps for learning that our son enjoys. But it so has some pretty big flaws.<br/><br/>Here are the things I like about it:  I can control which apps are suggested to him and i can disable the browser and purchase options. It has also been a life saver on longer trips.<br/><br/>And the cons: The battery does not last long at all. I left it unpluged at night when it was at 59% and in the morning it was completely dead. So if you are planning a longer trip...be sure to bring chsrging cables and/or power packs with you. Since it is an Amazon product, you cannot download the youtube app, you can only view videos through the youtube website. Which totally sucks fof when you need to have the browser disabled. Aldo, I wanted to transfer a bunch of apps that we already purchased from my kindle to our son's profile and for some reason tbey are downloaded as unpaid and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get them to download properly. The last thing that really irritates me about it is that the main window has all the apps on it. It does not seperate downloaded apps from the suggested apps. So it is super annoying when your tot sees an app they want but you cant download it because you happen to be in an area with no wifi.<br/><br/>All in all once this one breaks, I do not think we will purchase another one.
 My son loves it and the case seems sturdy. It seems limited with what it can do which is okay since it's for my son. I don't have to worry about him ending up on an app or site I don't want him on. My problem is that after only 5 months it is no longer charging. It's heartbreaking having to explain this to him when he brings it to me excited to play his games or watch his shows. I have tried multiple chargers and outlets.
 UPDATE:<br/><br/>Received a call from Amazon regarding this review and the issue was fixed.I<br/><br/>My daughter has had her tablet nearly 1 year and NOW I am having problems with it. Let's start off saying in 11 months my daughter has played with her tablet and learns from her tablet as well. However the inital storage is very small and less than a week she needed a new SD card, there is a 64GB in it and it should not be full with her not downloading any games or apps. But we dealt with it for 11 months. And now we cannot uninstall apps, games etc that she does not use because the tablet wont allow me to do so.<br/><br/>Now my issue is there must have been a software update because her tablet disconnects from WI-FI so now daily here I go entering the wifi password. It will kick her out of games (even with them updated), wont open games, asks her to share her content with other profiles (her profile and the administrative profile are only two on here and her profile is used). I should not have to 3 to 5 times a day need to turn off the tablet and turn it back on in order for the apps to work.<br/><br/>I've factory reset the tablet numerous times and it's the same issues. I called on the 30th to Amazon and was hung up on by a rep named Abby. This was a christmas present for my daughter last year and now I honestly feel like this is a waste of money that my fiance and I put out for our daughter.
 Let's get two things out of the way, first and foremost.<br/><br/>1. This is a cheap tablet. It's not going to be playing the latest PC games on ultra settings.<br/>2. This is a cheap tablet meant for kids. Unless you're flush with cash, you don't buy an expensive tablet for kids.<br/><br/>With all of these things in mind, this is a good deal. I've bought two, and my kids drop them, get them wet, sneeze on them, throw them, and they just keep going. The FreeTime app does a decent job of giving the kids plenty of entertaining things to watch, play and read (for free) while keeping the predatory pay-to-win apps away. Even if you don't use the app, you can use the parental controls to keep the tablet pretty well locked down.<br/><br/>If I could improve one thing, I'd probably have it load a bit faster. Performance is notably slower than even mid-tier smartphones, nothing too egregious for an adult, but my kids will often give up on an app that won't load after about five seconds. But then again, this is a $50 tablet with a $5 case and a $20 Amazon Freetime Unlimited subscription. I knew what I was buying before I pressed the button.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a sure thing. Sure, you could buy a cheaper tablet, but will it still work after your kids beat it up for a year? This one definitely will.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R15ASULRXZMF73"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/912XAvwbw0S.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1QSN8cTHyS.png"/> Let me start of by saying that my 3 year old son LOVES his tablet. I, however, don't really care for it. It was extremely difficult for me to set up at first. I had to contact Amazon because there was no way to start the free 1 year subscription to Amazon Freetime Unlimited. They told me to sign up for the free month and that I wouldn't be charged after the month is up and that they would add the year subscription on afterwards. I was disappointed that it was that hard to set up. Another issue I have is that the battery dies super fast, even when my son isn't using it. It sat off the charger for a night and when we woke up it had a 16% battery life. Unbelievable. Another issue I have is that it shows all of these apps, games, books, etc. on the kids profile, but they aren't things that come downloaded on the tablet. If you click on something you don't have already then it needs to download (my son doesn't understand that he needs to wait to use what he clicked on and gets very frustrated). A better option would have been for the parents have the only access to downloading the apps and sharing them to their kids profiles. It was on sale for $80 so I didn't pay the full $100. I don't think I would recommend this tablet to anyone even though my son likes it.<br/>I bought the tablet at my local Meijer store and not on Amazon.<br/>**UPDATE**<br/>My son was playing a construction game that had a lot of ads and one of them showed adult content that I did not want my 3 year old boy seeing. Extremely disappointed with this tablet. Save yourself the money and hassle and go with a different tablet.
 Second edit January 2019: After I sent the refurbished one back because it had the same issue as the original one, we got a brand new one. After about 2-3 weeks of use, fingers crossed!! She hasn’t used it as much as she did the refurbished one and maybe about half as much as the original one from April 2018. I think she just got used to using my daughter’s phone. So far we haven’t had any issues.<br/>Edit to add December 2018: The original review was after about a week. 8 months later and DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! She used it for 4 months. Then it wouldn’t charge. Turns out that it was a known issue with the charger port. So after about 2 hrs on livechat with a rep (and multiple transfers to other departments), finally get told you need to send it in. A repairman will look at it. And if it can’t be fixed, it’ll be replaced. Call me crazy, but I thought the replacement would be new. NOPE! It was a refurbished one. I was assured that this one was as good as new and I wouldn’t have that problem again. That was all well and good for another 4 months. Same problem, different month. So yep, it’s sent off again. 😡 If the replacement we get for it acts up again, I’ll just buy her a used iPad. You would think that it being a known issue, that it wouldn’t happen again. 🙄<br/>April 2018: I got this for my 3 year old granddaughter and she loves it!! It’s perfect for a “rough and tumble” little tomboy Princess. The style and content are wonderful. My daughter was impressed with the setup and parental controls. The funniest part was that my 13 year old grandson said he wanted one.
 We bought this for our 18-month daughter and we were quite disappointed with a number of aspects:<br/><br/>1.) Runs on Amazon UI, not Android, meaning you do not have the ability to download popular apps like YOUTUBE, Netflix, Hulu, etc. All our daughter's favorite content is on these apps so you are pretty much just stuck with content found on Prime Video (Free Time here)<br/><br/>2.) No Screen lock, and no ability to download a screen lock app - With our phones, we can put on a video, lock the screen, and hand it to our toddler with no fear of her pausing, backing out, going to a different app, etc. Not possible with this tablet, as they did not include it as a feature, and the "app store" has no options.<br/><br/>3.) No auto-play feature - Most of the videos are only 1-2 minutes long and after each video, you get kicked back out to the home screen where you have to choose another video. This is super annoying if your kid is too young to select videos on their own!<br/><br/>Overall, I would suggest getting a more traditional tablet and a sturdy case.
 I've given this several months of thought. I wanted to love this tablet - the cost (when on sale) is phenomenal, the case is sturdy, size is great, unlimited access to 1,000's of apps, books, games, great insurance by Amazon but there are SO MANY glitches.  When not on WiFi the apps that you've dowloaded will sometimes not show up - you will see a dotted outline of where an app would be but no picture/text.  You can click on it and open the app but you don't know what you are opening beforehand.  This is beyond frustrating as nearly 1/2-2/3 of the apps will do this.  I don't like the way books are displayed oftentimes.  Text is too small or multiple pages show at once.  Some books will easily enlarge the print if you click on it and then it seems some won't.  My son got onto the parent sign in profile and ordered a bunch of books off Amazon because he was confused and thought these were books he could read on his profile.  Not happy that there wasn't an extra identification stage before he did. Also the battery life is pretty poor.  Probably wouldn't last more than 4 hours (a guess at this point). I will also be curious to see how much the Kids Unlimited costs once the trial period is over (I'm sure I could find this info, just haven't looked).  Really there is no point in having this tablet unless you have the Kids Unlimited subscription.  I would never use this tablet myself.
 La tablet es bonita la compré para mi nieto para navidad del 2017 , el problema es que el cargador no sirve, la devolví hace unos meses por ese problema, me enviaron otra y a los pocos meses el mismo problema,  ya la habíamos dado por perdida hasta que ayer llame a Kindle y me van a mandar otra, espero que cumplan y esta si  funcione porque mi nieto deveras disfruta su tablet
 The tablet functions about as well as any Fire - which means decent performance, limited app selection.<br/><br/>But really, since this is the Kids Edition, I'm going to review this as a device I've given my child. In that regard, this tablet is a complete failure. Amazon advertises this along with FreeTime as a way for you to control your child's experience while also providing a wealth of content. While the latter is true, the former most certainly isn't.<br/><br/>Prior to receiving this, my child was using my Kindle and an old Android phone. The Android phone we specifically disconnected from the internet, and it gave us a huge amount of control over what content she was exposed to. It also severely cut down on ads. My Kindle was more of a challenge, as I frequently had to check up on her and keep her from purchasing or downloading new items. But for the most part, it was fairly easy to keep up with.<br/><br/>The Kids Edition Kindle with FreeTime is a completely opposite experience. She can't purchase anything, but she is constantly inundated with "suggested" apps and videos, non-stop. It automatically populates her carousel with these items, with no control for the parents. We're probably going to need to turn off the internet on this one too, which kind of defeats the purpose of the supposed "parental controls". It gives you the ability to control usage with time controls, but nothing to turn off these forced apps or keep her from downloading things. Even if you manually remove something, IT WILL STILL SUGGEST IT, and of course the kid will just grab it again. You can't even blacklist apps! You can't do much of anything to keep your child from just grabbing whatever they want or whatever they're told they want by an ad.<br/><br/>I would suggest you stick to a cheaper tablet, probably an Android, where you can pick and choose the apps you want your child to use and then just turn off the internet.<br/><br/>Another parental control I'd like: A Max Volume Setting, so she can't crank it to 100% all the time. Those speakers are LOUD.
 This product is great! The case is heavy and durable. It feels like either silicone or rubber. The tablet is a real Kindle Fire, just like you or I would buy<br/>There is a year's worth of Amazon FreeTime, a service designed especially for kids with books, videos, and games that are designed to be age appropriate though you can hand tailor your experience.<br/>The only caveat: Buy the 32Gig kid's tablet if you can because there is so much to choose from, and a front and rear camera, that children can quickly fill the tablet and you'll end up needing to clear space. It's happened to us already.
 No enough storage so must purchase sd card with it ..targeted only for the young ones .under about 8 i would say ..my 8 year old perfers Google play Unfortunatley . great for little ones .great quality , picture quality , sound , case protects so far very well .tons games , apps , videos ..although habe no figured out how to watch gideos when not connected to wifi so for that reason i take a star off ..another reasin i take a star off is even if you set it to a ceryain age lets say 7 years you will still get all the very young books and apps . i wish they would create a division .so put the age in and only age appropriate games etc...would be option . also more for older kids. not a biggie but ...there sure is alot to go thru and like i said most is targeted for a preschool kindergarten age . otherwise great product ! Best out there for kids!
 Amazon advertises this tablet as kid proof, and states "If they break it, we'll replace it.  No questions asked."  Well, your child probably won't break it before it breaks on its own.  As many others have mentioned, after a few months of use the CHARGING PORT no longer works.  We tried several different chargers that work and nothing.  The tablet wasn't abused, and the charger still fits tightly in the charging port.  It just doesn't work at all.  My 7 year old is not happy, and neither are we.  After talking with customer service and having to explain the situation and go through their trouble-shooting steps (it still doesn't work), now we have to ship it to a 3rd party repair shop in Kentucky for them to figure out why it isn't working.  Unknown how long it will take to fix, or even if they'll fix it.  If they can't fix it, I believe Amazon will send us a REFURBISHED tablet, not a new one.  I'd steer clear of this one folks.
 You do need Amazon Prime to see the videos. Without it, for a child, it's very frustrating as you  can't  hide the "videos tab", and the kids will keep trying to open them but it won't work. One third of the content, useless.<br/><br/>Also, some video apps, like the "Disney Now" app, does not work outside USA. Actually, most of the content is only in English, so, if you select a language la "Spanish", most apps will still be in English.
 This tablet was purchased for my two year old because he was no longer satisfied by his nabi jr. I was unsatisfied with the app selection for nabi and the internet problems. It's supposed to be a pre screened internet that leads to kid friendly websites but it's not checked regularly. Every time a website updates it's no longer accessible on the nabi and this leads to so many dud buttons. A dud button leads to tantrums. Very slow loading websites leads to tantrums. Once he had all the puzzles and songs memorized it was time to switch it up. It will take years for my son to get thru all the content on the Amazon unlimited. This is great because he gets bored with an app after a few days and needs 8 new ones. I love that I can block anything I deem as unapropriate or annoying. I never have to listen to Cailou, Blipping, or peppa pig or many others. I can download content for offline play as well. I love that he is constantly learning and challenging himself. He is now tracing letters and numbers. He knows their names and sounds. He will be reading soon. This is a much better safer option than YouTube kids. I have to customize it often but at least I'm not worried about inappropriate content. My son used to steal my tablet to watch you tube kids. I found him watching a video where they were smashing babies over the head with hammers. Never again
 I bought two tablets in September. One for my 3 year old and one for my 5 year old, and so far I'm not really impressed. I feel like I over paid for them.<br/>Pros: case, shatter proof screen, the child friendly apps, books, and videos. The ability to switch to parent profile and use the tablet.<br/>Cons: The tablets are slow(like really slow), one tablet has been factory reset once because it wouldn't respond and wouldn't download games. I have to turn it off and back on at least once a day to make it work. The second tablet is slow, gives problems downloading, and has to be turned off and back on every few days and the case keeps interfering with the charging port.<br/>So at this point I have to find the time to contact tech support and see what we need to do.<br/>Update 1-10-19<br/>Replaced the 1st tablet 7-2018 because the charge port wouldn't hold the cable. Now the 2nd tablet will not turn on and does not charge. Waste of money.
 This is the second one that I have purchased, first one being this one with a blue cover.<br/>I enjoy how easy the parental controls are.<br/>The child mode is perfect for my young ones, and I can set times for when it turns on and has to shut off which takes away from the bickering and pleading of kids demanding to play.<br/>The children cannot access anything without a passcode of your choice. Not wifi, bluetooth, parent account, settings, location, nothing but volume and brightness and the apps you allow.<br/><br/>** MY COMPLAINTS are mostly that you cannot access these parent controls without internet, which would have left these useless without my mobile hotspot.<br/>If the tablet is not constantly updated, the apps will appear as invisible squares and the kids have to play a guessing game to play the one they want.<br/>And finally, if your little one insists on guessing your passcode, it locks you out for FIVE HOURS!!<br/>Only way around this is a factory reset, or a password change, which both you need wifi access to do, and if it's not already connected, you'll just have to wait.
 I'm writing this review after buying two of these for my six and three year olds over the course of six months. My six year old previously had the now discontinued, and in my view, superior Nabi Jr and then Nabi Dreamtab. The Fire 7 has fatal flaws that often times makes the tablet unusable for users of any age.<br/><br/>Fatel Flaws:<br/>- Unlimited downloads for kids; which leads to nonstop house keeping<br/>- Kids can navigate from one kid's profile to another<br/>- Inefficient Search<br/><br/>The Fire 7 requires an adult to periodically delete unused apps because the Fire does not limit a kid from constantly downloading apps. While I have a 32 gb sd card in both Fires, they are both filled in a few weeks as a kid can fill them without limit or warning each time they use a different app. There is no way to limit the amount of downloads or at least limit the apps that could be used. In time the Fire becomes very slow, if it works at all, when the memory is exhausted. The Nabi in contrast allowed the adult to determine the apps available to limit scope for learning and play and eliminate any chance of exhausting the memory without warning.<br/><br/>While a parent can add a password for each kid's profile it's not very affective to keep a 3 year old from accessing a 6 year old's profile or vice versa using passwords. Kids will easily share passwords and can get around the free time goals by switching profiles. It would again be best to limit profile changes from kid to kid by a parent only while allowing a kid to access their own profile without a password.<br/><br/>In addition to the vast amounts of content available for download, which is not a bad thing unless to access the content you must download therefore filling up your storage, there is a issue of finding a specific app. The layout list apps in no particular order outside of 'last used' section at the top and when searching by name the indexing is very limited requiring the user to use  an exact word instead of other possible descriptions that would be in meta data. Even if a user uses words in the title of an app or book that will not guarantee the app or book will appear in the search results.<br/><br/>While the warranties and and customer service are great for the Fire 7, the product itself is subpar due to the software. While the FreeTime feature is currently great and has tons of potential, the actual kid view is still a wild wild west landscape prone to predictable bad user experience if the user does not constantly delete previously used apps from months ago. For anyone under the age of seven, or thirty for that matter, to be burden by constant housekeeping is not a product ready for prime time.
 So I ordered this children's tablet as a gift for my little sister. It arrived intact and with the cute little blue case on it. However, once I got it set up with her account and tried to download some books for her, nothing would download. Got into contact with customer support to problem solve the issue, which ended up with me returning the tablet to get it repaired, since there was no easy fix and the tablet was defective. They returned the tablet to me, repaired, however I lost the blue case in the process. Okay, whatever. I tried the tablet again, this time the children's content wasn't even on there and I have no idea what happened with the "unlimited" kid's content subscription that was supposed to come free with it for a year. I get into contact with customer support services again, a little fed up and ready to be done with the whole thing. I just wanted to return it at this point. Well of course, it's outside of the return window. All they can do is offer me a "free" replacement. Again, fine whatever. I just want to be done. They say they'll send me my free replacement by Sunday. I check the order, it's a regular adult's tablet. . . not the original children's one that cost about $30 more because of the cute case and children's content. I'm super not willing to get back into with customer support, being transferred endlessly, re-explaining the situation repeatedly, on multiple phone calls and chats. I thought it would be a simple process, but it was an unnecessarily convoluted and frustrating experience.
 So. It's hard to review this, so I am reviewing it the way it is sold, as a tablet.<br/><br/>As a tablet, it is not very good. I am a high end pc user, I do not use tablets. I bought this of course for my kids. It has alot of issues. The build quality is poor. A very big problem is the charge port. It breaks. Alot. This is not my first Kindle. You need to use a magnetic adapter to keep yours from breaking. I have been able to help other parents who had theirs go bad just by using one.<br/><br/>As a tablet, it's slow. It lags on many of its own stores programs. Yes, it uses its own store, and it's only for Kindles as far as I can tell, and they don't all run well on their own device. It does use Android, so there are ways around this. I had it work better after I went into the "bios" and re allocated resources. I did not over clock it because it's for my kids and they don't know faster. But the memory gets all used up when you make an adult profile, than a kids profile, even on the 16gb. Solutions can be found online, so if you want you can look into it. I think it's easy to do, but I'm a high end of user so I would say do it at your own risk as I think it may void your warranty. It does require rewriting firmware files.<br/><br/>I am sure it's a great e-reader. I'm sure it's the best. It has a great screen. I can't tell you as a reader the battery life, but it's ok as a tablet. It does not fast charge, and the speaker is poor for movies. It's loud enough, but sounds bad of course.<br/><br/>From stock it can be hard to put your own movies on it. Alot of things online did not help me. What worked for me was a product I bought 123 movies to devices. I ripped them with that in the Kindle format, and use VLC player to watch them. On the Kindle.<br/><br/>All in all it's not a great tablet. I'm sure it is a great e-reader. The screen on stills is amazing. I think it's 30 fps and feels choppy in games and movies to me. The way the ram is allocated in the stock bios causes programs to run poorly. It can be unlocked and adjusted, but may not be easy if you don't know what you are doing.
 Low memory warnings, slow load times, super slow app downloads and installs, low quality screen. Everything is slow and low. The kids Freetime interface is absolutely the worst. It's a bunch of things "you may like". Well guess what, there are a bunch of movies we do like, so much that we bought them. Now, being a grown ass man, I CANNOT find the list of movies that we own!!! How is my 6 year old supposed to?  Are they buried in some section of things she may like? Don't know, can't find them. Maybe if I had the patience of a tortoise I could sift through the stupid big list things Amazon speculates we like and I might come across them.  All these "things she may like" aren't actually on the Kindle, so when she clicks on one it starts downloading at dial-up pace. She loses patience after 3 seconds so she clicks another, then another, then another, and nothing ever finishes downloading at all!!! My older kid has an HDX 7 and it's held up well comparatively. It's low on storage and was expensive, but the interface is 10000 times easier to follow and the screen &amp; performance is wwwaaayyyy better. What I want to get my kid is another HDX 7 but with an SD card slot. Amazon customer service has called a couple times to somehow help. Usually in the middle of the work day. I don't have my kid's kindle with me at work, and if I did, I don't have time to turn it off and back on to see if that magically made it a competent device.
 I’m pregnant and hungry...read with caution<br/>I’m giving this particular one, the YELLOW, 1 star BECAUSE:<br/>I bought 2 for my son and daughter. I had to wait an extra 3 days for the yellow. No big deal. I set them up today, the pink one works just fine on and off WiFi. The yellow...oh the yellow...was not only slower, but once we got everything downloaded nothing worked unless it was connected to WiFi. My son is 5 years old. He does not need to ever be connected to WiFi. Got ahold of support only to be told the whole tablet has to be factory reset. Now here I am redownloading all of his apps to test the damn thing without WiFi again. Not only does it take 45 min for one app to download, and not only does it only download 1 AT A TIME, but I have to wait to even test it to make sure it’ll work without WiFi. Lord help me.
 It works like a nice kid's tablet. I like the restrictions already built in, the cover case and the battery life. what offends me with this device is the lack of information about what actually works where!<br/><br/>This is supposed to be a device that can keep children busy but you can't download videos even though it comes with a year long subscription. Streaming is not possible outside US, UK and Germany which is not even in small print in the long epistle written on the sales page for this device.<br/><br/>If you live or intend to use this device outside the afore mentioned coutries, do not purchase!
 I wanted to like it. Cons: 1) hard to find dowloaded apps to use offline. Have to scroll through hundred or more apps looking for the little check marks. Frustrating for little kids bored in the car. It needs to be way more user friendly for kids when not on wifi (i.e car travel, doctors office, etc). Also, the apps and books on one child's profile are not automatically available on another tablet. I purposely bought same color tablets so there would be no fighting- just pick up the tablet and pick up where you left off.... not how it works. Annoying. Now when one battery is dead, they may or may not have the app/book on the other tablet to be able to go to. And when they want to play a game, they have to go find which tablet it's on... which is likely to be the one their sibling is currently using. So having a profile that is accessible by any tablet would be infinitely more helpful.<br/>Pros: like the idea of parent controls, thethat is comes with a cover and replaceble.
 I give 4 stars because there were a few things I didn't like about it as a KIDS tablet<br/>Pros:<br/>Simple! It truly is a simple interface for kids.<br/>Battery life is good.<br/>Your kid CAN do stuff with the tablet OFFLINE.<br/>Good sound.<br/>Tons of apps and activities for the kids regardless of age.<br/>Apps = Read to me Books<br/>Cons:<br/>Kids can click to download pretty much any and everything inside of Free time so there was a time my daughter was downloading 16 apps at a time and it was taking forever to download the apps we really wanted because I had to scroll through the categories and FIND the stuff she may of clicked on to stop downloading it.<br/>It does take a few seconds to load and with how speedy tech has gotten you might find yourself rolling your eyes here and there but in full disclosure it's a fast tablet for a KID and we shouldn't hold it to Apple standards. Kids don't need that type of technology anyways. But SOMETIMES my daughter will lose interest in specific apps (it could also be my personal wifi connection too so take that with a grain of salt)<br/>The camera! The camera is the worst but I don't think my 2 year old is going to take any super captivating selfies anyway. It's cute and fun and she loves it. She's learning a lot as well. 2 months in she's stood on the tablet, thrown it, and put it in her mouth, no cracks scratches or damage to report so I'd say it's pretty baby proof for the most part!
 While this device when working is great and my kids love it, the warranty is a lie. I had one go out and they replaced after a bunch of hoops to jump through (No questions asked is NOT their way of handling it) then the second one went out and when we started the return we got the same  treatment and treated like idiots. Then when they finally issued the return order they did it on the wrong device so when I sent it they had no record because the one I sent back was not the one they created the return and shipping label for. I contacted them to check on it as well as report that the replacement they had sent us a coupe of months earlier was not charging they said they could no longer do exchanges and would only issue refund. Ok fine but then when I told them i no longer had the card used to purchase they said no amazon credit and you have to get you money back from the bank who issued card. I told them i really just wanted replacement and they said it was not an option only the refund. So again I say the no questions 2 year warranty is a LIE!!!!!!! Do not buy this product if you want it to last more than 6 months.<br/><br/>Update: Had a very nice rep call me when I posted this review and got my replacements. However, both "NEW" replacement have stopped charging. They are useless. This is the absolute worst product I have ever purchased. Having to replace it every 3 months is bull crap. It is a piece of trash product! no wonder they offer a 2 year warranty no questions. They know their product has a defect!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT EVER!!!!!
 The price is right, but unless you are the purchaser AND the person you register it to, you will not be able to use the two year "no questions asked" guarantee. I bought this for my Granddaughter one year and three months ago as a gift and it won't charge. Her mother registered it under her name. I spent over an hour and talked with two agents. The last agent told me finally that he would send me the return label because I am in possession of the tablet, but they would repair/replace the unit and send it to my  Granddaughter's address. PERFECT! After waiting 12 hours I have not received an email with the return information. If I have to replace it, I'll buy it somewhere else. I've never had such a terrible experience and have at least 300 Amazon orders in the past 8 years. By the way - they asked me  a LOT of questions - no questions asked is a laugh. UPDATE: I have now spoken to 5 agents and have emailed Jeff Bezos (not that he'll ever see it). I got one return label email that didn't work because it was "not associated with the account", I called and after another 20 minutes on hold, received the correct mailing label. I will update when/if this is resolved.
 This was great while it worked.  A few technical issues but stopped working after 6 months. Want worth the return hassle.<br/><br/>Update....<br/>It has since this begun working again but was out of commission a good 3 months when it was really needed for travels. Had to buy a Samsung tablet that has been amazing.  Battery was always charged on my Fire but screen would not come on. I couldn't bring myself to throw it away, so I left it plugged in on our desk for over a month and would try to power it on every so often.  One day it finally did something and acted like it was on a reboot screen and the next day it started working. Nothing appeared to be gone and it has worked since but the battery doesn't last long any more and it has only been 1 year. Maybe I just got a dud.
 If you’ve ever owned and Apple product, you will hate this! The software system is garbage. It is nothing but frustration trying to get it to do what you want.  Just turning on and off the Wi-Fi, for example, is a nightmare and requires rebooting the tablet just so that it does what it should: turn the WiFi on or off!  We are giving up and giving our kids our old iPads.  The fact that this is cheap and comes with free replacement if damaged isn’t worth it for us.
 Bought this tablet at best buy.. I love it! I had a nook tablet which SUCKED! this one is nice u can control things but still allow freedom. You CAN download YouTube kids. Easy to use for kiddos they can download there own stuff. ALOT of apps are free.. I'm an Amazon prime u can control kiddos profile through ur phone Amazon app account. ONLY problem is that ALLL reviews about it being slow and the downloading is sooooooooooo slow is 100% correct  its beyound slow and DOES freeze this is a major bummer. :( I'm hoping that they fix that issue it is really bad. But over all I do reccomend this for a toddler not a teen or any middle schoolers
 Update 10/15/18. I should have listened.  Tablet wont charge after month 6. Waiting on a replacement and repair. At first rep said it was"no questions asked" and I could get another, then she said they would need to try and repair original first. So is it really " no questions asked " or a repair???<br/><br/>Love the numerous apps provided in the kids interface. He absolutely loves it. Also like that I can switch over to parents side.
 Frustrating to use. I purchased it mainly so my toddler has something to keep him occupied on road trips and flights where there is no wifi available; however, I just found that the child's profile (Freetime Unlimited) does not work without internet/wifi which makes this Kids Edition tablet a bit useless. I also cannot transfer downloaded Prime videos to the child profile so the only way for him to watch those videos offline is if he's under my profile (an adult's profile). I also don't like that you cannot choose which books and apps you want your child to have access to. They will have access to everything and it is overwhelming! There is also no way to view downloaded videos from Youtube (unless you do a workaround).<br/><br/>I've thought about returning and exchanging it for a regular Fire tablet without the kids edition, but in the end, you still save with the bundle (no 'special offers' ads, added case, 2-year warranty, 1 year trial of Freetime - which I don't care for at the moment), especially at the sale price I purchased it for. Still thinking about it but I have wasted so much time trying to configure this device (and I'm the go-to tech person in the family so that says a lot!).
 Update2-6-18, I have changed my 2 star rating to a 5 star rating! I am very impressed with amazons customer service and the 2 year worry free return policy! Amazon customer service called me after my review and helped me reset one tablet and get it working again! And the other tablet that would not turn on, is being replaced for free! The tablets not working is most likely my fault, from infrequent use and not charging them once a week.  I am so happy they will both be working again! My kids are a year older now and I hope they get into them more now that I will have two working tablets again for them to play on. Thank you so much amazon! For a great product and fast service for replacement!<br/><br/>Previous review: I liked the case, very durable and bright. Bought two as a bundle deal, seemed like a good deal. Used infrequently by my children and would go  weeks to months between using them at times. Haven’t used them in a few months, tried to charge them in December and neither of the two  will charge or turn on. Just over a year old. Waste of money, my kids just didn’t use them as much as I thought they would and the cost for amazon free time was too much for as little as they used them. Amazon Said worry free 2 year warranty, except on my order is says they are not returnable anymore and it’s been less than 2 years? I haven’t been able to figure out how to return them for repair?
 Amazon clearly states "2-year worry-free guarantee: if they break it, return it and we'll replace it for free. No questions asked." that is a lie. I had this just a little over a year. It stopped working and a I call Amazon for a return. They tell me I have to deal with Kindal to have it replaced. I was then transferred to them. They then proceed to tell me I will need to send it back and wait 3 to 5 business days for them to look at the device. So two days shipping there, 5+ days for diagnostics, then a few to ship it back to me. But there may be more time if they "REPAIR" it. I see nothing about "REPAIR" in the statement above.<br/><br/>I have now been on the phone for over an hour with four different people, I would not call that "Worry Free". I call it a pain in the butt! So, after two phone calls, over an hour on the phone and FIVE people they finally agreed to make and "Exception" and send me a replacement. What a pain.<br/><br/>Know for the device its self.<br/>It is ok, it is very, very slow.<br/>The kids apps are ok but some of the games and things trick your kids to being locked into the game.
 We got these tablets for our kids about 3 years ago now, and they still use them, so we've got some experience here.<br/><br/>The tablets themselves are just normal Fire 7 tablets -- they're pretty slow (navigating the UI can sometimes be really frustrating when taps take multiple seconds to register), but overall they work OK.<br/><br/>You will presumably want to use the Freetime application for kids (otherwise, you might as well just get the standard tablet rather than the Kids edition.)  Freetime is really a mixed bag.  On one hand, there are a pretty good selection of games and apps that the kids like; also, the apps don't rely on misleading and annoying advertising like most standard mobile apps do.<br/><br/>However, the freetime interface is really poorly designed, and since we're now 3 years in, I don't believe Amazon will ever be fixing it.  The basic problem is that the interface encourages kids to download tons of apps, but it makes it annoyingly difficult to halt downloads or remove apps.  The inevitable result is that they end up filling up the storage space on their tablet, and then everything stops working until I go in through the settings interface and remove some stuff.  Even that is not always sufficient, as the storage space eventually gets chewed up with "mystery" data, and I have to do a factory reset every few months.<br/><br/>It's really unfortunate that Amazon has not devoted more resources to fixing the interface side of things.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this model unless you are technically inclined enough to troubleshoot problems on the tablet (and can accept the time required to do so).
 My daughter loves this thing. It made for a great upgrade from her leap pad3 . She had been taking our phones to watch Netflix and hulu both of which you can put on this tablet. It allows mom or dad to download apps that can be accessed from the child's profile. So you can put apps that you might have on your phone onto this tablet. The free time that it comes with has tons of shows, books, games all for download. All of which can be accessed through the child's profile. My daughter figured out how to use this tablet in about 10 minutes. She had to ask for help a couple times but since then she's got it. My only complaint is that in 2 short weeks we are running out of storage space. I guess I'm going to have to buy an SD card for it or something. Besides the storage this is a great tablet for kids.
 This is a long overdue review. My almost 4 year old daughter has been using this tablet for over a year. Not only has it kept her entertained but it has helped her grow educationally as well. This tablet comes with a case that looks like it can prevent any break however, a few weeks ago my daughter came to me with a shattered tablet. None of us know what happened but as I went on the internet to purchase her a new one, knowing we couldn't live without this, I noticed that it had a 2 year warranty-no questions asked. I called amazon up and sure enough I had a replacement at my doorstep 2 days later! Not only is this the best tablet on the market but you can't find a better warranty plan anywhere. Thank you Amazon and Kindle for your awesome warranty!
 *edit for update.<br/>we continue to have nothing but problems with the child profile not downloading or opening the games. the tablet freezes frequently. I'm going to shop for an alternative. the HOURS I have wasted not he phone with tech support are not worth the continued headache this tablet provides. it's not worth the tears and frustration of my child, who this tablet was for.<br/>our FIRST tablet lasted almost a year before it began overheating and not downloading apps or opening the games. up until that point we LOVED it. amazon customer service, well, I guess it depends on who you get. they first wanted to argue about the "no questions asked replacement guarantee" and have it sent back to be "refurbished". I had to be firm with them to avoid that. the next tablet wouldn't do ANYTHING under the child's profile and after 3 hours with tech support had to be returned as well. we are now on our third tablet and so far we have only gotten a couple of error messages with a couple of the apps. my daughter is 5 and she loves to chose and download her own games. I love the parental control that gives her access to only age appropriate content. the case that it comes with is AMAZING and simple. it really protects the tablet well. would I choose this tablet for her again? probably, because of the 2 year guarantee that it comes with.
 Great tablet.  We have a Fire 7 Kids tablet for our older son and he's had it over 2 years now.  That thing has been through the ringer - dropped, sat on, you name it.  We knew when our younger son was old enough we would want to get one for him, so we did that this past Christmas.  Just like our other Fire 7 Kids, we love it.  They both have hiccups sometimes - i.e. freeze or don't work quite right.  All we do is shut them down and turn them back on.  I can imagine with the kids never turning them off and constantly changing applications that any software would mess up sometimes.  I do love that it's FULLY customizable.  We have narrowed our 3 year old's tablet to only contain about 10 shows, 20 books, and 10 games.  All are age appropriate and vetted by us, whereas our 6 year old has a lot more to choose from as he's able to do more.<br/><br/>Love these and highly recommend them.
 I purchased this for my 4yr old son and just received it today so this is my initial review and I will update after we have had more time to evaluate it.<br/><br/>Making the decision about which one to buy...<br/><br/>I had a hard time deciding which version to buy but ultimately chose this one even though it appears to cost more because of the awesome 2yr no questions asked warranty it has and the free year of FreeTime unlimited subscription with it being the kids version! If only considering the cost to buy it I could’ve saved by purchasing the regular version of this tablet (with the parental setting options I could’ve restricted just as much access as the kids version) but I would’ve had to purchase a durable kid proof case separately and the FreeTime unlimited subscription but after considering more than just the price and reading the details and doing a little research the warranty between the two don’t even compare and being that it will be mainly used by a child the chances of it accidentally getting dropped or anything happened to it is a lot more likely than if i would be purchasing it for myself and it’s nice to have that reassurance that you’re not buying something that could easily get broken and just throwing money away.<br/><br/>The tablet arriving...<br/><br/>It came packaged separately from the other things I ordered at the same time and arrived the same day and was packaged well with lots of protection. The box the tablet comes in was in perfect condition. Upon opening the box and plugging in the charger and turning it on it came charged to 75% which is nice because my son was ecstatic to get his own tablet and waiting for it to fully charge from 0% would’ve been torture to him.<br/>It was super easy to set-up, connect to wi-fi and create a profile just for him and I immediately began downloading learning apps, a few games, shows/movies &amp; books.<br/><br/>The case it comes in is very durable and I feel like they did a very good job designing it with kids in mind and to provide the best protection for it but also keeping it lightweight so that even little hands can handle it!<br/><br/>I have seen a lot of negative reviews about being limited on what apps you can get and not being able to easily access the google play store without sideloading it but trust me there is sooooooo much available to download and a huge variety I promise there’s more than enough things you will find to download and you or your child will not be disappointed!<br/><br/>You can also add a significant amount of storage to it and manage the settings from your amazon account too which is really convenient.<br/><br/>I love that even though it’s already set up for kids you still have the option to adjust the parental controls to age appropriate content! You can also limit the times they can use it as well as set limits that they can’t play games until they do x amount of learning activities and set reminders too!<br/><br/>I was second guessing whether I made the right decision in choosing the best tablet for my son but within a short time after opening it and setting it up I knew I purchased the right one.<br/><br/>He absolutely LOVES it and I am so glad that I did a little more research and didn’t let price be my deciding factor for which one to buy or let some of the reviews convince me to buy something else!<br/><br/>So far I couldn’t be happier with it! I am a huge critic of things claiming to be designed for kids when with a lot things that claim that you can tell that not a lot of thought was put into it to make it kid-friendly and it’s just a more basic version with a higher price tag because it’s a “kid-edition” but that is definitely not the case with the Fire Kids Edition! If anything I would say it has more features than the regular version making it extremely kid friendly and giving parents more control over the content their children can access.<br/><br/>If you found my review helpful please click the helpful button below. I know there’s many others like me who rely on honest reviews when making online purchases and when I see reviews that others found helpful it helps me make my decision about what to buy.<br/><br/>If for any reason my opinion of this was to change in the future I will update my review accordingly to reflect any changes although I don’t foresee my opinion changing because these are very well made, durable and a product that I would definitely recommend and would purchase again!<br/><br/>They definitely outdid themselves designing a kids version that is truly kid friendly!!<br/><br/>APPROVED BY A MOM OF 5!!
 I was super excited to get my kids these. However, after setting them up, i am disappointed in them. While the tablet itself seems great, the way they have the kids profile set up is confusing. The "HOME" tab is where all downloaded content is stored. The "BOOKS," "VIDEOS," and "APPS" tabs have downloaded and yet to be downloaded content. This is super confusing. If my kid sees an app they want to play, they click on it and don't understand why they aren't able to play it right away. And then, as a bonus, the "HOME" tab is a carrousel which kids will have to scroll through to find a certain app, which may take quite a bit of time.<br/><br/>I think it would be much simpler and allow more "Freetime" if there was a "STORE" tab for content that is not downloaded yet. And for all the other tabs to have content sorted to the appropriate tab. I have suggested this to the development team.
 Decent little kids tab. I love that they have the 2 year worry free warranty, that is an excellent benefit. Unit performs decently. It hangs fairly occasionally and / or takes longer in general to load content and apps than an iPad for example but for the price you get average performance. The MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR downside is that you can't download Google applications like YouTube Kids or Google Chrome browser on this device. YouTube Kids is my daughter's favorite app and I think it is absolute garbage that Amazon is censoring my android experience like that. Especially considering that they do not have an application availible like this in their app store. I probably would not buy this product again had I know this. Should have done more research first. If you don't care about Google applications this is a four star buy. If you don't want Amazon censoring your android tablet experience, it's probably better to skip this one.
 I bought this for a toddler (age 2.) I got this device in lieu of a portable DVD player, as they are roughly the same price and this offers much more in terms of education and entertainment. With the ability Netflix allows to download movies for offline play, and if you own or purchase blu-ray that come with the Vudu codes (or similar) you can access these too, and download them for offline view as well. This comes in handy with children!<br/><br/>More about the device. Initially, you have your own individual profile. I don't have another Fire tablet but I assume the same android-based UI/OS is the same. You have to set your kids account up, and once you do and log in to that account your child cannot get into your profile without entering your password.<br/><br/>In the child's profile, the screen is very simple. It's based around Amazon's Freetime service. Amazon Freetime is a subscription service that allows your kid to download apps suited to his or her age range (which you SET.)<br/><br/>You can also go into the devices settings (needs the initial users password to access settings) and add apps that you (adult) downloaded off of Amazon's digital store to put on your child's profile. I put Netflix on as well as a few specific educational apps.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Durable<br/>-Simple<br/>-the price is great for a device like this<br/>-2 year warranty<br/>-setting times on when your kid can play with the device, as well as total cumulative amount per day.<br/>-additionally, you can set limits on certain types of apps.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>-With freetime your kid simply taps the icons of apps and they download without any additional app, I wish you could set limitations on how many apps or have a way to turn off the ability to download apps, because it turns into a free-for-all click fest quite quickly.<br/>-Why can't I change the background of the lockscreen  on my child's profile?<br/><br/>4 stars because of freetime, and the limitations I can do as a parent with it. Specifically, blocking additional app downloads. Great price from a reputable company, but I hope to see changes in what was mentioned.<br/><br/>UPDATE 11/22/2018:<br/>This device has moved at snail speed for half of the time I have had it. With unlimited download abilities a child has for the free time apps, it slows the device down tremendously. I constantly try to clear up space but I cannot seem to do a good enough job. The case and physical state of this device is still in great shape however.<br/><br/>Now on to a disdain-fueled rant.<br/> Amazon pushes their free time service, allowing a child to download whatever apps are filtered and that Amazon deems suitable. I get it, children need a sense of autonomy. This reputable company has a CEO who is one of the richest people who have lived and yet they fail to deliver a decent device for children. I don't justify spending money on an iPad, but these fire tablets, all generations, are cheap and you do get a good deal. Why cant I find a mid-range tablet? I know myself and hundreds of thousands of others would shell out a few more dollars for a tablet that:<br/>1.) Functions properly and has decent hardware<br/>2.) Offers parents ACTUAL control instead of a facade of a profile that has Amazon's personally filtered apps, that also gives a child unlimited app downloading and a poor UI (apps that haven't been downloaded onto device show up in a fashion that appear as though they have been downloaded, no filtering or favlriting apps, etc.)<br/><br/>I understand that I can spend $100 more for a SLIGHTLY "better" camera and RESOLUTION, but my kid will watch a 30 year old VHS tape and love it. I don't think kids care about 1080p as much as functionality.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R2M1VT94GYPSVC"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1qoOXCOFnS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1UTmMXQ5US.png"/> So some small amount of credit is due, this is better than our 2016 5th Gen 7" Kindle for Kids, in that more games actually work. That 5th Gen also had a near-fatal flaw that made it useless on the road, it simply could not sign into Xfinity WiFi because it would time out due to limited connectivity before I could get through the web sign-on screen. They never did fix that horrendous bug on the 5th gen.<br/><br/>The bad news is our 7th gen starts out behaving even worse, it locks you into a loading screen when you're trying to get on a new WiFi and you're in a Kids profile. I have to turn it off to get it's attention. The good news is I can actually log into Xfinity Wifi, as long as I go directly to the Adult profile after restarting.<br/><br/>The bad news is that I have to sign onto EVERY SINGLE Xfinity Wifi. Every single one. Each location. Each home. Each store. Each restaurant. We don't have to do that with: a half dozen Androids, the last 3 Windows Phones (yes I'm going back here a few years), two iPhones and an iPad. It's one and done then all other Xfinity locations come automatically. But not the Fire 7" Kids Edition. I have to sign onto EVERY SINGLE ONE.<br/><br/>Amazon really needs to fix the WiFi sign-on to a.) not lock up a Kid's profile, b.) allow sign-on from Kid's profile (with Adult password of course), and c.) work as well with broadband account access as, well, absolutely everything else on the market for the past decade.<br/><br/>Another issue has been the PBS Kid's App, which is made up of a bunch of internal Apps and games. It stopped working for months. Then it worked again for a while. It still bombs out often. It's frustrating because my child loves a lot of the content there.<br/><br/>If Amazon fixed the WiFi account sign-on issue and the PBS kids issue, I'll change this to a 5 star review.
 I bought this tablet at best buy for my toddler because the screen from the other tablet I had for him (the PBS kids tablet from Wal-Mart) cracked. They are both the same price and in my opinion the PBS kids tablet is way better. First of all, the Amazon tablet is too slow for an impatient toddler, second of all the kids section is too complicated for him, there are so many apps and you cant filter out the ones he doesnt like as they are already pre installed.<br/>(Sometimes less is better for toddlers, it would have been alot helpful if I could install the apps and shows he likes myself!) It lets me install the videos he likes on youtube but you have to do every single one manually and individualy(since theirs a lot of apps already installed the shows on YouTube that I download on to it get lost with the rest of the ones he doesnt like). At last the tablet turns completely off BY ITSELF! With a full battery, don't waste your money, I suggest the PBS kids tablet.<br/>(On the plus side: It does have a nice big screen, it has a soft foamy durable cover, it makes it harder for them to get to the volume and switch off/on button. It has a profile for parents or older kids to use, you can add the age range for the apps, it lets you see the search history, and you can adjust the viewing time.
 But.... it has a few flaws. Listed in my update. Otherwise We love it! Its easy to use. It came programmed with my amazon. Kids apps are there like a app store with the freetime from Amazon. I just logged in and the profiles l made before were already there! Amazing! The pictures great. Switching profiles os easy. SHE LOVES IT! The easy pay option is incredible. So lm loving it too!💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕 Did l mention WE LOVE IT!<br/><br/>Update: We still love this tablet but its hard to download outside material and get it on the childs profile. Some apps like Noggin are purchused on parents profile. But cant be switched to the childs. This is maddening because a toddler cant play in my profile with my Credit Cards attached. She could purchase movies and books just with a touch. THEN.... The chaging port started to not charge. We would have to find ways to set it different positions or wrap the cord just right to get it to charge. The charger was good and we charged other devices with it to make sure. Then one day it wouldnt charge at all anymore. We are now sending it back for service. I will update again how things turn out.
 We absolutely love our kindle tablets! I purchased one for my son 2 years ago and purchased one for my daughter on prime day. These things are seriously indestructible. They have been sat on, thrown, stood on, thrown down the stairs, had liquid poured on, been chewed, etc, etc. It comes with the 2 year "no questions asked" warranty and we haven't had to use it! This is the perfect tablet for young kids!! I also love the freetime and that my kiddos can download anything they like for free. (After the one year subscription for freetime, the price is $3.17 a month). I also love how our "movies anywhere" movies can be easily streamed or downloaded to the tablets. Great for car rides! I also love that you can insert a memory card to increase the storage which is DEFINITELY necessary! Buy a memory card when you buy the tablet. Don't wait!<br/><br/>Now the things I don't like. I'll preface this by saying, I am an Apple person, so android is not something I am familiar with. This tablet is not user friendly for the grown up. I find it hard to get the settings right to enable my kids to use these without help. With every update, it seems the settings get changed and I have to figure everything out all over again. What a pain! The screen is also sometimes not very sensitive making the games hard to play. The images are not sharp and crisp. (Again comparing to iphone/ipad here). Also, on my son's tablet, the charging port is loose and really hard to get the charger inserted. My daughter's that I just purchased a few months ago is a little easier. My 4 year old son cannot get the charger in the port by himself. I also wish the battery life was longer. Again, my son's tablet (2 years old) stays charged about 3-4 hours and my daughter's (brand new) stays charged about 5-6 hours.<br/><br/>That being said, I in no way regret buying these tablets. My recommendation is to buy these for younger kids until they can learn to properly care for a tablet, then upgrade them to a more expensive tablet. One that has longer battery life and a glass screen with a more sensitive screen.
 Nice idea, and the second one I purchased.  First was about 5 years ago, and the protection from adult content and unauthorized access was dismal back then.  Bought a new one for my grandson this year after reading the promises of much better controls for the children.  He hasn't accessed adult content so far, but was able to bypass the restrictions and purchased $80.00 + in apps over a long weekend before I discovered the charges.  The digital store says they will not refund such purchases.<br/>Absolutely cannot recommend a product that basically allows unlimited purchases by little children without notifying the account holder and getting permissions.  If you buy this product, do not expect support when the built in security fails.  I spoke with two departments about this.  Certainly nice workers, but totally unhelpful.
 There are things I love about the product and there are things that I hate. I hate that my three year old can click on anything in her profile including anything in Spanish (which she does not speak) and that those sections cannot be removed. She finds something she thinks looks fun clicks on it and then gets frustrated because it’s in Spanish) I hate the memory storage. Everything you click on it downloads and the memory fills quickly and you have to go on and delete things “on this device” just for them to continue playing more. I love that she can explore videos safely because I hate YouTube and the garbage that can come up or she can click on if she isn’t heavily supervised. I do love some of the preschool games included on the device. It was a great price point for the product, however when they start to play and “download” it becomes slow. I do love that she can download some things because when we are out she doesn’t have to waste the data on our phones to play/watch downloaded material.
 So far so good. This is our 8th tablet purchase. After our 3rd tablet break we started buying the Kids versions for our 5 kids. Now I'll never go back! Love the warranty and replacement if they break them. I absolutely HATE Freetime though. I delete it immediately. It takes up a ton of storage for apps that one child puts on their tablet somehow affect the storage of another child's tablet even if they don't have Freetime? So we just do away with it right away to avoid storage issues. The 16gb is a nice starter size. I haven't really noticed a big difference in this model and the old one. The screen maybe seems a little better? Other than that, I can't tell much difference. The bumper cases are all identical to the previous generation. Love this new yellow color though.
 omg all the games are free! tons of free games. my daughter had the leap frog tablet an its so expensive to buy new games, I thought this would be the same. I was planning on buying her a new game once a week, and to find there all free! awesome! works well. both 4 year old an 7 year old loves it.<br/><br/>you do have to have it on another adult profile to use netflix though witch is fine, but a little weird at the same time. I think its so kids do not accidentally  purchase netflix if theres no account. but they have tons of free pbs kids cartoons, an if you have amazon prime all thoes are free too. an any movie you buy that are for kids on the amazon fire tv stick.
 I purchased this tablet for my daughter recently and although the tablet is still functional and my daughter is able to watch various shows on it, if you live outside the US mainland, please note that you will not have access to the Amazon Unlimited shows advertised with the tablet as well as many of the apps on the Amazon apps store that Amazon has advertised you will have access too.  Amazon who claim that they cater to international customers, doesn't allow international customers access to certain things because of geographical locations.  For example I signed up for Amazon Prime in the past and they wanted to  charge me $99 a year for only access to free shipping on certain items that I ordered.  I had no access whatsoever to the Movies or Music but they still think I should pay $99 for that.  So I cancelled my Prime membership.  That's insanity to me and I'm already getting the free shipping option on many stuff I order without the Prime membership anyway.  I'm sorry, perhaps other persons can rate this tablet as 5 stars however this tablet cannot get any more than two stars from me.  It's false advertising wrapped up in $99.
 This is the second (and third) Fire 7 kids tablet we've bought. The first lasted over two years, so we bought two more. In less than one month the charge port on one broke. I thought, no big deal, the "hassle free" guarantee will pay off. After contacting Amazon, they had me go through a few steps to attempt to reset the tablet to get the charge port to work again. I did what they asked. It took two separate phone calls. The representative wanted me to try to charge it for a period of time and then she said she would call back. She didn't call back on time. First issue. Ok, no big deal, a couple hours later, while I was going to sleep I received a call. I went back to check the tablet. No luck. She proceeded to provide me with a shipping label. It took us a few weeks to get this in the mail. We had another working tablet so it wasn't a priority. Once it was mailed, it was a couple weeks later and I tried checking on the status. The first email said they never received the tablet. I checked amazons tracking number which said it was received at least two weeks before I tried to contact them. Second problem.<br/>Now, I call. Long story short, if you wait too long (I’m not sure what period of time this is) they cancel the claim. Interestingly enough, if you mail the tablet and they have canceled the claim they simply do a factory reset and put the tablet back in their warehouse to be resold (according to Carlo A. a supervisor I talked to, more about Carlos in a moment). Now not only do they not bother telling me they received my broken tablet. They take my tablet, that does not work and they put it up for sale with no repairs made (remember, the warranty claim was canceled so there is nothing wrong with it, apparently). I find this very troubling. Carlos was great and offered me a refund for the confusion. If I would not have called and waited on hold for about 40 minutes (several transfers) I would have gotten nothing and amazon would have essentially stolen my tablet and sold it to someone else. The irony the only reason I started looking into the status of this tablet was because the other one we bought at the same time also broke. Carlos also helped me set up another warranty claim for this tablet (anyone want to buy a remanufactured tablet?). But the last, more troubling problem. I feel obligated to discuss the way they handled this situation with someone else, to be sure Amazon is aware of the very grey ethical line they are walking and potential consumer laws they are violating. Carlos refused to give me anyone else’s contact information. He insisted he is (and was) the final point of contact. I insisted to speak with someone in their ethics and compliance division. He refused again. He said answering phone calls is not part of their responsibility. I may have tried Carlos' patience as he fairly politely hung up on me. No hard feeling Carlos, but I still don’t understand how or why my feedback to a process that left me an unsatisfied customer goes unheard.... unless I write a review. Buyer beware, if you do order one I hope you don’t get my old broken tablet...
 This device was incredible. My 2 year old quickly learned a lot and exceeding his learning blocks.<br/><br/>Then someone who doesn’t have kids decided to create an update that changed the interface of the table. Instead of having a home page (of about 8 apps that your child uses often) and having separate pages for books, online videos, etc. The only homepage now has absolutely everything in one spot. Imagine a kid seeing literally 60 plus colorful little boxes and they want to click them all. They took away the favorites pages and you cannot edit what can be seen. Yes, you can change the age, and remove access to online content but it doesn’t address the issue. I’m super annoyed and disappointed because we used this tablet daily and we were able to see such growth. Now I just spend upwards of 5 minutes trying to find the educational apps we’ve grown used to in the midst of a bunch of useless videos and games.
 I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my three year old and I was really excited for her to receive it because we just started allowing her access to electronics and I knew she’d be excited to have her own device. I chose this over the Leappad we wanted because I felt this would grow with her better and because I’ve been impressed with how well my 5 year old kindle fire still works. However, this thing sucks. It is extremely slow and choppy. The couple times I’ve tried adding content it took forever to download. The experience with my toddler has been terrible because she can’t understand why it takes 5 minutes for her book Brown Bear, Brown Bear What Do You See to open. 5 whole minutes from me opening the book to it actually opening. Since we have two other kindle fires in the house, I am fairly certain it is not user error. Another thing I am not impressed with is how “other titles you might like” show up as a carousel beneath her downloaded items even with my filters set.  I have to monitor her verrry closely to ensure she doesn’t click an item to download because then the entire device is useless for ten minutes while the item downloads. I am so disappointed in this product and I’ve loved all my other kindles and kindle fires so it’s doubly disappointing that my daughter’s experience is so terrible. I am returning this device and giving her one of my old ones.
 So glad I got these !!!!  Great tablet for little Ones ( Toddlers )  Took advantage of the combo pack and ordered the pink and blue for my 2 yr old son and 4 yr old daughter . Ok so first great thing is this comes with a NO Questions asked replacement warranty - so i have piece of mind knowing that for the next 2 years this get broke for any reason it gets replace - I dont know of any other tablet for kids that offered that . Next All the Apps are free for 1 year ..Awesome Right . The apps are great and there is plenty for my 2 yr old and for my 4 year old . The only thing i say i didnt like is that there isn't a lot of storage available on the device so you will defiantly have to get a SD card .  This is a super Great Tablet for Kids !
 I'm really glad I chose this to graduate my 5 year old from her Leap Pad to a more intuitive tablet. The nice thing is that my daughter doesn't ask to play on it much as we've kept technology to a minimum in her early years.  Now that she is about to start kindergarten, we have decided to start easing her into it. My favorite thing about it is the parental controls. It's password protected, and I love that I can put a timer on it.  Right now, I have it set so that not only can she only have an hour per day (and only between 4-7 pm) but I also have it set that she has to complete 30 minutes of books before she can play any games.  I have it set to what kinds of games she can download (we try to keep it educational) and she has free access to any books she wants to read within a certain age range. She finds it very easy to navigate and really enjoys the reading time in particular. Her other favorite- PBS kids!  You can find a lot of that content within their app.<br/><br/>That being said, there are also profiles for myself and my husband that bring up the regular Kindle Fire features and internet options.  We already have our own devices, but it is nice to know that if we travel, we have the option to only take one device.<br/><br/>Lastly- The bumper on around the fire is really durable!  Overall, this was an AWESOME choice for our family!
 The device has some issues when it comes to security and parental controls. Kids edition of Amazon does not work and allow him to also access other things he wants. It's like a choice between kids fire and regular Amazon fire, so he figured out if he reboots it, the kids version is off and he suddenly had access to my full Amazon account, instead of me being able to pick the Amazon books and audiobooks that are appropriate for a 12 year old. Not sure how that happened and I guess it's fine because I trust the kid. And what haven't kids been exposed to these days anyway? I guess I'd rather him have access to adult drug and sex education materials than smutt books and fantasy or something and if he decides to peruse my psychology books, that's OK, but what happens when he's a teenager and makes some bad decisions? Does that mean he'll be ordering a few thousand dollars in video games on my account?<br/><br/>2 months and it has held up physically so gets a star for that.
 I want to give 5 stars, i do, but i can't. While the application and idea behind this product is amazing, there are a couple flaws i just can't get past. Firstly, even with the 16gb, we are constantly running out of storage. The 1-click app download is frustrating. My 3 yr old hits every single button on the screen and all those apps start trying to download at once. You can't cancel them all at once either. One. By. One. It's annoying. The space fills up quickly and then nothing runs properly. We are CONSTANTLY having issues with both tablets freezing and then my autistic son freaks out and i have to spend forever holding down the power button to shut it off, restart it, and then promptly remove everything downloaded in order to make it run faster. This, this is a problem. A major problem. One that will prevent me from ever buying these product again.<br/><br/>That being said, i LOVE freetime unlimited. The content offered is amazing. I love the time constraints you can implement as well as age restrictions for what apps and books can be downloaded. We have both the blue &amp; pink kids edition 7in 7th generation fire tablets.
 I have three Kids Fire Tablets.  All three I have had problems with the charging port.  They all stopped holding a charging cable and therefore the tablet couldn't be charged or used. The first two I used the warranty to exchanged them and they sent me two refurbished tablets...  again it happened,  I called  to get them replaced. It is to be noted that I am the one that charges the tablets and I am ALWAYS careful with plugging and unplugging but no matter what, the problem will occur.  Now two of my kids' tablets are again having this same issue and sadly the warranty is over and I will have to buy them different ones.  The tablet will not accept wireless charging and the port is made to be weak.  It is sad because otherwise these tablets are amazing for my children.  They are easy to use, I have bought apps and games, and they go well with my Alexa  echo and fire TV sticks, but they can not use them if charging port does not work and they are rendered useless.  I guess I will continue my search for good kids tablets.... because these are not it and I can NOT recommend
 I have had my son's tablet replaced twice. We originally had a 6th gen and they replaced it when the screen broke. That was the good part. We ended up with a new 7th gen tablet and had nothing but problems within months of it getting replaced. It wouldn't recognize our sd card, which was brand new. It took forever to download any content. Then it would randomly shut down. Then it began to only work when we would remove the card and still took forever to load anything. Sent it back and they said it was fixed, only to continue having the same issues. Then it stopped charging. Bought a new cable and worked for a little while and it stopped charging again. So I called only to be told it was out of warranty (from the original first tablet I bought). The warranty counts from the original date of purchase, regardless of whether you are sent a completely new device, which we had been. Aside from all the hassle, the tablet itself is SLOW. It's slow to download, slow to load, everything is slow. Freetime also does not have all kid-appropriate content even when you set the age. I do not think it is worth the trouble to buy a device, just to have it be unreliable and prone to issues.
 The kindle works alright as a tablet, but the FreeTime is the most aggravating experience of my life! It has these wonderful features that work properly, about 25% of the time. I am constantly getting error messages and have to restart it, at least twice each day. Also, the space becomes limited so quickly and I purchased two micro SD cards for my two children’s Fire’s and 98% of the apps WON’T move to the card! I’m ready to sell them both.
 My son love this,his favorite now and I even use it at times
 We have three of these tablets with the biggest memory card we could find. I’m torn on what rating to give because they’re very durable with the case however it’s very slow. Even when i thought I was buying the best possible capacity and I got the best memory cards I could find it doesn’t let me download apps it restarts it is just a very frustrating device. My husband wants to get a tablet for our fourth child and I am looking for something by apple or anything with good reviews. We are a major fan of amazon household but this is the one thing I’m not satisfied with.
 I got this for my 2 year old daughter.<br/><br/>It isn't terrible.  Compared to the first generation Kindle it's only slightly faster, which is a disappointment.  The wireless range is fairly weak, too...in fact this has the weakest wireless range of everything else I have, including the first Kindle and the newer HDX.<br/><br/>As for the OS, it's fair.  It is annoyingly difficult to add programs.  I have to sign on under my account, enter my password a few times, and hope it shows up under her account.  I can't seem to get downloaded movies to show up on the menu, either.<br/><br/>It also uses the annoying micro USB connector.<br/><br/>These issues are what cost this two stars.<br/><br/>As for the rest, she's getting the hang of using it.  She can start movies and play games on it, which speaks to the simplicity of the user interface.  While it only has the one speaker, it is loud enough to be heard without trouble, especially with the foam cover.<br/><br/>The picture is acceptable...I'm not picky, and she's less picky.  It's light and with the foam cover it's comfortable to hold for her and myself.<br/><br/>There is a huge selection of movies and games.  Some of the games appear to have in-app purchasing, which I am NOT a fan of, especially with a device aimed at children.  Most of the games are fun, however, and many are educational.<br/><br/>I haven't tried the Freetime yet...she's 2.  I love the concept.<br/><br/>The bottom line, though, is that she loves it, but she's not addicted to it.  She uses it in the car, she'll sit with it outside the bathroom while I take care of my personal business, and occasionally she'll fall asleep while music plays from a game.  Most times she's happy to go outside and get filthy...but when that's not practical, this comes in very handy.<br/><br/>I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this for a child.
 USB micro port breaks. It won’t charge anymore. Even after getting a new cord. I can’t get a secure connection to charge. My 4 yr old is so upset and is now using the iPad.<br/><br/>Challenging to use: for me and my child. He gets extremely frustrated because it isn’t very intuitive. Our other child has an iPad and it’s overall much easier. Thinking it was me I asked for pointers in a local moms group and received tons of responses echoing my issues - they all hated this tablet too.<br/><br/>We’ve had the iPad longer than this Tablet and the iPad has been easier to use &amp; more durable.<br/><br/>**Update: Customer Service called me after my review and tried to resolve the problems. They trained me on a few features to make it more user friendly which I appreciated. They had me send it in to get worked on or possibly replaced since it was still under warranty. I was so impressed and excited. We got it back and I could tell it was the same one - same scratch marks is places. The charge port wasn’t any different. Still incredibly hard to get it just right to charge. Even after being plugged in a full day it was still at 3%. I messaged customer service again but no response this time. My 4 yr old is extremely upset and we’re angry we wasted the $. Our iPad that’s much older is still working fine.
 This was a gift for my grandson.  He seems to love it. My only complaint is that I didn't want this tied to my account because it was a gift and because I was the purchaser it was linked to my account which resulted in a few games being purchased through my account.  Also I had to contact Amazon to notify them not to automatically renew and bill my account for the unlimited services after the warranty period ends.  I feel Amazon should revamp how their system handle kindle purchases and they should not automatically be assigned to purchaser's account.  These devices should be assigned to an account only after the product is registered.
 The case is great and the few times my youngest, 3 years old, has dropped it have shown no damage to case or tablet. They are sturdy and soft at the same time. I really like the case. Now onto the tablet. Previous reviews were more helpful than the walkthrough of the tablet itself. Had I not known ahead of time, from reviews, to download content I would have been out of luck when I got on the plane. I did decide to test out the airplane mode before I left home and I'm glad I did as it seemed to have had a glitch. It showed that no content was available. I restarted the tablet and it worked like a charm. However, I have had the same glitch when I switch between profiles if I leave wifi or go into airplane mode. We've only owned them for a month and this issue has happened at least 6 times. Each time a restart corrects it, but considering the price and the fact that the content is all downloaded it is an inconvenience and I worry about the durability of it down the line. As for the content, it almost appears limitless and my children, ages 3 - 9, all love the options available.
 We had previously used an Android tablet with my son with a "kid shell" app running, which allowed him to use only the apps we added to his profile. It was awesome. He had free reign within his profile and could access any of the apps we allowed whenever he wanted, switching back and forth between apps as he desired. We all loved it. But we lost that tablet. :(  So we were looking to replace it, and the Fire Kids Edition popped up on Prime Day. Seemed like a great deal and was designed for kids. Win win. I ended up pretty disappointed, though.<br/><br/>Here's my beef:<br/>- We like to restrict my son's access so that he can only use a handful of apps. He's young, and there are only a few apps that he interacts well with. With FreePlay on this Fire, you can NOT just select the apps you want the kid to access. If you want to restrict access to just a few, you have to actually disable the thousands and thousands of apps you don't want them to access. This took me several hours. If I had left all of FreePlay available to him, every time he clicked on a new app (which he would do A LOT), it would start downloading. He would get frustrated because there would be several minutes of delay while it downloaded, and I would be frustrated because he would constantly be downloading new apps, filling up the storage with apps that we didn't really want him to use in the first place. And the only alternative is to manually restrict access (one at a time!) to thousands of apps. (I did quite a bit of research to make sure I wasn't missing something. Limiting access to a few select apps seems like it should be a given feature of any kid-focused tablet. But it's not a feature of this one.)  It's ridiculous.<br/>- Additionally, it crashes a lot. There are often lags (even when using the device in airplane mode with no wifi), the user profile freezes, the home screen doesn't refresh, and the apps crash. It's not all the time, but it's often enough to be pretty frustrating.<br/><br/>We'll continue to use this occasionally (like on an airplane when I can help him through troubleshooting), but it's not something I'd purchase again.
 Bought as gift for my nephew.  I liked it myself.  He is 2 1/2.  Immediately used it.  Only complaint,  my sister is not a prime member so on Christmas Day I spent 45 minutes on the phone with Amazon to activate the advertised one-year included apps.  Embarrassing but all worked out.  Bad business on Amazon's part not to have set up as advertised.  If buy for someone else,  be warned and not get the included year free. The device was set up for 30-day free trial.  Amazon line helpful but took long time to override and set correctly.
 We own many Apple and Android devices and have four kids that are young and tech savvy.  I thought they would be disappointed by the less robust fire tablets. Thankfully the kids didn't seem to have the same hang ups about what games they play and the power of the tablet as I did.<br/><br/>We have four fire tablets and kids have played on them almost everyday for the last two months. One will no longer charge because the power port is broken. Two others are starting to get loose and you have to hold the cord a certain way for them to charge. Amazon could really improve the whole situation by making wireless charging possible. That would allow my kids to charge it without plugging in ports or touching cords at all.<br/><br/>A tablet is worthless if it can't be charged. And if that happens within 3 months, it's disconcerting.<br/><br/>Otherwise, your children won't be disappointed, until they fill up the tablet with apps and they can't download more. It is not a simple process to delete the external or even internal storage if you have multiple children because you have to login as that person to delete the stuff. They should have some sort of administrator override to delete everything but that doesn't exist at least in my experience. It is not possible to see who has what saved on what tablet. This is probably not an issue for smaller families that becomes more and more of an issue the larger your family is. Sometimes I just take out the external memory chip and delete everything using my computer.<br/><br/>Every child can log into their own account with any of the devices. This is somewhat convenient for them but not convenient for file management. It would be a good idea to have a toggle switch of some sort to determine whether one tablet can have one child only or if the tablet is available to all, or some, children.<br/><br/>Indeed the biggest selling point of these is that they suffice as tablets (and parents can log into their own profiles as well of course) and they have a great replacement policy if broken.
 My son is 2, and he's at that moment where sitting still in the car is pretty tough, so we bought him a kids Kindle Fire for his second birthday in hopes it would be easy for him to operate. It's great. We waited till it was on sale and got a promo price around $70, and seriously, it's a lifesaver. It's in a thick, almost foam like case, and even though I've seen him chew on it, the case is without marks. It looks seriously diesel, like you'd have to work pretty hard to break this table. It also comes with games and a subscription to Freetime, so he can view and read age appropriate content... it even pretends to have a dead battery when he's hit his daily preset screen time limit! he can't buy anything on it, or find, ahem, adult content online, because I was able to easily shut the browser down when setting up his profile. In short, it's a well-thought out solution to the problem of everyone wanting a magical screen of their very own, even before they're actually responsible enough to own one.
 So, I wish I had read more reviews about this product before purchasing for my kids. Apparently, the charging port is a HUGE issue. I bought each kid a tablet last Christmas and guess what broke within a few months? Yup, the charging port! Now, I have to say that I had zero issues returning it and they essentially sent me a brand new tablet all covered under the warranty (I see a lot of complaints about this but mine was painless). My daughter's tablet held out until AFTER the warranty was expired, (of course!). When I purchased these tablets the warranty was only for 1 YEAR, I see it is now 2 years, which is better. So we are now stuck with a tablet literally 1 year and 2 months old that simply won't charge but is otherwise a perfectly good tablet. I will purchase another one ONLY because of the better warranty and like I said, they are otherwise great tablets for the kids. Those charging ports, though. C'mon Amazon!
 This is the worst tablet I have ever owned! It was super slow right out of the box. I was so surprised.  Yet, I still gave it a chance.  The children’s screen has way too much going on at all times.  It is hard to understand what the app is exactly before you download it.  Is it a video app? Is it a coloring app? Who knows… It comes with hundreds of apps that look like they are “preloaded”, but they aren’t.  So when you click on each one individually you have to wait FOREVER (even with great internet speed) for it to download (not good for the patience of a toddler).  You cannot even get the YouTube app on this!  I ended up going into old storage boxes and pulling out an old 1st Generation iPad.  It works leagues better than the Kindle Fire.  In comparison the iPad seems lightning fast!  I do not suggest wasting your money on this.  I would buy a cheaper unknown brand tablet before buying another Fire.  I couldn’t start the return fast enough.
 I bought two fire tablets for my children, one had an issue so I had it replaced.  easy no problem with that.<br/><br/>the replacement  was a refurbished kid tablet with no cover and no charger.  I  could not return it easily... I was on the chat with three different people, including a supervisor.  it took a good hour and a firm hand to finally get them to take back the tablet , so I could at least get my money back.<br/>for some reason they would not let me exchange it, which made no sense....<br/><br/>So just beware, I still have one already wrapped up for Christmas that I made sure worked and I plan on buying another one at bestbuy.  If my kids were older, I would not even buy these.<br/><br/>one reason because amazon obviously knows their tablets are not the greatest and they are slow from the get go.  My husbadn figured since the kids are only 3 and 5 they'll be able to deal with these tablets.<br/>If i got myself one of these I would probably go crazy, lol
 We got this tablet for my daughter in July, and with normal use by September the metal port that the charger plugs into couldn't keep the cord in so I had to resort to taping another cord in place that was a fast charger so it would charge at all. The rate it charges is so slow normally that it wouldn't be able to get past 1% unless I used a fast charge, and then I had to push it all the way up and tape it in place. I contacted amazon, and was told they had no replacements until the end of October despite them having ones available on their site to be purchased brand new. Why they think it's acceptable to treat customers who already bought one as 2nd class citizens, and keep selling new ones to potential buyers instead of taking responsibility for their failure is beyond me. People will talk about it, and it makes them look bad. They replaced it finally, but now I have no confidence in their product.
 This is a good tablet option for a child.  It's affordable, and the case makes the tablet quite durable; this is good for peace of mind, especially in conjunction with the no-questions-asked replacement plan that comes with the tablet.  My daughter loves the kid-friendly content that's included free for a year. My only complaint about this tablet is that Amazon devices do not come with Google Play applications (including YouTube Kids).  I had to go through a convoluted workaround to install Google Play Store onto the tablet (I wanted Google Play Store because I couldn't find all of the content I wanted in the Amazon Store that comes standard on the tablet).  After doing so, I realized that the parent account/side of the tablet, which is where you have to install any Google apps, will not allow for those Google apps to then be accessible from the kid's account/side of the tablet.  This renders useless any Google apps you've added to the tablet.  Again, those apps are not accessible/usable from the kid's side of the tablet.  That means my child can't use the Google Play Store or YouTube Kids.  On a related note, the version of YouTube Kids that's available in the Amazon Store is horrible (pop-up ads galore, awful interface, etc.).  Maybe the super-techie could figure out a way to make this Google/YouTube issue workable, but with my tech skill level, I was unable to figure out how to make those apps available to my child.  Again, this is really my only complaint about the tablet.
 I gave these tablets (I bought 2) to my children (6 and 7) for Christmas. They were astonished and thrilled by them. At first, I showed them how to operate them, and now they, mainly, operate them on their own. It's easy for kids to understand.<br/><br/>Perhaps, since it was a Christmas deal, each Kindle came with Amazon Free Time included. Free Time is a free subscription for one year and then there's a monthly fee (I don't know how much the fee is). It includes lots of games and activities that my sons like. Alexa is included, though I turned that off. There are parental controls available (for example, there's a YouTube for Kids and automatic shut-down). Since I have a Kindle myself, any app my sons download appears in my email account, so I know exactly what they are playing. Each tablet includes a charger.<br/><br/>My children play with them everyday and have really become interested in electronics. The Apps store has lots of games, and many are free, so they like to add more.<br/><br/>The built-in bumper has saved their screens from damage more than once, so it relieves a lot of stress that comes with children and electronics.<br/><br/>My children are very happy with their Kindles, playing games, taking pictures and navigating a touch screen. These tablets were their favorite Christmas present.
 Everything about this tablet is just okay. The tablet is great when it works, doesn't delete profiles, doesn't delete content, and if it wasn't on the 2.4ghz Internet. Woke up one morning and both tablets didn't work. For some reason both profiles were deleted, and I had to set them up (again) via my password. I had this happen within the first week of owning these, too. So, a third setup would be a breeze, right? Setting up is a huge pain when there's an eternal blue loading screen. Had to restart both twice (at different times since the Internet is slower than the US Mail). It wouldn't let me add appropriate content via my profile, either.  As mentioned before, downloading is slow, honestly the US Mail is faster. It takes a solid 15-20 minutes for one app due to constant restarting.<br/><br/>Would I recommend? Yes, when it works and when I don't need to restart every few minutes or when it doesn't delete profiles.
 What can I say that hasn't already been said in reviews before mine? I got this for my 3 year old son for Christmas, and when he opened it he freaked out and it was worth seeing that smile on his face. To adults, the screen resolution is rather lack luster, the lack of memory is also rather bland. However, you can buy an SD card and expand the memory, so not an issue. I suggest turning off the camera if you have younger kids, as you'd be surprised how fast the storage fills up with just photos. As for the screen resolution, my 3 year old son thinks it's amazing. And that is all that matters to me. I can adjust what times he can use the tablet, which is amazing, and the option to make it so he has to read for so many minutes before he can play games or watch videos is awesome. Highly recommend this for any parent looking for something for their kids, especially younger ones. If you have a teen on your hands, go a step up and just get them the Kindle 8. They'll appreciate the default memory that comes with it, and the better resolution. One slight downside is the case that comes with the Kindle 7 Kids covers the speaker, which is located in the rear left corner. I know if the volume is low, it  makes it sound rather muffled, however at higher volumes it's not really an issue. Besides, after the fifth time in a row you hear Baby Shark, you just get headphones.
 I have been looking for something to use as a TV for my 2.5 year old. I have an old I phone that we use to watch shows like Daniel Tiger, we do not have a conventional television. The device came with a free year subscription for Kindle Free Time and I wanted to see how the device would work without it because I have no intention of paying for a subscription when the trial period ends. (FYI, you have to call customer service to disable the Free Time). Without Free Time you can not access a video series from the kids profile, you might be able to get individual Youtube clips, but you can't just pick "season 2" and watch it. If you have purchased digital movies, you can watch those, but I want to watch the things I usually have access to with my Prime membership. You can access some of the kids apps like PBS kids, but this is also not what I want. I do not want to just hand the tablet like a toy to my daughter to use unsupervised, I just want a TV that we can carry around where I can play shows and movies for her. Can I access these things in the adult profile? Yes, but there is no screen lock available (like the Apple products "Guided Access" feature). Overall it seems like a nice device, especially for the price, but it just doesn't do what I ordered it for, so I am sending it back.
 They don't last very long and they will only replace with a refurbished one which lasts even less time.  I have purchased 2 of these for my granddaughter and had them replaced 2 times each during the 2 year period.  They simply do not hold up.  The last replacement was handled with the utmost care and it simply stopped accepting a charge.  You are better off buying a different tablet and purchasing a good cover for protection.  Amazon could make a better product or they could replace with new tablets instead of refurbished.  Very disappointed in this tablet.
 First of all, the hardware is terrible. Increadibly slow and clunky.  Even when connected to fast wifi it takes forever to load every single video. The touch interface is hit or miss and the children’s OS is not intuitive at all. The screen is comically reflective too, even indoors!!<br/><br/>Second of all, the whole “Freetime” concept is very misleading, bordering on disingenuous advertising. If you buy a tablet for your kids, you want to be able to take it on the road, to a restaurant, etc. Well, the only way you can download videos to Your kid’s profile is if you BUY them. So the 1,000s of videos available via Freetime are only accessible if you have a wifi connection. They’ll say you can download videos through the adults profile and have them watch them there, but that kind of defeats the purpose of having a device made for children doesn’t it?<br/><br/>Really this is NOT made for children in any way, shape or form. Especially if you have smaller children. They’ll grab the tablet and the overlay to pause or move ahead in the video immediately pops up. Plus it’s so slow if you plan on taking this out when your baby is being uncooperative and try and soothe him/her GOOD LUCK!<br/><br/>I tried giving it a chance, but will likely return.
 Do not waste your money ! We purchased these because of the so called hassle free warranty . All 3 tablets wouldn’t hold a charge and stopped working within weeks apart from each other. I called for them to correct the issue and spent a hour going back and forth with the customer service reps . They couldn’t fix the issue and then stated they would send a replacement tablet to send ours back . We sent ours back and they sent us a refurbished piece of junk that don’t even fit in the kids case ! Therefore making this purchase pointless and a waste of money. Now you have a refurbished old tablet that isn’t set up with the kid features you paid for and don’t fit in the kid case and they said to just buy a new case ! Money scam ! They do not honor there so called warranty . Very false and misleading . Save your money and buy a iPad where they do stand behind the warranty and it lasts longer than less than a year. Awful experience . Amazon has went downhill lately . Even Walmart is better to deal with than this .
 We have 4 kids and purchased two kindles.  We are literally going to have to purchase additional kindles because the kids love FreeTime!  Unfortunately, the kindle does not allow us to install the "youtube kids" app (I guess since they have the free time mode) but that is the only thing the 3 and 6 year old miss about their other tablets vs. the Kindle Kids. I am satisfied with the purchase and we have not encountered problems with the screen interface as others report.  We did purchase the glass screen protectors to go with it and the 32 gb Amazon recommended micro sd card to be safe since some report other cards going slow.  The 6 year old has filled up the 32gb since his siblings have profiles with apps on his so I am looking at a 64 gb replacement card.  I would buy this again - especially with the 2 break policy -- for $99.00 with no additional "insurance premium" and no question return; I will take it.
 We just hit a year with the Kindle Fire in which we received the first year of Freetime free with purchase.  The Kindle worked great for that year.  Once the year was up which was 2 weeks ago we decided to cancel Freetime.  Literally the day following the cancellation of Freetime the Kindle has gone to crap.  It's constantly saying that "oops something went wrong" and my kids can't access their video's that I've downloaded.  I have to restart multiple times a day for them to get access to their video's.  I find it interesting that we've had no problems whatsoever with our Kindles.  We have two, one is 3 years old and the other is a year old.  I believe that Amazon is pushing for you to subscribe to Freetime otherwise it's a piece of junk.  I will certainly be calling since the 2nd kindle is still under the 2 year warranty but I believe it's all related to not subscribing to Freetime so I'm not expecting much.
 This is the third Kindle Fire I had to get for my daughter the first when I had stopped charging so I had to send it back it was still under warranty so they trade it out for another one the second one I had stop charging also all of this happened within a two-year span with two tablets they said that I bought the tablet 2 years ago and they were not going to warranty from the second one date they were going by the first date about the first tablet which I think is completely crazy so I had to end up buying a third tablet the only good thing about it was I was giving a discount on the tablet but other than that I feel as if they should have replace the tablet seen that it was a manufacturer problem
 So after a Kindle firmware update last September or October 2018, my kiddo can no longer use Netflix through their Kindle Free time, however a cursory search of YouTube allows all of the weird videos from the whole Eldagate scandal to be viewable. I just did a search for Peppa Pig about 20 minutes ago, and the first result was someone making a Peppa Pig themed cake. Not an episode, but someone's DIY video. There is no vetting by Amazon as to what is actually displayed. They rely on YouTube, and wash their hands of what is really displayed.<br/><br/>Kid-friendly, parent-controllable app that is competition to Amazon's lackluster streaming library for kids? NO ACCESS FOR YOU!<br/><br/>Nearly unbridled access to YouTube with autoplay, a web service that allows kids to view age-inappropriate videos that pass through YouTube's lax filters? Sure, why not!<br/><br/>Amazon still gets paid either way.
 Bought two of these and BOTH needed to be replaced after a few months because the charging port stopped working. AFTER they were replaced it didn`t take long before they were doing the SAME thing and are now worthless again because they won`t charge and I no longer have the option to return them. I am starting to loose faith in products by Amazon.<br/> UPDATE I found out that these are still under warranty and I would like a refund as I already bought new tablets from a different company, but amazon has made communication impossible. They obviously are trying to avoid the problem until the warranty expires.
 I had an old Kindle I used for my son to watch videos on when we had a weekly drive to Grandmas. It’s a long trip so I let my two kiddos veg out for the drive. That’s my only purpose for their Kindles so I can’t attest to much else besides the fact that I know that the Android app market sucks compared to the apple market for apps. Well anyway my sons kindle broke so I needed a new one. I decided to get the kid friendly version this time. And I ended up returning it!<br/>The speed on this thing is sooooo incredibly slow.  Not sure if it’s because it has extra programming on it that makes it kid friendly or what but it took forever to get it running with updates needed immediately when I opened it. Couldn’t figure out how to download shows on it from my prime account and every time I tried to go back to the home screen it took forever. I had it one day and I am sending it back. Already bought the regular fire.
 I bought this at the recommendation of a friend who has a pre-schooler using one. Let me start by saying, I've used an Apple device for the last 10 years and this tablet was like greek to me. It's not intuitive for parents right out of the box and took a fair amount of learning for me to understand how games, books and video's are played/stored/downloaded. It only took 1 week of her playing to max out the storage and we had to delete things. It doesn't come with instructions at ALL and I had to locate resources online to assist me. The battery life is pretty terrible, it's very SLOW so my child often gets frustrated, the charging port is small and difficult to get the plug in the right direction. There was so much hype over the parental controls, FreeTime and parents dashboard...but it was really not so extravagant. Kinda bummed!
 This tablet is fantastic! It's user friendly system is easy to setup, if you understand an android based phone you can run this tablet no problem. And probably even if you arent an android user it's still very easy to setup. My 2 and a half year old loves thus tablet. We are able to monitor the content she sees as far as apps, books, and videos go. The free time unlimited with Amazon is amazing! We enjoy doing jigsaw puzzles, reading books, watching educational videos, and learning on our tablet. We are able to restrict the amount of screen time our child has by setting up the tablet to turn off after a certain amount of time. (Allowing the parent not to be the bad guy) this tablet is extremely light weight and a perfect size for our little ones hands. Love this tablet and have nothing negative to say about it. Thank you Amazon!
 The Case: The case is fantastic. It's perfectly molded to the tablet with all surrounding ports/buttons accessible. The foam is hard enough to withstand being dropped or dare I say, flung accidentally. It's ergonomic and comfortable to hold and handle. The material is smooth enough to be wiped easily, but not shiny and prone to cracking like some coated foams are.The edges are raised just enough so that if it falls, the screen is protected. I like the bright colors available. They are perfect to aid in distinguishing which one is for which kid. It feels secure so that I don't have to worry about it being removed by the kids.<br/><br/>The system: While I do love a product made especially for children, I wish it didn't come with all the pre-loaded apps and icons like the newspaper or other standard ones that come with "big people" products. Simplicity is best when it comes to kids' products. I docked 2 stars due to the hard time I had trying to figure out how to separate two accounts for two kids. I have two tablets and one account. I noticed that both of the tablets will say the same child is logged in as "child's" 2nd fire despite 'adding a child'. I also haven't figured out if it's possible to use the apps without wi-fi. So far it seems that I can't and this is really inconvenient while we're away from home at places without public wifi.
 We bought two of these for our boys around 2015 and they worked awesome for a couple years; had to replace a battery in each, but aside from that, no issues. They stood up for a couple years, to their torture and I didn't hesitate to replace them with the same tablet when they died. So in June/July we replaced the older models:<br/>Replaced 1: June 2018, September 2018 (which would not connect to wifi), October 2018<br/>Replaced 2: July 2018, August 2018, December 2018<br/>I'm not sure what happened between 2015 and 2018, but it was not good. Luckily they are under warranty, but kids don't really care about under warranty, they want to play on their tablets and keep the rewards they have earned in the games they play ... but what can you do ...<br/>If they weren't under warranty I'd move on to something in the Android family, but since they are free to replace ...
 I was surprised to see so many negative reviews on the warranty of this product. We got our original fire kids tablet in 2016 and after 2 years of being well loved it stopped charged suddenly. Luckily I logged in to my amazon account and found I was within 3 days of my warranty period and quickly contacted Amazon. They had me try a few trouble shooting tip and when they were unsuccessful they told me they would move forward with the repair or replacement process, no questions asked! I shipped my device to them and they quickly let me know my device could not be repaired so they would be spending me a new one. I was extremely impressed at how easy it was to get my device replaced. Now as far as the tablet, my kids love this tablet, the only problem is we only have one of them and the two kids fight over it! It is packed with fun content and the free time app is so kid friendly. I have a 3 year old and a 5 year old and this tablet is a family favorite!
 i really liked this when i first got it but after giving it a solid chance over a month i’m returning it and getting another tablet.<br/>These are the issues i had.<br/>1. even with limiting the age filter to only 2 years old, there were thousands of chooses that overwhelms my 2 year old.  she couldn’t find her favorite apps or videos.  it doesn’t show what has or hasn’t been installed so she’ll click pictures and be upset that it takes forever to load.<br/><br/>2. YOU CANT INSTALL ANY GOOGLE PLAY APPS.  my daughter LOVES  Dave and Ava and i love it’s learning format.  even after i installed the app through third party software i could only get it on the adult profile and can’t transfer it to the kids profile.  this is the same for YOUTUBE KIDS .  which is the most popular kids app.<br/><br/>3. it’s wayyy to slow.
 You cannot beat the value of this tablet with the deal that was going on when I bought one for my son. $99 with a year free subscription to free time unlimited and a two year no questions asked replacement guarantee. Those things alone make it worth a hundred bucks but they also let me pay $20 down and pay the rest off at $20 a month which was incredibly helpful for me being on a tight budget and trying to put a birthday party together. The tablet runs great and there is so much content on it that he never gets bored with it. It comes with a bumper case so it doesn't get too banged up and we've not had to use the replacement guarantee yet in the 6 months we've had it. It has an offline mode which is helpful if you have limited data and don't have an extra SD card. We have unlimited data and could really use some extra storage space because he fills it up fast and I have to clear it by doing a one tap archive thing that pops up on it when the storage is low. The free time unlimited is really just a user profile that you can't get out of without a PIN number that the parent sets up. You can exit out of the kid profile and everything looks like a regular fire tablet and you can download content onto the parent profile and then share it to your child profile if you have an app or game or media that you want them to have access to but isn't available in the free time kids profile. I can't complain at all about it and am very happy with the purchase.  I know that software is an ever-evolving thing so it may get these things later on but two things I would hope for in future updates is custom lock screen for the free time profile instead of only being able to customize the adult profile and I hope they improve on the offline mode because usually it only shows half or so of the icons for the content that's saved on the tablet and there are things that show up in the storage when you go back manage it that show they are on the tablet and on the child profile but when you go to offline mode they aren't there you you have to search for the missing things when you have internet access and click on them and then go back to offline and they will show up without having to be downloaded again. Same thing with the favorites section..some will disappear from the favorites section but then you'll randomly see one with a littl heart pop up in one of the recommended apps and game feeds.
 I am very disappointed with the returns process for this "no questions asked warranty" item.  I notified Amazon days ago that this tablet overheats and constantly crashes while being used by my son, and no one has called back as promised to set up the replacement.  I have had great experiences with Amazon, but they need to change the way returns for this tablet are handled.  As it is currently, the "no questions asked" is a straight up lie.  I was asked many questions and still have a defective tablet.
 These are always perfect. Pop in a 32 mb SD card in the side and Kerri them as distress for when your kids break the HD 8" ones they all received from their grandma with inferior cases at Christmas. Always good to have a backup...<br/><br/>The fact that I hit treo if then in a bundle and that they have a 2-year no questions asked return and replace guarantee makes them a no brainer. Unless they see an ipad. They you're kind of screwed... I was able to Kerri my kids on kindle and cheap go ladies for the past few years- My 5 year old got her first kindle when she was 2- the 6" hd they don't even make anymore (but write, my hands wish they did!)  She can't read our write very much yet and that is the requirement for her to get a laptop like her two older brothers.  Her brothers got them... Probably for our homeschool so 4 years ago?  Proceeded by laptops the following year (they also pay half... )
 My boys are 10 and 13 and they loved their Amazone fire tablets which held up over the yrs. My now 13 yr old took his durable case off when he got to the age he thought he was too cool for it. At that time the tablet had been loved for yrs and held up. But then he dropped and shattered the screen. So i do recommend the durable case. My 10 yr old continues to use his tablet amd has gotten yrs if use and he loves it. So i knew when my husband really wanted to get my 3 and 6 yr old step daughters tablets for Christmas that i would look for these. This time i got to get pink ones and super excited that they will also get yrs of use out of a high quality kids tablet! I also purchased a pink and a purple cat ear case with the carry handle and legs because they will love these and be able to know whos is whos. We will also use the pink included amazon casr as it is more durable for travel. We are looking for personalized labels for these. I would recommend expanding the color line to include maybe lime green dark blue hot dark pink and purple etc. For families with multiple kids know its nice to know which child owns the toy or item in case it breaks or fights ensue lol. Or an optional customization to add their name to the case would be fun with a fave charactrr maybe. Just some ideas. Overall wr love these and they are durable and high quality and the kids will be super excited!
 This product is a piece of crap and it is so disappointing. I really expected more. I bought this table for my daughters birthday in August, she absolutely loved it. When it does work the parental controls on it are amazing. By November the tablet stopped charging. It wasn't a big issue as they offer a replacement but still upsetting as it was only 3 months old. They sent the replacement fast and all was fine, for about a month and a half when the replacement did the exact same thing and just would not charge no matter what. My daughter has been super upset since. There is some kind of USB port issue with these tablets that needs to be acknowledged and fixed. We used the charger that came with it, and it always sat on the counter while charging. My daughter is only 4, so it was always plugged in for her by an adult. For the $100 I spent on it and it having to be replaced every other month I am rating a 1 star. Would not recommend,  will not purchase again. I tried to reach out to customer service about the second one doing the same thing and never heard anything. Keep your $100 and find something better.
 I love these.  They are sturdy and can handle usage by two little ones. I love the trial Freetime that comes with it and will use it after it expires.  There are many different parental settings, the games are educational and fun. I do not have to worry about what my kids are doing on them. I have them set to turn off at a certain time and my kids have learned that's when to start their bedtime routine.  It's actually made bedtime less stressful for everyone. I can use them when I want with the regular set up on my profile. 10 STARS of I could!
 Amazon just updated the Freetime App to make it essentially the same as the Prime Video UI. Which replaces icons with text descriptions for all of the categories. (So instead of a TV Set icon for videos, the child sees things like "Movies &amp; TV You Might Like"). Which makes the user interface UNUSABLE for kids who cannot read!<br/><br/>My daughter discovered the update yesterday (it was automatically installed yesterday), and was in hysterics for two hours last night, crying "Daddy, I Can't Read!"<br/><br/>So Amazon's goal is to be the most customer-oriented company ever? Really?<br/><br/>BEWARE!
 Pretty awesome little tablets. My girls love em... only major disappointment is that the internet explorer for the kids is completely useless. I have read many posts in regards to the explorer's condition and to my knowledge there is no fix. Some people have said the kids internet works fine, then others say it doesn't work at all. Just luck of the draw I guess. I wanted the kids internet to work, because we wanted to use the pads for the kid's home school website. I will just have to log into my profile on the tablet, whenever the kids need to work on their school work I guess. Otherwise, its a great tablet, and is far superior to leap pads.
 Overall we love the kindle. Our son is able to have control of games and independence in how he's entertained.<br/><br/>Kindle continues to have problems with charging ports. We purchased this just a few months ago and it is no longer charging. It's great that Amazon is willing to replace them -- that's important. I would move to another product if they weren't able to replace them immediately. Since they do we will stick with the Kindle and hope they make improvements.<br/><br/>There are some software improvements I'd like to see in the kids profiles. Overall there should be improvements on storage management. It would be nice, as a parent, to limit the number of applications or put a lock on downloading applications from time to time. He fills up storage quickly because he just clicks on whatever he thinks he might like. This is a problem created by very good to great content that he wants to explore (so it's a good problem to have). Some sort of messaging would be great as the kindle battery gets to 15 or 10%. "Hey kiddo, you're down to 10% battery. Let a big kid know you need a charger." Although I'm sure it is much much harder to do trying to weed through content to eliminate non-age appropriate items.
 1) Battery barely lasts and the item is brand new. 2) Takes forever to turn on. 3) Takes forever to load apps. 4) Not easy to figure out how to load apps for youths when you are not online. This can be done but make sure you do it well before its time that you need the unit to be working offline. That's all I can think of for now, but honestly how much more could there possibly be to this to like it less.<br/><br/>Update: Changed my review to a 3-star. I spent a while on the phone with a customer service representative who helped me do some updates and some other things to help the Kindle work a little better. It's kind of ridiculous that a brand new item needed to have updates in order to work, but that seems to be the way things work with computers. Since then it has been working a lot better. Definitely not a long battery life item, but that's just the way it is nowadays. My granddaughter loves this Kindle to the point where my daughter went out and bought her one to keep at their house. She is not quite 3 years old and has mastered figuring out how to turn it on and how to get into the games that she loves. It still takes a long time to turn on if it's been powered completely off and takes a long time just to load free time. Once you get free time open it still takes a long time to load some apps. None of that stops her from loving this item though. That is why my review has changed to a 3-star.
 When I became tired of my toddler abusing my phone and was too afraid to share with him ipad pro I decided to find a better alternative. After comparing all tablets suitable for children I decided to get Kindle for Kids. My, then 2.5 yo son figured it out right away and the tablet became a life saver. He didn't care much about the Amazon Freetime (he was too young for games and the choice of movies is very limited), but you can download your own games, videos and other apps, although you have to first do it to parent's account and then enable in child's account. The tablet went through a lot of abuse yet the case did an excellent job protecting it for over a year until one day my son accidentaly dropped it and the screen cracked. Every day it broke more and more until pieces of glass started coming out and it was time to take the tablet away and contact Amazon about the promised warranty. From the moment I dropped off the broken tablet at the UPS store it took literally 3 days to receive a brand new one!, and only because the delivery person made a mistake for which Amazon issued a credit! The new tablet already came preregistered, with all the data restored. So, my experience with this tablet and Amazon, just like always, was excellent. This time I'll order screen protector though, and another case (the one with a handle/stand). I have to mention that with first tablet the charger broke quite fast but its the same as my older Samsung phone so we had plenty of those chargers around the house and there was no need to replace tablet. But, a few months ago, my sister did that with her daughter's Kids Kindle Fire and she also received a new tablet.
 Bought two of these for toddlers ages 18 months and 3 years. We love them and they love them. They are so durable, the boys have jumped on them and dropped them indoors and outside and they keep on going. I like that you can set up individual profiles and lock them down.The selection of apps included in the FreeTime Unlimited one year subscription is great.<br/><br/>My only caution is to set a firm limit on screen time and stick to it. It can be easy to use the screen time as a occupier. We allow them about 1 hour a day screen time and it is usually guided with the little one to work with him on learning games. The 3 year old has a set of favorite learning apps and he only needs an occasional "show me" to learn new stuff but his screen time is directed as well to learning games. The other go to time is during long car rides and they have been a good calming tool for the 18 month old who has always hated car rides.
 We bought this tablet for our two year old.  We will be travelling soon through multiple states and needed her to stay somewhat occupied.  Although this will not be the only form of entertainment we really wanted something that we could play movies on, and YouTube on for her.  The biggest selling point was that the case came with the tablet.  Plus the warranty.  I read a lot of reviews saying these tablet last a long time.  So we bought it in Hope's that we wont have to buy another tablet for her by the age of five or six.<br/>The tablet arrived in an amazon box with the air filled bags around it, then it came in it's own little box that was orange and looked fancy.  We ordered the yellow tablet since we like more unisex things.  I took a picture of how thick the case is because my husband was very shocked and pleased to see how thick the padding is.<br/>I gave only four stars because I cant seem to figure out how to make shortcuts to downloaded videos.  For example, I downloaded Blippi videos but I cant find them on her homepage and that's kinda upsetting.
 We like this so far, I love that the case is thick and seems durable (so far) like it’ll protect the tablet if dropped/thrown. The volume buttons/on-off buttons are easily accessible on the side even with the case on. The only issues I have with it is that it’s kind of confusing if you’re not used to android like technology.<br/>The iPad plays pretty loud when turned all the way up, it was easy enough to set up.<br/>You can’t go on regular websites which we like for our kids to keep them protected. I think if you’re going to get a tablet/iPad/screen toy for your kid this is the one you should go for.<br/>It charges fast, you can set a passcode for everything, and parent control everything on the tablet as well.<br/>Amazon offers a payment plan which makes it an affordable option for everyone
 I really wanted to like this tablet. The 2 year no questions asked warranty is what sold me, BUT... You cannot get kids YouTube on this tablet. Disney, Disney Jr. are not available anymore, AND freetime is great but you literally have to download every app, book, game, song etc... that free time offers, which kills the space FAST!! I wound up giving my son my Note 5 since it had a kids mode that I can put his favorite apps on. Plus this tablet is glitchy. I have a strong Wi-Fi connection and it took forever to download a few apps off the kids side. Then they wouldn't work or froze when we got into the car even though we have Wi-Fi there. I should of listened to the majority of reviews that said this tablet was a waste of time. For some reason even though it's connected to Wi-Fi and in the settings it shows an excellent connection, it continues to act like there is no Wi-Fi. It's too late to send this back so I guess I'll call Amazon and see if they can send another tablet even though it will more than likely run just like this one.
 So far I love this tablet!  I got it for my son for his first birthday which is not until November, but now we will have something for him to do when we travel.  He is pretty good in the car without something, but sometimes he just gets a little bored and a bored baby while traveling on vacation is not a great situation.  I haven't looked into everything but I love the free year subscription and the fact that it has a two year anything protection plan.  The case that came with it is great but will buy one that has a handle when he is around 2 years old.  It is the best value that I could find and I got it on Deal Day so it was $30 cheaper.  I love the size of this for him, but if you are getting for a teenager, get the 8 inch.  This was one of the best purchases I have made!
 These are not as "safe" for youngsters.  First off, an adult has to choose which Fire Tablet it is, if you have multiples.  Then, once you chose it, you have to wait for each thing to download AGAIN.  No matter how many times it downloads, either to the tablet or the additional storage, you can't just hand the tablet to the child and off they go.<br/><br/>Also, the "home" page has lots of stuff on it EVERY time.  You cannot make this easy for younger kids.  And they get frustrated in the amount of time they have to wait to do just one thing.<br/><br/>If it is truly "kid safe", then it should be "kid easy" too.<br/>Very disappointed.  I was hoping to set these up for the grandkids (very smart 5 and 7 year olds), but they aren't very excited about using them often.<br/><br/>Even on sale, if knowing this, I wouldn't have purchased them.
 My daughter loves playing on this tablet, however the screen turns black whenever she plays an app which sends her into temper tantrum mode. It worked great for about 24 hours, then this problem started and kept getting increasingly worse.
 I’m disappointed in this device.  I bought this for my 2 year old.  Mainly to play nursery rhymes and read him books while in the car or before bed.  However, I have yet to find (despite hours of research) if I’m able (and if able, how) to lock the screen so that if he is holding it (like in the car) that he doesn’t stop the video.  I read there was a screen lock and thought perfect.. but come to find out that’s just to lock it so the kid can’t use it.  I want to lock it so that it plays a video without my kid being able to touch the screen and stopping it....  I would have just kept playing YouTube videos on my phone for him if I knew there wasn’t a way to lock it so he couldn’t interrupt it.  It’s useless at this stage.  I think it’s be better for interactive kids.  A bit older most likely
 The tablet is awesome but the setup for a child is horrible.  It was a gift and I didn't want it to sync to my amazon account but it wouldn't allow just a plain setup without a linked account.  I had to create an email account via gmail, create an amazon account and put in a credit card number (thank goodness I had a visa gift card) to set the tablet up.  Seems like a tablet designed for a child should allow free downloads from a specific location but if you want to purchase something then ask all those specs.  Very frustrating and many hours on Christmas just so the child could enjoy it.  BTW I purchased this one over other child tablets since they could grow with it and get more advanced learning games in the future.
 I’ve had this tablet for a while. My son loves it and I did too, but for the past few months he has been getting this message “oops something went wrong”. I can see a lot of people are having the same issue.  It didn’t not start out doing this. It’s something that shouldn’t be happening, im guessing there is a glitch, but they need to fix it. Its apparent that a lot of people have complained about it and yet nothing has been done. If you have not purchased this item I would advise not to, at least until they decide to fix the issue. It makes it hard for the kids to actually enjoy the tablet if you have to constantly turn it off and on to get rid of that error message. The tablet is full of entertainment as well as educational apps and such. He has learned a lot and it keeps his attention.  I can say that is a plus to the purchase. When it does works, it’s great. But the problem is actually getting it to work and continue working... At this point I kind of wish I could return it
 I've been buying kindle kids edition for several years, each time upgrading the memory. They are great and we use them every night taking advantage of free time and all the great content that it offers. However, it is time for a hardware and software refresh. The devices simply are not keeping up with the times and demand of new content. Also, the device continues to fill up to capacity and removing applications manually is time consuming and tedious. You cannot beat the price, so I feel bad about the complaint, but I've been left wanting more from the Kindle for the last 3 iterations. I was really hoping for a better experience this last upgrade but found the same tired interface and lackluster performance. The experience is frustrating even for a 4 year old and im left wanting for faster processing and more dynamic content management. There is no equal, but if you can wait for new specs I'd highly recommend waiting on this purchase.
 I like that I can set daily time limits for my kids so that I don't have to keep track of how much screen time they are getting.  The tablet just locks them out when their time is up so there is no arguing.  One feature I REALLY wish it had:  An easy way to extend the time limit without changing the settings.  In other words, if I decide I want to let my child have an extra 15 minutes to play her game, I would like to be able to just enter my password and select "increase limit by 15 minutes just for today" or something like that.  As it is, if I want to give my child extra time just for today (because, say, we're taking a long car trip or I'm giving extra screen time as a reward), I have to change the daily time limit settings.  Then the settings stay that way until I change them back.  I would rather have the option to change it temporarily.<br/>The games are okay but don't expect a lot of educational content from the Free Time subscription.  The eBooks are also not that great.  They are mostly what I call "TV books:"  Books that are based on Disney and TV characters.  There is not much quality children's litereature, in my opinion.<br/>Overall, though, this tablet is what I would expect for the price.  It's not perfect but I do like the parental controls.
 I recently bought my second Amazon's kid's tablet. FIrst of all, it is the same as the adult one, but this comes with one year of the subscription to the kids' software options, which you will start to be charged for after the first year. You can cancel it, but you have to do some serious digging on the website to find the link to cancel. Makes sense, they don't want to make it easy for you. I do want to caution that if you are buying this because you have the option of getting a replacement tablet if/when you have problems don't expect this second tablet to be as good as the first. Although it is not clearly mentioned anywhere, I'm guessing this is refurbished. My son's second tablet seemed to be fine for a couple of months, but it wasn't more than 3 months later that it wouldn't charge. At all! So I ended up having to get a new one. I even tried to trade in the 3 month old tablet for a pathetic $5 and it was rejected because the tech assessors said the tablet was defective. It is rather insulting that they offer you a free replacement, no questions asked, and only deliver a defective item that might last you a couple of months at best.
 The idea is really good but the execution could be better. Not all apps are SD card compatible so the tablets were consistently low on storage which makes them run slower, or not at all. The kids are able to download apps without a password, so with toddlers download EVERYTHING available, a password there would be nice. We thought taking them off the internet would stop them from downloading, but then the tablets only worked some of the time. It’s good that they are set to stay in the Freetime unlimited so they can’t access other things, but sometimes Freetime can be glitchy. Sometimes apps just wouldn’t work for no explainable reason. The battery life wasn’t very great, and they took forever to recharge. I love that you pay a subscription and then have access to apps that you’d normally have to pay for individually. That’s a great idea. The IT support was not very great either. At one point we were told there was no solution to the issues we were having with the tablets. Overall, it was not a very good experience.<br/>We ended up returning the fire’s and getting refurbished iPads.
 I bought this tablet for my 2 year old daughter so that she could stop running off with my phone all the time. It was definitely worth it. The kindle store is a little limited but it does the trick. My daughter loves all the apps and games on Freetime. &amp; I love being able to limit what she does and keep an eye on everything. Also this has to be one of the sturdiest tablets ive ever seen. It has literally taking a beating at my house and it still works amazing and you cant even tell its been stepped and jumped on and thrown halfway across the house. If it can withstand my daughter who is going through her terrible 2 stage I would say it is definitely worth the price.
 We bought two of these for a discount a week before Thanksgiving, one for our house and one for our daughter's house, for our granddaughter's 2nd birthday. We ended up giving it to her a week early on Thanksgiving. She is absolutely obsessed! She watches Netflix and she plays abcmouse on it, downloads kid friendly educational apps on her own (they come preloaded with access to a ton of kids apps), and she loves the coloring book apps. She has to have it for car rides now and she doesn't even mind the headphones we got her (this child hates anything over her ears or on her head). One huge selling point on these is the warranty. 2 years no questions asked and they will fix or replace it? Who does that? Nobody but Amazon, that's who! The rubber case is so great for little hands. She has no problems picking it up and carrying her tablet around. The parental controls make it so that you must download the extra apps (that aren't already set up as accessible kid friendly apps on the tablet) under your parent profile and then give permission to share them with the child profile. This keeps them from downloading apps they shouldn't. You can set time limits for your child as well. You can have more than one child profile on each tablet which is great if you have multiple children but only one tablet. This has been well worth the money!<br/><br/>Now, the downsides. We have only been using it a short time and already the screen has frozen a few times. No biggie really, just hold the power button for 40 seconds and then power it back up. I do restart the tablet a few times a week but I may need to start doing it daily. The battery life is horrible. Because it is always connected to wifi the battery drains very quickly. She only gets about 3 hours of play time on it in a single charge. That might be ideal for those parents that limit time because their child sits on the tablet non stop but for my grand she will be playing with her kitchen or coloring on her desk while having a movie or music playing on her tablet. And it takes FOREVER to charge! No fast charging on any of the ones I've seen.<br/><br/>All in all I give it 4 stars. If the charging was faster or the battery life longer it would get more stars. But I wouldn't let that stop me from purchasing this thing, in the end you really can't beat it.
 This tablet started acting poorly a few weeks ago. It wouldn't repsond to the touch screen periodically. Then the battery died and it refused to charge. The entire product is dead and won't charge regardless of which charger we use. So I called because , "If it breaks, we will replace it, no questions asked..." I am currently on the phone with them, being passed from person to person. Each person has a different response, none of which is "We will replace it as the guarantee says." And as far as "no questions asked....we are being asked a million questions." We were told they could offer a partial refund. We were told we were past the return date, even though we bought it this year. We were passed to technical support who asked us to "trouble shoot." So we tried to trouble shoot a device that is dead to the touch. Currently back on hold...it's been 45 minutes. Now someone is back on asking us to describe, for the millionth time, what is going wrong with it. "2-year worry-free guarantee: if they break it, return it and we'll replace it for free. No questions asked" Unfortunately, it's a total lie.
 For the 40-50 days my kids have had these tablets, the software would constantly error and not allow the use of books without a restart. Once restarted, the tablet would only error again requiring a reboot and that is after 1 or 2 books being opened. We do not use the tablets for games or videos. Only books. Whenever I mention these tablets, my kids would cringe like its some sort of torture. Needless to say, we went back to paper books. I lost quite a bit of trust in Amazon products after this experience. I do give 1 star for the thick case though. We had a throwing contest with these tablets and we tossed these tablets dozens of times, sometimes 30 ft in the air and the cases protected the tablets every time. Excellent case. Too bad these cases had something worthy to protect.
 I gave my Mom (aka Grandma) the OK to get the Kids Kindle for her birthday. Prime Day came along and my Mom hopped on and ordered the cheapest one. The Kindle 7. The device is OK but the battery is terrible. My daughter has 2 hours of time each day and it usually dies after 2 to 2 1/2 days. Thats 4 to 5 hours of use, while sitting doing nothing on wifi. It drains with no use after a few days.<br/>THE HEADACHE I have GONE THROUGH to get this replaced is ridiculous. I LOVE Amazon. Amazon Store Card holder and Prime member but I can not get this exchange for the Kindle 8 while only paying the $20 difference. It's only $20 (or $30 if not on sale) difference but the battery life is supposed to be longer. Try that one! It also should be faster...<br/>Honestly, I'm not a big fan of the Kids Kindle format. It is not very user friendly for the adults to add content but I do know that it locks down the kid as a user.
 This tablet is a replacement / backup tablet for my son who is on the spectrum w/ Autism; he's has had this one since it first came out (2015-2016); this was a tablet we wanted to try out w/ him prior to buying an expensive I pad..The Amazons Fires are the way to go..trust me we have tried numerous kid friendly tablets that don't stand a chance / compare to Amazons. He has 3 now -This 5th generation, The new HD 8 / 7th generation &amp;  now an I pad too! We keep this one around as his backup tablet but he honestly prefers the newer one; HD 8 / 7th generation (2017-2018) model; screen is bigger, 32 GB compared to 16 GB and honestly, the battery last longer &amp; has Alexa on the latest version. His I pad is more for learning w/ Autism apps &amp; not play; but I highly recommend The Amazon Fires for learning, play &amp; safe browsing prior to transitioning to a more expensive device / in addition.<br/>*I would recommend this particular model / tablet for beginners* but recommend newer version for advanced / experienced children*
 The kids edition is great because it comes with a cover and with the kids unlimited. However, the set up process was not intuitive nor was I able to locate a set of clear step by step instructions. For example I thought everything was set up and a few books and apps downloaded. But the next day when I was at a meeting where the kindle was supposed to keep my son occupied we discovered there were additional steps that required WiFi access. Using my phone as a hot spot didn’t help. The other issue that I have is that the password to get to my sons profile is the same as the one to get to my parent profile. And he now goes to my profile because he doesn’t have to read any books to play the games. I must be missing something but as an intelligent person with an MBA, I wouldn’t think this should be do difficult especially since I own two other kindles.
 Great kindle so far. Setup was easy and it's super cute. The 2 yr warranty is nice, but the 1 yr freetime I'm super frustrated with. Research it before you get too excited. While it is a great value, there isn't an option to only show 'chosen' items. The kids can always see all the available options. And while they're free, I don't want my kids downloading a million apps-or even having some of that apps that are on there. I'd love to be able to choose which items show up on the kindle from a 'freetime store' or something like that....hopefully in the future.<br/><br/>Also, we received the kindle and the external speakers didn't work. It also seems to shut off randomly or close out of games randomly. Amazon already sent out a new one, but super irritating for the kid who get this one instead of the good one :(.
 I bought 3 of these tablets for my 3 kids for Christmas.<br/>At first the tablets were amazing and my kids loved them. I didn’t have to worry about them dropping the tablets and breaking them.<br/>Things started going wrong with these about a month after they started using them. Which they didn’t start using til Christmas Day. Even after my kids downloaded the apps for free time they couldn’t play them unless connected to WiFi. So taking them on car trips with us was pointless.<br/>Now it’s the end of February and the battery charging port is going out on all three tablets. I ignored the reviews I read during the purchasing process because I figured these types of issues would have been fixed by now. Clearly they are not.<br/>They are a waste of money. The only thing I can do with them now is reuse the cases with the Samsung tablets I originally wanted to order.<br/>Do yourselves a favor and spend a little extra money on something like Samsung that will last longer and have more use outside of WiFi range.
 Bought for my great grand daughter &amp; she loves it! She is now 6 (was 5 when I purchased) &amp; has it with her at all times when not at school. She uses it to watch cartoons &amp; to play games even some learning ones her mom slipped in lol. I had bought one before &amp; she broke it before a year was up so when the kids version went on sale I bought it! It is well worth the price since it has a 2 year no matter what warranty. That bumper is a life saver since I know it has been dropped several times. For a younger child this is perfect. The warranty means that for two years you don't need to worry because if it is broken in any way it will be replaced &amp; the bumper case keeps anything but a direct hit to the front from cracking the screen. I really think this will make it to past the two year mark! Very pleased!
 This is the second Kids' Fire Tablet I've purchased for my 2 grandsons. The 6-year-old uses his for games and to read stories. The 3-year-old got his this holiday and loves playing games and using numbers and words. The parents like the Control Feature that tells the child that Time is Up for Today.  Since the tablet sends the message, it's not a parent taking away the tablet! I bought different colors so the games/books are age appropriate and there is no question who owns which tablet.
 Okay, we bought this for our 2 year old daughter because we have a few road trips coming up this year. We tried to cancel the order after reading reviews (which not reading reviews are actually unlike us) but we waited to long and it shipped. We got it with the intention of probably returning it if we hated it. Turns out, it’s not that horrible. First, it’s $70 with amazon kids for only 2.99 a month. SO MUCH CONTENT FOR CHILDERN. Next, it’s not that difficult to use. My child is able to click on a video and it proceeds to play. You can download videos for offline. Perfect for what we need. People are complaining about the slowness of the tablet, well it only has two gigs of ram. It’s gonna be slow but it’s not so slow that it can’t serve the purpose of keeping a busy toddler still in the car. Second the battery, after using it all day, is on 49%. The storage is very small, but you can easily insert a sd card to fix the issue. All in all, I think it’s a great tablet for toddlers. Older children I would suggested a better grade tablet.
 I bought 2 of these for my children, age 7 and 10.  They work wonderfully and I don't have to worry about damage if they drop them because of the protective cover.  They recharge quickly and the battery life is perfect for the amount of time I allow each day.  I can use the parental controls on the device or the parent dashboard online from my laptop to control the time limits, set daily goals, set age appropriate restrictions, or review the content they are accessing.  We had an iPad for a long time and it eventually wore out.  I am so glad I replaced it with the Kindle Fire Kids Tablets.  I highly recommend them. And an added bonus: I can switch between both their profiles as well as mine on each tablet, so if I want to use it as my Kindle when they are finished playing for the day, all I have to do is switch to my profile and enter a PIN and I have access to all my own content and web browsing.  I like the multifunctional aspect.
 I've had my kindle fire for YEARS and absolutely loved it! When my little got this kid's version I expected it to work the same way but for some reason when you add Freetime to the tablet, your battery life becomes garbage.  Something must run in the background at all times with Freetime because the battery life drains within hours even when not in use.  If you want to have your child be able to use it, it must live plugged in until use.  We've charged it all day, and then unplugged it at night to plug something else in, and by morning the fully charged one (that no one has touched) will have a dead battery.  And the charger is too tricky for little fingers and hands to plug in easily themselves.  It basically will always have a dead battery when your kiddo wants to actually use it.<br/><br/>I've also tried to contact them and try to figure out a potential solution (settings and such) and its just been a nightmare.  Amazon has among the best customer service out there, but for some reason that isn't the case when it comes to the Kindle Fire.  Every time I've had an issue with a Kindle, the customer service is atrocious.  I agree with all the reviews that the customer service for this product isn't at Amazon standards.  I really wanted to love this.
 I love this thing! it forces my child to read more according to how I set the parental controls and I love that it allows me to set a time to shut off! easy to operate as well and very comfy to hold in your hands. I also love the definition assistance it provides in the reading section for your child to learn more vocabulary.......
 I previously purchased a tablet for our son a couple of years ago.  we had a myriad of problems with it and I had finally gotten around to posting a review with the technical issues we had experienced.  Amazon’s R&amp;D department contacted me and wanted more detail on the issues I had with the tablet, they replaced the tablet and took down my concerns with such caring and support for parents around the world in need of a functional educational and safe tablet product!  Amazon is amazing. Had I thought to reach out to them with my issues prior I could have saved months of trouble shooting and frustration but I didn’t think to bother as they are a large company and I am just one little customer.  Well - it turns out - they are a huge corporation with an abundance of love for each of their consumers!  THANKS AMAZON!  You guys are the best!<br/><br/>This tablet works perfectly and functions just as it says it does!  Awesome!
 This tablet is the absolute worst tablet I have ever purchased. Opened the device for my son on Christmas and the battery doesn't even last 10 hrs. That is connected to wifi and basically setup for an 18 month old to play songs on for the most part. Not to mention when you have the tablet in children's mode you can't shut off unused apps the child has opened. Also you can't kill unused apps period and all of the bloatware added to Amazon's eco system is horrific.<br/><br/>This tablet needs the ability to kill apps without the use of a 3rd party app that barely does the job. Also this tablet needs an extremely improved battery life to make it worth any of the cost. I'm going to get the little guy an iPad mini most likely due to the battery life and that I can actually stop apps from running.
 So we had The original, Kid's Fire tablet, Which was great, until one day it just stopped working on the USB to Charge plug, It had been about 8 months or so, Amazon did replace the Tablet for free, After a week of having it to check it out. The feature that I don't like on the tablet for my 4 year old is that the screen can be enlarged and decrease, in size, during normal operation. so My son cries when the screen is not right. I cannot find a lock for the screen size. Also when changing direction of the Tablet. even slightly the screen changes. We did not have these issues with the original one. The new layout is hard for a 4 year old to understand. VS the original layout which was simplified. These are Kids Tablets not Adult Tablets, they are used by 3+ YO children. Not adults, in most cases. The new version Relates more to a selling platform, rather then a kid friendly one. For all these things I would rate it a 3 out of 5 stars, If they took out the main page advertising, and fixed the two other issues It could have been 5 stars, or just left it as the original was. it Would have been 5 stars.
 A disaster from the moment I received it.<br/><br/>There were many advertised features that were unavailable on this tablet when it arrived (downloading videos to watch offline and a blue light filter, for instance). Worse, the help documentation seemed to refer to a different version of the product, most of the menu items and actions that I was told to perform did not exist on the tablet I was sent.<br/><br/>But it's a cheap tablet, meant for kids, so maybe that shouldn't matter too much. What you're really paying for here is a purpose-built kid's device, including access to the "FreeTime Unlimited." This, I'm afraid, is a waste of money as well. Amazon promises that the content available to your child is customizable, but this is not really the case. Individual titles (apps, games, books, etc) can be removed from library so your child cannot download them, but there are literally tens of thousands of titles available. There is no way to remove all titles and selectively add the ones your believe are appropriate for your child -- you are forced to rely entirely on Amazon's choices. Perhaps this is me being overprotective as a parent, but it's a bit scary to give your child access to a large collection of media without being able to curate what is available to them in any meaningful way.<br/><br/>But here's were it gets really bad: The tablet stopped working after one week of light use. After checking the aforementioned help files (which didn't apply to the device I had), I contacted customer service who told me (and these are direct quotes):<br/><br/>1. "Restarting your Fire tablet may resolve any issues you're experiencing with it."<br/>2. "You can learn more about troubleshooting your Fire tablet in our Help Forum"<br/><br/>I was forced to return it after having owned it for about a week. Very disappointing.
 These are great for not worrying about them breaking.  But if you want to load android apps from the Google Play store you can forget it.  And once the storage is full, good luck cleaning that up.  The device maintenance is a nightmare.  My kids can't hardly do anything anymore with the tabs, because it's always complaining about the storage being full, and I'm racking my brain trying to figure out how to clean up the storage, and I'm an IT guy.  My wife wants me to buy Samsung tablets again for our kids, and just give the fire tablets away.
 I've owned no less than 8 of these over the last four years.  I was excited to get the kids' version because with that we can monitor their content and the guarantee if they break it (the ONLY reason I'm giving two stars).  However, after downloading a handful of games the memory is full.  When the memory is full it kicks you off wifi, you can stream videos, etc.  Essentially the device becomes about worthless.  Mom or Dad has to restart, reconnect to wifi manually, remove unnecessary files, and try again.  I've considered adding a storage chip but I'm so frustrated at this point it's easier to hand them our iPhones and let them play.  My kids are 4 and 6 and they get tablet time at bed and EVERY SINGLE NIGHT they take turns crying because their tablet stops working.  I think it's time to get a couple of iPads and be done with it.
 The tablet was great for kids. You have to get the 16 GB model or you'll constantly be dealing with the tablet running out of memory. The content was great and I'd happily buy more if they had any longevity to them. I've owned multiple of these tablets and every one has stopped charging after no more than a year of ownership. I have had one returned under warranty with the issue which I appreciated but this suggests a serious design issue with the product based on all the negative reviews and my own personal experience with it. I would not recommend buying one unless you don't mind it only lasting a year.<br/><br/>Update: Shortly after posting this review Amazon contacted me to get more feedback from me. It's very encouraging that they are committed to understanding the issues with their products and gives me confidence they may solve this model's problems in a future model.
 Let me start by saying I am a HUGE lover of kindles. Ive had one since they first came out and I love, love, love them. I purchased this for my 3 year old since his older siblings had fire 8’s. I figured kids edition would be better for him since he is so young. I gave two stars because it has only one speaker. Sound quality was poor. I do love the case it comes in but it is smaller than what he was used to. So I returned it. I haven’t made up my mind if I want to purchase another one like his siblings.<br/>I don’t want this review to detour anyone from getting a kindle. Ive had zero issues in the 5+ years they have been out. Amazon support is amazing too. I prefer kindles over iPads due to easibility of navigation.
 I love this device.  Good features, excellent parental controls, good web-based interface for restricting content (etc.).  Keeps my kids safe, while still letting them "own their own device".  I haven't had any complaints about the device, despite three rambunctious boys' best efforts!<br/><br/>I have a comment about content - even though I restricted it to "age appropriate", my 7- and 5-year-olds still find "games" that depict shooting animals and fighting people.  I don't agree that this is "age appropriate".  Why not shoot targets, or robots, or something?  Why does it have to be people - even if "army men" (etc.).  They're 5, not 12.<br/><br/>Anyway, the features and capabilities are why I bought the device, not to critique app developers' offerings.  I still like Amazon's restrictive environment for my little ones.  I really needed something like this, and I am very pleased that it's doing the job I intended it to do!  Kudos, Amazon!
 Affordable tablet, compact size makes it easy to carry.  Kids profiles are locked down to Amazon environment which is good.  Available kids content is fairly limited though and is subscription based with only one year included.  Further even with the subscription, only 25 episodes of (15-25 min) shows are available for offline viewing at a time, with only a 48 hour viewing window. Child can easily go through these if travelling internationally away from wifi. I'm not sure if it will be worthwhile to subscribe to kids content after year one. Playing content is fine, but navigating tablet is slow. Hardware is definitely not as powerful as our (6 year old!) 3rd gen iPad.  Included protective case is extremely basic-it has no stand or handle, which makes it difficult to carry with the bulk it adds to the tablet.  I immediately purchased an aftermarket case which was readily available through Amazon.  Finally, the original Fire 7 delivered to me had display issues and died within 3 hours of its first use.  Amazon replaced it after some time consuming troubleshooting steps.
 We have a 7" and an 8". Both are fantastic. We've used the worry free guarantee two separate times. Once, I accidentally dropped it in the pool and the other time we found it with a cracked screen. Both times, customer service was very helpful - they sent me a shipment label via email, I sent the device back, they assessed it, and then sent me a brand new one. It did take maybe a week total but considering it's a no-questions-asked deal and both times were accidental, I'm not complaining.<br/><br/>The only real drawbacks are<br/>Some apps are only available through the Google Play store (like You Tube Kids) and that requires some extra work to download, although once you get it to work, it's fine BUT the apps are only available on the adult profile - you can't make them available on the kids profiles.<br/><br/>It's a bit of a hassle getting content that isn't on the existing kids app list to the kids profile. You have to login to the adult profile, download the app or movie to the adult profile. Then you have to go to the settings and add the content to the allowable kids content THEN you have to go to the kids profile and download it from there so it's available on the kids side.<br/><br/>A final drawback is that although you have the FreeTime so you can set it so that the kids have to read a certain amount of minutes or do a certain number of minutes of educational games in order to unlock the 'fun' games, the device doesn't allow you to determine which apps you consider educational. We get access to Raz Kids through our school district to help kids learn to read but reading in that app doesn't count toward the daily threshold to unlock the fun stuff when we have FreeTime on. Reading only counts if you read what 'they' consider books. There are also some math games that I would consider educational but the device doesn't.<br/><br/>Get a 32gb or above OR make sure you get a large micro SD (there's a slot for it) because the memory is used up VERY quickly. A lot of GREAT content - books and apps. We also have an iPad and these tablets, to me, are just as good for how we use them and MUCH cheaper.
 We got the bundle buy 2 deal, last yr for chirstmas, THANK GOODNESS WE BOUGHT WARRANTY!! If u buy this u MUST buy warranty!!! 7 months after getting it 1 tablet stopped working and they replaced it with a new one. Now 5 days away from warranty expiring the 2nd tablet took a dump, and now waiting for our new one free of charge. So yes it's a good deal but u definantly need to add warrenty.  It's for my kids but I don't use the kids features, kids tablet is great for the free play but I don't buy that, so we just download games to the regular adult side and keep parental controls on with passwords. I do like that when I buy a game it can be downloaded for free to the other tablet. My 2 boys close in age this is a big deal for me I don't have to buy games twice, not that I did I just told them to share the tablet. But since they have there own and play the same games with each other side by side it's cute... with limitations of coarse ;)
 I purchased this item about 6 months ago and it no longer charges. I first called an spoke to a rep who said that they will send me a brand new one but didn't have a shipping date because of black Friday so I waited over 2 weeks and called back. After speaking to 3 representatives and over an hour later the rep said they were waiting for me to send my  tablet to have it repaired (which was told can take up to 30 days) and if they can't fix it they send a "new" one. After going back and forth about what I was told- he made the "exception" to send me a "new" one.  I got it 2 days later and it was a refurbished tablet!<br/><br/>The Amazon free time is a kids mode that is set with a seperate profile on the tablet. It is a bit confusing for a child. It has overwhelmingly amount of all these apps showing- my child selects them not realizing there all being downloaded and it's not clear with the pages and home screen what apps you have and what can you downloaded. It needs to be less clutter and more user friendly for a child. Perhaps like on a smartphone- you have a home screen with your downloaded apps and then a button like Google play button to downloaded more apps.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I've changed my rating from 2 star to 5 star for outstanding customer service. After speaking with Tim from Tech service department who went above and beyond to resolve my issue and also advised me the repairs have a faster turn around than 30 days (between 2-5 days) and walk me through setting up a kids profile without using the free time and has the same parental controls that are in the free time profile.<br/><br/> I was told the free time has extra apps that you would normally pay for but being a prime member I already have access to alot of free content.  I'm setting up a regular kids profile and a separate profile with the kids free time which give my child more user friendly interface and option to still use the free time program. I give this 5 stars also because Tim showed me how to set up YouTube videos that  would allow my child to watch and nothing else, so I don't have to worry about them getting into other content and videos. That also apply to websites- you can give them links that would access just the website you authorized and nothing else! Kudos to the Amazon for actually reading the reviews and taking the feedback to make customers happy!  I highly recommend this tablet for your kids that can grow with them and could use yourself!
 I bought this for my toddler for Christmas hoping it would distract her from my phone, and so far so good. She gets tablet time once a day, and looks forward to it. I look forward to it, too, because that means quiet time for me and her daddy. The case is pretty durable. I've taken the tablet out because I had to troubleshoot a problem and the tablet itself is really light, but the case definitely helps that. The best part is knowing she can't accidentally download apps that aren't age appropriate, especially given the age restriction option and parental controls.<br/><br/>I have had a few problems with it, however. The charger provided seems flimsy, and if not laid flat won't charge. The screen has, also, randomly frozen for no apparent reason twice now (but the troubleshooting on Amazon was helpful for fixing that right away). Beyond those problems, so far it seems to work wonderfully and my toddler loves it.
 I have 3 kids, each had their own, but USB port stopped working and was beyond warranty with one, so we bought another, now another one is having the SAME problem with a USB. If we get this one replaced that will be 5 tablets total, in the past 2 years! after seeing everyone else's comments having issues with the USB port not working and having a lot of issues getting it replaced, I don't think we're going to go through that hassle and will just have to buy something else :-( They should really consider making it a magnetic charge port or wireless, USB gets ruined too quickly.<br/><br/>**UPDATE**<br/>I didn't have any problems with customer service, they were great actually! but although Customer service was great and I didn't have any problems getting the issue dealt with pretty quickly and we actually really love these tablets for our kid's age range (3,4 &amp;7), especially since we do VERY long road trips every year... we have gone through quite a few fire kids tablets in a short amount of time all with the same USB problem, I still think a wireless or magnetic charger would make this near perfect.
 God. I'm trying to like it and work with this Kindle. Really I am trying. But everything is just falling apart with it.<br/>1) the games keeps saying they are downloaded but when you click to play them they either crash or "aren't" downloaded and begin to "download" again. I've had one game be downloaded 3 times already. Idk if I'm doing something wrong. But if so it's not very clear.<br/>2) It's NOT user friendly at all. Everything I need isn't at my finger tips. You have to jump hoops to try and get from one setting to another.<br/>3) set up/interface is not very child-friendly. Child gets frustrated because of the overwhelming amount of things you have to do to close the game (because it glitches and doesn't close), or to remove from carousel, or add to home.<br/>4) the whole Kindle seems to glitch. Keyboard won't respond, apps don't close correctly, can't even buy something if I try. You'd think buying an item through the Kindle via Amazon app would be easy, it's Not.<br/>5)the battery sucks! How can a child play with it if it doesn't last their game. Not giving it for them to just play all day but even 30min. And it's already drained.<br/>6) storage is horrible...I get that 16Gbs is nothing in today an age. But even with the new memory card it makes me load all the games onto it and still says the storage is full within the Kindle. So what's the point of putting a new memory card on it.<br/>Overall I'm very disappointed with it. The concept of hundreds of apps available for your child would be wonderful if it would work and/or even let you play with them. So disappointed with this product coming from Amazon. They definitely need to improve it before they even advertise for it.
 Overall my toddler and I like the tablet.  However, it is not as user friendly as I'd like.  Like most people, I want to figure it out without reading the long drawn out tablet instructions.  Adding profiles, security, apps, etc. was all pretty easy.  But adding apps to the child's profile was a bit more difficult.  t automatically synced with my profiles and uploads from other programs, sites, etc.  But on my son's profile it is a bit of a chore trying to find compatible apps and digital movies already owned.  I dunno if it is because his is an age related profile or what.  I have to log into my profile for him to watch Netflix because the app would not show up on his profile.  I have not figured out why as of yet.  Will keep you posted when I do!
 So we bought this for our 1st grade aged daughter because we did not want her to have all the freedom and access that the iPad and other tablets can allow for her. We liked the parental controls available etc. BUT, we gave her this product on Christmas and within 3 weeks the charging port started acting up and it is coming loose, the battery life is not very long (we brought it for a long car trip and it lasted about 1/4 as long as other tablets) and it has glitches constantly, and it is not always responsive on the touchscreen.<br/>We do like that we can return this product when something is broken without questions asked (for the charging port issue) but we don't really appreciate that we have to do it this soon! Overall, I should have done more research!
 So I have to say this product is the best, especially compared to other kid tablets on the market. It was easy to set up, and I enjoy the fact that you have to load the apps because your in control of how much space you use. I love that there is a parent sign up and then the child's.I'm in total control over what she can access. The parental controls on this are top notch. I bought this for my two year old niece and she actually learns while playing. This allows me free time and it's guilt free because she is actually learning while playing. The built in case is the best, she has thrown it and stood on top of it and the thing still looks new. The battery life is awesome, I could not be happier with this tablet. My niece calls it her phone and she takes it everywhere and she knows how to use it better than me. This has reduced her grabbing for my phone, I simply say use your phone Jeannie and she is cool with it because she just loves her tablet.
 My niece (3 years old) loved her gift. It for sure has plenty of games for her to learn how to write her alphabet and tons of education episodes from PBS. As soon as we opened it and set it up for her (which was super easy), she quietly sat down and watched a few episodes of Sesame Street.<br/><br/>It was really important to my brother and his wife that she have something that they don't have to monitor for her. Like when she watches YouTube, they feel like that have to ensure she isn't accidentally watching something they don't approve of. With the Fire 7 Kids Edition, they never have to worry about that because she has no access to social media, contacts, or non kid friendly videos and games. It's the perfect gift for someone who wants to provide their child with an educational distraction that you can set limitations to.<br/><br/>The amazing thing about this tablet is that as she gets older, you can change the age range on it and the programs will change to accommodate her as she grows mentally. In other words: It will always challenge her.<br/><br/>I'm really happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend this product.
 We bought this for our 4 year old for Christmas. I did my research and saw the other reviews saying the same thing. However, I didnt realize the amount of slowness they were talking about!<br/><br/>My 4 year old is very patient for her age. She will pretty much only use this thing now for YouTube instead of the apps and games it was intended for. We bought a year subscription of ABC Mouse and this tablet can barely run it. Over half of the time, the app will crash and the tablet will freeze.<br/><br/>We did buy an additional memory card for the tablet since it was recommended. I would say that was a good buy because it comes loaded with the *freetime* or whatever that takes up alot of space.<br/><br/>Other than the pink case that came with the tablet, I regret this purchase.
 My  daughter will be 2 in less than 2 months and she love it!! She know how to use it on her own and I was able to download YouTube kids on it which is her favorite app. The case is aslo amazing for a toddler . She drop it from time to time and it still 100% in perfect condition . The only thing she really don't like is the amazon free time app . And because it won't allow me to download any outside apps in the kid profile , she won't use it. However , we are starting to read books on it which is perfect And I hoping I can teach her to use it over the next few months . This is really  the best tablet for kids !!!
 This 2 star rating is due to quality and based on two of these we’ve purchased. There are several major issues with these tablets that:<br/><br/>1) the kids profile is very buggy. Apps will occasionally redownload themselves filling up storage space, and the apps will be very slow to load on reboot. I believe the glitchiness has to do with storing apps on the SD card, but it is not due to the SD card, as the issue persists despite changing SD cards. I noticed that the tablet functions better when the kids profile is deleted and using the standard profile.<br/><br/>2) The biggest headache on this tablet is the terrible usb charge port. The stock charge cable that comes with the tablet is inadequate, as once the charge port becomes loose (usually within a month) it’s extremely difficult to get it to stay in. The only success we’ve had is via higher end usb charge cables, but the only way to get the tablet to charge is to wrap the cable around the front of the tablet and back underneath so there is tension forcing the plug downward (see picture)<br/><br/>3) the only reason i didn’t give this 1 star is because it is cheap and a good entry tablet for parents wanting their kids to have access to educational apps without breaking the bank. I have bought a third for our youngest whose turning 2, but in order to make the tablet functional, I had to install Nova launcher and use only the standard adult profile. If we could afford it, we’d look at getting the kids some galaxy tablets since we’re using the adult profiles anyway.
 Perfect price point for a cheaper tablet. Works great! The kids can watch shows, play game, read books. Bright enough but not too bright. Loud enough but not too loud. You can do everything here that you could from a more expensive tablet in regards to kids. They can drop it a thousand times and it stays protected. My kids don't know the password on it so they need to ask me for permission. And I can set it to have time limits. (i.e.: if they only need it for an hour I can set it to turn off in an hour). They use a number of apps like Netflix, PBS kids, some fun games and some educational games. My tween son't tablet is hooked up to his Alexa.
 Purchased approx one month ago and it will not charge. I have tried several cables and charges which will charge other devices. I contacted Amazon customer care and they told me my options are to send it back to have it checked for repair, or to repurchase another device which is now at a higher price. After about 30 minutes of speaking with the representative, he was able to adjust the price for me to repurchase the device at the price I initially paid. I was extremely disappointed in  Amazon. The 2-year worry-free guarantee: if they break it, return it and we'll replace it for free.  No questions asked. was definitely not worry-free.As stated in the product description Amazon All-New Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet, 7" Display, 16 GB, Blue Kid-Proof Case]] site. There was no replacement. I have to repurchase the item, send back the defective item and wait to be refunded the cost of originally purchasing the item. My hope is Amazon will refund me for the original purchase promptly.
 So for Black Friday I ordered 4 of these tablets for my nieces and nephews for Christmas. Tablets turned out to be a great buy you really can’t go wrong especially for the price. I highly recommend  you really can’t go wrong. The kids loved them so much they didnt even care to open up the other presents. I think I’m getting Aunt of the year award before 2017 is over. So I’m super happy with this purchase and so are the kids !
 Sitting here on hold with customer service again as I write this. 12 minutes on hold so far. Infuriated with Amazon after this last absurd incident. I received an email tonight stating I was officially being charged for a replacement device I hadn't returned. However I have returned said device 3 weeks ago. AFTER being ASKED to FIX the FAULTY DEVICE I was sent as a replacement MYSELF!  I received an email the day after I returned the replacement warning me about being charged if I didn't return the item, but disregarded it as in the email it is stated to do so if the return had already been made. Yet here we are 3 weeks later and I was charged anyway. So now not only am I still stuck with the original screwed up kindle that I was hoping to get replaced with one that shouldn't have been 6 updates behind and impossible to manually update after several hours of guidance by customer service who also ended the call telling me Amazon had a more important issue to address and they'd have to call me back later.  That is exactly what I've gone through with this last "worry-free guarantee" issue I had. First off, why should I have to do Amazon's job by fixing a device they sent me to replace another one that is having issues with the software? This is only the second replacement I've requested and the first was due to an issue with the charging port.  It's not like I'm throwing them under a car tire and having them replaced monthly. So far "worry-free" is the last thing that comes to mind when I think of this purchase. Secondly, while I won't say every customer service rep has been unhelpful, I will say several have been grossly unprofessional.  Who tells a customer, "I'm sorry, but we've got a more important issue to handle right now"? Ok, cool? I'll just keep trying to repair this broken piece of crap you just sent me on my own?! I can't count the number of times I've been transferred over to another representative and had to explain my problem all over again because I was transferred without any information being exchanged between the reps. (this just happened again) Way to add fuel to the Fire.  I'm infuriated to say the least.
 My 18 month old is suspected of having Autism (aspergers) and he is obsessed with technology and watching Lilo and Stitch. My tablet he almost broke trying to play with it when I put on his favorote movie and after his father got him this I am so pleased and thankful they make a tablet so durable for my son and the kids more is beyond amazing. It comes with a year for free (or at least mine did) and no other kid tablet did or nor was any other kid tablet I tried out comparable. My son does nit have the attention for books, but I found a few books on here that read the book to him and highlight the letters as its being read. And one book even lets you tap on everything and it says and spells out what the child is tapping on like tree, apple, car, barn, etc. He really seems to enjoy it and the fact that it has books on there that he pays attention too (as Well as education games and videos) and guys, not to mention Amazon says with in 2 years if anything happens to the tablet, like kid wise accident, they will replace it no questions asked. Its pretty dirable anyways (my kid has bad tantrums and can throw things pretty hard) so to know that if incase the worst happens to it it will be replaced.
 Within the first month the screen cracked. So the bumper doesn’t protect like it claims to. 6 months later and it won’t charge. No cord can stay in the port to charge. I put in a service request and they failed to tell me I have to send it in first before they replace because they have to look at it first. They don’t state that in the description in selling the warranty. I called to follow up twice and no one told me to send it in and THEN it MAY be replaced. Two weeks in and I am still waiting for a fixed Fire 7 Kids addition and it will be longer. So parents, it’s not child proof like they say and it’s not as easy to get it replaced as they say. Beware. Not worth the the money. Terrible customer service and hassle. I’d give it zero stars if I could.
 We bought one of these for our older granddaughter. She was five at the time and of course, like every child of this time period, knew exactly what to do with it. She loves playing games and watching videos on it. Over the year our middle granddaughter - now 21 month discovers this and quickly showed that she also knew exactly what to do with it so she is getting one this Christmas. There is a little on - now 15 weeks who will probably get one next Christmas. They are easy to use, well protected in the case and very reasonably prices. They are a good investment.
 I got this kindle mainly for me but knowing I would share with my kids I wanted the smooshy case and freetime. Let me just say it's been great! It's so easy to switch between profiles. I have one for me and one for each of the three kids, they have individual age appropriate settings and I can easily customize limits and goals. The kids can pick their own books, games, and videos and I don't have to worry about accidental purchases or inappropriate content. The big kid has enjoyed the reading variety that comes with it. The case is perfect as well, we accidentally fling the Kindle on the ground on a regular basis and it just bounces without breaking. 10/10 would recommend this to others.
 The product works fine... when it works. But the Kindle customer support is TERRIBLE. 3 times calling as the Kindle stopped charging and each time almost 1hr on the phone. So much for this "great" warranty it comes up. Finally i was able to have the support process to exchange for a new kindle (via a supervisor) and I just received the Kindle Fire w/ Alexa - not the kids edition and no kids protective case...  Called back customer service and they said they only send whats in stock.<br/><br/>Annoying that Kindle support is different than regular Amazon support. They are useless.
 I am so mad about these tablets i could throw them in the road and run over them. Within the last month i have called customer service about 6 times, been transfered over 20 times and had to return now 3 of the tablets. Our first issue was my daughters tablet would no longer charge or hold a charge. We got a new one sent to us and once we got it, it wouldnt play videos. so we had to return it. Then around the same time my sons tablet started to take forever, over an hour just to download one game! They had me send it in and they fixed that. By then we finally got a replacement for my daughters "replacement" Now it wont download games at all! i have been sitting here for almost 40 minutes trying to download a book on freetime and it just keeps saying downloading but wont actually download anything. I am not returning this tablet for a 3rd time. I will throw it in the trash and pay the extra money to buy from samsung or somewhere else. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER PIECE OF JUNK LIKE THIS FROM AMAZON AGAIN.
 I wanted a children's tablet for my 1 year old to keep him entranced while we were out in public or entertain him during car rides. Because he is so young I wanted something that had baby games and could be used easily by a child. This tablet has apps perfect for a baby. There is a piano app and baloon popping app easy for him to use. Also, no matter what he clicks on he winds up on a game or his PBS kids video app appropriate for his age. I did not want an iPad because there are too many apps that you cannot delete off. If he clicks around on an iPad he could wind up on the calculator or weather app for example. This does not have any useless apps for adults under the child's profile. My only complaint is that I wish there were a switch for hands free mode, which would not turn his videos off if he starts pressing the screen.
 I bought this for my son plus I like that if my son broke it we can just get another one and everything was working out great with it but then about 6 months later it started slowing down, the battery did not last long, and they just up and updated it that you cannot use this without WiFi.. like absolutely nothing.. the whole reason I bought it first and foremost was because we go on long drives and so my son has books and stuff to read offline and play the games off line that we previously downloaded on WiFi. But everything stopped working offline... I bought my son an iPad so that he can use it in the car and just download the amazon free time app instead.<br/>Then I wanted to buy a kindle and see if I can trade it in after 8 months that I had it.. and get something for it at least so I didn't totally waste my money and they wouldn't take it back.<br/>I would not recommend buying it.
 We trust our little ones to do the right thing.  We do check up on them regularly but this is not the tablet for that.  YOU cannot search for apps.  You cannot download an app that you want to add for your child.  Everything is locked down.  I hate it.  I've tried everything under the sun to increase my child's ability to download a game that she wants but forget it.  There is not an option for app store on KID MODE.  Amazon could easily do a better job of letting parents know what they are actually buying.  I bought it for my child / not for me to use.  Kids are forced to use the apps that amazon says is appropriate for my child.  If I could return it I would and get a regular fire tablet that is less restrictive.
 I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON AND THIS ENTIRE EXPERIENCE THEY HAVE PISSED ME OFF SO MUCH THAT I AM SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING CANCELING PRIME AND LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVES FOR ONLINE SHOPPING. We bought these devices for the children because of the "2 YEAR WORRY FREE NO HASSLE NO QUESTIONS ASKED" warranty. Nearly everything about that is a complete and total lie. Amazon has turned out to be just your normal every day scumbags that you cannot trust. Both of the kindles we bought quickly had charging problems and would only charge about half the time IF we propped something under the cable to keep it in exactly the right position. Recently the devices would no longer hold a charge though one would work if you left it plugged in.  We decided to get the kids new ones soon, so we just figured "lesson learned". Then Amazon auto-renewed the kids subscription (amazing that worked without error). So I logged on and realized the devices were still under warranty. I then proceeded to search for the warranty information on the site. I checked my account. I searched "customer service" (try not to laugh when you read that). Finally I found the details. Which leads you to a trouble shooting section which eventually leads you back to the "details page" which leads you back to trouble shooting. That's right it's a loop. I checked it several times to make sure I didn't miss anything. But nope, try to get details on a warranty claim and they take you through several pages which always take you back to the same pages. Tried to look for a phone number but it can't be found. (Go ahead I dare you, try to find Amazon's phone number on Amazon.com.) Finally googled for it, only to find they have disconnected the main line and buried the new number. Well done Amazon! AT THIS TIME (12/27/2018) THE AMAZON "CUSTOMER SERVICE" PHONE NUMBER IS 1-866-216-1072. When I finally got someone on the line (after several minutes of "you should hang up and try our website....", she proceeded to at first pretend she couldn't find that I had purchased them, even though they showed up just fine in my order history, then demand the serial number which luckily is on the orders page since you can't boot up the tablets anymore. (I'd find yours now and right it down, once amazon finds out they made that information convenient it'll no doubt be removed). Then we proceeded to play a game of 200 questions (remember the 'no questions asked' thing? ) So they could be sure we knew how to do things like plug it in, turn it on and off, etc. Cause you know we forgot how to do that recently, it can't be that the tablets actually quit working. After another 1/2 hour of this and a few 'let me put you on hold moments' where I expected them to hang up, honestly, they eventually agreed to let me return the tablets. At my expense. And then they'll inspect them and see if they are really broken and then will decide if they'll replace them or not. This has certainly been "worry free" hasn't it!?!? I'll do an update once they actually decide what to do.
 We have three fire kids tablets - 2 5th gen and this one.  The Fire 7 Kids edition is such a disappointment. We have already had to replace it twice, and all three of these tablets we've had has the same issue. Eventually, the tablet will shut itself down every 10-20 minutes and usually has to be reset before it will turn on again. Replacing the Fire is a hassle, and once Amazon sent it back stating there was no issue - but there most certainly is so I had to go through the nagging phone call AGAIN just to get a tablet that worked for a couple months. We last replaced the Fire in August and it already will not stay on. The return process is such a negative experience, I don't even want to return it even though it is under warranty until July 2019. The 5th gens work great and have stood a lot of abuse, but based on my experience with this more updated Fire, I will likely not buy a fire again.
 **Update** I received a phone call from Amazon Customer service after posting my review and the lovely woman helped me to set this up for my daughter. It is now perfectly kid friendly and I can call them or e-mail them any time I need to. I've increased my review from 2 to 5 stars because anyone with customer service that great in this day and age deserves a five star review. Happy customer. :)<br/><br/>I wish that the kids edition was set up in a more "child" friendly way. Now I have to spend a bunch of time eliminating options my kid will never need. I would recommend going with something that uses android, if that's what you're accustomed to, as this isn't entirely intuitive.
 This tablet was purchased for my 14mo old and I'm happy with it. My son has zero tolerance for car rides, or anything else that confines him for more than 10mins. It requires WiFi to stream. It's a kids tablet, not a regular tablet with a data package through your phone carrier. You can get around this by using your phone or other device as a hot spot if youre on the go.<br/><br/>Navigating around takes some getting used to if you're an android person, but I was able to work it well after playing around with it for 20mins.<br/><br/>Content is amazing. You can completely customize it based on your child's age and decide what you want them to have access to along with time limits. The content for adults is similar to what you could do with a typical tablet. Downloading content takes a bit longer but opens and works effortlessly once it's downloaded.<br/><br/>The "no questions asked" warranty is legit. My son dropped his tablet in the dogs water bowl on day 1 and a quick phone call was all it took to get another on the way.<br/>If you have realistic expectations for a child's tablet, this will definitely exceed them.
 My son and I both really enjoy this tablet. He's dropped it and thrown it already and it's still intact. I also really like the freetime that comes on it. It makes it really easy to add apps for him. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I have had to Google quite a bit to figure out how to use everything because it doesn't come with directions.<br/><br/>Edit: my son has been using this tablet for a little over a year now and alone the way we have had some issues. The biggest one being that for some reason it doesn't show the app pictures most of the time. Or it will only show some of them. It will show them all when connected to the internet but we rarely are connected because we dont have wifi and he gets annoyed when he has to randomly click on things without knowing which game it is.
 I wanted to love this tablet for my daughter. However it was nothing except problems from the beginning. I created her account and downloaded her apps to play with when we were traveling because we were about to make an international flight in 2 weeks. Well the first problem was that after downloading the apps, we realized NONE of them were working without internet. The only reason this was bought was for travel which means no internet.<br/>The next problem we encountered was BOTH my tablet and my husbands tablets decided that they were not going to work and would not let us log in. It continued to prompt us to login with our Amazon information and then said we had the wrong password continuously. So I finally decided to contact customer support to get help. It took well over an hour for me to get the help I needed and I had to factory reset everything. Eventually our tablets were working again, but then they wanted me to delete the child profile and re add it, which I did, but again I lost all of the apps that were downloaded on her tablet. After that it was still not working properly so they told me I would need to factory reset it as well. The only answer I continued to get from support was that the only way to fix the problems for the tablets was to do a factory reset. That just sounds ridiculous to me, for the price of this tablet you would not expect to run into so many problems. Especially not when you just received the tablet.<br/>Overall, the warranty is nice, but it seems to be a pain to get it set up and there really should not have been so many issues with my daughters tablet. Had I known this, I would not have purchased this product. Would I purchase again? Absolutely not.
 What frustrates me most about this tablet is the Freetime Unlimited. The "home page" for your child is carousel upon carousel of suggested content with 1 carousel "recent" holding all of their already downloaded content. Whether it be books, videos or games it's all just dumped into 1 random heap. There is no way to organize the apps already downloaded, or to file say all the downloaded books with books and games with games. It might be ok for older kids, but my child is 6 and I'd like for there to be a separate page for just the things that are downloaded so she can tell the difference! This is rediculous! I'm hesitant to even let her play with it because it will probably be returned. Other than the incredible frustration with Freetime Unlimited I feel like its good quality, but probably not worth the headache...Please restore my faith in Amazon and fix Freetime Unlimited.
 We previously had the standard Fire Tablets for our kids. While those are stripped down the kid profiles still had more access to different apps. Both those tablets are in the garbage due to USB connector breaking aka bad design. On these new Kid Edition tablet, the Freetime child profiles are so stripped down the kids can do literally nothing without CONSTANTLY asking me to enter my password and add things for them. Also the thing will lock and require the parent to unlock the screen every time. We've had to resort to using the Parental profile as well as find some alternate methods to getting access to alternate apps.  SMH Is the low price worth the headaches? Probably not. This will be my last Fire tablet purchase.
 My son has a first-generation iPad that is way past its prime.  We'd heard great things about the Kindle, so we bought this one for his birthday so that he can watch his favorite shows and play some games.  This tablet is atrociously slow and difficult to use.  Honestly, his first-gen iPad with a broken home button is faster. But here's the worst part: the kids' home screen is LOADED (I'm talking THOUSANDS) with "suggestions" for content (in all categories: games, books, videos, etc.). The only way to remove these suggestions is to uncheck each one of them individually by hand.  All I wanted was a tablet where I could load a few videos and a couple of games.  This is ridiculous.  This tablet is intentionally designed to be addictive.  Seriously unhappy with this purchase; I only hope I can get a refund.
 That no questions asked policy is a complete and total LIE!!!!!  The CSR refused to replace the 3 Kid's Edition Kindles that I purchased 11 months ago.  None of them will charge anymore.  The CSR said I had to give her the children's names and the accounts that they were registered under.  I purchased them as gifts and the parents registered under their accounts.  The names and registration have nothing to do with the NO QUESTIONS ASKED REPLACEMENT!!!!!!!!  What a rip off then they said they would give me a gift card for the amount that I spent.  She then proceeded to tell me that I could buy the same thing for that price.  LIARS!!!!!!!!!!!  The same Kid's Edition Kindle is $20 more this year than it was last year.
 We bought 2 tablets on black Friday in 2017 at a local store and by 2018 we returned and replaced 2 tablets.  Now that we are on the second replacement one it failed to charge with in 90 days.  We went through the steps to have it fixed via amazons help line.  And as a result amazon replaced the charger at no cost.  Awesome Amazon! However the issue wasn't the charger.  Having that said, I had to go to the local library and print out the shipping label then drive to a postal store to have it shipped out for repairs.  If it could be repaired.  As for use: The parent control I can't figure out without having my child be locked out all together from the internet.  Googled the 'how to' and it turns out I have to pay per month for the 'unlimited kids'.  I will now have to wait to figure the 'kid' friendly option with the help line when the one tablet is returned.  Over all Amazon's been very helpful on trying to resolve the issue.  As for the malfunction of this particular tablet and time and gas spent on shipping it out for parts, repairs, or a replacement...  perhaps it's better to have a store warranty so your able to exchange it right away for a new one then and there?
 I have returned my child's tablet twice because the charging port stopped working, and it has stopped working a third time. It's only a year old. The second time, they kept it for a long time, and when I called to check on it, it seems that nothing was in progress at all to fix or replace. They put me on hold for a long time, then came back to ask me what was wrong with it again, and then I was on hold for another length of time before they told me they were sending the replacement. These are not reliable at all.
 I love this tablet!  My oldest son, who is 6 years old, was using a regular tablet that  had purchased though Verizon.  I had so many issues with him looking up things on YouTube that I did not feel was appropriate for a 6 year old boy.  I love that this tablet allows me to have parental controls and "tablet time" as I call it because I can set the limit on the amount of time that both he and my youngest son, who is almost 3 years old, spend on the tablet.  I love the deal that I had receive as well! Now both of my kids can have their own tablets and I know that they are safe online and using the tablets for educational time and occasional play time as well!<br/><br/>The only downside that I have found with this tablet however, is that I have to have an account in order to be the account holder.  I cannot delete any of the apps that come with the tablet.  Since day 2 of having the tablets it continues to tell me that it is low on storage space (which I am assuming is due to the apps downloaded between both of my sons).  So there is definitely NOT enough storage space.  So now I will have to buy an additional 2 SD cards just to put into the tablet for storage use.  I wish that there was a way that this could be changed.<br/><br/>Also, the tablets loose charge very quickly!  You must turn the completely off while they are not in use in order to save battery life.  Definitely not like my iPhone X that will hold power all day long even if I am on it all day for work.  However, other than those 2 small details, I am in love with this kids tablet idea!
 Although after just under 6 months of use the device stopped taking a charge or working when plugged in as some other reviews have stated I still gave it 5 stars. This is because unlike some other reviewers I had no trouble getting a replacement sent(emailed Sunday night, they said to call for replacement,  called Monday morning was transferred thru 3 different departments but took less then 30min, and new device(not refurbished as others stated, not sure if I just lucked out or if they changed policy). Device was already registered to my account, answered a few simple questions, and after loading my last backup settings which took less then 30min total my sons device was ready to go.<br/><br/>Will be ordering a second 1 for my other son soon.<br/><br/>My 4yr old easily navigates, downloads, and plays with the device.
 Id suggest buying a higher gb or an iPad... Consistant issues with memory. We have 2 and they include the parent profile- each tablet is able to switch between profiles (for example if my sons is dead, im able to use my daughter's and just hit his icon)- great, right? No- it takes up more storage and hinders each tablets usage. For the cost- go else where. Amazon is really easy to work with but when you have a bad product- what can they do? They have a lot of software issues.. In hindsight it's an awesome idea and i bought the new one (for my youngest) assuming the bugs would be worked out. Nope. Buyer be ware.
 My daughter loves her tablet and so do I. I had an old phone I would let her use but I stopped her from using it because she knows how to get on YouTube (3 years old), and some "kid friendly" shows aren't so friendly. With this tablet she doesn't even have YouTube and I can monitor the things she watch and games she play. I am in complete control. A plus is that it came with the case that is very sturdy and I wouldn't see how any child could break their tablet unless they take the case off. Then the 2 year worry free warranty and the fact that I have an account on the tablet as well. All of that for $99  but because I have prime I was able to do $20 payments per month. Oh and I received it the same day I ordered it! I would definitely recommend.
 The UI is terrible. The user accounts are global to all devices, so if you  have more than one child, each can logon as the other, quickly filling your storage as the profile is synced. Play schedules are limited to "weekdays" and "Weekends" meaning the device will turn off on friday nights and stay on longer on saturdays, if you want them to have longer time on weekends. There is no individual day-of-the week control. You cannot block the kids from downloading apps, so crapware like Batman, which is 1.5GB will quickly top off your devices storage, requiring constant interaction by the parent to delete it. Ideally, there should be a quick prompt for a parents PIN before a download. If I had it to do over again When these are deprecated, I will go with another product. Also no access to google play store, so limited selection of stuff.
 This tablet is your regular Fire Tablet with a few additions to make it suitable for kids. If I wanted I could use it myself. There is an option for you to set up multiple kids profiles. In the kids mode there is a parental lock that you can enable to keep kids safe. Mine came with 1 yr free apps and 2 year no questions asked return if something were to happen to it. I love the ease of kindles which is why I purchased this one for my daughter. She is 18 months and knows how to navigate thru the apps so I obviously use the parental lock.
 We purchased this item for our grandson.  The tablet is very slow (that was somewhat expected given the price), buggy in that it freezes and becomes inoperable on a regular basis, and in less than a year, it will no longer accept a charge.  We'll now find out whether or not the two year replacement guarantee is valid.  Not recommended.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  I've upped my review to 4 stars simply due to the quick and excellent attempt at customer service by Amazon.  Within minutes after posting my original review, I received a voice mail and email from Rachel in Amazon customer service.  I responded to the email and received another call, again within minutes.  After a couple of hand-offs and troubleshooting attempts, it was determined that the Fire Tablet was broken (I already knew that, but I do understand that they have to make an attempt to fix it over the phone) and I was sent a pre-paid UPS shipping label and was informed that a replacement tablet was going to be sent.  I'll be shipping the broken tablet back to Amazon via UPS tomorrow.<br/><br/>Look, it's a very inexpensive tablet computer and you do get what you pay for.  However, assuming that Amazon follows through, the customer service was nothing short of outstanding.  If all goes as I understand it should, I would be inclined to up the rating to 5 stars.<br/><br/>Update:  Received the replacement tablet a few days after returning the defective device.  I'm updating my review to 5 stars simply due to the outstanding customer service.  There were no hassles.  I'll reiterate my previous comment about the tablet... you get what you pay for.  I purchased a $70 tablet and NOT a $3000 workstation  laptop computer.  It's great for my grandson and that was the intent.
 Amazon promises "2-year worry-free guarantee: if they break it, return it and we'll replace it for free. No questions asked."  I should have known this was too good to be true.  First of all, they asked a lot of questions for me to have to prove that it was broken.  Ok, fine.  It was really broken. But then I did not return it within the 14 days that I called about it.  That was my mistake, but when I did return it, they just did nothing.  They kept it.  They didn't tell me that, even though they had marked my tablet as "received for repair", it would not be repaired or replaced because the warranty request had been cancelled.  So I guess they were just going to keep it, or throw it away?  Who knows?  Finally, after two calls and multiple transfers, they said they are going to ship a new one... I'll let you know.
 Disappointment. Slow, confusing to use (to manage as an adult for kids use, specifically). Instructions for use on Amazon are often wrong, or confusing. (example: https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201642270 these instructions for video management are flat out wrong.) The "manage child's time use" feature doesn't work.<br/>And I fall into the "very experienced computer user" category. It shouldn't be a challenge for me to figure out how to manage this device.<br/>The kid likes it well enough, but I won't order one again.
 So the kids fire tablet has always been great. We have had them for years. The newer ones are quite as sturdy as the old ones but the case that comes with it is great! The case is really hard to get on and off (I consider this a positive). The device isn’t great for anything other than amazon freetime (which is fine with me, it’s all my kids use anyway). It is slow and the storage on the devices is terrible, an SD card makes life a lot easier; once it has no storage space it can no longer connect to WiFi  (I took away a star for this). It’s not a device meant for adults, it’s for kids, which is why I loved the replacement plan (initially).<br/><br/>The replacement plan is terrible. Here is how it works:<br/>1. Call ask for replacement, if it’s a software issue they will make you sit on the phone and troubleshoot it first.<br/>2. Get email for the shipping label. Then box and pack it (expenses are your responsibility). Drop off to UPS.<br/>3. They receive the product and inspect it.<br/>Once they receive the product they with either fix the problem or use a replacement. It will take 3-5 days AFTER they receive your device for them to ship you the replacement/refurbished device.<br/><br/>Now I would have taken off a 3rd star but you do have the option to pay roughly $16 to have a replacement sent first and it will take 2 days to get to you or you can pay roughly $22 to get it next day. It says free replacement but if your kids are like mine a week without their tablet they would feel like it was punishment.<br/><br/>I wouldn’t buy a kids fire instead of an adult one again. It’s not as cost effective as the adult tablet and replacement plan with the adult tablet.
 I gave 3 stars and heres why first the tablet was really easy to set up and it seemed to run pretty fast granted I only used it for 20 mins and decided to return so basically the stars are because its durable runs good and easy set up and now why I hated it way too many apps thats u just tap to download I removed them.from the home screen 15 mins later they returned this is supposed to be for a kid and it's way too over wehlming for kids to even natigate because its just packed with apps every swipe that arent installed its just too much make it more like a normal tablet the pics u see when purchasing is exactly what u get its not for us. Returned so fast
 Love the warranty, it’s very quick and easy to replace. The case that comes with it is very heavy duty, some time the tablet get very hot and slows down, so we have to take the cases off to cool down, for some reason when we did the warranty exchange the case covered part of the volume button and would press the button. I would recommend buying a pack of screen protectors. And to take out of the case and wipe down once or twice a week. The table is the prefect size, easy to navigates. I’m not a fan of the silk browser, but that’s an easy fix. The only real down side is the charger port seems to wear out very fast. I bought some magnetic chargers and that helped a lot.

Would give 5 stars but it has the worst camera known to man 😩 and the storage is lacking easy fix with memory card but yet and still it would be nice to not have to mess with a memory card right out the package. I believe the regular tablet (not kids) is around $50 so you’re basically paying for the case and the kid time subscription. Which I think you end up saving as opposed to paying for the subscription separately. I do like that I have a separate profile so I can also use this tablet for adult things like Netflix and such. It’s pretty cool. Somehow when I ordered though it defaulted to a blue case I really wanted the pink. My daughter was pretty sad but i don’t have the time to return it and wait for the proper color. She’s still all smiles but warning your child will still ask to play games on your phone 🤣<br/><br/>Oh and I ordered it on Friday it came Sunday I wasn’t expecting it to come so quick but amazon is amazing with their delivery I was really shocked and you can edit delivery instructions I added my door code to my apartment and they brought it right to my door early Sunday morning. I want to order everything amazon now lol
 Bought for my 1 yr old grandsons birthday girft. He lives it. Can download TV shows, movies, apps, games online or OFFLINE to take with in car to use with no wifi. Has parental controls. He loves it. He can work it &amp; he turned 1 one St Patrick's Day. It has a great thick kid proof case. Also comes with free 2 yr NO QUESTIONS ASKED replacement wareanty, he breaks it they replace it for 2 yrs no questions asked. I got it while it was on sale for 69.00. Has camera &amp; video camera also. He loves it. I love it. Best birthday gift ever. Kids are smart &amp; able to work tablets by age 1 nowdays from watching their parents use theirs or their phones. It's very handy for car rides, trips, and keeping him busy while his mommy &amp; daddy are trying to take care of things around the house. Highly recommend! He watches his fav baby shows &amp; learning shows &amp; TV shows &amp; movies on it, plays baby games on it, &amp; they take it on the go with them.
 Unfortunately, the reviews are correct. Buyers beware! I bought this device in september and it is now January- and the device is having difficulty charging, the charging cord does not seem to seat properly into device.  I am just starting the return procedure but it is an understatement to say that the 2 yr warranty'no questions asked' is more than difficult to navigate. I keep getting into a loop within the amazon website, chat is unavailable, doesn't bring me to the email of customer service, etc....<br/>I am only giving this a 2 star because my kids do in fact enjoy the device, but i'm sure they would also enjoy a good old fashion board game/card game just as much!<br/>very disappointed in this product
 Waste of money. We got two of these for Christmas 2017 bd they have literally sat in the box in the cabinet because none of my children had any interest in them. It is August 2018 and I opened them to try to see if things changed. They only like being able to play roblox ( which you can’t even do on the children’s profile) . They do not care about any of the other content. it’s not user friendly and the lay out doesn’t make much sense. We haven’t even used these and already it tells me there’s not enough space to download an app. Yet I can’t even figure out to delete content to free up space.<br/>  I was hesitant to buy this because we’ve had a kindle fire before- my kids didn’t play that either. but I thought we’d give this a try since it was supposedly geared specifically for kids. Huge mistake. It’s not any better. I regret this purchase every time I’m reminded by the boxes in the cabinet.  Just get an iPad.
 This is great, however there is no YouTube Kids. That is a major problem, not to mention every parent knows a child watching "Daddy Finger" 10,000 times a day is a nightmare but a must..lol<br/>Also we had to buy a different case because we like this case but prefer it had a handle to help sit up the screen for times when our son needs to be handsfree.
 I want to state that we do love how easy this tablet is for our 2.5 year old to navigate. He absolutely loves the games and shows. The content is perfect for little ones. Unfortunately, I need to change my rating and review as I will be replacing this device for the 4th time since Christmas! The charging ports just do not last. With this last device we have been extra careful on not moving it while it's charging to not disturb the port. But this did not help, as of this morning the port is broken yet again. The device will not charge at all. So, if no upgrades are made to these devices in the future and you purchase this for your child they will indeed love it but be aware you will need to replace it.<br/><br/>Old review: My 2 year old son absolutely loves his Amazon Fire tablet that he got for Christmas. It has great shows, games, puzzles and music. You load the games/shows apps on their home screen that you think they will like best, they can then pick and choose which to play. It's also attached to my Amazon account with a password so I can go in and easily change his settings, but he can't. If you do not approve of an app you can delete it off of the tablet entirely. He has it down pat already. In and out of different games, shows and pausing/playing. The most recently viewed app goes to the first place for them to find easily next time. They swipe to the right to browse all apps loaded. The case it came in is great protection far falls and also helps him to hold it and not accidentally touch the screen. Lots of apps for small kids and big kid. Attached is a picture of him in his little fort having a snack and watching a show. And attached are his favorite four apps, although there are twenty on his home screen that he will flip through. The second app in the picture does not need Wi-Fi so he helps the little animals in the Vet clinic while we are out and about. We were going to get him the PBS tablet because he loves Daniel Tiger but after reading reviews on both products and finding out this one has ALL those shows plus lot of others and games we decided to spend the extra and we are SO glad we did!
 We got this product for our 6 yr old daughter's birthday in July and it has been one of her favorite things keeping her from wanting a phone like her older siblings. It comes with a very cushioned case appearing to be " bullet prof" but alas I was watching her run up out (carpeted) stairs the other day, excited to show me something on the tablet she tripped and fell. The tablet not even seeming to hit the ground, the screen shattered. I first thought it was the screen protector (understanding, as with phones protectors break) however it was the screen. Pretty disappointed that Amazon said they can do nothing for me. I kind of understand as people can "say" anything but usually they happily agree to replace my defective products. Maybe they need to be held to the same standards as a "3rd" party seller.
 This product stopped working after a year. Wouldnt charge at all. It supposed to have a two year warranty. I called to get them replaced and amazon is demanding I return them with photos of my children on them. I can’t turn them on to wipe them clean, or I would!! I do not know where these devices will end up or in who’s hands. But I DO Know that there are  photos of my kids on them and Amazon is demanding I return them to get them fixed. Apparently child exploitation and invasion of children’s privacy is with worth exactly $75 a device for Amazon. Also, $75 is worth losing a very regular customer with Prime. It’s so disappointing to have to do this.
 I bought this for my son for Chrismtas, he is 2.5. I got it for road trips, long car rides, something to play educational games on and look at books here and there. The battery is trash! We have to charge it 2 times a day even when he doesn’t use it. If it has a full battery and just sits all day and that night, don’t worry it will be dead the next morning. It’s highly annoying. It is glitchy at times and extremely slow, you have to be pretty patient with it to get into an app and do something. Since my son is only 2 it will do for now until we upgrade next Christmas. I would not pay full price for this! We got it on sale for $70.
 Overall I like this, because I can limit screen time. However I have a couple gripes.<br/>1. If you give the kid the PIN it's very easy for him or her to get to the parental settings from their profile. From my own profile, I have to use the password. She liked having her own PIN to open the Kindle, but I had to disable it, so I would be the only one to know it, and she could not get into the parental controls.<br/>2. I wish it were possible to set limits for two different time periods, such as morning and evening. Also would like it to be in smaller increments, but that's not a big deal.<br/>3. I wish it had a warning to let her know when she has one minute left. She sometimes gets upset when her time is up, so I have to set a separate timer to warn her.
 Bought this for my 3yr old for Christmas 2017 and I am very happy with this! It has definitely held up to being beaten up by a toddler and I love that his profile is based specifically for his age he enjoys everything about it.<br/><br/>Update..9/17/2018<br/>We were very happy with this table for our 3 yr old, however about 3 months again it stopped charging and wouldn’t hold charge. Now we can’t even get to charge with any charger! Very very disappointed. We did get it while it was on sale and I should have read more of the reviews because it seems like almost everyone who has purchased this table has the same problem! Definitely would not recommend anyone buy one of these if you are looking for something that will last and get your money’s worth! We purchased a Samsung for our other son 4 yrs ago and that still works with no problems. We will definitely be buy only Samsung tablets from now on.
 Purchased two tablets for our boys Christmas 2017 gift and by September 2018 (with light, occasional use) BOTH charging ports stopped working properly. I tried replacing the cords, they weren't the issue. The actual charging port is bad amd the tablets wont even charge anymore. So, now I need to try and get my warranty out of them. Super frustrating. I almost don't even feel it's worth the trouble because these aren't as "child friendly" as they claim to be. Kids figured out where the app store is and clogged the tablet with downloads of stuff they cannot even operate. They're 3 &amp; 4. Would be a nice feature if the apps could only be accessed/downloaded in the parent profile, then playable in the child's profile. Overall, I would never purchase another Kindle Fire.
 Bought this as a Christmas present for my toddler. It's April 3rd and the thing stopped its touch function. Nothing happened to it; it just stopped functioning. It doesn't hold a battery charge well. You cannot add Netflix to it that I've seen. You can access YouTube, but it is not in a manner I'm used to on my phone, TV, computer, or laptop because it doesn't function the same way, as in you cannot seem to search for specific things. I don't love the setup of the apps. When you click on a show (e.g., Shawn the Sheep or Daniel Tiger), it doesn't play the next episode automatically. I haven't found many teaching/learning apps for shapes and letters, which is what I purchased it for and purchased it over the LeapFrog Epic.
 This is a great tablet for my grandson he is 2 and he loves it! I just put Netflix and YouTube for kids on his profile. But I gave you four stars because it was freezing up and the screen kept going White so I called customer service and we got it back to the original way it had to get an update so we had to wipe it to the factory settings and then it says all the previous information and now it's back like when we first got it and it have not frozen up and my grandson is happy about that. PS never knew that an update messed it up where it was always freezing and doing stuff had to reset it to the factory and that was it and everything was back up so didn't lose anything. So I hope anyone have that freezing problem they look and see when the last time and update was take it can I go from there
 I really want to love this thing b/c my daughter adores it, but it's kind of a pain sometimes. At random moments it runs very slowly, or the buttons stop working altogether. I spoke with customer service and they taught me how to "clear the cache," which helps, but doesn't entirely solve the problem. The battery has a pretty short life, too. It does have lots of fun games on it, it's just rather annoying at times trying to get it to work properly.
 The Kindle Fire is good, but product support isn't. They claim there's a 2-year guarantee. If the child breaks it will be replaced or fixed free. I bought this about 6 months ago and last month it stopped holding a charge and then stopped booting up at all. The -problem is I've tried opening up a return file and the system says my time was up for returning it and this was about 30 days after I received it.WTF how is that a 2-year no question asked guarantee?<br/><br/>Not to mention forget it if you want apps from anywhere else than Amazon because they won't let it and all the apps I've seen from Amazon have in-app purchases, something you doon]t want a child to have access to.
 If I could select 0 stars I would this is the biggest piece of junk I have ever bought in my life. Seriously the worst we’ve had it two days and every hour or so I’m having to restart it cause the apps won’t even open. It’s so slow as well like painfully slow. its also very unorganized kids have access to literally everything available on FreeTime and one tap and they download it. Not a choose what you want for them and only that shows up kinda thing you can block stuff but there literally 1,000s of things on there my toddler accidentally downloads stuff all the time and it’s cluttered with stuff he really doesn’t care for. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! It’s a piece of junk and I’m so disappointed. I will never order from amazon after this the fact that they are even selling this tablet with it being in this state just shows how shady of a company they are completely lost my support as a customer
 bought this for my son. he has been using it on the weekends since christmas. i bought a 64g memory card. very soon messages started to appear about critically low storage. some apps just won't go on the memory card. and there is a group of "miscellaneous" files over 9gigs that can't be looked at or erased. not to mention all of the amazon bloatware. MY 4 YEAR OLD DOESNT NEED FRIGGIN ALEXA!! so the kindle always fill up even after 3 factory resets. it performs like crap and he can only play a couple games.
 I want to give this a million stars for all the times it has saved a long road trip or a flight, but there are some down sides:<br/><br/>Most of the stuff does not work off wifi, defeating the purpose for us. Netflix will allow you to download shows, but those expire after about 2 weeks, so you can just throw this in the car and forget about it until you need it.<br/><br/>Most importantly, YOU CANNOT ACCESS YOUR Google Play purchases, Chrome, Instagram, Gmail, YouTube, and other APPS FROM AMAZON COMPETITORS. Come on, if you trust your brand, don't be afraid of competition.<br/><br/>So, open the platform to access what I can from a PC, or other tables, and this is a keeper.
 The pictures are screenshots from this tablet. The first is how it looks to get into my own profile and out of kids mode. The second, is the internet browser. This tablet is very functional. The bumper works great to prevent any damage. The tablet has great battery life! The apps, games, and videos in kids mode are very easy to work. My husband and I bought two of these for our kids our daughter (age 5) and or son (age 3) love them! They can access them very easily. To add other profiles, it's very easy. If it's not a kids profile there will be a password option so the kids can't go outside of kids mode. You can turn the browser or search option off. You can customise each kids mode profile based off of age. "Alexa" is available as well for a hands free option. There is a camera as well. The apps are fed educational and awesome! I'm fan all will have to download once a kids profile is created. It's an awesome tablet with many customizations for you and your chikd.
 This tablet is a great deal and perfect for young kids. Not only is the price much cheaper than an iPad, but it includes the case (which had been put to the test by my son) and a two year warranty AND the best part: the Free Time subscription. The content is wonderful. Tons of his favorite apps and shows from the iPad are available on free time and they are FREE. And after the first year the subscription is still quite cheap, especially for Prime members. My son is 3.5 and uses this tablet daily. The programming is fun and educational. The only negatives I would say is the screen is easily smudged and needs to be wiped down. Also it is difficult for him to switch between apps on his own since there is no home button, but this might be a positive for some people. Overall, great product if you are looking for a personal device for your child.
 Duró solo cuatro meses, debido a que los reemplazos no los hacen a mi suite y no estoy en USA simplemente no tengo garantía, la realidad es que no funcionó mas, sin golpes ni nada, no recomiendo este producto, esta pensado solo para crear suscripciones, encima no hubo ninguna voluntad de parte de la asistencia por solucionarlo (cuando la compré no hubo problemas, me la enviaron a mi suite, pero para reemplazarla no lo hacen), la verdad es que quedé muy insatisfecho, si van a comprar tablet opten por samnsung o apple, ellos tienen garantía (no tecnicismos ni letra chica) es la diferencia entre grandes y pequeñas empresas, las verdaderas se hacen cargo de sus defectos y trabajan para arreglarlos.
 My kids love these, and when they work they are fantastic. However as I type this I'm currently chatting with customer service to get this replaced because, yet again, the charging port is loose and the tablet will not hold a charge. I purchased two of these in early January, just about 4 months ago. This is the THIRD time I'm dealing with this. The first time was a mere month after receiving them. It's completely aggravating. I've had my own Fire tablets (not the kids edition, of course) and the same thing has happened several times over the years. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why Amazon cannot fix this flaw. As an adult it's annoying but not the end of the world. For an 8 year old....well lets just say I've dealt with lots of tears.<br/><br/>I will say that the customer service is great. I initiate a chat and within a few minutes I'm being sent a replacement and a return shipping label. I would NOT buy a Fire without a warranty. Period.
 Device worked well for an hour, then all of the books we downloaded disappeared...  Contacted Amazon, and was told the device sometimes ships with old software and that it is easy to download new system software.  After 3 hours and 4 downloads, I gave up.  Still waiting to see if I can get a replacement with updated software, if not, it is going to the trash.  Big disappointment, and so much time wasted!<br/>UPDATE: Was sent a replacement device and GUARANTEED that it would have updated software.  Device arrived with the same old software that requires hours of updates.  Unusable. Waiting on the 3rd replacement device in 3 days.  Was given another guarantee that I'd be receiving what I paid for, but clearly those don't mean much.
 I bought two of these. My 4 and 6 yo really liked them and used them daily. We purchased them August 15 of this year and both charging ports quit working within the same week. While I knew that this tablet was not a high end tablet by any stretch of the words, I expected at least a good year or so. I've NEVER been a huge fan of Amazon's devices apart from the basic Kindle Reader devices, and this pretty much confirms that for me. The "NO HASSLE" guarantee has already cost me about 30 minutes on the phone and still no sign of repair or replacement.
 The charging port has been a problem on 3 of these for our family. Luckily amazon support is amazoning and we have had the replaced each time. But the kid warranty is about to expire and we are starting to have trouble again. Maybe they need to switch to the type c port like so many other devices have begun too. But basically the port on the device like wears out within a matter of a month, you then are unable to get the charger to stay in the device and if you do you have to hold it at an odd angle for a day and the it is useless all together. It's happened on past versions of kindle fire tablets for us too. Youd think itd be something that would have fixed by now.
 UPDATE: 03/13/18 We have had this tablet since Christmas morning.  This week it has stopped charging.  I was not concerned since of the 2 year worry free warranty.  Wrong on the worry free. The only option that Amazon can give me is that they will refund the price I paid for it.  I bought this tablet during a sale before December.  So the worry free warranty will actually cost me another $30 to replace and buy my son a new one. If you follow the links this option is one of the three that could happen if tablet needed to be replaced. Great product when it worked. Misleading warranty.<br/><br/>We had a old kindle fire and decided to buy a new one for a 2 year old for Christmas. The one year of free time and the 2 yrs of being replaced with no questions asked if broken is worth it. We haven't tried to add other apps. The videos, games, apps, and books in free time have been more than enough to keep him interested. No complaints
 This product is not functional. By nearly activating the device Freetime was automatically suspended on our older child’s device. Then I had to spend over 3 hours updating the software on the device to even get Freetime to function. After that we still were unable to download videos to the sd card (it was not an available option) until 3 days later when apparently the software decided to catch up. Now that it “works” we are just constantly infuriated with how slow it functions and the insane lag time trying to pull up any app/video/game. I find it hard to believe that amazon sent me a new device as our older child’s device was NEVER this bad and we’ve had it 2 years. To say we’re disappointed is an understatement.
 You can't search for books in the Freetime Library. It is just a long list of thousands of books.  You can't search on the device or on Amazon.com, you can filter for Unlimited, but not Freetime.  My son is frustrated because he found a series he liked, but now he can't find the next in the series because he has to scroll through thousands of books. I've spent too much time trying to find out how because it seems rediculous that there is no search feature available.  I finally contacted Amazon and they confirmed that there is no way to search.<br/><br/>Parent's have no control over what apps are approved.  Instead there is a group of people at Amazon who think they know better than the parents in determining what is appropriate for their child.  I tried to add a blue filter so my children could read at night, but it is not considered an "educational app" so we can't use it until their reading time is up...<br/><br/>It doesn't work with educational programs that schools use.  For example, I am unable to use Lexia Core 5. This is due to two reasons to the best of my knowledge.  One, flash does not work on the Kindle.  Two, Google and Amazon are in a fight over who gets to use what on what devices, so Amazon has a more limited app store and Amazon devices can't use Google Play even though they are both Android based.<br/><br/>I guess this is a good device if you want to just hand the device to your child after setting their age and send them on their way.  Then Amazon will be their parent and decide what is best.  If you want to be involved in the choices and help your child choose media they enjoy or could use, then this is not a good device.
 Downloading apps, books and movies on this tablet is not intuitive but after watching a great Youtube video I was able to get everything set up. Here is my BIG problem with these tablets. I got them for use in the car and on airplanes and as soon as you turn the WIFI off they don't work very well. The icons only stay on about 50% of the time, the rest of the time my kiddos have to choose from blank squares and hope they like whatever show/app/book they picked. Also, I've downloaded things and shared them with my kids that I still cannot access on my kids devices. Some are there at times and not at others. Their unreliable, and when I'm boarding a plane for a 5 hour flight with a 2 and a 3 year old unreliable is scary. I would not recommend these.
 I want to write this review because I really want that my little comment can also make amazon realize there is definitely need more improvement to this kid tablet.<br/>Pros: the price is perfect, the case is really strong<br/>Cons: I really like that amazon allow us to create a profile for the child, however definitely it needs some improvement. 1) the age filter when you place age 4, it shows so many things, some books are Long sentences that children of 4 yrs old can’t learn. Also on the child profile home screen it shows soo many icon, if there is a filter for us the parent to choose how many books, apps, videos to show on the child home screen that will be perfect. Also put a search engine for us to choose what kind of book my children can read. Just like when we go to a library, there is a section of books for 4 years of age, there will be tons of books and we as a parent choose the right reading level for 4 yrs old of age same as older children
 These tablets are absolute junk. I purchased the Fire Kids Tablet for my daughter for Christmas in 2016. Less than 4 months later, the tablet's charging port failed and would not accept a charge. As the Kids tablets are under warranty for 2 years, it was replaced with a refurbished version. The refurbished version was super slow and glitchy and eventually, in the summer of 2018, the charging port on the refurbished tablet failed again. The plug seemed loose and was obviously the very same charging port problem we had with tablet #1. In July 2018, Amazon replaced the refurbished tablet with a brand new one. In December 2018, merely 2 days after Christmas and 2 days beyond the warranty, the charging port on the brand new tablet has now become loose, and stopped accepting a charge.<br/>After an hour long chat with an Amazon representative, Amazon has refused to fix or replace this tablet, and is "very sorry for the inconvenience." The representative tried to offer a 15% discount on a new tablet, which I refused. There is absolutely no way I would spend another dime on an Amazon tablet knowing that within months the charging port will fail. Beware. There is only a 3 month warranty on the tablets without the Kid's package. I will not be purchasing another Amazon tablet device.
 This is a great tablet for my son. It allows him to download a TON of apps, he tries them all so we are constantly deleting so he can try a new one. He is five so he is pretty hard on it but it works great. Fast and reliable, which is great because 5 year olds let you know when something disappoints them!<br/>I like the kids mode but also that it has a regular mode so that I can use it for things. Although the biggest flaw is that 80% of the time it wants to start up in Adult mode - which means you have to enter the PIN. So he can't use it independently when that occurs.
 If I could give 0 stars I would. Never buying an amazon product again. original wouldn’t keep a charge a little under a year of having it. I received a refurbished one, which I don’t care if it’s new as long as it works. Nope, setup wouldn’t go through right from the start and then two weeks later the volume won’t work either plugged in or otherwise. Now the thing doesn’t even turn on. Amazon is horrible now. They used to have good customer service and it has fallen so far from what it used to be. If you are reading this please don’t get your kid this, in fact don’t buy any of their devices. I regret being an amazon prime member so many years cause obviously they don’t care about loyalty.<br/><br/>EDIT: I will leave my original review up because it still happened and I don’t regret it.<br/>So amazon ended up contacting me after this review was written and wanted to make it right by apologizing for the bad customer service so far and offered me a refurbished replacement again which I was totally cool with. It ended up within a week, I think, dying from some sort of malfunction. Skip forward and I think we did another one or two replacements with each one malfunctioning in a different way within a week of getting it, mostly because of a malfunctioning charging port. They called me every week it seemed like to make sure everything was going good with each replacement so I never had to talk to a bad customer service agent. The last one started messing up the day after I received it and the agent told me that they would give me enough account credit to buy the newer version with a bigger GB space. I’m happy with how it ended of course. The only bad thing I would say is that they should be checking these refurbished tablets before they are sent out. But my customer service experience definitely improved.
 I talked to 3 different reps, each asking the same things like they don't talk to each other. FIRST BEING told it was out of warranty (Wasn't out of 2 year warranty). When confronted that it literally says 2 year warranty on the product page was told it must not be reflecting due to an error. Eventually (30+ minutes) led to getting a new one.<br/><br/>This is the second kindle to have the same problem. The usb port WILL fail.
 My young daughter used to love the kids fire. The widgets at the top of the screen made it easy for her to use and choose between movies, apps, books and characters. But the recent update took away her ability to use the fire independently. Now it is just a list of titles. She quickly got tired of having to come to me to figure out if what she was looking at was an app, book or movie. And she got frustrated when she thought she was clicking on an app and it turned out to be a book. She has no way of telling them apart  The update is fine for older children who can read. But for younger, non-readers it is terrible.
 I purchased 2 of these for Christmas 2017. While my children love them they simply are not the quality I expected for the price! Within a couple months of purchase the charging ports went out on both of them. After almost an hour on the phone with Amazon "support" and going over the same dozen questions (for their "no questions asked" replacement policy) with 3 DIFFERENT PEOPLE I was finally able to get approval for the replacement tablets. Now here we are again on the phone needing a replacement for the replacement for the SAME EXACT ISSUE! I'm now a half hour into the call and on my 6th person. I'm really disappointed overall because the Free Time Peruvian is wonderful for kids (and is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars)! As far as the quality of the device I've had better luck with considerably cheaper brands. These just aren't built to withstand frequent charges and use by children (mine are 8 &amp;15).
 Customer service is a joke! Bought the tablet late November and here it is March 1.<br/>Called and said the tablet wasnt charging so they asked A LOT of questions.. ..(isnt that what the "no questions 2 year return policy"  promises WON'T happen?)<br/>Anyway received a replacement...A REFURBISHED one...(Even though i had originally bought a new one)...this one lasted a few weeks but eventually the screen went black and only audio was working...also the battery was draining quickly...BARELY GETTING 4 HOURS OUT OF IT...<br/><br/>called AGAIN....<br/><br/>and despite the fact that i already called about the same issue (bad battery performance) the not so swift phone rep tells me to wait 2 hours and he will call me back to walk me through a reset....<br/>And of course 2.5 hours later you, guessed it....NO CALL. I guess my time of waiting is not important to them....why do they need to reset it anyway???...i was told that is what they did when i sent it in the 2nd time when they supposedly uploaded new software updates)...<br/><br/>Major regret...time spent on the phone, (also STILL WAITING on a return call), hassle to have it shipped back x2, and just WAY TOO MUCH aggravation...and STILL dont have a functional product!!!<br/><br/>Save yourself ...DONT MAKE MY MISTAKE!!!
 My daughter loves her Fire 7 Kids Tablet!  She is 3 years old with mild cerebral palsy, who is non-verbal.  With the Amazon Freetime, she can download her own games, select her own shows, and we will be investing in continuing the service after the free year.  She loves learning and her access to learning apps and books makes her so happy!  It is easy to maneuver for her and I like knowing that she can't do too much harm (like can't go to the internet, etc.), but if she does, there is the awesome guarantee!  The case is rugged and, so far, we haven't had any problems with it.  Highly recommended!
 While it lasted this was a great and sturdy tablet. We got screen protectors for it as well to prevent scratches. Everything was great ten out of nowhere, with no damage to the tablet, it stops charging. Amazon has made it an excruciatingly painful process to get it fixed since we still have a warranty and it’s been close to a month since it broke in the first place. Still no service ticket created by their tech staff either, so not only are we down a tablet but we are In the dark as to whether or not they will fix it. I would go for a new  version instead of this one, maybe they’ve finally fixed the charger ports.<br/>The year free access to the kids unlimited is well worth it, but they do that with all the tablets so again, don’t waste the time on these that I can promise are going to break .
 • Item was purchased for a gift and quit charging within 10 days. Amazon wanted to replace the new, defective item I purchased with a refurbished kindle under the one year warranty. I was very disappointed because if I’d bought anything else from them that was defective within 10 days of purchase, it would be replaced with a NEW item.<br/><br/>• I’m glad to see they added support in the kids freetime app for audiobooks, but my older kids cannot get any of the boooks we have purchased and added to their profile to download or open. They can only access them outside of the freetime app, defeating the purpose of limiting the kids access to specific content only
 DO NOT BUY!!! IF I COULD GIVE NO STARS I WOULD!!! On top of being nearly impossible to use with any website not preloaded- even ones used in a first grade classroom- the claim that it is a kid proof case is utter nonsense!! My 6 year old left her Kindle on the couch and it slid 3 feet off the couch onto the floor and shattered the screen- WITH THE PROTECTIVE CASE ON!!!<br/>Save yourself headache and frustration and just get an iPad mini with an Otterbox.
 Kid uses this a lot. It's not very fast and slows down after a couple of weeks of use. App launching and user switching gets horribly slow and the videos stop launching in the kids free time app. A resetof the device gets it back up to speed but it's annoying to do that every other week. Then downloading all the apps again drives my kid nuts, it's not that fast at downloading the apps, and it's not our internet that is slow, it's the Amazon servers. the tablet is cheap and will  get frustrating over time. Get a faster tablet for your kids if they will be using it daily.<br/><br/>Also it's a micro USB port, totally not ok for kids, barely ok for adults. Find something with a usb c connection. We took advantage of the no questions warranty replacement when the power port broke. They shipped out a replacement in couple of days after we shipped the n broken one back.<br/><br/>The case is awesome, protected the tablet for lots of falls and trips tumbling down the carpeted stairs.<br/><br/>The free time app used to be good. They just came out with an update and it's semi junk now. My 4 year old has a hard time finding the content he wants. They put things in odd categories with small links for navigation, it's fine for adults but not kids. There is a ton of content both videos and games. That's one reason to put up with the junk tablet. The games are only available if you use Amazon device. You can load the app on on any Android device but only get the books and video content. There are controls to limit the content. You can set an age range as a filter then you can go through and select items you don't want to show up. We did quite a bit of filtering of content, which they add stuff frequently so you have to keep track of what your kid is using.<br/><br/>In the end we decided to get a Samsung tablet from Costco on sale, loaded a child Google account which puts lots of restrictions on the tablet and started specifically purchasing content through the Google play store for both apps and video. Amazon almost provides too much content on junk devices. It's just wasn't worth it for our family. It was a great starter device and did expose us to lots of good content for kids. Just not a good long term set up.

My kids love the all of the freetime games, books and apps.  There are so many to choose from and I don't have to sit next to them and make sure they aren't clicking on things they are supposed to.  I LOVE that I can limit the times they are on the tablet, the length of time and even the things they are doing for amounts of time. This tablet is truly everything I was looking for, for my younger kids.<br/>HOWEVER, I bought a package of two on the Black Friday Sale and it hasn't even been 6 months and I have already had to have both replaced because of the charging ports.  They are really lose when you first get them and it keeps getting worse as they are used.  These tablets are for kids and should have a little better charging system.  I will hand it to Amazon, they have the two year guarantee and I had no issues with the first replacement (working on the 2nd one now).  I'm just sad that I'm probably going to have to buy new ones every two years when the warranty runs out!  Please fix the issue, I love these tablets!
 This is a lot of fun at a very low price for a toy.  It is a full featured kindle, but it will be used as a dedicated toy.  The Free Time included in the Kids Kindle really makes the kids kindle the one to buy.  A neighbor decided to save money by buying a regular Kindle, and a rubber case.  Big mistake.  Free time is what makes it worthwhile for my 3 year old grandson.  He instantly gravitated to Catman, and the Elmo coloring pages.  Yes, it’s a coloring book too.  You can set a pin to prevent youngsters from going outside Freetime.  My thought now is to replace the Kindle when free time expires, rather than pay a monthly charge.  When he outgrows it, he will have several regular kindles.  That will be handy if one is damaged after the warranty ends.
 These are great for the first 9-10 months but after that they start to act up. I have 4 of these kids tablets and every single one of them has had an issue. Issues such as charging, apps closing on their own, the whole tablet restarting on it's own, and more. The kids free time app is great but they don't keep up with updating the apps in it so my kids get frustrated and upset when they suddenly can't play their favorite game because they haven't updated the app within the app. Unfortunately after having these for a year now my husband and I have decided to buy our kids new tablets from a better company.
 I bought this for a long road trip with my 3 year old son in July. It was the best tablet I could have gotten him! The amazon free time is awesome, tons of shows and games to download for the trip. He loves this thing. But in typical 3 year old form he threw a fit and threw it and of course cracked the screen in December. Now this thing has been dropped and bounced of off many surfaces so I was a little surprised when the screen cracked. But let me tell you...amazon is AMAZING. They honored the 2 year, no questions asked replacement guarantee. They sent me a shipping label, I sent it on a Tuesday and I had my new one that Friday during the Christmas rush!!! So if you have any question on a tablet for your young child...get this. 100% without a doubt.
 Don't waste your money. I originally bought these tablets for my 2 children for Christmas last year. They had an ipad that they shared, but I thought for the price of these Fire tablets...I would get them each one for Christmas. The first problem we went through was that there favorite apps from the ipad weren't available with the fire tablet including YouTube kids. This was a game changer as YouTube kids is their favorite app. I did search ways to get YouTube kids on the tablet but I couldn't figure out the secret. Next, the apps/programs/books/etc that are originally on the tablet take forever to  open up. This is not the best with a 3 and 6 year old as they were use to the ease and speed of the ipad (note: the ipad we have is the very first ipad ever sold...so we are not talking the newest edition). Finally, as of today...less than a year of having the tablet...my son's tablet stopped charging and he can no longer use it. The price is great but it is not worth the hassle for a product that doesnt even last the year.
 I wish I could give this product 0 stars, but here we are. I ordered this tablet for my 6 year old son in April. It worked, until August. When suddenly he was no longer able to load anything on his homepage, rendering the tablet completely useless. I’ve been an amazon customer for years and have never had an issue with an item, until now. Keep in mind this item specifically says it can be replaced for ANY reason.<br/><br/>I contacted customer service and was transferred to the kindle department who had me troubleshooting for half an hour. Nothing worked. Then they said they would call me back in half an hour. Nothing. 2 hours later i receive a phone call during dinner that i missed. So i email them, no response. Today, 3 days later, i email again and receive a response saying to call them and they will walk me through troubleshooting( which I’ve already done) and IF needed replace the tablet.<br/><br/>This tablet stopped working back in August. It is now December. The reason we went with the amazon kids fire tablet is because of the worry free replacement guarantee. So if you’re looking to purchase, save your money, and your time. What a headache and now a very expensive paperweight.
 Very mixed feelings about it. Kids interface runs slow, whether downloading  (installing) or running an app. Once switched back to parents' profile with normal interface, it runs smooth just like the Fire 8 HD I bought last November. Tried to sideload google play store and youtube on this tablet, successful on either parents or kids' profile but won't show up on kids' home screen unless activate the app from file folder directly, which can not be done if no ES file explorer file manager or similar APP installed first, and no way for a 3-year-old toddler to do that. My kids enjoy the kids app but whine about being unable to watch youtube as they do on Android phones. The youtube APPs under Fire App store is not as good as Android ones by my kids' standards, so that's a big downfall unfortunately. Other than that, a very good one for young kids to expand their interest and practice various skills if used properly and with parental supervision.
 A good tablet. I'm not a big fan of the FaceTime Unlimited kids feature though. I also don't like how you can't have Google Play unless you manipulate the system... Mainly because Amazon's store hardly has ANYTHING on it... Barely any kids games. When you download them through the FaceTime Unlimited account you have berter options, but still not much. Also in the FaceTime one you can't even see what the game is or read a description. Only option is to download it, so that stinks. The tablet runs well though, and I like the actual tablet. Just the FaceTime and Amazon store to download stuff sucks. They need to improve it severely and add a lot more stuff to it.
 These are perfect for my grandkids and I love the Free Time app that lets them use appropriate apps. I'm not happy with myself because I got the kindle for my grandson for Christmas and the price went up $20 ... now I need one for my granddaugthers birthday in March and am kicking myself for not getting two at the same time. They are sturdy and my granddaughter uses it every night at bedtime, sharing (as much as a 4 year old can share) with her 2 year old sister, who is about to get her own IF the price goes back to $79! lol.
 For Christmas we got our son his very own Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet off of Amazon (We gave it to him early so he could use it on our trip). I have never been one to love technology or to rely on it but I am extremely pleased with how kid friendly this product is.<br/>You get to choose the age range you want your child to be in, you can block shows/books/apps (BYE PEPPA PIG), you can set time limits for how long they can use it during the week and on the weekends, can put a time when it's able to turn on and off AND you can make it so they have to do so many minutes of books and educational apps before they get to roam around freely for the remainder of their time.<br/>SUPER, SUPER pleased with this and highly recommend it to any of my fellow parents looking for a great gift for their kiddo!
 Tablet set up for toddler with a free year of Amazon Free Time, a wonderful protective case that holds well in small hands. Literally the best tablet I have bought to date. The ease in which my 3 year old granddaughter will be able to use this is remarkable and parents can monitor what they do and watch. With a 2 year replacement warranty, you cannot find a better tablet for a child focused on their level of interest and learning.  We had to install approximately 7 updates before we could customize it. The year of Amazon Free Time with this tablet plus the warranty plus the awesome tablet with a toddler friendly protective case thats easy to hold, gets 5 stars all the way! Best tablet for kids as you know you'll get at least 2 years out of it.
 All of our kids, big and little, have this kindle now. We love the parental controls for Kindle FreeTime Unlimited, and the wide variety of apps, videos, and books that are available. It's easy for us to block content that is too scary or otherwise inappropriate for our kids' ages. The kindle itself is extremely durable and has survived much at the hands of our toddler, also known as Destroyer of All the Things. Just yesterday, I saw the kindle go flying over the back of the couch and onto a hard stone floor - no cracked screen, no problems with function. The only thing I would change is to add a blue shade feature for the children's profiles. We can use the kindle with blue shade under an adult's account, but the option does not appear on the kids' profiles.
 Wonderful product!  Limited storage space without a memory card but we use it for "research" and phonics centers in my classroom.  Computers are still a little difficult for the kindergartners to use as they are still figuring out how to use a mouse and keyboard but having a set of four kindle fires allows them to explore the books and apps that I've downloaded ahead of time!  The case stands up to dropping and I love that amazon will replace if they are broken.  There are no home buttons like on iPads (something that had to be repaired 4 times when it was in use in the classroom).
 Works well.. didn't know I had to set up a profile so I was ready to return it. I turned it back on and THEN saw the option for a kids profile. I set it up and my daughter LOVES this thing. I love how long it goes on a full charge.. about 8 hours for us. I can remove apps and set up youtube in addition to the apps already built in.<br/>My daughter tossed hers into the bathtub and I didn't know about the worry-free so I ordered another one. When I did find out about it, I called and they set me a replacement the next day then asked me to return the 2nd one I bought. I cannot be more happy.<br/>When the replacement came all I did was log into amazon and my daughter's account popped up so I didn't have to set up another profile for her.
 Bought two for my boys, ages 3 and 5, and one seems like a dud but it still works as long as it’s fully charged. One doesn’t hold power all that much, and it doesn’t load apps each time we’ve tried, and it doesn’t always connect to WiFi. But the second one is great! It has taken me, the mom, a few weeks of playing around with one to better understand this tablet. Some apps are there and easy to access; others are on the tablet but need to be downloaded and that takes a lot of time. I have been told the Fire 7 is better than the Fire 8 or 10 so for the most part, we are happy. My friend reminded me not to use it while it is being charged; he has also been through 3 Fire Tablets so I’ll take his word for it. My boys seem happier with them now that we’ve had them for about a month. The apps are great, the screen is good, the case is solid, and the extra memory cards have been helpful. I’d say we are at a four only because one seems a little off in comparison to the other.
 I have owned, several kindle fires. And every single kindle fire I have ever owned dies because of the charging port. Once the warranty is over, and that port goes out, you are SOL. Now the ports are out on the two kindle fires I purchased for my kids last Christmas, and they want me to send them in for repairs. And the only reason they lasted this long is because I put the kindles away once spring came and we just took them out a few weeks or so ago.  And at this point, I am just done with Kindle Fires all together and will be finding a different tablet for my children.
 All 3 of my Little one’s have this tablet. I absolutely love love love the free time app and how everything is age appropriate. The parental controls are awesome and lets me keep track of my my kids are doing and I can set playtime limits as well as block anything I don’t want them to have access to. It’s very fast and battery life is good. The case is a life saver, very think and soft. Amazon support it amazing, my 6 yr old has cracked the screen after a yr and they sent me a replacement no questions asked!<br/><br/>My only issue would be the actual charging port. It does get loose for some reason.. you can’t let your kiddo pull on the charger or let them play on it while charging. I’ve gone through a lot of chargers and all of them seem to get loose and fall out of the port.. I did contact amazon support and they sent me a shipping label to have it sent In for repairs..<br/><br/>All in all a great kids tablet, and it also has the benefit of normal tablet functions. I’d definitely recommend it.
 I've been letting my toddler use my old Android Tab 4, and wanted a tablet that was more kid friendly.... This is not it...<br/>Cons...<br/>1. This thing is SLOOOOOW, and he loses interest while it's loading.<br/>2. it's not very customizable like the android.  on the android I set up a profile for him and set 6 apps on his home screen.... there's no home screen on the fire kids edition, and he has access to everything even though he doesn't know what any of these thousands of apps are.  So he's selecting apps that are above his level, or are boring, or just aren't good.<br/>3. Apps being suggested aren't age appropriate for a 2 year old, I should be able to set his age and only apps for that age group should be available to him.<br/>4. I want to set his language... even though I set his language to English the tablet is suggesting Spanish apps to him.  I'm not opposed to him learning other languages, but since his mother is Thai, I'd prefer that second language to be Thai, not Spanish... It should be our choice what languages he's learning.<br/>5. There's no home button<br/>6. can't turn on from the screen, and have to feel around deep in the bumper case for the power button and volume<br/><br/>Pros...<br/>1. The bumper case is really nice.
 I decided to ignore the reviews and bought this despite people mentioning it's slow and glitchy. Let me tell you this thing is so slow and glitchy! Should have just bought a regular one instead of a kids one. It has some okay features, but it's not worth the price and to deal with the slowness and glitches. I'm sure I'll be in for a new tablet soon enough though because their charging ports are ridiculously cheesey, I'm sure on purpose so people will have to buy another one since the hassle of replacing it is rarely worth it. I've had several break. I've put a new rule in the house that only I am allowed to plug it in or out since these break so easy.
 This is the third Pad I have purchased for one of my grand kids as I have 8. When ever I have a problem all I need to do is call the Amazon help desk and they solve the problem. My grand kids love these pads and if you start running short of storage space all you have to do is order a larger memory chip.I have had problems and Amazon always replaces the tablet or they will fix it while you are on the phone by going into the pad from their end. The great thing is the parental control so you choose what the kids can and cannot play or watch.
 We bought one for each of our kids on Amazon Prime Day and paid a great price. Love that it comes with a good case and a great warranty.  It's easy to set up parental controls and I can entirely turn off access to Apps and Videos so that only books are accessible or limit the amount of time they can spend in each section (Books, Videos, and Apps).  If you only buy 1, you can set up multiple profiles so each child has their own. Content is geared for each child based on their age and interests.  It comes with a free, one year long subscription to Amazon's FreeTime Unlimited content which is awesome! Tons of good content! And finally, there's a Parent Dashboard so that I cannot only monitor the time my children spend on their Kindle Fire's, but also the exact content they're accessing. The Parent Dashboard also suggests questions to ask the kids about the content they're using which is also a nice touch.
 My son loves this tablet. The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because the battery life sucks you have to charge every morning sometimes through out the day and the way the game apps are is weird they dont give you any information about the game it doesnt even give you the name of the app. You just have to click on it and let it download to find out what it is. The content that's on it is great it give a variety of different stuff. It has some tv shows on it and all kinds of books for them to read. When you buy this you get a year of amazon freetime so you get everything they have for it. This is a great little tablet for kids and toddlers.
 Go ahead, set it to save to you SD Card and insert one.  Watch as it still loads up the hard drive and you are constantly fighting for storage space.  Did I mention that the tablet has only been used by a 5 year old on Free Time?  Here's the kicker:  I have four of these darn things and I spend more time resetting them to their factory default settings than I should ever have to.  Either buy it with more internal memory or give your kids Legos for Christmas.
 I feel cheated. I just brought this tablet for my little niece, and I kept getting the error that said (your amazon freetime unlimited subscription could not be redeemed). I got in contact with amazon 2 times, neither of both could solve the issue. Apparently the freetime subscription only applies in USA.<br/><br/>The beauty of everything is, the tablet is useless without an freetime account, despite being a Prime member for years. It is not possible to use it as a normal tablet, and neither watching content transfered via usb port (not audio, books, videos, nothing).<br/><br/>Here I am, with a brand-new 80usd tablet that cannot be used outside US territory.  And my little niece was so happy when she saw me trying to configure the device. Imagine her face when I was forced to take it back to my place.
 We had purchased two other tablets that are over a year old and never had a problem.  I got this one and had problems from the start with it.  After 5 weeks it stopped even working - it would stay on the FIRE icon screen for an hour and never turn on.  I have called several times and got the run around and told they would replace it with a new one, then we get an email saying that we need to send the tablet in for service, then after another phone call and 3 people - one being a supervisor and on the phone for over 50 minutes and being told multiple times that they would send me a new one, then get back on the line after putting me on hold for over ten minutes and saying that we would need to send it in.  The customer service was terrible!!!  I purchase from Amazon all the time for personal and our business and have NEVER had problems like this.  Very disappointed in Amazon's customer service experience on this product.  If I heard "No problem" one more time with one of their representatives I was going to lose it even more than I already was.  I had to actually tell them to please stop telling me that because there was a problem.  SOOOO frustrated.
 We bought the tablet for our daughter's first birthday. We wanted her to have her own device instead of using my iPhone all the time to watch videos. I soon discovered that she was able to turn off the tablet. I researched this issue and to my surprise there wasn't a function or lock that was already installed on this "kids" addition tablet. I finally found out that I would need to download 4 files in order download the app called touch lock. Even with this lock screen app our daughter is still able to turn off the tablet. I absolutely love Amazon however I feel like this product should have either an app already installed and/or a button lock. With apple products, they have what is called Guided Access under accessibility and allows our daughter to watch her videos and she is unable to control volume and or turn phone off.
 So far so good!!  I got this for my almost 3yr old because the iPad is too big and heavy. I love the profile I can’t set for her only so there is nothing questionable for her to get to!  It’s light and easy for her to hold and play on!  I also love the expandable storage!!  I have downloaded a few movies for our trip this week!!<br/>My only problem is that it is a bit slow to change between applications or even opening applications. I guess I am spoiled by the iPad that has almost no lag time when opening apps. But it’s not really a concern as it is for a child :)
 Picked this up for my 2 year old grandson for Christmas.  It has held up for a year of all of the sticky gummy wet hands a kid can muster up and is still going perfectly.  He has dropped it, spilled milk and tea on it, and again got every sort of food imaginable on it and it cleans up easily and continues to work without issue.<br/><br/>It is tied to my amazon account and have had zero issues with him being able to purchase anything by accident.  I still see all notifications on the lockout screen but again he has no access to purchase which was a big concern of mine.<br/><br/>Perfect size and holds a charge well enough.
 This is a perfect tablet for my 8-year-old daughter. It was initially a bit difficult to get started due to several (around 13) new updates that were needed to be installed. I had to contact Amazon to figure out why I couldn't access the child's internet section and save kid-friendly sites... turns out that I just had to continue to check for any software updates. After all updates were installed, it worked perfectly. There is a parent profile that allows you to control what, how much, and when your child may use the tablet. There are ENDLESS amounts of books, games, and educational apps that can be downloaded to your child's profile. The protective case is bulky but in a good way. If dropped, it is definitely going to protect the tablet. Overall, it was worth the Black Friday price of roughly $70. I gave 4 stars because you will definitely get frustrated with the numerous installs that are needed for it to function properly --- especially if you are unaware that the installs are needed.
 After less than 2 months this device will not charge. I thought, no big deal because it has a 2 year warranty. Never in my life have I ever had such a hard time exchanging something. I have been transferred to THREE different people so far and for some reason they can't comprehend that the device has no power and will not charge despite the fact that I have tried several chargers. They just asked me to restart it. It is DEAD!!! At this point I may just ask for a refund because it should NOT be this difficult to exchange something! The person I am corresponding with this time asks a question, I immediately answer and they answer several minutes later. Before this the device was great. Had perfect parental controls and awesome games to keep my 2 year old entertained. But, if you happen to get a defective one like mine, good luck to you!
 Its OK but it lags often doing simple things like closing and opening apps or going through the menu. games like jetpack joyride lags often and thats an old game that is not demanding. I think it could do with a little more RAM and CPU power to say that this is going to last. Its built good especially  for kids. battery is good but it charges slow. Speaker is weak. The screen is good and bright.
 It’s just not worth it. Spend the money and get a good tablet. The Amazon FreeTime is $5/month. You get the first year free, but it’s just isn’t entertaining long term for kids. My son got bored with it, and had to let him watch Netflix and YouTube on the “other” side of the tablet. I finally got him an iPad and it’s just so much better.<br/>You can’t download apps since it’s amzon, and not a apple/Android. The apps are kind of like fakes to things we use daily. Good luck finding a YouTube kids that actually works.<br/>Also don’t even get me started with the “no questions asked” warranty. It’s almost laughable. They will want you to do everything to not send it back. Then once you finally get them to, they will send you a label that you have to print and then you have to send just the tablet part back. They will send you a used one!<br/>My sons tablet stopped charging and he only had this for not even a year. The speakers were barely loud anymore and it just sucked. I could see this for maybe babies in the car. 1-2 maybe. But that’s it. Just wasn’t worth it, and forget it when it’s at full price!
 I'm so thrilled with the customer service on this Product. We have owned this for almost one year, bought last xmas. When the screen stopped functioning properly recently, I called Amazon and they made it easy to send in for service. They only keep it for 5 days and return it repaired or replace it if needed. My 4.5 yr old daughter is elated to have her tablet back. Thanks so much for making it easy to love this product!<br/>Tablet has been great for car trips and other times when she doesn't have access to her toys. I use the parental controls to monitor and limit her content. It is safe, she doesn't have access to the web and I make sure the apps and books are age appropriate and educational.
 The tablets themselves are fine. However we keep having to send these back because the charging ports only work for a little while. Then you end up having to prop up the charger in just the right way to get them to even charge.  My kids can’t get them to charge without adult help and leaning it just the right way. Then everyone yells “don’t touch it,” because even the slightest movement makes it stop charging again. We have sent our kids’ Kindles back multiple times and get sent new ones. The warranty is nice, but it’d be a lot easier if they would just make a quality product. Amazon has known about the Kindle charging port issues for years and have done nothing to fix it.
 I bought two of these for my kids for long trips and airline travel. For that purpose they are sufficient and there is plenty of FreeTime content to keep them happy. However, I found these extremely unintuitive to set up, and they are slow and glitchy when downloading content. Some content that is downloaded is inexplicably not available without WiFi. It’s not explained upfront that only so many videos can be downloaded at a time (even if you have extra memory), and you simply get an error message with no explanation if you go over the limit. After quite a bit of googling I got the errors figured out and content downloaded. The kids are happy with them for the limited amount of time they get to use them. If I had bought this for myself I would have sent it back immediately because I was so frustrated with the interface.
 I honestly am very disappointed in these tablets. I think the battery life is good. But they are not user friendly at all and with a 2 yr old,5 yr old and a newborn at home I'm looking for easy. . Maybe I'm too used to the droids...but these are a royal pain in the butt. Everytime you turn them off you have to start back at the home page. If you don't pause your utube videos before turning off the sound continues to play. There are many APS my kids love that are not available on these which if you have young children you know this is a huge deal. I do like that you can switch between users on each tablet easily but that's about the only user friendly option. We've gone through a lot of tablets between my 2,5, and 40 yr old and these are by far my least favorite.
 I wanted to love this tablet but I hate it. The only thing I really like about it is the case. The battery dies so quickly so I feel like I’m constantly charging it. And the Freetime program leaves so much to be desired. I definitely don’t see myself paying for it once the free year is up. It doesn’t let me control what category of content my child has access to (e.g. videos, games, etc), which is frustrating because I would like for him to only be able to use it for games and books. The program also shows kids recommended apps, not just what you as a parent have chosen to download. So my son is always asking to play/watch things I don’t want to download but that he sees on his screen. Also the apps take ages to download so you can’t decide you want something new and then get to use it right away. The whole thing is so frustrating to use. For the price I guess it’s fine because you obviously can’t really buy something else better in this price range. But I’m seriously feeling like it would have been better to invest more in a better product that wouldn’t be such a headache to use.
 Bought 2 of these the tablets them self are great, never had an issue with them however you get a year of Amazon FreeTime  for free and then its $2.99 a month after that yeat but be very careful because they do not tell you that when you purchase these that FreeTime is put under your account..... i bought the 2 as a gift for a friends grand children and that Year of FreeTime should go towards whoever accepts to activate the FreeTime but thats not how Amazon did me it was linked to my Amazon account i purchased it through without even knowing..... then it says you can cancel the subscription at any time under the family portal but according to the rep the family portal is on the accual tablets which i do not have.... i never set the tablets up just ordered them so my account was never linked to the tablet themselfs just purchased them... so be careful and just know this before buying.
 Want to waste money?? Here is your chance!! Act now with this purchase and be sucked into the "fire tablet" triangle. We purchased 2 tablets in 2017 for both of our kids. In the summer of 2018, my daughters tablet stopped downloading apps (wouldnt delete apps, wouldnt add apps). I left a review for this product and customer service contacted me with a "solution". They remotely accessed the tablet, fixed the app problem (or so we thought) not even 5 minutes later, the screen went out. I was sent a replacement tablet for this one. Replacement tablet worked until around December 2018, then stopped charging. I had to PURCHASE another tablet (because I guess Amazon only cares enough for one replacement). New tablet comes, everything is fine, now my sons tablet stopped charging. I refuse to give Amazon anymore business or money. Such a waste.
 These are GREAT tablets for kids and I never worry about them seeing anything that isn't age-appropriate.  They're very durable and offer great battery life.  They aren't, however, waterproof as we learned when my son spilled water into the charging port.  Since I've had the tablet for less than 2 years Amazon covered it under warranty.  I submitted the warranty request on Thursday, shipped it to Amazon that afternoon, and received a brand new Fire on Monday morning.  Great product and great service!!
 At first I was skeptical because it requires parental set up. I know that sounds terrible, but keeping your kids safe from so much junk online really does take work and this product allows you to do that.  I just had to step up as a parent and choose which websites my kids could access.  That was where most of the set up time was involved for me, but it is all pretty straight forward.  I'm very happy I did it though, and I think we will be very happy with it.  I do like the lightweight kids case and all it needs is a ballistic glass screen protector.  No questions asked one year warranty was a selling point for sure.  I hope it lasts!
 This is probably the worst item I have ever bought on Amazon. The tablet responds slow, the menus are unclear and after spending hours to figure out how to start the tablet up it turns out that it is full of terrible content that I am unable to remove. The user interface is not tailored to kids at all. I struggled to understand how to navigate the menus and needed to read several forums and manuals to make basic changes.<br/><br/>I have ordered hundreds of items on Amazon and I have never sent anything back, but I will happily stand in line at the postoffice to return this thing.
 The tablet itself is durable, and FreeTime Unlimited offers a good range of content for the price.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the parental controls are absolute garbage. If you have multiple devices in your family (for several children, for instance) any accounts you create on one device are immediately visible to the other. However, for whatever reason they've decided NOT to share parental control settings. If you want to limit a child to 1h of video per day you must modify the settings on every single Fire Kids device attached to your account. Additionally the web "Parent Dashboard" doesn't let you configure or see these settings.<br/><br/>There doesn't seem to be any log for changing these settings. If you happen to have a particularly intelligent/persistent child who guesses the PIN they can change their settings at any time, then change them back before returning the tablet at night.<br/><br/>Being able to grant access to specific books, videos and now items from my Audible library is a good start to parental controls, but Amazon needs to focus on the missing pieces of functionality to earn a higher review from this consumer.
 I selected these for my children who are entering Kindergarten to occasionally engage educational apps.<br/><br/>Freetime has a frustrating user interface.  There is no easy or obvious way to sort / search for the apps I want my children to use - and with the unlimited subscription that comes as part of the purchase for the device - just endless scrolling.<br/><br/>Once downloaded, there is no simple way to organize the apps in a predictable way so my children can easily find the ones they like.  Instead, the home page requires endless side scrolling, and a reshuffling of apps based on recent usage.<br/><br/>Because its not obvious to kids how to get out of an app (a hidden up swipe to reveal the home button), nor is it easy to find others of interest, they get stuck in one app for the entire time.<br/><br/>The lure of endless videos trumps the educational focus I had hoped for.
 My grand daughter loves this tablet. I had to return it due to the fact that it quit charging after 3 months, but, Amazon is great with returns. I was also informed that since you return and reorder the tablet that the 2 year replacement starts over with the new order. I hope that Amazon fixes the charging port issue, but as easy as Amazon makes the return process, I will not complain. This thing gets dropped several times a day and it is not harmed at all with this case. Even when, as anyone with toddlers will know, her temper kicks in and she throws it down. I will say that if you need to return anything do it by phone or chat for the very best experience. I love Amazon!
 First you pay for the tablet, then you pay for the subscription (if you don’t the tablet becomes completely useless). Complete ripoff. Don’t be lured by the content and parental controls, ALL OF IT disappears when you stop paying for the monthly subscription!! Every app, show, book, and all parental controls. It’s a money grab, not a screen time solution.
 The tablet is great for the first couple months... If I had written a review right after getting the tablet for our toddler, I probably would have given it five stars. After a couple months it starts freezing. If you are using your phone’s hotspot, half the time it loses internet connection and shuts off mid-video. That’s super fun for you and your toddler, by the way. The problem only gets worse as each month passes to the point where it takes forever to load videos, loses internet connection, and has some other glitchy stuff happen on a daily basis.<br/><br/>You have to start paying for the programs after you’ve had it a year? No problem. The tablet probably won’t make it that long.<br/><br/>I do like a lot of the apps and videos. They’re great for getting ideas on what to stream from Netflix or look up on YouTube.
 I ordered this tablet for my 5 year old who LOVES my iPad and former Android tablet. They are decent for kids but I kinda hate the kids’ display. I wish it was more like an Android layout but it has an icon menu that you swipe in order to find your apps. This gets really irritating because there is no way to see all of your apps at once so my kids don’t explore beyond the few apps that they have used recently since those appear at the beginning of the icon swipe bar. I’m not really sure how to explain it but I just wish there was a page with the apps all shown on it. Anyway, I’m glad I bought these on Prime day because if I had paid full price for them I would have been irritated!
 I bought the 2 pack of these Kindles so that the kids (5 years and 2.5 years) would stop messing with and changing things on my and my wife's phones.  I have only had one Kindle fire before this, a 2nd generation 7", and it worked great and had great battery life.  After it stopped working for some unknown reason I decided to get these for the kids.  I thought that they could learn some responsibility with having their own device.  It is unavoidable, this tech is in the classroom and is not going anywhere.  I would give Kindle Free Time 5 stars because within two weeks my 2.5 year old counted to 10 just by playing the learning games.  They get to have their time and I get to set limits on how long they get to use them a day.  I love how the kids choose to play educational games, maybe because they don't know that they are.  I have many more examples but over all I really like the 1 year free trial of Free Time and will more than likely renew the subscription.  I have and prefer Amazon products (the Kindle fire I mentioned, three Echo dots, two fire sticks) so I thought this was a safe bet, BUT... I feel like Amazon went a little cheap on these kindles.  My old Kindle Fire felt indestructible but these feel almost disposable.  I am glad that they came with the foam cases because I am not sure they would survive a drop.  The batteries on these kindles are really bad.  My old kindle could sit idle for days and only drop 10%.  These things lose their charge really quick and you have to charge constantly.  I can put a Kindle down at 90% in idle mode with the screen off and in a matter of hours it is at 10%.  Both Kindles act the same in this respect so I know it is not a factory dud.  I am not sure how long the batteries can last so I am glad it came with a 2 year no questions ask warranty. In the end, I would say go for it if you have kids and are wanting to use the Kindle Free Time subscription.  It is all Kid safe content and I don't have to worry about in app purchases or them finding weird stuff on Youtube.  Also, it works as a normal Kindle Fire in the parent profile which is nice if I need to look something up or need to use a bigger screen.  Though the device could be a lot better, backing it with a 2 year no questions ask warranty makes Amazon redeem themselves a little bit on this one.  I hope future Kindle Fires are much better though in at least the battery life.
 My daughter's 5th generation Kids Edition Fire was exchanged under warranty. We received a 7th gen Fire as the replacement. My daughter was a bit frustrated by the different button locations at first however, she quickly adapted. We absolutely love the kids edition kindle fire tablets. The 2 year warranty, 1 year access to currated kids freetime content, &amp; customizable parental controls make it worth every penny. I do wish kindle &amp; google play could get along so I don't have to purchase the same apps from both in order to have access across all devices in our family but it is definitely not a dealbreaker, not even close.
 I hate the operating system on this thing. It doesn't function like a normal Android, there is no play store (app store for iOS users). Amazon locks you into their own operating system and crappy app store. Then if you want good apps from the Google Play store, you have to hack it to get it loaded. But then once you have it loaded and downloaded the REAL YouTube Kids app (which isn't available in Amazon) you can't add it to your child's profile. The ONLY upside to this is that it's inexpensive and if you're okay with be locked into a TERRIBLE OS, then this is for you. But for those of you that want something familiar and not a pain in the butt to deal with, get an iPad or ANY OTHER TABLET.
 Hate giving this a bad review bc my kids love the tablet, and they are durable. However— I have 2 tablets that I bought a year ago and the battery/charger fails every few months. There is clearly something defective with how this is made, and it’s very frustrating for the customer. I hate having to take time to contact customer support when Amazon should be taking appropriate steps to fix the defects before production. Not sure what’s going on, but something needs to be done as there is clearly a trend that this isn’t properly made. Also, annoying when your toddler is upset that their favorite toy is no longer available to them.
 While I love the kids mode and the parental controls, I'm pretty pissed about one thing. We got the tablet in August, and in October it stopped charging. We had it replaced per the warranty, and received the replacement in early November. It's now end of December and the replacement tablet is having the exact same issue.  According to my research, this is a common issue with these tablets. I'm not even going to bother replacing it. I'll buy something that's better quality instead. It only gets 2 stars because of the parental controls, otherwise it would be 0!
 I bought two of these in a promotion one for each of my oldest children and I love them just as much as they do! I loved the price, the limitations available but with the limitations the freedom for my children to explore and read. They have their own world within their kindles! great buy and the free apps we have found have even helped my children in their schooling! cannot say enough good things about this product. I did purchase a sd card so that my children could have a lot of free space to download all the books and apps they want.
 Been great so far especially the free time - just wish you could create free time sessions for different periods of the day eg morning limits vs evening limits. Also would have been nice if tablets were the same  colour as the cases
 UPDATE: I wrote a review for these tablets Summer of 2018 also stating I had one that was inoperable and almost immediately received a call from an Amazon Rep who assisted with getting me a replacement. Within a week I received instructions on how to send back the tablet -- I sent it back and because it could not be repaired they sent me a "replacement" (not a new one - a refurbished one). It has worked since June2018 until this past weekend (less than a year later). This replacement tablet will no longer hold a charge and you have to play around or hold with the charger cord in place for it to charge the device (and I have tried multiple charger cords and outlets). My kids love these tablets because it's entertaining but these are bad tablets after 6 months or so. Content consistently needs downloaded again or it will not open on the tablet, they freeze, crash, black screens with volume but no picture. For the price &amp; content this isn't a bad tablet but it's also not an ideal tablet for kids in regards to the amount of issues they have. I spend more time troubleshooting issues than my kids do playing with them.<br/><br/>See my previous review below::<br/>I purchased 2 Fire 7 kid edition tablets in December 2017 -- I have twin girls and wanted them both to have one. The girls Loved them but as of this month one of them will not charge so I am unable to turn it on. The warranty that came with the device (ironically) lapsed in April and it's been difficult to reach someone at Amazon to find out if it has a defect regarding the charging unit. I am very-very disappointed because I have 2 Amazon tablets of my own (that still work) so I was really taken aback by this technical setback. Luckily I have an extra for my daughter to use but it does not have the kid features. Hoping that I can have this matter resolved properly and pray that the tablet my other daughter is using will not have a glitch
 Just received this as scheduled and was as described. Was a gift for my daughter and she was extremely excited. I wouldn't have been able to afford it without the option to make payments. Thank you for that option.
 Update:<br/>Technical support reached out to me and we were able to get everything squared away.  The tablet is running great now. Some if the things I was having issues with were my own oversight of not understanding how everything was running or set up.  Tablet has been running great now.<br/><br/>It has already been a pain. I just got it today.  It is so slow it's ridiculously. Went to set it up and it just kept circling back to the restore screen while backing up my information. Would say my internet connection was slow when it was fine. Started with ten minutes each time it came back around. The third time around it added on a minute after every couple minutes. Finally I pressed for it to restore in the background. I can't get half of the apps to open. They just sit with the little cirlce like they are thinking. If no changes by tomorrow I will be returning this.
 My parents purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. I wondered how well that would work out considering she's 18 months old. It's come in very handy already especially with the free trial to Free Time. I've read books to her while we're waiting for food, running errands, etc., there are plenty of easy enough apps, such as coloring, for her to play with and not to mention unlimited bubbles guppies which is her favorite thing. I can see her getting a ton of use for many years as she grows up. I love the parental control options, which I'll use more as she grows up. Also the big rubber case makes this thing pretty indestructible. All around, it's a worthy investment!
 It’s reallllly slow. I feel like there are better tablets out there that aren’t so aggravating to work with. I like tablets to load faster than this does. It doesn’t even respond to my taps right away either.
 We bought this product for travel, primarily for use on an airplane. It's basically worthless. The interface is incredibly cumbersome and difficult to use. In addition, without a strong wifi connection there is very little you can do with it. We didn't understand that, unlike an ipad, content is streaming as opposed to downloaded. We learned this the hard way, during the trans-Atlantic flight for which we purchased it (there isn't a wifi connection over the Atlantic ocean). After that terrible experience, we attempted to download some shows so that we could use it on our next flight. That apparently didn't work - once on the aircraft, we couldn't access the shows we thought we had downloaded. We tried one more time - our next flight had wifi. Even connected to the plane's wifi, we couldn't watch anything. I'm assuming that's because an airplane's wifi connection isn't fast/strong enough. I suppose if your purpose is to let your kid use this at home with a strong wifi connection, I can see how it could be useful. If you are buying this for travel, don't waste your money. We might as well throw it away.
 Had to get a new tablet for my son because the old one almost caught fire. Luckily this tablet is everything I could have hoped for in a kid's tablet.<br/><br/>The Freetime unlimited is such a grand idea, so many apps that I had to pay for are available for free as long as you subscribe, but it comes free for the first year. My son has already found his favorite apps and videos. He's even gotten into the books.<br/><br/>And the freetime unlimited also keeps kids in the app so I never have to worry about him getting out of the app and into things he has no business getting into. And with the parental controls I can make sure that he doesn't stay up pass his bedtime playing on his tablet. It's really good at stopping all activity at the time you set it for.<br/><br/>Another great thing about this tablet (though not so great for me) is the sound. It can pack a punch sound wise, especially in quiet rooms. Often time I find myself turning it down just for peace of mind. And the screen display is lovely. Not too big and not too small with a crisp picture. And very bright display, had to turn it down so it wouldn't blind us.<br/><br/>Delivery for this product was super humanly fast. It came 4 days before the expected date which was great because my son was getting restless not having a tablet. Then again ordering straight from Amazon has always done me well in speed. And the tablet was unharmed, even the box it came in was pristine.<br/><br/>Also the tablet is super lightweight. When I received it in the mail I almost thought I had an empty box. Because my son's old table had a nice weight to it, this one is super light and he can carry it everywhere with no problem. Haven't had the chance to test out the protective case yet, and hopefully never will.<br/><br/>My only issue with this tablet, but it doesn't stop me from giving it 5 stars, is battery life. My son can run a battery down like none other, and I find myself having to charge the tablet often. Though I haven't let it outright die yet, I can't afford to let that happen. My son loves his new tablet too much to wait for it to charge. But I remembered there's a low power mode so I'll see how good that works for him.<br/><br/>Overall this tablet is fulfilling every need my son has, for such a great price too, and I see myself maybe getting a fire tablet for myself in the future.
 I purchased this tablet so my son would have something to entertain himself during a 18 hour road trip. Friends also own two of these tablets and recommended the purchase.<br/>We ran into a problem less than 3 hours after the start of the drive. One of the games that I had downloaded for him stopped working and force quit the program. Normally opening the app would fix that issue and get him playing again, but for some reason the app disappeared from kids profile I set up for him. I quickly discovered that without a internet connection the tablet started to lose functionality. More and more apps disappeared from his profile, including movies which I had supposedly downloaded directly to the device.<br/>Once we reached our overnight destination, I got it on the wireless network and everything came back after a reboot. I chalked it up to a remote glitch of some sort. Until 3 hours after leaving the hotel it started doing the same thing again.<br/>It seemed that the only way I could get apps to work was to exit the kids profile and find it under the cumbersome OS that Amazon uses to organize the tablet in the parents profile area.<br/>Needless to say this made our trip a bit more stressful given I had bought it to reduce our stress for his entertainment. I don't know why this tablet acted in this manner as when it's on a live network it works okay, but without internet it's like it forgets the apps exist.<br/>This tablet also seems very cheaply made. While it has a nice kids cover for it, I am not pleased with the quality of the screen, or the fact that you couldn't hear over even the road noise through headphones when they were plugged in and turned all the way up.<br/>I have purchased many tablets over the years (much to my wife's dismay). I never thought I would find a tablet that was worse then the $80 Sophix Tablet I found at Kroger, but here we are. I know it's a kids tablet, but I expected a lot more.<br/>I know the iPad mini tablets are double the price "used", but those have much better restrictions for little kids, and are far easier to use than this tablet.<br/>I'm an android user (have been for a decade), so you know it would take a lot for me to recommend Apple products.<br/>Keep your sanity, spend a little more for better quality.
 Bought this for my grand daughter for Christmas to listen to books and watch kid safe videos! She absolutely loves it and no longer wants to take possession of our phones all the time. She’s almost 2 and easily selects the books she wants to listen too. She can change screens on her own and we don’t have to worry about her accessing anything she shouldn’t be on.
 Update 12/5/18 to 3stars<br/>Was contacted by tech support.  They were very nice. My device is still under warranty.  They are having me send in my device to try and fix and replace.  Will update review after return is finished.<br/><br/>Below review was written in frustration after calming a crying 3yo.<br/><br/>Tablet worked great for about 8 months.  I bought it from target. Well really the only thing that worked great were the Amazon prime videos and Netflix. The apps are slow to download,  but worked well once they download.  No issues after downloading.  Then 8 months in  any of charging cords would not work.  So now I just have a dead tablet and a crying child because it doesn't work.
 Good- has a ton of stuff for kids, you can control when WiFi can be use, set up how much screen time is allowed, able to download some things that will work with out WiFi, case has kept tablet safe super kid proof, affordable<br/><br/>Bad- to overwhelming for a younger child with so many steps to get to a simple video , battery life is short and you have to fully shut it off so it doesn’t die on you(8hr including screen lock or less with brightness on high) once in app desired tablet is slow! For example using Netflix it takes forever to start playing a video and children are not patient!<br/><br/>****Update this worked great for 7months but i can’t get it charge. (It’s not the cable i tested the cable with a different gadget and it )
 we bought this as a special treat for a long car ride (about 8 hours) for our 4 year old daughter. It worked great for the trip and then for about a month or two following. She only uses it in the car on a long trip, or when she’s in a rough mood and we need to get groceries or other errands done and she’s not feeling it, but never when we are at home so she really couldn’t have worn it down. However, I don’t know if there is a bug or what but it barely holds a charge now for longer than a day, at times it won’t let her do anything if not connected to internet (even the games and shows downloaded directly to the device that should be accessible) and it’s moves at a snails pace.  I don’t know. Maybe we’ve done something wrong but it’s extremely frustrating. She’s barely touched it for months because every time we take it to use it, it’s a huge process.....is it charged fully? Can we gain access to content? Is the wind blowing in the right direction? Is the moon full or only a quarter moon? Seriously.....it feels like every condition has to be just so in order for it to work it doesnt seem worth it. We’re flying for a vacation in a few weeks and I don’t even know if I want to bother to take it with me. My iPad that’s over 4 years old might serve us even better at this point! I’ll probably just throw a more protective case on that and take it with us instead. First and last time we get a kindle. If we get another device for her, it’ll be an iPad. Disappointed. Three stars for it doing what we hoped it would when originally purchased, other than that I’d give it a one for the fact that it works problem free only some of the time.
 I bought this for my 3 yr old daughter and I have set it up for her so that there will be apps and games available for her already on the device when she opens on Christmas.  The free time is awesome and there is a ton of different things for her to try out.  Very easy to use, although she has not tried yet, it is easy for me.  The tablet's quality appears good, the case isn't the greatest quality but it is lightweight and protective so what more can you really ask for, the kids have to be able to hold it comfortably and it not be too heavy.  Awesome product!
 My 3 year old loves it! After using this for a while my only gripe would be that the home buttons react and show up when you slide from the bottom of the screen which is where almost all apps need you to swipe for their games and so it will go to home or if swiping from top it will try to change profiles. Most games are ok and he has learned how to deal with it but it is frustrating when playing a game.  I’m sure there is a setting to get around this but I have not found it.<br/><br/>It is also very durable and I love that he does not have free access to the internet. It also has parent setting including times allowed to use for older kids that play too long.
 I am sorry I bought the Kindle for my grand daughter. After reading the reviews regarding returning a Kindle I am going to pray from this day on that it does not break down, that it works for at least 2-5 years without problems. But it seems that the likelihood of it working that long is very low. There should be something one can do about them putting out  false advertisement. When they post all the wonderful things about the product and how they know what can go wrong and they will replace it "No Questions Asked" they do not tell you "READ THE TINY PRINT 3 PAGE DOCUMENT" of their policy. So, it seems to me that their policy does not match what they  advertise...Maybe a class action needs to be put against AMAZON????  What is also false advertising is the phone number 206-266-2992 is a non-working number. I am beginning to QUESTION Amazon's way of doing business.....Is their new policy "Say Whatever It Takes To Get The Public To Buy" and whatever happens after they pay, "WE DON"T CARE" because we got what we wanted, we got their money!!!
 OK! Got it on prime day for a great deal. Perfect for our 3 year old for road trips. Def a little slower than expected. My BIGGEST complaint is I wish that it didn’t show the apps you don’t have. If WiFi is on my kid can click any book and app which is so annoying but also confusing for him. I don’t want him having access to them all bc 1. There’s a lot we don’t allow him to use on the screens and 2. Many are aimed for bigger kids. Overall it’s a good price. We aren’t going to use it all the time but it’s serving it’s purpose.
 My daughter received this tablet as a gift for christmas. I didn't purchase it but I would say it is worth the money, but that's it, It's not really a deal.<br/><br/>Pros;<br/>- Cheap<br/>- Comes with kid proof case(it really is sturdy)<br/>- Lots of free games<br/><br/>Cons;<br/>- Its kind of a slow tablet<br/>- Display is barely passable<br/>- Not very "kid" friendly - my daughter often has to hand me the tablet to navigate back to the game after she accidentally hit the wrong button. The home screen is part of the store, not where the installed apps are. You can set the parental controls to make sure they don't buy anything but it makes it hard for them to navigate back to the game.
 All child profiles are installed on every Fire you own.  Each child needs 16GB.  So if you have a 16GB Fire, it can only reasonably be used by one child.  Additionally, you'll want to add a 32GB-64GB SDRAM as external storage.  Make sure the Fire is configured so that everything that possibly can is installed on the external storage.  Now, most importantly, since every Fire has all the children's profiles, set up passcodes so that each kid can only use their own tablet.  Otherwise you'll quickly run out of internal storage, then problems start to happen, requiring a factory reset and your kids will be mad they lost their place in lessons/games of apps.
 I got two of these- as part of a 2 pack special- for my 4 and 8 year old who were constantly fighting over our 1 iPad. WELL worth the $. No more fighting, keeping their tablets charged is THEIR responsibility, and I love the controls from the Parent Dashboard. I can limit screen-time, content by age, and adjust schedule based on if it’s a school night... plus the shows and apps that come with the Freetime subscription are what they’re already into. I especially like that I can choose to have my 8 year old spend 30 min reading before she can access anything else on Freetime. The cases have already proved durable with many drops on concrete and tile floor.<br/>No more fighting, road trips are more pleasant, OH, and I also bought earphones for mine and my husband’s sanity. If you’re buying more than one of these- spend the extra $ and order earphones.
 This is really a well thought out gadget for the kids. So far the durability and functionality is perfect. This item is just as described. The charge lasts maybe 4-6hrs of constant playtime. If I could change one thing about it though, is when it is on the child profile, access to other apps besides freetime would be a huge plus for my homeschool children. Freetime has lots of games, books and videos but limits my son from going onto other apps such as pureflix for educational material. Of course once you exit freetime there should be a PIN for the parents to enter in order to access it.
 I have purchased 2 of these tablets for my kids. They have both broken. Amazon replaced 1 and it broke again for the same reason, the tablet will no longer connect to the charger. I called Amazon and they will not stand by the 2 year guarantee, the device is only 1 year old, they advised that the warranty was voided when the new device was sent out, because it goes off the original product. BE ADVISED that the 2 year guarantee is a sham and Amazon will not stand by their product.
 If you happen to be looking for a learning tablet for your 2 to 12 years old, or for yourself, may I recommend the "Kindle Fire Kids Edition". It comes with a 2-year, no questions asked, repair or replace warranty.  It is exactly like the regular Kindle Fire, except that it comes in a kid-proof case, and it comes with a free one year subscription to Amazon FreeTime - which has age appropriate books, videos, and learning games. It also has terrific parental controls. My girls thoroughly enjoy using theirs.
 Our kids love their Fire for kids (ages 5, 3.5, and 2).  We find the content to be age-appropriate but would suggest a few modifications:<br/>1) it would be absolutely fantastic if Amazon would add a parental volume control option.  We are constantly reminding our kids to turn the volume down!<br/>2) it would be nice if kids could access parent-approved ebooks from within the Freetime app.  Our library is set up to rent out ebooks and I'd love to have a way to push them to the kindles so the kids can read them, rather that requiring the use of my tablet.
 For the price I guess these work as well as you can expect. Very frustrating that they have a lot of issues. The pictures for the apps keep disappearing, sometimes just turning it off and back on will fix it, other times I have to completely reset and re-download everything. The visual of the app is important for my autistic son to be able to see. Works well enough it's not worth the hassle of returning, but I wouldn't order them again.<br/><br/>Dropped another star after realizing that apps are only available based on gender. Hate to tell you Amazon but my daughter and son both like Barbie AND Batman. But they can't have both on their own tablets. Stop forcing antiquated gender roles on kids.
 Bought this for my almost 2 year old for Christmas. It’s been a bit of an adjustment for her (and me) to learn as we haven’t used android in the past. But overall, it’s been good. There are some cute apps and she’ll certainly be able to use more as she grows. My two complaints are battery life - she will have barely used it and it still seems to die overnight. Will have to get into the habit of charging it nightly. It also has a slow start up. But overall, I like the features, especially that I feel safe that she’s not going to stumble across anything that she shouldn’t.
 Not as kid friendly to operate as I was expecting. He couldn't see all of the apps available to him bevause they are not in columns and rows. It's just one long row of apps. He also couldnt figure out how to go back or go home since there isn't a physical button to push and the ones on screen disappear quickly. I couldn't figure out how to read about apps before downloading. It just automatically downloaded anything I selected instead of opening it so I could read the description and reviews.
 This is the best thing I have ever bought for my child.  Their is a ton of game apps that are geared for her age, she plays games and learns from them.  Also the games are mostly free.  She has a list of about 20 free ones on her kindle already.  She can also download movies or even stream videos.  Last year I bought her a leap frog and the graphics on this is 10x better and on the leap frog almost everything on it you have to pay for to add it for the machine.
 This is a good product I like the parental controls all the fun videos and games and learning.  The bumper case is very sturdy. However, this is my 2nd tablet . But, the 1st one I returned after less than a month bc it doesnt hold a charge. It goes from 100% to dead by end of day even if you dont use it. Battery dies quick. I returned for maintenance and was sent a new one. I was sent a pink one instead of the original blue we ordered. But that's okay we will keep it pink. I just hope it doesnt keep dying. After reading reviews it seems like the battery is an ongoing issue and you have to turn completely off if not in use to save battery. I will try this and hope for the best.
 I bought this tablet just under a month ago for my 2 year old son. He loves it... its definitely durable enough for a toddler. The problem is the educational videos that my son grew attached to (Brain Candy TV), suddenly became unavailable on the device after only a month. With the purchase, there is a one year unlimited subscription for all of the content on the device. Of course, I call Amazon device and content support because my son doesn't understand that the videos just aren't available. I run though two different methods of troubleshooting on the device and still to no avail...the videos are not there. Other videos will play, just not the ones from Brain Candy TV...<br/>So I had to switch over to my profile to search for the videos and have my son watch them there, which defeats the whole purpose of purchasing a kid-friendly device. All I've been told by Amazon support at this point is that web developers are looking into it....Really, and in the meantime, what am I supposed to do? So finally after fussing on the phone, I get a manager who says I can share to content from my profile over to my son's profile.. Okay, fine... that will fix the problem... for now. My issue is that I should never have had to call in the first place. I haven't had the thing for a month! Also, why would certain educational videos just suddenly become unavailable? I even emailed the CEO of Brain Candy TV and he advised his content should still be available on the device...<br/><br/>SO WHAT IS GOING ON?.... who knows.
 This is my second Kindle Fire. The first one lasted just outside of 12 months before it started having trouble charging. This is my second Kindle Fire and it is just under 3 months old and will not charge at all. It was fine one day charging and the next it will not do it at all no matter what you try. I contacted amazon and their customer service person said this was a "very unusual problem". Which was a bold faced lie as I had read these reviews prior to purchasing and saw the hundreds of people with the same problems. Amazon is paying for me to return my old kindle and is sending me a new? or refurbished? one.
 I bought this tablet in late Nov for my son as a Christmas present 75.00( black friday price), one month of use (it was open on Christmas) later the tablet wont charge. I was given a 2 year replacement agreement in which I am using. My problem is, if a product is defective when I bought it brand new, why do I get a refurbished replacement and not a new item. My son was not able to enjoy the tablet the first time around. Now we are taking chances with someone else's used tablet.
 After going through 2626263 chargers with the Nabi and having the Epic completely stop working not even 3 months in I’m happy to say I am thrilled with this tablet.<br/><br/>I myself have a kindle and loved the performance and decided after seeing the deal on the two to make the leap and try them with the kids.<br/><br/>I love how you can keep track of what’s being done with Freetime. It’s nice knowing what your kids are doing behind closed doors.<br/><br/>The bumpers are awesome for drop and fit in the hands comfortably.<br/><br/>These hold a charge for quite a long amount of time even when in constant use.<br/><br/>My only complaint is with internal memory. There isn’t quite enough but it can be expanded with a memory card.<br/><br/>Overall very pleased with this tablet.
 If we used this more often, I would have given it fewer starts.  I bought this as a prime day deal, thinking it would be great to keep the 4 yera old occupied on long drives.  We live in Alaska, and anywhere we go is a long drive.  I have it set at an hour limit.  The battery does not even last 8 hours on a full charge.  even when not in use.  It was fully charged in the morning, used for 1 hour in the afternoon, and when I picked it up in the evening to use it, it was dead.  Super disappointed.  This was supposed to be for road trips, but can't be because the batter does not last that long.  Super bummed.
 Like many others who have reviewed this, the charge port on my kids devices also failed after a short time.  Luckily I was still within the "hassle free" replacement period right?  Not so much.  After justifying the issue with support, I sent it in and was without the tablet during one of our long road trips.  A time that I really wanted this device for.  Then I got my device returned... unrepaired, unreplaced.  Amazon couldn't replicate my charing issue which continued to persist.  Don't waste your extra money on the return policy.
 This product came with a warranty that stated it could be returned, no questions asked, if the device quit working. That is one of the main reasons I went with this particular brand. This tablet was a gift for my young daughter, and I knew chances were something would happen to it. The warranty was very appealing. After owning the tablet for almost 3 months, it would no longer hold a charge. I bought a different charger thinking maybe the issue wasn't with the tablet, but the charger. The tablet still would not charge, or even turn on for that matter. I called customer service to have it replaced, and was transferred to two different departments before I reached the kindle department. The staff was unhelpful and would not replace my tablet until a troubleshoot was performed. I was then told that if the tablet was returned to Amazon, and they were able to get it charging, I would be billed for a second tablet. So basically...if they fix the problem once it is returned I will be billed another 99.00 dollars plus tax. Please please be aware of this before purchasing this product. The 'no questions asked' pitch is simply that..a pitch. It was misleading and I expected more from a product and a promise that came directly from Amazon.  ***This is the exact phrasing for the product, "2-year worry-free guarantee: if they break it, return it and we'll replace it for free. No questions asked."  This is NOT the case, parents.
 I would not recommend this product.<br/><br/>1. The device does not support Android so you can't install any apps from the Google play store.<br/>2. This means you have to download the Amazon apps which have tons of ads.<br/>3. If your kid clicks on an ad the regular screaming is on cue, you say why not lock the screen to avoid clicking on the ads? Well,<br/>4. There is no app for screen lock!!!!<br/><br/>So in essence this product is useless for a child and the consumer was not a kept in mind when amazon chose to rip people off and put this scam of a product on the market.<br/><br/>Oh and all the complaints about the charging port are true I've had them replace one already and I've had it for 4 months only.
 I really loved the idea of this.  All that content and the size is perfect.  I had a really hard time navigating the software.  (I am used to apple software) Also I had bought a memory card for it hoping to store content like movies,  knowing the device wouldn't have the space to store everything.  I couldn't figure out how to use the external memory card to do this.  I tried, I looked up instructions and tried.  I wanted to like this, but unlimitedly I had to return it.  I really wanted to like this -  Super bummed.
 Bought this last Christmas for my daughter. It worked fine for about 8 months then started having battery issues. Over a span of 6 weeks they sent me 4 replacement Kindles (all refurbished and having the same battery issue as my original) and after Hours on the phone with kindle support asking for a NEW replacement instead of a refurbished one I was told it isn’t possible (even though I have a year left on a 2 year warranty) and the best they could do is give me an 80% refund and I could just buy a new one. Basically they were telling me my warranty is worthless and I would need to spend my money on a new item. I got very little help and was actually hung up on by two supervisors.
 Find a different product. Have had the same issue with this devise after 3 replacements. The charge port wears out after less than a year. This has now happened for a third time. You plug it in and no charge.<br/><br/>As far as "hassle free warranties" Good luck. You call and they treat you like a complete moron. "Did you try restarting it ,"Are you using the correct charger", "did you wiggle it". Then you got to go through about 3-4 people and 45 minutes on the phone before finally getting someone that can actually help. First two times we had to send it in for them to work on. Less than 3 weeks after getting it back it still has the same problem and you need to send in for a new replacement.<br/><br/>***I actually had a guy on the phone say "well maybe it was plugged in and your kid was playing on it and this caused the port to fail" .  Umm I've had apple products that are 5-6 years old that still work. And I don't know how many times I had those plugged in while in use with no issues. Really this is what you say to a customer??<br/><br/>Now even though a new one was sent and in less than a year we have the same problem they are not willing to do anything with it. Even though its new, the 2 year warranty only applies to the original one. (again replaced three times).<br/><br/>Also it has very little to no memory. We have stripped it down and still constantly get messages for low storage with around 6-7 games on it. It will also randomly delete games. My son was playing Lego Batman and spent weeks collecting the characters. Then the app just disappeared overnight. Had to re-download and start over. Try explaining that to a 5 year old. Not fun.<br/><br/>Long story short is there are plenty of other products out there. Feel free to research as many posts say the same thing about the charging port on these. Real piss poor craftsmanship.
 After having this 4 months I have to say I'm surprised at how well it has held up with my almost 2 yr old. He loves watching his kids youtube on it. I had to search up how to download the google playstore to install it but the steps were pretty simple to follow. It holds a charge pretty well. I charge it at night and depending on how much we use it it lasts all day.  I wouldnt say my toddler is rough with it but it has survived drops and him getting juice on it. I would definitely purchase again. Also my son has quite a few other apps downloaded beside the youtube doesnt seem to slow it down like past tablets I've tried.
 First, let me say that setup was very challenging.  I took the time before Christmas to get everything working, but the tablet was not giving access to what was downloaded.  Got it up and running, downloaded more after my son went to sleep in preparation for our trip home.  Again, the next morning, all gone.  I had to rebuild his profile.  Something I learned that others had to do when I was searching online for answers.  Might I point out that download speed is very slow on this.  We are still having challenges but I’m tired of fixing it.  It is supposed to block entertainment apps until his reading is done but only games are blocked.  Videos are not.  Lastly, I was very disappointed at the books offered with our free time subscription.  I could not find a single Christian book, not even the Bible.  I realize I’m in the minority reading category here but I’m still in a major segment.  In general, my kids read books with a good purpose.  I want it to teach them something (share, dealing with bullies, etc.).  I am challenged to find those kinds of books on free time.
 I found it quite difficult to set up the tablet for my child the way it needs to be set up.  For instance, it does not let him look at Youtube videos as it offers him no "web" option on his screen.  I was unable to figure out how to add this to his child account.  The only way I can get it to surf the web is to enter my account, which I don't want him to have access to.  His old Samsung tablet was more user friendly than this!!  I bought the fire to replace his old tablet he used to surf the web, but as I can't get this one to surf the Web, it's turned out to be useless for the purpose intended.
 The tablet is a Christmas present so it hasn't really been used yet. I like the kid protected case for it - it seems very durable. I turned the tablet on so I could connect it to my internet so that it is ready Christmas morning. I like the child's account on the tablet and the fact that I can set a time for how long my child can play on it. I also like that the child's account can be turned off and it can be used like a regular tablet. Will update once my child gets to open the present and play with it.
 This tablet is very entertaining..as long as it stays charged. It loses its charge very quickly. The port that connects to the charger is very loose. Also, it takes hours for it to charge fully and still quite a while to reach a decent power level for the kids to play. The upside is it has a lot of apps to choose from and the case makes it toddler friendly.
 My grandson absolutely  loves this tablet.  However there are some games that are not suitable for him at this point.  We would like to remove them.  After a lengthily conversation with a customer service rep, this seemingly small task can not accomplished.  After trying several things she suggested  factory resetting the tablet.  I elected not to do that because of the time involved in reloading all of the lost information. All I want to do is to  delete games from the device. There must be a simple solution.  HELP
 We have high speed internet and this is our second fire 7 but it makes my kids so frustrated! The apps take forever to load and I have to add the apps so it’s so time consuming .  I still am not sure what freetime does, it must have just never worked for us. Will stick with Samsung kids or I pads. Not worth the constant meltdowns , definitely do not recommend for children with autism.
 Useless after 7 months.  Excellent product while working and almost undestructible for a 2 year old girl.  Very happy with the product until... It worked fine for 6 months, then the charging port started failing.  We had to wiggle the cord but after a month it stopped charging and nothing could be done.
 Picked this up for my stepdaughters 5th birthday and she LOVES it! Very user friendly for all ages; plenty of parental control (set time limits and screen locks); volume can get pretty loud; and the case it comes in is very protective and thick (rubber material). You can create multiple profiles and can use as a normal Fire. Literally has thousands of kid friendly games, books, videos, etc etc for her to continually play and learn from. However, the space on this will fill up fairly quickly depending on what games are downloaded. My stepdaughter installs a lot of games that she doesn't ever play but more so to see what they are. I just go through it once every couple of weeks and uninstall some of the games, but it may be worth spending a little more and getting the bigger version. All in all, something fun and educational to keep your kiddo occupied with. Definitely worth the money.
 This has been so great for my two year old. We started off with the iPad but he kept getting into other apps and he loved pressing the home button. Free Time is awesome because I can set the age for appropriate content. It outs my mind at ease when I can give it to my son and not worry about him viewing inappropriate content. There's to a of variety for fun activities and learning. Setting parameters will be great when he gets older and has to read for a certain amount of time before he can play gamers watch videos. The feature that sold me was the 2 years no questions asked if it gets broken. With a toddler you never know what might happen. The bumper is great also. It's light weight and the battery life is awesome. We will get plenty of use out of this for the years to come.
 Got this for my one-year-old, go ahead judge me, but the apps we use on it a very music and learning oriented. Ultimately, this is just a Kinde Fire 7 in an awesome protective sleeve. My husband wants one for himself now. I do wish it came with a screen protector but fortunately, the gorilla glass seems to keep itself mostly scratch free. (it's the same glass that the fire phone was made out of and our's barely has a scratch on it after 20 kids (we're foster parents) playing with it.) This tablet doesn't really lag and is lighter than previous versions even with the foam case. I really like it and so does my little guy.
 Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a good tablet for the little one, it’s really strong and fun , it has everything my daughter needs it , and the most part i LOVE  it about it is the ( GOOD TO GO) so now my daughter can enjoy it anywhere without Internet , the other thing I really love it is the Amazon’s Warranty, it’s amazing, they sent Replacement within one day and no lot of questions!!<br/>Really really I recommend it for everyone<br/>I hope i can get the other one to my son ❤️❤️❤️
 It was great at first, and my son loved the content that it came with.  However, it broke within 6 months and wouldn't charge.  They replaced the cord which only fixed the problem for 2 months, before they had to replace the entire thing.  Once the new one arrived it worked for another month or two, before the charging port started to become loose again.  Given the fact that my children are not allowed to plug or unplug the device, it is beyond my comprehension that a device made for kids has been so poorly made.  You may save on the front end, but my iPad that is 11 years old was a much better deal, and still runs perfectly.  Don't waste your money or your time.
 Pros for this tablet is that it is a great size for a toddler, great volume and quality of the screen, lots of apps to play GAMES.<br/>Cons for this tablet was setting it up you had to have a password (so our toddler bugged us while on car rides to unlock it), you had to make a separate account, you couldn’t get KidsTube or YouTube on the child’s account only the parents account and the biggest it’s charging port sucks. Our daughter used this tablet as a Christmas gift last year mostly for car rides, sometimes at events and for some reason it won’t charge at all, we tried buying multiple new cords and it still won’t charge, but the battery light shows up. We will be looking for a new tablet this year for Christmas.
 The offline content setup on these things for kids profiles is ATROCIOUS!!!  Freetime is great and the curated content is awesome if you have a constant internet connection but if you dont, be prepared to be frustrated. First you need to download the content in the admin profile. Then, you need to add the content to each freetime profile (2 in my case). Then, you have to log into EACH freetime profile and run the content once for it to cache or something. All this is with wifi access. Now, turn off wifi and cross your fingers and hope the content works. In my case, it only worked 75% of the time. Now repeat on the second device, argh!!!<br/><br/>Also, with wifi off the freetime profiles still show all the online content but errors when the kids click on them, super frustrating!!!!  Why doesnt it only show the downloaded content????<br/><br/>I hated spending 3x more but we returned these and got ipads instead. Soooo much easier to setup and when you download an app on one, it can automatically download on the other keeping them exactly the same (important so kids dont fight).
 Not worth $20. It pushes ads at full volume an random while the device is not in use. This review has is being written at 2:30 am because thanks to this heap of crap I got to wake up to a damn ad even though all the settings are set correctly after speaking with tech support for 45min of my weekend.<br/><br/>Get a paper and some crayons... faster processing and less ads
 Strongly recommend for calming down overly active grandchildren. Even very young children can play simple games, develop and improve hand/eye coordination, watch movie,s and their favorite cartoon shows. Extremly durable (even when thrown by a child onto a tile floor) with free damage replacement and videos for a year. It's rechargeable and Wifi enabled, and it has both front and back cameras. We purchased a pink one for our 3 year old granddaughter, and a blue one for our 18 month old grandson. There was a special "twofer" price last December, don' know if that is still available. Definately recommend the Amazon Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet, 7" Display, 16 GB.
 Good deal, pretty indestructible and great for my three year old.  She's enjoying a couple puzzle apps, taking care of things apps, books, and finding things for herself.  PBS kids video and game app is on there too, she loves it. I like I don't have to censor things much and it helps on long car trips.  There's things she can grow into on there as well, seems like a good variety. The memory runs low at times but I just delete some things/restart and it's ok.  You do have to get on wireless periodically for some apps to continue to work so that's a negative but only a few are like that.
 We have four of these tablets. I bought three for the kids and then one for myself I liked it so well. I would give five stars but we did have an ongoing issue with memory management. The problem was with the cache build up for each app, but it you get the impression it is from storage. You have to clear the caches for each app individually. Unfortunately I had to go through several people to discover this. Every single person was pleasant and tried to help to the best of their ability. When I did get to a rep who recognized my issue she was extremely helpful and cheerful. I would give her five stars just for her.
 We purchased our 3rd set of Fire 7 kids tablets because we had no issues with the first 2 sets.  This 3rd set has been a huge disappointment.  We don't let the kids use them every day but when we do try to use them we can't because the battery is dead.  Plug it in until it says 100% then unplug it and by the time we go to use it, its dead again.  All we use is free time so nothing else has been downloaded on either but for some reason both pads are draining their battery in 2 days time when not in use.  The help desk had not been helpful and after sending in for repair they were returned as fixed but still do the same thing.  The only way we can use these is to leave them plugged in except when in use.  This should not be happening and is a waste of electricity.
 I purchased this tablet to keep my little entertained on a long flight. At home, it worked great. It has some wonderful features BUT it doesn't function at all without Wifi! Nothing opens. Nothing works. I predownloaded some movies via the Netflix app which is subposed to work if your not connected but the app won't open if you are not connected to Wifi. So when the planes Wifi stopped working, we were SOL. It's very disappointing. The technology to make these items work off line is available. Why not make them functional?! People buy these to travel and use in cars and planes. Come on, Amazon.. get on it. Amazon even sells a car harness... why sell that when you can't use it without wifi?!!
 As a kid's product, it was very surprising to learn that the Kindle Fire doesn't have a screen disable feature to that the tablet can be handled while viewing a movie without interruption (aka "screen pinning" for Android products or "guided access" for Apple products).  We found this to be a completely worthless product without this simply software feature.  We've returned our Fire to purchase an Apple Ipad, which is a shame since the Freetime content was kind of nice.
 UPDATE 01/19<br/><br/>Doesn't charge at all. Has used just over a yr. Awful product!<br/><br/>UPDATE 06/18<br/><br/>STAY AWAY from this if you only want it to last a few months!!!! We had problems charging it and kept getting new cords to charge. Hardly charges now, takes forever when it does and doesn't power off correctly! Didn't purchase warranty because I thought it would last more than 5 months!<br/><br/>This WAS great. Purchased this for my Grandson for Christmas and already where it plugs in is worn or something and won't hold the cord in the USB to charge. 2nd Amazon device I have owned that had the exact same problem. I don't recommend.
 My kiddo loves this.  She did throw it down and my husband and I were in awe with how we hear the rubber catch the fall.  No scratches or broken screens for us when the rubber case is on.  Hallelujah!  The only bummer about the Fire is that it does not allow us to lock the games while in use so that my daughter doesn't accidentally log herself out of a game or movie.  She does it all the time and it's super annoying to have to run to her aid and help her get back on her game over and over again.  Anyway. Great product and easy to use.
 We have owned 3 of these since February 2018.  One of them quit charging within 30 days.  Amazon replaced it (painlessly).  The NEW one quit charging within another 60 days.  After doing a bit of online searching, apparently the Kindle Fire has some sort of USB faultiness epidemic in which many, many of these devices quit charging after awhile.  Of the 3 Kindle Fires we have owned--2 of them quit charging nearly immediately!  That's a 66% failure rate, which, in my opinion, is pretty high!
 This is absolutely the best purchase that I've ever made on Amazon. My son loves his tablet. The tablet broke a year later and Amazon replaced it in less than a week...talk about impressed. He has been learning on this tablet since he was almost 2 and he is now 3. Before bedtime this tablet must be charged up and ready for the next day because he will wake up and say Tabletttt where are you lol.  I'd advise anyone to get this tablet!!!
 I purchased this for my five-year-old son, I was very happy with the 2015 version and I was excited to see this new were version come out. However, even though I purchased the 16 GB tablet and a 256 GB SD card for it, the tablet is very choppy when playing any sort of game In Freetime. My son got very frustrated qith long loading screens and constant reboots when games freeze, now he doesn't want to use it at all; which is frustrating since I paid for a year of AbcMouse for him...
 Very slow tablet. Tried to trade it in but was told it is unacceptable.  I was only going to receive $5 but there was a 25% promotion toward a new tablet. Now I am stuck with a tablet that does not work well but yet was supposed to have a 2 year worry free warranty. Apparently Amazon does not stand by their own product.
 The UI and all of the installed amazon stuff weigh the system down a lot.  Also when a kid downloads something on freetime its owned by that account.  So instead of being able to admin the device from the adult side of the device you need to login to uninstall apps.  Which you will do a lot.  And it will be slow and painful.
 Excellent buying experience. The tablet are quality item, but in little hands accidents happen. I had to replace one one the tablets ( more than once). No problems!!! And the turn around time was awesome.
 I expected more from this tablet but it is mediocre. Barely any space to download for anything additional then what is already available. Its really sensitive to touch so my son is constantly kicking himself out of his profile and going into mine. It is just the same as the first colored tablet except it comes with the bubble case around it. I wouldn't recommend it for any kids under the age of 3 and/or kids who like a variety of things.
 Buyer beware. DO NOT purchase this product.<br/><br/>I purchased this tablet for my daughter, and of course she loved it. However, we started having issues with it after a few months.<br/><br/>My wife initially told me it wouldn't charge. I'm pretty tech savvy (former IT support) so I checked it out. It seemed like the battery wasn't connecting to the charger. No biggie, I propped it up during charging. It worked fine for maybe another month. Only problem is, I had to charge it because there was a very specific angle I had to place it at to make it charge. My wife could never get it right. So if I wasn't around and it died, she had a crying kid on her hands.<br/><br/>Fast forward a few weeks. I noticed it would NEVER charge past 10%. The most it would get to is 32%, then it would die within a few hours while idle. Yes, a 32% charge would be gone while sitting locked on the table and connected to the charger. My daughter would come home and ask for her tablet. It wouldn't power on, after me having it on there for hours. She'd be inconsolable some days.<br/><br/>I ended up hiding it from her, and thankfully she's always loved books so we just read a lot more now.<br/><br/>Do not, I repeat DO NOT buy this tablet. There are thousands of reviews, and I wish I had read them all. Many reviewers have had the same issue, but I didn't read them at the time and purchased this blindly. My wife has contacted customer support several times with no response. I am now looking into other more reliable brands.<br/><br/>This has been extremely frustrating. I really hope this review saves someone $100...
 I would have been able to give this 5 Stars if I would not have have had to spend 5 hours on the phone trying to straighten out the account that this was linked to I bought it for my niece for Christmas and I wanted it linked to my account because I have Prime and Kindle unlimited however my sister went to register it and put it under her email and it took many hours and many different Associates before we could figure out how to do it I really wish that Amazon would educate their customer service Representatives not only in the policies but and how to treat other people and make customer satisfaction their main focus not just making money
 I have three kindle fire’s now. Two 8 and one 7. Recently got the 7 for my daughter. First one came and wouldn’t hold a charge for a day. Completely died with minimal use. My boys fire 8 last for days. Second 7 came after I returned the first (and argued with customer service because they wanted to send us a refurbished one two days after I bought the brand new one that didn’t work).... and this one hold a barge better, but nothing like my boys 8. So frustrated. Considering returning this one too. How could both 7 I receive be defective? Or is it just that the 7 is junk? Love my boys 8 but dodsapiunted in Amazon.
 Our 2 year old loves to watch his shows so we’ve had an older generation iPad but we were wanting something smaller, affordable and easier to download things on it for him. Which this tablet does all of the above. What I’m not impressed with is the fact you can’t lock the screen like the iPad. So he’s constantly turning off his show or games which isn’t ideal while your driving down the road. Maybe as he matures it will be better but a toddler with curious fingers I’m not so sure this is a great fit.
 Having been used to Android, I was afraid that everything I knew would be completely gone.  This is not the case.  Many of the apps are in Amazon's App store too--except Castle Cats, :( --and it does similar things.  My son loves the games on it.  I like the chance to use the Open Library for our local library and download library books onto it.  Free books to read? Double-score!  It also offered several children's books for free.  We chose the entire series of Harry Potter for my son; I will probably read them faster than he does, but it's okay.  They're fun to read over and over!  It's a good device, holds charge for a good amount of time, and the bumper protects it well.  I'm glad we got it!
 Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 3 year old grandson.  He loves it. He found programs on it he could use right out of the box. So far everything about this device has been great except the battery life which I expected after reading other's review's before buying. I do wish the thumnail pictures of the YouTube videos didn't have the big red arrow on them as you can't see what they are. This however may be a YouTube issue not a tablet issue. Otherwise the tablet is just as described and I love that the adult can set a shutdown time and the child doesn't fight turning it off and putting it up.
 So, let me start by saying that I haven't done a review on Amazon before now, but I felt that I really needed to share my experience with the Kids Edition Kindle Fires. I bought them back in March for my 3 year old and my 1 year old. Honestly, I was nervous because I didn't think either of them would like them and that I would have wasted $150 on two tablets. I was pleasantly surprised when both of them instantly fell in love. My son(3yrs) has learned so many new words, has watched and played games that are both entertaining AND educational. My daughter(just over a year) watches little shows and even learned how to put puzzles together. Both tablets have Amazon Free time and we will continue our subscriptions once they run out. Thank you so much Amazon for giving us a product we can trust our children with. All the apps and videos have been tailored for age ranges and couldn't be more safe! I also feel like both of my children are more engaged than they were before now. Like I said, my son has learned so much! I know the statistics say that children should be exposed to too much screen time, and for the most part I believe this. However, when my son gets excited about The Magic School Bus or whatever new Dinosaurs he just learned about, you can bet I'm going to encourage him to do these things.
 I purchased this tablet for My 3 yr old Grandaughter. After it came in, I was so amazed at the many ways she can learn and interact with this I purchased another one for an 8 year old Grandaughter, She hasn’t put it down since she got it! They really love it and I love the apps and Characters. The tablet has a special profile for the adult with a pin # so the child can’t change any settings and Amazon is really on top of the game as far as tablets for Children, I’ve seen other Children’s Tablets and they don’t have anything on this one ! Very Pleased with this purchase and I will buy more for the rest of the Grandkids under 12 soon, it’s to much of a good thing for them to have and learn from to not get it. Worth It !
 My daughter is GREAT at math. Like really really smart. Where she's in a different classroom with older students now. But one thing she struggles with is reading. I have a LOT of children's books because of my job but it's just hard for her to get into them. Then I got this device for her 7th birthday. It not only allows her to a WIDE access of books, shoot I even downloaded the Harry Potter ones to reread, but it allows me to control her minimum reading time before playing games. I can set the device to where it shows the definition of the harder words on top so she knows what they mean. I've never seen her so excited to read some of the books. And she's reading a lot more now.<br/><br/>Because it has the prime unlimited, a lot of games they have on there actually cost about $5 each if I wanted to put it on my phone. And the games are really cool. I actually have to turn off the timers sometimes because I'll take her tablet to play Ticket To Ride and other games.<br/><br/>Overall I def give 5 stars. Get an extended storage card because you'll want to download so much
 Seven months in with my four year old having this tablet and I have mixed feelings. I wanted to hold off on writing a review to see how the tablet held up with my son. For the money I paid for it I expected it to be better. About three months in the charger port in the tablet started to come loose and now it’s a nightmare to charge it. At first I thought it may be the charger but after buying multiple chargers I’ve determined it’s not the charger it’s the port. Now 7 months in the tablet is always getting A LOT slower. It’s to the point I don’t even want to deal with it because it takes so long to load. I don’t know how much longer this will last but next time I’m going to invest in Apple.
 I waited a few months to review the 2 Kids Fire 7's purchased.  I wanted to find out for myself, if the problems others have encountered were user error or actual device problems.  I am not the tech wizard in my house, I leave that heavy lifting to my husband.  I talked him into buying the Kids Fire 7s for a long trip we were taking, I was done with constantly giving my children (2 &amp; 9) my iPhone or iPad.  I really wanted something for them.<br/>Pros:<br/>Out of the box we were both impressed, it's light weight and setting up the children with separate accounts was easy.  The Anytime is great, they can download what they want and use it off wifi; also I enjoy the use of age appropriate content.  My 2 year old has a bit of a temper, as most do, they have thrown it and spilt milk on it, not broken.  My children find the Anytime interface easy to use and the battery life has not disappointed us yet.  Love that I can keep them in Anytime with passwords and the use of Dashboard.<br/>Pro or Con:<br/>In the Anytime interface children can click on an app to play but apps "conveniently" download to the tablet, which can cause a space issue.  This really comes down to a parental preference. The Kids Fire 7 does have a port for extra storage but like I said it is a preference to extend the storage space.  We chose not to expand the storage space, not because we wanted to limit their content but every time they touch an app it downloads.  It is much easier allow our 9 year old to decide what to keep or decide for our 2 year old what is best.<br/>Cons:<br/>Our 9 year old is allowed to charge their own electronic devices.  They have an iPhone and the Kids Fire7.  The micro usb charging cord has broken prongs which keep the charger in place when inside the tablet.  Without careful connection from the charging cord into the Kids Fire 7, the charging cable will fail and require a new charging cable.  In other words don't allow your children to charge their own devices.<br/><br/>Hope this helps.
 The reason that I chose the kindle fire tablet was because of the parental control options and being able to limit each child's usage.  Each child has their own device where their profile is visible and all of the other children's are hidden.  For whatever reason, the hidden profiles won't stay hidden no matter how many times I do it and call tech support.  This completely defeats the purpose of having the time limits because all they have to do is switch over to a different child's profile after their time is up on that device.  The time limits are not shared across devices either so they basically have unlimited access.
 What can I say but Amazon knows what they are doing? We got this for my 4 yesr old after recently purchasing my 6 year old one and her loving it. The yesr of "Free Time" that it comes with and the protection plan alone would be enough to convince me to buy another one but it is a superior protect to all of the other kid tablets we have bought in the past. We have 5 children sonthat says alot. It is easy for him to navigate, and Dad and I don't have to worry about him getting into stuff he shouldn't be.
 I bought the Fire 7 Kids edition tablet with 16GB storage in a twin pack with foam cases. I love them. My kids love them. I can set parental controls for each tablet easily. I can make it so my kids have to read for 30 minutes before they can play a game or watch something on it, I can set how many minutes they are allowed to use the books sections, the apps/games section, and the videos section for weekdays and weekend days. It's so easy to get into the adult profile right from the tablets to do any changes and it requires passwords to get into those controls. I added extra storage and it was easy to transfer all the apps and things over to the Micro SD card and set the tablet to automatically save to the Micro SD. I would definitely recommend these! Oh, and the tablets charge quickly and keep battery for a long time. My daughter left her tablet playing music through headphones all day when she went to school and it only lost 30% of the battery.
 This was a gift for my three-year-old grandson he walks around proud takes such good care of his tablet shares it with his big brother and would you believe it or not his mother can even log on and use it for herself what a great gift at a wonderful price very pleased with my purchase everyone in the family can enjoy!
 I'll be on my 3rd one now. I've been overcharged by amazon in the amount of nearly $300 THIS YEAR for buying this piece of junk. Internally the charging adapter fails. No big deal if it were just the charger cable. So, they sent me a refurbished unit. Didn't last 2 months of actual use. I converted to Samsung galaxy tabs so that the kids can use the open android market instead of "free time" and "kindle unlimited". Both of which I was charged for, neither of which I opted into, to my knowledge.
 I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 3 year old grandson.  He dropped it and the screen broke.  When he attempted to continue using it he cut his finger on the sharp glass screen and brought it to me.  I looked up my order and requested a call from Amazon Customer service.  The device is advertised on Amazon with a "2 year worry free guarantee.  If they break it we will replace it no questions asked."  This was not my experience at all.  I received a call from Amazon Customer Service and was asked how it broke, if it was exposed to water or dropped, if it came in contact with another device, and several more questions.  Then I was put on hold and transferred to 3 different people each asking the same questions.  I was then transferred to someone at Kindle who informed me that they would send a label and I could send it in to see if it could be repaired or replaced.  This is far from a "worry free guarantee.  21 minutes later I was informed that I would receive a shipping label so I could return it for evaluation.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Fire-7-Kids-Edition-Tablet-7-34-Display-16-GB-Blue-Kid-Proof-Case/dp/B01J90MSDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet, 7" Display, 16 GB, Blue Kid-Proof Case</a>
 Got this tablet for my son for Christmas, After a few months I was having issues charging the tablet. I thought it was the wire as my phone wire can disintegrate after a while. Called amazon and they replaced the tablet. Once again I am  not getting a charge at all. I have come to the conclusion that though I love the amazon freetime feature it is not worth my penny to keep buying a new tablet because something as simple as a charging port which they could make it more durable and I wouldn't mind paying a few extra dollars for that so that I could have something that would last more than 3 months.
 My kids love these! And I love the parental controls! I can limit the hours of the day When they can acccess anything, how long they can spend not only total but on each area. i.e. videos, games, books, web, etc.  you can even block them from any of those areas and require them to spend so much time in educational apps before they can use the other areas. Highly recommend!  Especially for the price, (got them on sale for Xmas) features, Amazon kids freeware subscription free for one year and a two year warranty  that covers any damage including dropping it or getting wet!
 Worth it! Freetime is very handy to keep kids corralled in the safer areas of tablet usage. You can even set daily goals and time limits. It's cheap too but Prime members get half off. There are so many movies, TV shows, books, apps, and games available for the kids in Freetime and you can choose the age range of these materials they can access. I feel the need to tell people about it because it is a safer alternative than letting young kids watch YouTube with its misleading titles and inappropriate content geared towards children. 👍 My daughter loves it!!
 Are you kidding me ? Great NOT Christmas gift... Parental controls + free time on this thing simply suck.  They are targeting your kids to have them be consumers at 3 years old.  WOW astonished .. I cannot turn off their apps / suggestions... so my child is subject to items/things/apps that I have NOT QA-ed or approved.. but that amazon has ... I am not asking for Amazon to approve NOR do I want them to do it .. I simply want them to give me a product that works as advertised - this ISNT it.
 The first one I received worked for a while, then I would have to restart it most of the time to get certain apps to work.. Finally the charge port wasn't holding the charger &amp; it would keep a 100% charge for only a few minutes before being completely dead.. I attempted to get the warranty replacement back in January of this year, I had been jerked around by customer service for 3 months before finally getting it resolved.. I had to harass them so much to get anything done with this thing that they ended up sending me a new one. I told them I was out of town &amp; needed it for my son &amp; I updated the address on my profile &amp; VERY SPECIFICALLY told them twice that I needed it sent to the new address not the billing address.. What happens? They sent it to my billing address.. If this one messes up I will NEVER buy or request another one. Screw the warranty.
 Horrible. I should have trusted some of the other bad reviews. Tablet kept freezing in freetime when trying to download or add content. Spent nearly 2hrs trying to get content for my son. Very disappointed. Connected to wifi and everything was still super slow or it just froze. Will be returning
 We were lured in by the price, warranty and ease of parental controls. It's not worth it, these really are garbage devices and the way Amazon has chosen to exclude google services and the play store using their own inferior app store is infuriating.<br/><br/>Hardware wise we've had nothing but issues, charging port became loose, devices refused to charge, issues reading the micro SD cards and they are just slow compared to a more expensive tablet (Samsung or Apple). We sent them back after they failed to work on a trip, we received them back with the same issues and found out later they were just "tested" and shipped back. After speaking to customer service (they have been awesome) again, they shipped out refurbished ones that have worked so far, but I can tell the charging and ports will be an issue soon.<br/><br/>Software wise, the OS is clunky and a poor rendition of android. The lack of app options from the app store is very annoying. There are work arounds for installing google services and the play store as well as a different launcher, but it's not really worth the hassle. I'm looking forward to these tablets breaking very soon so I can justify going out and buying Samsung tablets.
 I purchased this tablet for my 5 year old son so that he could have a newer tablet to do his ABC Mouse app without it freezing on him and making him loose interest. The tablet itself works really well for what it's made to do, which is the only reason I didn't give it one star. For what it is, it works really well and we haven't had much in the way of issues with it as far as functionality. The problem comes in the lack of parental controls in the Amazon FreeTime Unlimited that comes with it and child profiles associated with that.<br/><br/>In order for my son to use his ABC Mouse app he has to be on WiFi. That's no big deal. As advertised by the products page, the Amazon FreeTime Unlimited give kids over 15,000 things that they can download which could be awesome and sometimes is awesome. But there's absolutely no control of what and how much can be downloaded. So every day I have to go in and manually block and uninstall apps that my son has downloaded to his tablet while it's been on WiFi after he's finished his ABCmouse or I have to put the tablet on airplane mode and that takes away the option for him to do his ABCmouse at all!<br/><br/>I contacted Amazon about this and they basically told me there's nothing they can do about it. They told me my only option was to keep it on airplane mode and basically removing the purpose of why I bought it anyway and I can't return it. So I'm stuck with this tablet that can't even do what I wanted it too just because Amazon doesn't want to program in and install better parenting controls over what a 5 year old can download on their tablet. Like why is he even able to download whatever he wants on his tablet without asking me first anyway? He's 5 years old! It's so frustrating to the point of bringing me to tears.<br/><br/>I absolutely regret buying this product.
 Bought two in summer of 2017. One is still going but the other stopped charging. The repair was more than the cost of a new device. I do love that the platform is all kid safe! You can convert to a non-kid platform though and when my kids were younger they did that by accident a few times. They were too young to get into trouble but in that view Amazon sent me alerts for every item I purchased so they almost saw Santa gifts! A few things like that could be worked out but overall, it's a great device for younger children (mine are now 9 and 10 and still using it).
 Not sure why so many horrible reviews on here, we got this for out 2 yr old and she loves it. Yeah it’s a little slow at times but what tablet isn’t? Maybe people need to do a internet upgrade before complaining. I only have up to 50mbps internet and we have no issues. If the charging port is breaking maybe plug it somewhere where the kids can’t just rip the thing off the charge to use it. This is a great product in my opinion.
 UPDATE: there is a TWO year warranty on this little sucker!  whoo hoo. Amazon contacted us and gave us the info to return it for a replacement...  Thanks Amazon.  Super EASY!!!  we are all happy here in the Pete residence....<br/><br/>My replacement window closed January 12. It hasn't been charging for a few weeks now... and this is the 2nd fire we've had. The 1st one had an issue within the replacement window, but now this one has an issue and we are stuck with it not charging. My son does his school on here and plays games. And is helpful on trips and car rides. It broke on vacation... So that was fun.. 😞
 This is a great tablet and the parental controls are great for those who need them. They were a little frustrating since we aren’t quite at that point, but I know we will soon enough so it was worth it. I’m a little disappointed in the battery life though. Sometimes it can make it through a movie and other times it can’t which is not great when you are using it where you cannot charge it like in the car or on a plane, plus the charging cord is very short. Otherwise it has great content if you have an internet connection.
 I bought this for my daughter in November of 2017. She's now 3 and throws, steps on it, bites the rubber case and this thing has held up great. Make sure to use the free year of the Amazon freetime. That's how you get all the good kids apps for free. If you were to pay for them they aren't cheap with most of the apps being $2 &amp; $3, or at least the Daniel Tiger one and the others my daughter likes. The tablet comes with a 2 year warranty, you send it back, they replace it. What could be better? I don't know if we're just lucky but their hasn't really been any problems with the tablet. I'd definitely recommend it. Thanks Amazon :)
 I got 2 of these for of my grandchildren for Christmas 2017 and they were great while they lasted. They kids LOVED them! However, at around 6 months one stopped taking a charge then not even a month after that the other one stopped taking a charge. They are unusable now and I have 2 very sad grandchildren. We have tried using the charger that came with them as well as other chargers with no luck. I bought a 3rd one back in May 2018 for another grandchild so I guess I have to let him know his won't work after 6 months. Only buy one of these if you want a disposable tablet that will make your children cry. - Disappointed Nona
 Bought this with the hassle free 2 Year Kids Warranty. What a joke. It is a HUGE hassle. Device quit holding a charge after 3 weeks. When trying to get a replacement, I was forced to Speak with 3 chat agents all claiming to be "Kindle Specialists" but then say they must transfer me to a 'kindle specialist'. Then the next specialist would say "please wait while I review your chat transcript". Apparently they don't know how to read because they then asked me the same questions over again. I finally said "this is getting ridiculous. I have spoken with three of you claiming to be 'kindle specialists', please just replace this faulty item. Finally got them to send me a return label, but they were only going to send the unit only. I had to ask "what if its the charger that is bad?" They claimed I said in chat that I tried other chargers. But, again, they can't read. I said I don't have other chargers. Finally they give me a $9.99 credit to get a new cable to try a new cable first. If that doesn't work, I can still use the return label to get a replacement tablet. Hassle free my hind in.
 It’s good for a amazon tablet, and kid proof. It’s the same thing as one that’s not kid safe, just the case and extra security features on the profiles to control it more. They are slower then iPads obviously, you get what you pay for. Perfect for kids when on the go.
 Amazon claims 2 years warranty with no question asked. It's a false advertisement. I have 1 version 7 that I purchased in 2017 and started having problem in the 3rd quarter of 2018. The battery drains very fast and 100% charged won't last for 3 hours of usage. We also had challenge turn on the device. When we pushed down the on/off button for a long time and if we were lucky, it would turn on, or else, we would just put it back to the draw and tried later. Lately we even had trouble to open the apps. I called the technical support and spent a very long time to trouble shoot. They had me reset of factory setting, connected to my machine to witness the issue (extremely slow to just download 1 app). Finally I was told to send it back and that once Amazon received my return, they would send me a new one (under warranty). However, after I shipped back the device, I noticed the status of my original order changed into "pending certified vendor to repair". It was not what was being communicated to me prior to shipping back my original tablet. Bad experience with the warranty process.
 After 2 other "kids" tablets turned out to be junk, went with these based on internet reviews. Very happy! Lightweight, durable, easy to start up and use. Battery lasts quite a while, fast response and loading. No complaints so far! Will update if needed after repeated use by my 5 and 2 year olds. Can't beat the deal of two tablets with cases for $150! A little worried about the "subscription" to kids content. Wondering about cost once the free year is up...
 This tablet starts out as amazing. The perfect tablet to help distract my child so I can actually eat a full meal at a restaurant. A lifesaver on the weekend so I don’t have to wake up at 5:30am on a Saturday and can eek out an hour more of sleep while he’s distracted watching games. But here’s where it gets bad. The charging port for this thing SUCKS. What once was a saver now is a large point of contention because it will not charge. What replaces it is a screaming and pissed child that is now in withdrawal and IT WILL NOT CHARGE. I am on my second tablet and I’m done. I can no longer tolerate something so undependable. I will say that Amazon customer service continues to be amazing. They have replaced this item twice now without issue (they must have children too). But I think I’m now moving on and purchasing an iPad instead because they reliably charge and I can’t take the uncertainty of how long my next tablet will last before it decides to start sucking at charging while I’m left with a beligerant toddler raging at me because he can’t play Minecraft or watch a grown man unwrap toys on YouTube.
 My three year old has learned so much from this tablet with the freetime. I would recommend it to anyone! It has helped him will his shapes, colors, puzzles, matching, coordination, and so much more. He loves the books, apps and video's. He can tell you every part of a excavator thanks to Blippi! Lol. My only recommendation is to buy extra storage. It is not neccessary if you clean out the games they don't play at least weekly.
 But this for my son and he absolutely loves our bit as a parent I've found that it's not kid or parent friendly. The amazon freetime is great but the OS no way top limit the space used by a profile so when my son downloads huge files because he's three the tablet lets him use the space even if there is none left to update. I'd the was a way to limit the space he uses then I'd give it a ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ review but with that major issue along with having to manually delete apps on his profile instead of on the adult profile I'm disappointed and in love at the same time
 We really like this kids tablet. I love it that my son can play his downloaded apps without having WiFi and there are SO many apps to choose from! You definitely need an SD card for more storage. I like how we can easily switch over to my profile to access everything else the fire has to offer. The padded shell is perfect for child handling. I recommend this to anyone who has a child that wants their own tablet and wants to control content and access. 5 Stars!!
 We have never had issues with an Amazon product until this tablet. Out of the box it wouldn’t stay on our WiFi network. It wouldn’t remember the user name or password. Every time you would pick the child’s profile it would say error try again. If it would connect to the child’s profile it would say no content has been added. When checking the memory it would say that it was full. I called customer service and they couldn’t use the warrenty since we only had the tablet 4 days. Got transferred to another department and instead of sending a replacement and me mailing in the faulty device I had to return it and wait for my refund to be processed and could reorder another one. I can’t beileve how I was treated and my kid was out her birthday gift.
 Solid build and durability means that kids love it, parents love it, and maybe even the dogs love it. The battery life on the tablet seems to be sufficient for nearly a full day of play. The speaker however sounds a bit tinny but is about what I expect for the price. Thanks to this tablet my son has been interacting with more games and learning new shapes colors and words. The dogs are also thankful for this tablet because now my son doesn't bother them when the just want to rest.
 I bought this exclusively to allow my toddler to have an option to watch videos or play simple games in airplane mode while on road trips. I have read all of the tech support articles and just spent an hour on the phone with 3 different support personnel and no resolution. I’m disappointed that content included with prime video does not appear in my video library when downloaded therefore I can’t share it to FreeTime that way. Unlike the amazon support articles state for making kid travel easier, I can’t press and hold to download tv show episodes in FreeTime either. If I can’t get this resolved, this is useless to me and I’ll go back to Apple devices with guided access.<br/>Update- apparently it takes a while for the kindle to get up to current software. Under the current software, you can download the FreeTime videos in FreeTime. Whether it works great for a toddler remains to be seen
 Many apps that claim to be free are not. The tablet takes too long to charge even when using much larger charging bricks. It is durable yes, but it cannot access youtube and many of the features are only available while online. Why does a book require internet to be read???? Don't buy this tablet. I got this so my daughter would stop using my ipad, and it's been 3 weeks since christmas and she's right back where we started.
 It was nice while it lasted. I bought two for my boys and the charger quit working for both of them within a couple months. It sounds like a lot of people are having this issue as well... maybe Amazon should resolve it.<br/><br/>**UPDATE**<br/><br/>Amazon contacted me and got the tablets replaced. it was VERY painless. I am impressed and happy that Amazon follows through with their customers and replaces their products when they break. The new tablets are working great. Hopefully it stays that way. Changing my two stars to four due to their great customer support. :)
 My son loves it! I've had a kindle fire(with no case or cover)for several years that my son was using on a regular basis and that one has held up great, so we decided to purchase the kids fire to replace a Nabi, that was broken when we got it, took 2 months to repair and broke again 8 months later.  The kindle fire is very comparable to the nabi, my son loves all the preloaded games and it's easier for him to navigate, he only is allowed an hour a day but he can use it 4-5<br/>days before needing to charge it again if it's turned off between uses.  If you want a quality product that is reasonably priced and comes with some of the kid geared apps and is comparable to some of the higher priced kids tablets(nabi) get the fire, you'll be glad you did!
 I would like a complete refund. I’ve had problems with this Tablet since day one. Now the charging port is loose. I’ve done everything as in managing my child’s time and I charge it up away from him. He gets it only 2 hrs a day to play only if he’s good. Once it’s fully charged I take it off charger in hopes to keep from getting the port damaged. If this isn’t going to last and I’m unable to get an email from amazon on this situation I recommend no one but any of amazons tablets as they’re not worth the money or hassle.
 The tablet is a good side comes with good games. But I cannot watch any videos. I get an error message on each video is the kids profile. So basically my son only use it for games. Then we have switch to parent profile to use YouTube for him to watch videos.
 What a big disappointment. We purchased two for our twin grandsons, a blue and a yellow Fire 7 tablets.<br/>After less than 3 months the blue one stopped charging. Getting it fixed turned into hours on the phone with Tech Support. We were finally told it was not fixable and sent another one but supposedly upgraded version, without the Parental Controls. Guess what? What  was the better version is now starting to have the same problems not charging.<br/>Now I have to return the second ( yellow)<br/>tablet. It was supposed to be kid proof?<br/>Same problem not charging. I will have to allow a morning to go through the Tech Support maze. Don’t buy this product. The one star it made our grandsons happy for a few months.
 Had done a previous review in the first few months and everything was great then it got an update on the free times for kids. This tablet was purchased solely for my son with the money that he had saved up from his birthday. since the first few months and the update my son can now download anything in free time that is in his age range even if he dosesn't mean to with just an accidental brush of an app/book allowing for the 16gb to fill up very few apps end up on his 24 GB memory card. Plus many of the apps just stop opening or working even when the developer is different. An app that opened 5 minutes ago won't. The battery quickly drains, factory reset is required often. This was meant to help him learn, and be able to help him take long car rides and sitting in waiting rooms as he is younger mom and daddy still work with him on the tablet but the new free time set up is not made for younger children who are still working on hand-eye coordination. Would not recommend this tablet for anyone under 6 or even older with the way that it is working. Not happy with it.
 I bought two for my kids. One of the tablets I got was it was not connecting to the WiFi so I contacted amazon and they sent me a new replacement the same day! I returned the one that wasn’t working a few days later. Great customer service!<br/>Back to the tablets themselves they are great for kids. I love that it had an option to lock all entertainment until they read ebooks for at least 15 minutes. It gives them an incentive to read. I also love that I can see how much time they spend on apps. The only take away is the tablet is kind of slow at times but it rarely happens and the kids don’t seem to mind that.
 It's really hard to beat this tablet based upon what you get for the price.  The tablet itself is sturdy and the performance is fine if you're just looking for a tablet for your child to play games, watch videos, and read books with.  Amazon also includes a year of Amazon FreeTime which lets you download (for free) all kinds of apps/videos/games that have been curated for your child and their specific age.<br/><br/>When you add in the two year no questions asked warranty where Amazon will repair or replace the tablet due to kids breaking it via hard use or some other catastrophe I just don't see how you could get a better value with any other product from any other vendor.  If you want to get your young child a tablet and you're not looking for the highest performing beast with a crazy HD display and all that jazz, then this tablet and all that Amazon includes with it deserves strong consideration.
 I love this. We bought a LeapPad last Christmas and it sat I played with. My kids are 6, 4 and 2. This is mainly for my 6 year old. I love that it gives me my own profile with all of my Amazon and kindle books and apps on it and then I can transfer the kid friendly apps right to the kids profiles. You can customize the timers however you want- if you want them to learn before they play or spend a certain amount of time doing books, videos or apps. It is the greatest! Worth every penny!
 Love that it came with the case. Love that it has multiple family profiles easily accessible so my 11yo can have games/content that my 3yo doesn't. Love that MY profile has a separate passcidw so they can't do whatever they want at any time.<br/><br/>I do wish in the kids mode there was  a better search option for specific apps not just by character.  Also maybe an easy way for me to look at the apps available and say download a set of like "2nd grade reading/ math/ science" all together. Overall happy with the purchase.
 Don't waste your money on this item !!! The first one I bought for my grandson worked good for about 2or 3 days then it started to turning off and  blinking in the middle of him playing with it for no reason .. And the replacement is doing the same thing too...
 We love this tablet and the super squishy case! However, my son dropped his in the toilet and the touchscreen stopped responding. I spent almost a half hour answering questions for three different support teams before they finally sent me a return label. I'm glad they honored it and I am so thankful that this warranty is available (because the case can't save the tablet from the toilet!) but it was a hassle to get through the support chat when I had already tried all the troubleshooting steps and knew the circuits were fried (and told them that upfront).
 Love it! It's perfect for my daughter. The games and videos are perfect to keep her entertained while in the car, and at any time it’s needed. The case has been tested by her dropping the tablet countless times and is still in perfect working order without a single break or crack in the screen. So glad we purchased it. Would definitely recommend and buy again if needed! The ability to have kids free time and the options for free games and books as well as tv and movies make this a perfect gift for any child.
 Absolutely satisfied with the purchase!! It came in brand new with a USB cord, prepackaged into the kid-proof pink case altogether in the Kindle Fire Tablet box. After downloading the apps I'm sure our kiddos will LOVE it. :) We also bought this with the Fisher Price Smart Cycle, we have yet to try it out, but it looks promising that it will work. I recommend adding on your cart a screen protector, just in case, and also adding on the memory card. We had added on to our order a 128 gb memory card which was easy to put in and will come in very much handy with all that we plan on adding in to the memory.
 Super upset about this purchase. I got this for my 2 year old for her birthday since she loves games and Kids YouTube. Unfortunately opening of apps is slow (which she gets frustrated with), there are definitely un-child friendly ads that pop up that she just clicks on, not user friendly as a whole compared to apple products. I have a difficult time trying to use it as a 31 year old. Guess I got what I paid for. I wish the case had a way for it to sit up so she doesn’t have to hold it or lean it against something. Gave it 2 stars just because the size is nice. Unfortunately I threw the box away and set everything up so I can’t return it.
 This device seemed great at the time. I have had it replaced 2 times in 8 months. Each time with customer service has been terrible and time consuming. For example today was my second contact, over this second battery malfunction, and over 1 hour of them trying to find proof I had a device sent back. Even though I had the label information and tracking number for UPS. They seem to last about 4 months before the battery will not charge anymore. I also bought in pink for my daughter which has had similar problems. The data fills up an other folder, which you cannot access to clear. You have to completely factory reset the device every time it gets full. You cannot disable the downloads, so if they determine it to be an age appropriate game/movie/book the kids can tap on it and download what they wish. I would prefer to sit down with them and download what they want then it go into kid mode. My youngest constantly downloads then the tablet does not want to function due to memory. When the warranty runs out and/or I have a heart attack from the stress I will find a different tablet.
 I was skeptical about getting a tablet for my toddler. I’d love for him to play outdoor a lot more. Having to choose though, I think this is the right one for toddlers and young kids. First of all is sturdy enough to be handled by my rough 2 yr old. Super easy to use and I love the fact that he can watch, play and listen to books all in one place, only once I downloaded the apps. Which means I know that what is watching fits his age. There are tons of videos and apps to choose from, and -wait for it, they’re free for a year!!!<br/>The only reason I gave it 4 starts is that I wish there were different languages you can choose from and more learning apps. Other than that great product at a reasonable price.
 I can’t brag on this little tablet enough. For the price compared to our iPads, I wasn’t expecting much. Our 2 year old loves watching kids YouTube on our iPads and I was ready to have mine back. I bought this for her for Christmas not expecting much. Ummm why didn’t I purchase this months ago!? My husband put kids YouTube on it in about 15 minutes Christmas morning. It works amazingly well on our WiFi, my car WiFi and my moms wifi which is often glitchy.<br/>My toddler LOVES her new “iPad” and I love having my iPad back.
 In a family of 8 I owned 6 amazon fire tablets and all of them have trouble charging because the charging port on the tablet itself eventually gets defective over time. I’ve tried numerous charging chords and blocks and nothing. The only way I can get it to charge is to bend the chord in a weird way so the port actually makes contact with the chord and sometimes that doesn’t even work. I would definitely not recommend these for children especially because of this. Children tend to run the battery out and end up watching the tablet while plugged up to the wall outlet. This would be an awesome tablet if amazon stepped their game up and switched to wireless charging. Hope this was helpful. Over time I’ve owned probably six of these tablets 4 were given as presents because after the first 2 tablets I refused to buy any more.
 I bought these over a month ago and decided to wait before I reviewed the product because I wanted to give it a fair run. I was hesitant to purchase since I'm definitely an Apple products person. For the price these are cool for the little ones but I really wish I would've spent the money on an iPad. These are hard for me to navigate let alone my children. I don't really care for the apps that are available and again I find that the Apple apps are definitely superior. The Freetime app is a cool concept but the content available isn't anything like I hoped for.  I also find that they don't hold their charge for the 8 hours the booklet claims. I will say that they seem very durable which is a positive.
 Will literally never buy any other tablet brand for my kids. They are still learning about responsibility and care of electronics and these are perfect. These bad boys survive the general abuse my kids throw at them and when one of them finally got a cracked screen it was as simple as a quick chat and mailing it back. Couple days later, there was the replacement. I would suggest getting some micro SD cards if your kids are like mine and expect to be able to install all the apps all the time.
 This has been an absolute dream. My daughter loves it, and all the extra stuff that comes with it. Definitely worth the money. And to the people complaining about volume, I have had no issues with that. It gets very loud and has great sound. Screen is amazing. Wish I would have invested in one of these instead of an iPad for myself. I am 100% satisfied.
 We purchased this for our three year old, who is quite savvy with electronics as she already has a Samsung Tablet.  We found the device to not be very user friendly, not easy to navigate and very slow when downloading or opening apps.  Another thing that annoyed us (but mostly our toddler) is the fact that apps would disappear from our library...this is not a typo....they were there one day and gone the next.  Not good for parent or toddler.  We've already reset it to factory settings and will be sending it back.
 Rugged and fun for all ages! The kiddoes have been trying their hardest to destroy this thing, but it's a trooper and hasn't yielded to their abuse so far. The no worries warranty is very comforting, especially after these monsters stepped on their hand-me-down iPad and cracked the screen. The free apps and videos are great and the kids love 'em. This kindle can have multiple users, including non-child accounts so it has the full functionality of the regular Fire tablet. I recommend this to all of the parents at my kids' pre-school.
 Should allow customers to purchase without have Amazon account sync to the tablet what if the person your giving it to doesn't wish to have an Amazon account with there credit card information exposed. The games given should have been off line games as what happens if the child doesn't always have Wi-Fi and lastly before purchasing consumer should knw if you live out side of the countries listed the tablet will not allow you to access the free games and videos. The quality of the tablet is very nice however i can't use it unless i sync my Amazon account to it
 This thing is awesome! So durable and my toddler is in love with it. He throws it across rooms and steps on it. NO damage whatsoever. We have owned this for about 3 months and have absolutely zero complaints. It even works without wifi. What a godsend. Feels like limitless memory, he has so many apps on there.
 We bought this for our 3 year old for car rides and other times where we want to provide some entertainment or distraction.  After trying and resetting this tablet countless times, virtually every app available requires the internet!  There's no internet in the car or in most places.  And we constantly get the "Oops, something went wrong" blue screen of death.  The first time I saw that, it seemed like a witty error message, but constantly trying to explain to my 3yo why she can't play her games, watch her videos, or read her books is exhausting.
 i called today because my granddaughter kids edition kindle fire was sent back because malfunctioned. tech support told me on 9/9/18 that if they can't fix will replace which part of worry free warranty. i spent hour with customer support<br/>then kindle department and tech support about granddaughters tablet. they finally told me te order got lost. idssue on there end so either i could get refund or wait 2-3 wks for them to resolve problem. well decided on refund which was not enough to cover price of kids kindle  now. i pushed for them send me another one and resolve problem on there end. they assurd  me they would but still would't send me new one. so will get refund but they had to  $30 credit plus $5 gift card to cover the difference. purchase black nfriday last year. yes the charge port is loose and so is her sisters.  it shouldn't be this hard amazon. need work on customer service or will start loosing loyal custom ers<br/>  frustrated customer cathy siddall
 We bought two of these for our sons for Christmas and within months they would not charge. I find it difficult to believe we recieved two anomalies. We're replacing them with a bigger brand this year and I will not buy another kindle.
 This thing is AWESOME! My daughter loves it, it was definitely worth the money. I was very skeptical about buying her one, but I gave in. But one it got here, the safety and security features eased my mind. Not only is there a content filter (that will filter out and block anything that isn't age appropriate) so your child won't see what you don't want them to see, there is also what I call a "big brother" feature where you can literally see every move your kid makes on their user. You can also set a time limit where it locks after a certain amount of time, and you can also force your kid to do educational activities for any amount of time you see fit before being able to do what they want on it. Thanks to this tablet, I finally have my sanity back. My daughter is very hyper and likes to cause trouble. When I just can't take anymore or just need to relax, this thing keeps her happily occupied. I think every parent should buy one of these, it's a real life saver.
 Really impressed with build quality and the case construction. Perfect size for little hands, 2 year old loves it.<br/><br/>Only issues I have are with the OS, it should have touch lock app built in. Instead had to install Google play to install one.<br/>Secondly, there should be a way to hide things in Freetime (which is a great idea, just not perfectly executed), such as cloud apps and videos. And should be able to download offline videos in kids profiles, instead have to download and watch in parent account, at least for Prime Video and Netflix.
 Our daughter received this not more than a week ago for her birthday. We love that we can control what she accesses and that we can set limits for her. We usually only let her use her device at the end of the day to read a little before bed. I unplug the tablet from the charger around 7am (because as we know, leaving your devices plugged in wears battery life quicker) and by 7:30pm there is only 25-30% battery life left on it. Where did the other 75% go while it was sitting unused all day? My 3 year old iPad holds a charge for 3-4 days when it’s not being used. We haven’t watched videos or played any high graphic apps on it yet, but I can’t imagine the battery will hold up long against them.
 I actually brought this item for my 1 year old! The quality of this tablet is really good. It has amazing protection and the warranty it comes with offers a replacement device if it is broken or just stop working. No questions ask! The app that is on here is really awesome. You get to see a lot of shows for free. The only complaint I have is that the battery dies pretty quick. But all in all it is a great tablet for a kid. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone.
 I bought this as a Deal of the Day on Prime Day, and my 6 year old son loves it.  He formerly had an iPad, so I was worried he may not like the change, but the FreeTime subscription is amazing and he has SO much to do on this tablet and I don't have to worry about his getting on any inappropriate apps or websites.  Plus he cannot get into the settings and change anything, like he used to do on his previous iPad, I LOVE IT!!  Cant say that enough, this tablet is great.  Plus you can upgrade the storage capacity!!
 This particular one (I bought 3 for my kids for Christmas) worked for 6 months, then wouldn't charge.<br/>I contacted customer service, who gave me a huge run around.<br/>**HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.<br/>**FIX THE CHARGING PORT!!!<br/>** There ISN'T a "worry free, no questions asked, 2 year warranty" It doesn't exist.<br/>It's been 1 year for ours now, they are all having problems, and we've never had an answer about HOW to get them replaced or repaired.
 We got this as a Christmas present for our preschool age son. It arrived undamaged and on time. I love that it comes with the protective case and the 2 year warranty! Such a relief when making such a purchase. I was concerned there may not be enough for him to do, since he's unable to read as of yet, but I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of age-appropriate apps available through Amazon Freetime. The absolute best part about this tablet is the ability to set time limits and also have a "curfew." So even if I'm not watching the clock, I know it will shut off at the time I have set every evening. It also makes putting it away A LOT easier when the orange screen says "Time is up for the day!" versus me just trying to take it away. Overall, it's a great product, and I'm extremely happy with it.
 Worked great thfor first 3-4 months. After that the thing wouldn’t hold a charge. It was dead after 30-45 min of play time. Very annoying esp on long car rides.  Each game takes up a ton of space so make you sure buy memory card. It’s easy to use for 3+. Takes like 20 mins to set up maybe longer. I’m currently awaiting customer service to fix my issue of the tablet not turning on at all. It’s completely black. I’ve seen other reviews with same problem as mine. I wish I could love it as much as my son, but it def came with a lot of problems.
 The tablet itself is fine, came exactly as described, easy to set up.  We got both the pink and blue for our twins.  I like that I can log in to my account on my childʻs kindle if necessary and that there are parental controls.  The one thing I donʻt like is that they can pretty much download any app they want.  Thankfully my kids are young still and havenʻt figured out how to leave their kid-friendly side, but I know itʻs coming down the road.  Other than that, this thing is great for entertaining my kiddos.  Thanks to their grandparents for springing for them.
 The product itself looks nice, but the functionality is terrible. The touch input is incredibly slow when it works and is unresponsive at best. The apps take a ridiculous amount of time to load, which doesn't lend itself well to being a kid's device as attention spans are a premium. The battery will not last more than a day, whether in use or not; for reference, my 3rd gen iPad (much older than this thing) can go about 2 1/2 weeks without a charge if not in use. Currently I'm running down the battery as the Kindle Fire is frozen and unresponsive to both mechanical button and screen presses. Never again, never recommended.
 We bought this tablet for long car trips, sick days, and pretty much any other time you might need a toddler to sit quietly for a while. At first it was fine and fairly easy to use, but with each software update it gets worse and more complicated. Instead of being able to access the apps he likes more than half the screen is "things you might like", and there is no way to customize or remove these sections. I would get frustrated using this tablet as an adult, let alone as a child. The only thing keeping this from being a 1 star review is that it seems to have a good battery and we've not had any hardware problems with it.
 This review is to express my frustration with the very difficult time I had setting the tablet up.  The web browser was apparently only set up to allow websites that had been "pre-approved" by parents.  So I tried to pre-approve a website but kept getting an error message.  I then spent over three hours across two evenings looking through the forums (finding many others having the same issue) and chatting with customer service.  Finally, after numerous updates - literally at least 10 - the tablets then started allowing multiple websites that Amazon had pre-approved, which is apparently a recent change that Amazon decided to implement.  I don't know how a device can be released to the public with so many updates needed to get it to function properly and I honestly expected more from Amazon, who I have appreciated for making things simple for the consumer - until this point.
 Charger port on device won't charge.  This is the second Fire 7 Kids Edition that I've bought and again the second one that looses its capability to charge.  I bought a brand new one in May and already in Sept, 3 months later, wont charge.  Questioning the value of this $99 purchase as it's the 3rd one that I received and again it's the same problem.
 Bought this to replace an old Samsung tablet that my 3 year old beat up pretty good over the years. The thing was old so I bought this on prime day. Honestly, I’d rather keep the Samsung. This product runs so slow. Things freeze up on him all the time. I’m constantly logging into the parent side to clean things up so he can get another half hour use out of it before he gets frustrated again. I’ve read horrible reviews and bought this anyway. The reviews were true. Not even 6 months into use and I want to throw it away and buy something different. Very disappointed.
 For my personal preference, I wasn't too happy with these for my toddlers. The apps kept disappearing and everything would go blank, plus there is no way to easily make this easy to use for my toddlers. It comes loaded with apps they can download with no easy way to remove them, so my toddlers hit every one and they all download until there's no more space. It would be easier to have a child's tablet come blank and the parent add specific apps that make it child-friendly and easy to use... My kids kept getting frustrated because the apps wouldn't stay downloaded and they had to keep re-downloading the same apps they enjoyed, then one day everything just disappeared... I wound up returning them....
 My son loves it, I like it but the subscription is ridiculous. Okay u get a year for free for buying a $80 KIDS TABLET. But when the free subscription is over it costs $3 plus your prime. I think that is to much, prime is enough, Amazon should include the children's subscription on the prime. Then they charge to add a child on as well. Its always bout money. For the Amazon's fire should be able to have a family of 4 on the subscription with rhe prime. I think it should all be one package.
 Shipped fast even without the expensive shipping.  The fire 7 was easy to set up. Great display.  The protective case felt durable and soft.  The only thing I have a complaint about is the application to regulate what your child has access to.  You subscribe for the service and get the first year free. After a year, from what I gather, they bill you for the service monthly.  I believe it should be free.  You're already paying extra for the child tablet.  But over all it's a good product from my first observation on set up.
 I bought this tablet for my three year old daughter, to have something to occupy her during long car trips, when we’re away from home, or when I’m working around the house to keep her busy and out of my way for a little while. She loves it! All the Disney content is great, I downloaded a few games for her to play offline (Talking Tom and Talking Angela) and she can also watch her favorite kids YouTube clips. The protective case is absolutely necessary for small children, and because it’s an Amazon product I can easily download books and other apps. Definitely a great buy, my baby said “thank you mommy I LOVE my tablet!”
 All in all it’s a decent little tablet with a great protective case. The FreeTime that comes with it was basically worthless for us though. It freezes up fairly regularly and takes a few minutes to “find it’s brain”. You can also only access the amazon App Store, but it has a fair amount of options. My 3 year old was able to purchase books on it! I didn’t realize it was as simple as it is, so now I have parental controls set. The biggest drawbacks are the freezing up and the quick drain on the battery. The case is probably the best. It truly does keep it safe in little hands.
 If you want to be constantly frustrated, constantly calling Amazon, and constantly be restarting a device, then the Kindle is for you. I’ve had two kid’s edition kindles for about 5 months. I’ve called Amazon multiple times because the Kindle’s stop working. Their response is to erase everything and start brand new. That works well... for about a day. Then, apps won’t load so you have to restart the damn thing multiple times a day. Sometimes, it loads with a black screen so you have to leave it off for about 20 minutes before rebooting it. The thing freezes nonstop where you have to restart it. Amazon representatives have basically told me the Kindles aren’t good tablets. They do nothing except bring an hour of frustration on the phone before you evenetually have to wipe the whole system and start fresh. If you wanna be frustrated nonstop, this is the tablet for you!
 We got this for our kids for our vacation and long flight and so far so good. BUT the only complaint i have is not being able to load our amazon music app in their kids view. The tablet itself came preloaded with iheart family music station but wouldnt it make more sense for Amazon to have their own Amazon music app loaded on the kids view with just kids music?? We can even load Netflix and watch whatever movies we want in kids view! Unless i just havent figured it out?? Our solution was to download a kids playlist with all their favorite music on the Amazon music app on the parent view, put it on airplane mode and they can listen to music and not be able to surf youtube, internet, etc. It just stinks cause you cant go into their profile while listening. Other than that its great!
 I purchased two kindle fire 7's last year and they are a waste of time and money. The 2 year warranty is an even bigger joke. These tablets are practically worthless after your free year of amazon free time expires and at that point all apps downloaded expire and you have to pay $80 per year per tablet to continue using free time. Halfway through the first year my sons tablet stopped charging. We went through the ringer doing their "trouble shoot" process a few times before sending in for repair. No contact was made by amazon after I sent the item in for repair and we were given back a refurbished item without consent. This item contained none of my sons apps and free time had expired leaving us with a blank tablet that is practically useless as even with the fastest Wi-Fi speed available, internet streaming is basically as fast as old dial up internet. DO NOT BUY this item if you are looking for a tablet to travel with for kiddos. Never will I buy AMAZON electronics again. We now have 2 useless tablets that are basically just readers.
 Received this tablet today it was intended for my 3 y/o granddaughter who was rather proficient on an older LG tablet until she dropped it and shattered the screen. After researching this product I decided it would suit her needs. After some difficulty I was able to establish an account and proceeded to download aps. I immediately noticed the battery which started at 77% dropped to 23% in less that 10 minutes. I fully charged it and presented it to an extremely happy little girl. Here's where the problems continued until I was mere seconds away from taking a hammer to this piece of junk. First it wouldn't connect to the internet once fully charged, even though I successfully download more than 10 aps. It stated I needed an internet connection to view the aps. The spinning circle would take me right up until it timed out and still not load. Then it froze and wouldn't do anything. After I restarted it multiple times it  never played the pre-loaded nor loaded apps just sit and spin. The battery was another story. Since it wouldn't do anything  I watched in amazement as the battery indicator went from 92% to 84 % in six minutes. Of those six minutes it wasn't even working so how did it drain the battery? It required me to sign in multiple times. Not sure how a 3 y/o would be required to do that each time you went from the home screen to the app screen. I see multiple issues with this product and I will be sending it back in the morning. Hopefully it won't be reissued to  another consumer thinking it was a good buy. By the way Amazon needs to change their this is not a "toy" statement. At least toys make it through the night before breaking.
 Very slow and unresponsive. I would not recommend this to anyone. Also will only run a gimped version of YouTube and no access to YouTube Kids app. This was a Christmas present for our kiddo and will now have to go through returning and picking out a new device. This was a complete waste of time and is making me question wether or not I will continue to buy Amazon Fire devices in the future (already own 3 Fire TV sticks, but am contemplating jumping ship for another brand)
 Love this tablet! My daughter got it for Christmas 2017 and she turned 3 on New Year’s Eve. My husband and I would let her use our iPad’s from time to time but would have to watch her like a hawk to make sure it didn’t hit the floor or she wasn’t in an app she shouldn’t be in.<br/><br/>The case of the Fire Kid tablet is durable. She had a little tantrum and threw it down, it survived unscathed. It actually bounced a bit. The operating system is a bit slower than the iPad but that’s more of an adult annoyance, our daughter doesn’t seem to care at all. It has apps from all of her favorite shows, love the fact that they are interactive. There’s a setting to limit their video time so they’ll focus on reading or whatever activity you would like them to do. She has no access to content that I would deem inappropriate, so while I still monitor her closely we feel comfortable allowing her to use the tablet independently. Free Time is absolutely wonderful, the tablet came with a free one yr subscription that we plan to keep. The memory is expandable via memory card which is also big plus for us.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn’t give it 5 Stars is because of the lag in loading time, again, the kids most likely won’t care, and the fact that is freezes every now and then with the only remedy being restarting the tablet which can be an emotional thing for a 3 yr old in the middle of fun activity lol.<br/><br/>Overall, we would recommend this tablet to others.
 UPDATE- Within 2 hours of my original review Amazon had called me to replace my daughter's broken tablet. I didn't realize a warranty came with it and when they read my review they took the time to call me to tell me it was still under warranty. The guy I talked to was awesome and even set up a repair for my son's broken screen on his tablet. I couldn't be happier with Amazon's customer service right now. Thank you so much! ORIGINAL REVIEW-My kiddos absolutely loved their tablets. The problem started when one of the tablets stopped charging. I tried several different chargers and it appears that the charging port in the tablet no longer works. I am super disappointed. It didn't even make it 3 months. ;(
 It’s been a great product/learning tool for our 2.5 year old. However, it isn’t drop resistant. My child dropped the tablet and the picture of the screen shattered. Amazon did stand behind the product and are going to fix it. We’re currently waiting for it to come back.
 These are ok tablets for the kids... except the battery life and charging stations are C-R-A-P. I've had to replace my daughter's kindle twice (thankfully within the 2 year warranty) and my son's is needing to be replaced soon (not even a year old), all for the same issue with the charging port. I don't know if it gets loose or what, but the dang things just won't charge! You have to have the cord positioned *just* so and make sure no one even thinks about breathing on it or ELSE. It's just plain annoying. My daughter's tablet is outside the warranty now so I'll have to pay for a new tablet. Sure as heck won't be buying a fire!<br/>I gave this review a 2 star rating because the covers really are amazing and keep the tablets safe. They're easy to remove and clean. If the charging weren't such an issue, these would be 5-star tablets!
 I bought 2 and the apps don’t work all of the time which is very frustrating. They are either super slow to load or they don’t load at all. This happens when the tablet is connected to WiFi and when the kids aren’t and just trying to play apps they’ve already downloaded. I even sent one tablet back to amazon for repair under warranty and sent the same one back and said they fixed it - they didn’t. For the amount of time, energy and frustration I’ve spent troubleshooting this tablet, I would have gladly paid the extra money for an iPad.
 If you have given your child an old iPad, certain features (or lack thereof) will drive you nuts.  Fires do not have a "Guided Access" function, my daughter can accidentally return to the home screen.  The battery life is definitely shorter than an iPad, even an old iPad 2 with years of use.  I'm fairly savvy as it relates to technology and can say there is less in the app store compared to Apple.  We were hoping this would be much faster and better than an older iPad for our daughter, but aside from the processing speed the system is not as much of a "WOW" factor we had hoped for.
 This is the 2nd tablet I've bought. And my son loves it. The first one I gave to my niece as a Christmas gift, she cracked the screen and we got a replacement that works great no questions asked and no charge... later she dropped it at a high school football game from the top of the bleachers (case on) the tablet didn't have a scratch and worked great...<br/>the one my son has he dropped twice already and it works great. He loves the freetime unlimited. Loves the games and to hear stories
 I got this for my two year old. Great games. I love that it comes with so many options already there to choose from. I love that you can set the age range and download books to read later. she is very intriqued with the tablet. She hasn't really figured it all out on her own..which is understandable because shes only 2. but I can see how it can grow with her and teach her. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because a lot of the games and apps cannot be played unless you have wifi..even if its downloaded to the memory card.<br/>Still a great tool for learning and reading books. especially if your little one LOVES to read books. def worth the price.
 This is more of a review of the Kindle department of Amazon rather than the product. I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my daughter only to find myself charged FOUR times the agreed amount (selected payment options at checkout). Unlike other double charges from amazon that fall off after a day or so, when I called Kindle they told me they repeatedly charged my account for whatever reason, and in order to get the three unauthorized payments off my account, I had to call the bank with special numbers to despute the charges. I get overcharged and my available account balance drops significantly, to the point where I cannot access needed funds. I express this to the Kindle team and their response is to throw “$10” my way for my inconvenience. Thanks. The late payments I’ll get hit with for not being able to access my money for  my bills will be more than that. Last time I do business with the Kindle department.
 Absolutely love it!!<br/>My kids are 1 1/2 &amp; 4 &amp; they loves the tablet!! &amp; the thing is a life saver for me too!! Comes in handy when your trying to do stuff around the house!! Buy another one soon!!
 I was hoping that this would be better than it actually is. There seem to be a lot of great apps and videos but it is SO slow to respond, constantly freezes, and will just shut down for no reason.  Obviously this is problematic with a 2 year old who doesn’t have much patience. Seriously thinking about returning and spending a little more to get an iPad.
 Tablet itself is fine (after we figured out the corrupt software issue with customer support), but VERY disappointed with the battery life. Bought two for our kids and they last maybe 4 hours of use. Unacceptable.<br/>*** UPDATE ***<br/>Amazon contacted me in response to my review and told me to close the open apps running in the background of my children’s profiles. This is done thru the parent profile but it is FAR from simple. After searching and searching (the person that called did not give me the steps to accomplish this) my husband and I figured out how to get into the app management for each child. Then we had to click on each app to see which were running (there was no indication either way) and if so, “force stop” the app. We’ll see if this works to save the battery. Even if it does help, it’s not something I’m willing to do on a regular basis — very labor intensive and frustrating. Why not put the little square on the child’s profile so the apps can easily be closed from the child’s screen?? So far, I’m not very impressed.
 Have purchased 4 of these kids kindles. while the cover does protect it from fracturing the screen, the charge plugs go bad on all 4 of them. one was replace by the store I purchased it from.. This model seems to be the only model with this failure mode. I have three other kindles that operate very well. Kids kindles are a loser..
 This is advertised to be 3+ but it forces you to put in your Amazon account with your credit card. This is NOT a product fit for a child. Parental controls CAN be bypassed. Please choose a different product.
 This is great for kids of all ages, including toddlers or those with disabilities. We had to fly with our 2 year old son, followed by a 4 hour drive and this helped keep everyone sane. It works great with WiFi. We made sure to download several movies from Netflix &amp; Amazon, as well as some of the free Amazon games, books + interactive books. It can take a while to charge; however, the battery does last a surprisingly long time. The grip from its frame helps keep a hold of it, or if you need to prop it up, it keeps it from sliding. Thus far it seems resistant to breaking despite the drops (and few throws) its experienced. My sister, who is a disabled adult, also found this much easier to use than other tablets. We plan on buying more of this brand / style for other family memebers. UPDATE: Still works without issues, nearly 1.5 year later &amp; we found if we place the tablet on Airplane Mode plus the toned-down “Blue” vision (for night time) it will charge up fairly quickly; however, if these changes are not made then it does take forever to charge.<br/>Once the battery is full, we remove the airplane &amp; blue screen mode. Charge / playing time has not altered at all since original purchase date which is astounding for any electronic.
 My daughter loves it, but I wish one could share personal items (Photos and Videos) on the kids profile. My daughter loves watching videos of herself and sisters that I record. The only way she can view them is for her to be on the admin profile so I am having her using more of the admin profile than the kids profile.<br/><br/>Another thing I noticed is that a lot of apps I downloaded do not work without Wifi, specifically the kids profile. BUT the weird thing is that they do work (some) on the admin profile??? I ASSUME this is because of all the safety feature it has to monitor what children view on the kids profile.<br/><br/>To sum up my daughter mostly uses the admin profile (especially on the road since there is not always wifi except at home).<br/><br/>So if you plan on buying you may want to consider buying the regular one and buying a kids case for it.<br/><br/>Personally, I am ok with my purchase because AS I SAID my daughter loves it BUT it can be better.<br/><br/>I believe Amazon could improve on having more apps that work without wifi, be able to share personal photos and videos with the kids profile, and not completly rely on wifi for the kid profile to work.
 Excellent value for the price point! Perfect for my children. I highly recommend the kids bundle that includes a very durable case, and two year no questions asked warranty. I haven't had to use the warranty, but it's great to know it's there! Plus the year of free content ( do I think that after the first year at something like $83. they do try to hook you). Overall, great value
 Perfect for our 2 year old. We were not ready to introduce her to devices like this yet, but she had other plans. We couldn't leave a phone or tablet unattended for 5 minutes without her grabbing it. She's obsessed with them whether we like it or not. So, maybe buying a 2 year old a tablet may not nominate us for the parent of the year award, but it's worked out wonderfully.  She loves her fire tablet, the content is tailored perfectly, and we can set our phones down without the fear of them getting temporarily disabled or wiped because of too many incorrect passwords.
 I love these kid kindles, we have 3 of them. My 3 year old throws everything and the protective case has done a wonderful job. None of the screens have any scratches or anything. I also love the parental controls. My kids don't have access to anything I don't want them to. I can even add individual youtube videos instead of giving them the youtube app that is worth it's weight in gold to me.
 I bought this tablet for my kids to use on long car trips. It's supposedly designed for kids. However, whenever they've had it for 1-2 hours on car trips, one of them will inevitably start screaming because they performed their own toddler factory reset it and it's no longer functional until we find wifi. It should not be easy for a 3 and 5 year old to reset this thing as often as both of my kids have been able to. I've reinstalled this thing more times than I can count and we've only had it two months. How about making a kids' tablet that kids can't reset on their own when they're preschool age?
 This is our third kindle and we have had horrible luck with them and even worse luck getting customer service to help repair them! The first keeps shutting down for no reason (either shuts off and won’t cut on, or cuts on but won’t let you open any apps, constantly says it can’t connect with my amazon account 🙄), the seconds charging portal is busted and I’ve called no less than five times have been told someone will pick it up to fix and no one ever shows, this new one randomly kicks its self off of the internet with no warning and instead of playing the movies downloaded on it it just freezes up! We won’t be purchasing again! After three failed attempts I’m over it!
 The tablet was too difficult to set up. Took too long. I bought this for my 2 year old. If she opened it and wanted to play with it, I would have had to take it from her for about 30 minutes to go through the extensive set up. I don’t like that they want to attach the tablet to a credit card. I don’t like that after 1 year I will have to make a monthly payment for the use of apps and other systems on the tablet. I am considering sending back it back.
 Tablet performance wasn't bad, and I understand that it's intended to be limited for kids, but I didn't know exactly how limited it was, I have two sons, my three year old gets some enjoyment out if it, but my 6 year old can barely get any use out of it for lack of applications that he considers fun. The screen is pretty weak, I love the fact that it came with the worry free guarantee and am waiting on a replacement, but the screen got destroyed about a week into owning it which is disappointing for a tablet marketed to kids. I'm going to do some research into exactly what applications can and can't go in it and I may update my review, but overall it's okay.
 We bought this on PRIME day back in 2017. At first it worked great, even as far as the battery was concerned. She has held and played with her tablet during multiple meals and snacks and has always wiped down well. We've had no issue getting the tablet to charge, but holding a charge is a different matter. She used to be able to watch her videos and play games all day before it would drain, now she's good to make it 4-5 hrs before we have to charge it again. Today, after only 2 hrs of use it was down to 40%. I've read where trying to get a replacement if the tablet is broken is a NIGHTMARE even though Amazon touts 2 yr replacement, no questions asked. Her tablet isn't "technically" broken, but it's certainly not working the way it's supposed to either. Not sure what to do.
 My son absolutely loves this thing. I limit him to 3 hours a day and so far he loves being able to use it by himself. It’s excellent for learning and he can watch his shows while playing. Battery life is great.<br/><br/>Amazon needs to add a button that will stop kids from<br/>Being able to download things though. He downloads everything and every so often I have to go and remove some apps to make space.
 In all fairness we purchased in Nov '17 but was a xmas present and wasnt unboxed/used until 2018. Once opened, it was used every day for many hours. Us &amp; Kids loved it. Kids mode was great and we could feel safe when our 2 year old used it. Lots of kid friendly apps too with access to more if you have the right Cable/Sat Plans. Rubber cover seemed sturdy and protective BUT...<br/><br/>This is where it goes downhill. I would have given this 5 stars...If it would have lasted longer than 4 months. It stopped powering for some reason. It was dropped a few times (not going to lie) but since it's a kid resistant version, I would think a few drops from the height of a small 2 year old would be ok. We did not spill or otherwise damage it in any other way. I dont know if the rubber patting wasnt enough or if there is a flaw USB port or we just got a crappy one (it happens). I can only go by the one I got and sadly it gets a 1 Star because now I gotta deal with a Pissed Off Little 2 Year Old Princesita and it should have at least lasted a year...<br/><br/>UPDATE: Was contacted by Amazon (Thank you!) and wasnt aware there was a warranty for this. Changing from 1 to 3 stars as they have been great about returning it to be fixed or replaced. Will update once I have gone through return process.
 This was delivered when expected.  My three-year-old loves it and plays with it every day. We opted for the yellow case which is very sturdy. It's some kind of Styrofoam type material that protects the tablet very well. My son has dropped his about a hundred times and it is never broken. The great part is with the 2-year warranty I don't even have to stress it. The only negative thing I could say about this is the lack of storage space. It has a large variety of games and books to choose from but no storage. I ended up purchasing a 64 SD card from Amazon as well but that is used up now too. I guess I'll have to buy another one.
 Hard to figure out, not a lot of instructions. It seems complicated. I’m not able to do what I thought I could do with it. I wanted the kids to be able to go on by themselves and watch paw patrol or read books. I have a subscription to watch paw patrol and they can’t get to it by themselves, they have to go under my account on it. I was hoping the books could be read aloud to them, I read it could do that, but only a few of the books have voice over. Not impressed by this at all.
 I love and my son loves this tablet but we are on number 2 because the first one's charging port stopped holding a charge. We returned it and received our second one only to have the same problem again. Definitely do no recommend, simply because I have the same problems as the other reviewers. The free time app is great but you can download that on any tablet.
 Battery SUCKS. Lasts maybe 3-4 hours tops? That’s if we let her stay on it that long, which we don’t. It doesn’t hold a charge if not being used, so we need to keep it plugged in all night. Our daughter loves it. The apps are age appropriate and it’s pretty fast. I read reviews that say it’s slow, we haven’t experienced that at all, yet. You get one year of free apps and use, then need to pay. Our daughter is only allowed to use it for learning purposes and watching “educational” videos.
 My 4 year old daughter loves her Fire! She loves all the apps and books available via amazon. I have recommended this product to many friends - and their kids love them too. The best thing is that I don’t have to worry about her little brother being gentle with it - first because it is well protected from drops and second because of the no questions asked, two-year replacement program. I’ll be purchasing another one when my two year old is a little older!
 My daughter was beyond thrilled to get this for her birthday! Decided to spend the extra money for this one because of the 2 yr warranty. Ive been threw to many phones because if she was playing a game and dropped it, then I had a cranked screen. She is still learning how to use it but I have a feeling it wont be long before she has got it mastered. She can run her grandmas Iphone and my samsung better then her grandma or me can. I love that they have a "bedtime" setting so I don't have to worry about her being on it when she is suppose to be sleeping! So far its great!
 Compared to various other Tablets, this one contains a lot of 4 year old + apps.  I no longer have to monitor where my 4 year old goes.  Then has a 13+ setting also.  It may not be the fastest tablet, but it does have core features, nice screen, decent storage, and a good safety cover.  When my little girl was 2 she started using a Asus tablet, it worked good until it was dropped 100's of times, I fixed the ribbon cable to the screen, but finally she broke the screen.  This one she will have to drop it on the screen on a shape edge or dull edge from higher.  And it comes with a better warranty, which I guess I will find out how good that is later.  I will for sure buy one again for my almost 2 year old son. Camera not so great, load time not so great.  But overall, best kids based design and function.  Also allows for an adult mode.  So multi user capable.  But no Google Play.
 Pros: Very user friendly (especially for kids), perfect size (not too large or heavy and easy to hold), all apps for kids are free (you won’t constantly be receiving pop ups to upgrade for a fee, or only be able to play basic, crappy games), a HUGE variety of games and apps for kids to choose from, settings to limit screen time, and the ability to require so much educational play a day before recreational games are available, when in kid mode you never have to worry about kids stumbling into apps or videos that are inappropriate (iPads guarded mode is a pain and even age settings aren’t as effective). For adults it’s just as user friendly and easy to transport. Great apps. If you have an android phone it’s even easier to use.<br/><br/>Con: This tablet is prone to a charging issue. The piece you plug the cord into can loosen inside and if this happens you have to finagle the cord to get it to start charging and even then it might not hold. This, of course, didn’t start until after the warranty expired so that was a little frustrating. It hasn’t happened on every tablet we have, but after researching the issue it is more wide spread than I realized.
 These are sooo slow and downloads take forEVER. Tedious to put movies on them. Can’t add anything that hasn’t been purchased thru amazon. Not very user friendly, especially when used offline for travel, which was why we bought these for our 3 year olds; to use on the plane as we are frequent travelers. I think we would’ve been happier with the iPads but we didn’t want to spend so much. Kinda wish we had. :/ These are pretty disappointing.
 I was really on the fence with this one. We got it for our 19-month-old for Christmas. I went so far as to leave it wrapped behind the tree for a week after Christmas while I struggled with the idea of returning it. I mean what toddler needs a kindle fire? Then she got sick and just wanted to snuggle and watch Elmo. This was a life saver. I love the easy setup. The Free Time is great. So many perfect  educational videos, apps, books, and games grouped right there for her in an easy to use format. She especially loves the kids music videos. The case is awesome. I feel safe letting her carry it around. And you can't beat that 2-year, no-questions warranty. I'm so glad we found this!
 I was so excited to purchase these tablets for my kids last year for xmas...especially with the no questions asked warranty. After having my kids break other tablets, I felt I was investing in a great tablet finally. Then they stopped charging a few months after purchasing, with the chargers they came with. I thought it was the chargers. Spent $20 a piece for for three replacement Amazon chargers...didn't work. Contacted customer service, and spent over two hours trying to "trouble shoot" and answering tons of questions before the told me that they couldn't replace their tablets. Every time I asked the rep "I thought it was no questions asked warranty and you have asked me tons of questions..And still i don't qualify for replacements, why?" Their reply was a well rehearsed "This is our process for deciding if it meets the requirements for replacement." I have since gone to best buy and bought the same 3 tablets and their warranty . I have had to replace one of the three tablets twice now because it won't charge. And went today to replace another. Why won't they stay charged? Very disappointed with Amazon. We have been Prime customers for years.
 I've had nothing but problems with these devices, mostly with the port for the charging cable.  I bought a device for each child; a year in the charging cable started to "wiggle" in the charging port and they would not charge.  I returned them, received replacements, and now the same problem is happening.  One of the two replacements will not charge at all and it's only been 7 months since we received the replacement.  To make matters worse, they CHARGED me for the replacements because I returned both broken units in the same box (return department couldn't figure it out, so they said I never returned them).  It's so time-consuming to deal with customer service/returns, I'm just giving up.<br/><br/>The warranty seems great but it's a ploy....it's not worth your time to bother with these.  Bite-the-bullet and get your kids a mini iPad instead.
 We love love love these tablets. We love the parental controls and there is such a huge selection of apps on Amazon Freetime. After buying two of them for our children we ended up buying two more for all the foster children coming in and out of our home. They are highly durable and the 2-year no hassle replacement warranty is awesome. The only downside I can say about these is you have to buy a memory card for it but you can get a 64 gig for about 15 bucks. It works without it however you are not able to download very many apps. We have had several other children's tablets over the years but these by far surpass my expectations
 I bought this product for my 2 year old daughter after seeing it could be useful for ABC's and counting. I figured it was something she could grow with for the next few years that would help us regulate her screen time with the help of the FreeTime App. We received the tablet and set it up for her. Once we opened her profile we found a screen with hundreds of apps, videos, games on it. Only a few of them were downloaded and everything you clicked on had to download prior to launching. We went through the setup and settings several times figuring we missed something. I wanted the device to have the "carousel" in the attached picture (this is the picture from Amazon that is used to advertise this item) that only had items we had downloaded so it would be easy for her to choose. After a quick search on the Amazon forums it sounds like an OS update around October of last year changed it so that you no longer have the "carousel" many are accustomed to. It's just frustrating cause the main reason we got this tablet was the simplicity of it, and now that is all but gone so Amazon can push app downloads to kids who just want to do their ABCs with Elmo.
 We love our fire! I'm still figuring things out about it, but it is great for my 2yr old! He works my phone &amp; youtube with ease, so this was very easy for him! I only have 2 minor complaints about it. 1. Is the volume really could go higher, but it's not bad. 2. Is where the circle, square, &amp; arrow r for back, exit, &amp; multiple screens is right at the bottom of the screen, which I kno is common, but for little ones working the screen, their wrist constantly hits it &amp; it exits the screen. This frustrates my son sooo bad! Myself as well! Maybe an "exit lock", or just putting it elsewhere could help!
 These things are garbage. It runs incredibly slowly, battery life is awful, videos can only be downloaded in the adult’s profile, meaning you have to switch back and forth between the kid’s profile and your own if you’re on a flight and large chunks of the selection are simply unavailable in airplane mode. Downloads also mysteriously disappear, so you really want to triple check that they’re still there before you leave for the airport. Given how slowly they operate you really want to triple check at least a day before you are getting in the plane so you can re-download, lest you be stuck up in the air with a child who just realized her kindle doesn’t work for basically anything. And customer service is the least helpful I’ve ever come across in trying to figure out what is and isn’t working.
 So I bought a fire for my daughter in October. Brand new, it decided to stop charging. However, I cant find anywhere to call them or contact them about getting a new one under my 2 year warranty. Not real happy with amazon at that moment. Usually sending back products isn't that hard.. just with their own products I guess.
 After a few years of my 4 year old Granddaughter playing on my tablet...I thought she would enjoy one of her own.  This is great! Parental controls allowed me to set up a profile just for her, giving her access to KIDS learning and other games...as well as her favorite Disney &amp; other videos!  Between safe programming and the protective casing, I don't worry at all.  Recommend for any parent or grandparent, as a gift for your little one.
 I'm not usually one to write reviews for products, but every once in a while - I feel the need.  I am giving this tablet a poor review for one reason only.  First, I'll start with the good stuff.  Like others have said, the thing works great, does all it needs to for kids and all that good stuff.  Really no issues there.<br/><br/>The bad however, that NEEDS addressed is the charging situation!  We have bought two and had to return them (about to do another) because the SUPER sensitive charging port gets messed up if you look at it wrong.  It's a KID'S toy!  Where is the large, heavy duty male/ female style plug for charging.  Why the mini USB or whatever it is that if you look at the cord wrong a few times, you have worn it out.  Regardless of how you try and supervise the kids usage, there are going to be times they unplug and plug the charging cord back into it and that's about all it takes to have it worn out to the point of not charging in no time.  I swear we live in an age where items are never tested or thought through with any brains.  I deal with it daily in my business and it's the first thing I thought of when we got our first tablet for our oldest and saw the fragile charging port.  This thing is pretty heavy duty all over and can be dropped/ hit/ abused and keep going, but once you have to charge it you have to use the most super tender methods or it's over - quickly.<br/><br/>Amazon! redesign the charging port on this thing to something that will hold up to small children!!  Please!
 Bought for my daughter's birthday to replace iPad mini (2nd Ed). Case is comfortable in both our hands. Performance and clarity of video playback is very good. Battery life is an issue. We find that turning off the Fire completely helps conserve battery; otherwise we are charging it daily. Unfortunately, youtube kids app is my daughter's favorite app; it is not available for the Fire, so she is still using her old iPad mini. Wish it was available for the Fire.
 My 4 year old grandson loves this. It seems durable and the year of amazon unlimited was a pleasant surprise. I like being able to set appropriate content for his age, and like having his books, games and videos in one convenient place.  It is great for keeping him entertained on the road.  It is fun watching him develop problem-solving skills as he tries to figure out new games, and seems like a good way to introduce early computer skills that will be essential in school.
 This new kids edition fire is lighter in weight than the previous version. I don't really like the selection of pre- loaded programs. I feel that the last model has better pre- installed programs for smaller children. It would be helpful if the downloaded books had a auto- read option. I also dislike the fact that it is only usable with wifi. May update my review as my son adjusts to the new upgraded/ downgraded version.
 If I could give this zero stars, I absolutely would. This thing has been slow out of the box. The app icons have stopped appearing and are now just a dashed box and you have to guess at what you're trying to open. Then you have to wait 30 seconds while the app opens. If it isn't the app you wanted, I guess you're out of luck because when you try to hit the home button the tablet freezes.  I go to restart it and when it comes back on it's the same thing. I didn't mind it being slow at first because it's for my 2 year old and she doesn't know it's supposed to be faster, but the fact that the tablet freezes as often as it does and I have no idea what app I'm trying to open is infuriating.<br/><br/>Additionally, the battery life is simply awful on this thing and drains in about 2 hours and takes another 4-5 hours to charge.<br/><br/>Apparently my support window closed a few weeks ago so I'm stuck with a $100 paper weight.
 I bought these for my toddlers this year for Christmas...I really wish I would've have spent money elsewhere! The batteries don't last long, you pretty much have to have an internet connection at all times, I've had to reset them twice now. I downloaded games, movies and books for them before Christmas so they would be ready to go on Christmas morning. I don't have internet at my house and EVERY SINGLE things kept popping up saying "You need to connect to the internet for this &amp; blah blah blah". I didn't download the movies from amazon, they were placed on the tablets from my Disney account therefore no internet should be required to watch them. The storage is horrible.<br/>Plus side is the case is very durable &amp; lightweight. So far that's the only good thing I have to say about this item.
 Originally bought for my son in June.  Worked great and we were all happy.  Then the battery would last less than four hours, whether he used it or not.  I sent it in for warranty service which took about ten days.  The kindle they sent back had someone else's content and memory card.  I then received another replacement that had the same battery issue as the first.  I then received a fourth kindle.  Hopefully this one works.  What Amazon does not tell you is that you have to have an adult profile on the kids kindle for account purposes.  However, everything your child does on the kindle is not saved in any account.  Thus, for the fourth time I have to redownload my son's content onto another device.  If I could give this less than a star I would.  Very disappointed with the kids product.  I have had two kindle fires for myself and have never had a problem.  I can't believe that no one at amazon thought of issues that could arise from the software on the kids kindle.
 It was great at first. Got it for my almost 2 year old for Xmas and we usually take it on car rides. Anyway, not even a month later, it stops working. I’ve had it on the charger for 3 days and it’s on 1% battery. I called customer support and they’re sending me a new charger. I just tried a different charger today and still nothing happened. I’m hoping I don’t have to go throughout sending back the tablet for refurbishment, because that would really annoy me. If the tablet stay d working, I would be a 5 star rating. But I can’t even get it to charge. 😭
 I’m not impressed with this at all. I got it for my daughter for Christmas but it’s so crappy I resold it. The apps have no descriptions so you basically base rather you want it or not off of the icon image. Then if you decide you don’t, you have to delete it and try to find another. I downloaded around 30 apps overtime, hoping to find some that would work for my daughter. Out of those I found probably 2 worth keeping. Just not a fan. I’d suggest Apple tablets instead.
 I don't know how well this works yet because I am currently locked into a child's profile and cannot get out.  I received the unit and started setting up profiles for the kids.  Got one set up with the PIN number, and now I can't get back to the original adult profile.  Every time I try to switch from a child profile to the original, I get a box saying "Settings cannot be changed under a child profile.  Please use the other adult profile to set up a Lock Screen PIN."  I don't have another adult profile since I"m the only adult.  Or I also get "Free Time blocks children from changing settings.  To access you must first set a PIN which you can do by opening your profile from the lock screen."  When I hit "Set Password" it goes back to the child profile lock screen and I can't do anything with the adult PIN I already made up. Als, I can't do a factory reset, as far as I can tell, from said child profile because the options aren't available on the screen.  Tried getting some help with the troubleshooting link, but that's not listed, and it doesn't seem that a real-time chat is available to walk me through anything.
 A little disappointed. I bought this for my little sister (6 year old) as she is a slow learner, but she seem to catch on from watching YouTube videos. Since getting this, not one of the videos on it plays. I kept getting error messages and this thing doesn't have the YouTube app on it so i'm forced to use the browser which makes this tablet worst than my Galaxy Tab. The games and books work hence the three stars.
 The Kindle itself is fine.  I would like to know, however, how Amazon can't find a way to fully protect this device from my 3 year old downloading everything, despite how many parental control functions I activate.  She also managed to factory reset the device by pushing numbers over and over on the screen lock.  Unless I turn the device on airplane mode and activate every feature, she can still manage to fill this thing up, thanks to all the ads that come with the stupid apps.  Should not be marketed at young children.  Looking to a leapfrog device instead.
 We bought two of these for a four year old and a two year old.  All my previous Kindle and Amazon Prime purchased are available! Each child has a separate profile with access to content by age. Internet access to YouTube etc is available but we haven’t activated and probably won’t as there is so much here!  For a year, the children’s app is free, after that, $3 a month — and well worth it!!  Setup was easy and the kids, even the 2 year old, quickly learned how to chose and play things they like. The charge lasts for a long time and we plug them in at night..  So far, no negatives!
 This tablet exceeded my expectations, my daughter is 3 and has autism. This tablet has got her to do puzzles, read books, and say tons of new words. The free time app is amazing I love the apps and I love that it is completely affordable only 99 cents with Amazon prime. Plus you get a year free so I don't have to worry for a while. Did I mention the case? It has definitely saved the tablet on multiple occasions since she likes to throw things down. I went ahead and got the glass protector for 10$ as well I definitely think that was worth it. Not to mention the fact that it has a two year worry free warranty. I would recommend this over and over again.
 I purchased 2 of the fire 7 kids tablets for my kids and already own an HD8 tablet for myself. I didn't realize this would create issues. I set up a profile for them in each tablet and wanted it set to where you have to enter a pin on their tablets to do any parental/app management. Well...it worked but also makes me enter the same pin every time I use my own HD8 tablet. I dont want to have to do this everytime just to use my own tablet. Also, the kids tablets randomly log off their profiles and and it shows it logged on as my 2nd or 3rd tablet with none of the kids apps on. You have to enter the pin and select their profile to get them back on. Another problem is with kids picking a bunch of games and not realizing how many apps they are running (The free kids subscription apps) You would think with parental rights you would have the square to pick at the bottom of the tablet to close out some of the games they aren't playing. You don't. So if one kid has a bunch of games running you have no way of knowing and it sucks up battery power. You have to do a hard reset to close all the apps. The only thing I am happy with is the kids app subscription. You dont have to worry about them going on any inapproptiate website or accidentally purchasing stuff.
 I purchased this tablet for my child for her 9th birthday from Amazon. I liked it, even though it is not easy to set up so it associates with your account.... I liked that it had the worry free warranty when purchased directly from Amazon. I ordered two more for my other children, shortly after. Unfortunately, all three tablets have had the same problem and needed to be replaced within a few months of use! The port for charging the device, is poorly made. I have had my kids use and charge other devices such as my Samsung cell phone and tablets, with no issues with the port whatsoever. I am very disappointed with this poor quality port, but even moreso with the so-called worry ftee warranty! I have had to speak to 3 people each time, explaining the problem over and over again. Right away, they want to refund you. Why would I want a refund when I used a promotion on the second two? It qould cost me more to purchase them again! That is why I purchased them theough Amazon, for the warranty. Also, when I contacted them regarding the last one I needed replaced, they told me I didn't have a warranty "attached" to that one. Like really???!! I mailed it in, and stull haven't received confirmation that they have it, and that a replacement is on its way. Makes me think I am getting poor service, as well as refurbished products instead of new tablets initially. Beware of the poor port issue. You will suddenly be unable to charge it, and may lose things if your kids don't remember their passwords.
 Seriously if you are a parent with young kids? GET THIS TABLET! I have twins - a boy &amp; a girl. My kids have had these tablets for 2 years strong. In that time even my 2 have had to only had to have the tablets replaced 3 times. Each time? It was simple &amp; easy to do. No hassle. Sent it in, got one back. Replacement usually within a week. Seriously, this tablet has paid for itself several times over! I love the no worry kids store &amp; the family shared games. I can give it to my young kids &amp; not worry about what trouble they can get into on it - cause they can't! Seriously this tab was designed by a parent with other parents in mind!
 I have purchased four of these for friends. We finally got one ourselves as a gift, and it was having a problem with a broken, flickering screen. After what felt like a zillion hours of customer support and service, they sent us another one. They forgot to tell us it was a refurbished. It came with a flickering messed up screen as well, no cable and no foam protectant. Boo. I sure hope my friends didn't have to deal with the problems we had... That would be embarrassing.<br/><br/>We are going to throw this in the trash, sadly. sheesh. This was such a waste of time for us, sadly.
 Fully charged tablet and set it up before giving it to my daughter for christmas. She used it for the first time on the 26th while getting ready for bed. Worked fine. The next day after charging it through the night she went to use it again. Multiple times in the middle of using an app the screen would turn black, sound still playing but nothing visible on the screen. Have to swipe down multiple times to get to home where the screen works fine. Just not on apps... which is pointless.
 I got this so that I could keep my son entertained while we went on road trips to visit relatives, because what kid wants to sit in a car seat for two hours? Setting it up was a snap and within 20 minutes of turning it on we were set up and ready to watch videos, play games, and read stories.  Upon using it for the first time, my son decided that he wanted to play the I drop and Mom picks it up game (yeah we still play that), and he hucked it out the car door and onto the concrete while laughing. I cringed thinking there is no way that the tablet was gonna come out unscathed but it did. There wasn't a scratch on it and it worked perfectly. During the last 2 weeks this tablet has been spilled on, dropped, thrown, chewed on, and everything else a house with kids and pets can do to it and it's still functioning perfectly. Amazon please make an adult version of the case with a stand please, I'm a bit of a clutz!  The parental controls on the tablet are great and keep my kid out of things I don't want him to see. They aren't difficult to set up at all. The only real problems I have with it is that I wish the battery held up a bit better and that because this fire and my fire accounts are linked I had to set up some security stuff on my Fire, it wouldn't let me bypass it. Overall I am pretty happy with it!
 I waited until my 5 year old put this tablet through its paces before I left a review. It took a lot of research and back and forth on whether or not my toddler was going to get a tablet. First, he's 5. Surely he's going to destroy it. Second, he's 5. Surely he's too young for a tablet. Y'all, on both counts this tablet is amazing. He had dropped it, stood on it, thrown it, got it muddy, left it on the van floorboards, basically did everything I thought he was going to do to it, and it is still alive. I'm shocked as well.<br/>The apps aimed specifically for him are outstanding. He's learning to read faster, learning Spanish quicker than I can keep up with, showing me cool videos on how things are made, playing games that make him think in strategies and mazes, and having fun while doing it.<br/>If you're going back and forth like I did when it came to buying this thing, do it. Especially if it's on sale. It's worth it.
 First off let me say that the tablets work well as far as the graphics, start up, and other things.  My children were very excited to get these tablets and it kind of got them out of my hair a little but then the problems started. First off, both of them had problems charging with the chargers that came with them.  One of the charging tables started to strip as if t was put down for a long time.  I had to eventually buy chargers for them which was a disappointment.  The next problem happened when one of them stopped charging at all.  It's just sitting in my desk drawer and I plan to return it before the warranty is up.<br/>If I was to buy another tablet for the children it would have to be a Naba because I never had a problem with them.  If it wasn't because of the charging problems I would have given it a better rating.
 Two things I don't love. First is that the default user is always switched to me (the adult) after it is turned off. Which means that your child has to know how to swipe down in the corner to switch to their profile. Not a big deal, but something I thought would have been obvious from a user-friendly perspective. Second, there is no way to distinguish between educational apps and just regular game apps in the "time limit" allotment. This kind of stinks because a multiplication tables app is definitely not the same as Geometry Dash.
 The fire is a mostly good product. But with this one that is my daughter's and my own there are some quirks. With this particular product the quirks aren't near as bad, the biggest complaint is that the pictures of the app don't show up in free time. This is a bit of struggle for my daughter who is just learning to read. Also when the battery runs down or it's powered off it doesn't start back in free time. I thought I saw that it should start back in this mode if powered off in this mode. Maybe I misread.
 My 15 month old loves my iPad. Whether we are on a road trip or lounging in the house he is using it. He loves ABC's and number apps. He shows this love by screaming and banging my very expensive 12 inch iPad pro. That didn't bother me until one day he decided to test out the durability by dropping it. (Luckily no damage).<br/><br/>It was at that point in time we decided to get him a tablet that could handle the "abuse". After researching online I have found the Kindle fire 7 for kids was the best deal. It functions like an android tablet but it uses Amazon's own software, so it took a few minutes to get use to.<br/><br/>HARDWARE<br/>The padding around the tablet is so thick that when it is dropped, it just bounces. (My son decided to test this as soon as we took it out of the box) Amazon is brilliant when it comes to knowing childern; it offers a 2 year warranty on it. If your child brakes it, they replace it no questions asked. It also offers 1 year of all access kids freetime. (This is Amazon's platform so you can download games, movies, books, and more). This tablet only offers 16gb but you can remove the case and add a micro SD card for more memory.<br/><br/>The battery life on the Kindle last 6 hours. That is plenty of time because you dont need you kid be on it all day. The speaker on it is okay. Its not the best sounding speaker but for a $100 and a kids tablet, it does just fine.<br/><br/>The camera is a cheap camera that wont take the best photos. But again, its a $100 tablet for kids so it does a good job.<br/><br/>SOFTWARE<br/><br/>THIS TABLET CONNECTS TO YOUR AMAZON ACCOUNT. IF YOU HAVE PRIME YOU GAIN ACCESS TO MORE FEATURES.<br/><br/>When you first set up the Kindle, you set up your child's account. You are asked when your child's birthday is. After you enter that in, the tablet will only show age appropriate content. If your child is under 10, the theme for the tablet is a bright blue and lots of colors. Over 10 the theme changes to a midght purple.<br/><br/>In the parent account, you can edit whether or not you want you kids to able to surf the web, download apps, make purchases, and much more. If have the "child under 10" selected, you will have to download the app on your account then add it to your childs account. There is a setting to do that. Go to settings, family accounts, chose your child's name, then add content. You can books, apps, videos, and anything else you want. But remember you have to download it first.<br/><br/>IF YOUR KIDS LIKE YOUTUBE-At the time of this review, I havent been able to download the actual Youtube app. I get apps that are very similar and will take you to Youtube videos but not the offical YouTube app.<br/><br/>Once you load you child's account, they cannot get out of it. If your child tries to do anything with settings or tries to switch accounts the are asked for the parents password.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/>Overall this a great tablet for kids. It is meant to take a beating and handle anything your child does to it. Its a $100 tablet that functions and serves its purpose. You can relax knowing that your child is only seeing age appropriate content and not have to worry about handing over your phone or your tablet. I would deffinelty reccomend this tablet for parents who are tired handing over their expensive stuff.
 The Fire was slow but sufficient for our 5 year old until it stopped charging.  We tried multiple different chargers and even purchased a new one from Amazon to no avail.  When I contacted Amazon support to get instructions on replacing the tablet... well let's just say it didn't pan out after wasting a lot of my time.  I would NEVER buy this product again.  Even canceling the FreeTime Unlimited was a hassle.
 My husband and I purchased these last year for our grandkids. I purchased two and he purchased two. Of the four, all four have had issues (TWICE) with their charging ports, which result in the tablet not charging, therefore turned into a brightly colored brick.<br/><br/>Returning is a giant pain - they ask you TONS of questions about whether you've tried different outlets, what the temperature is in the room that it's being charged in, etc. If you are lucky enough to get through this, then you might be able to send it in and get a new one...which will then break because THESE ARE JUNK.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in this case, saving some money on a tablet for your kids is not a great idea. Spend a little bit more and get a better quality one. After all, what is your time worth?
 I purchased this tablet for Christmas for my then 5 year son. I loved that it came with a warranty(if you have young kids, you know accidents happen)so if anything happened to it they would exchange it, no questions. He was doing great until one day he dropped it and the screen cracked. When I called to exchange it I was told by the first customer service rep that there was no warranty on such product. After going back and forth I decided that I wasnt getting anywhere with him so I called right back and talked to someone else who was able to help me out. The exchange process went well....upon receiving the new tablet I charged it and was doing the set up. Thats when I noticed that they sent me a refurbished tablet and I couldnt set it up like the old one. It wouldnt get passed the set up screen. I had to do a complete reset and lost everything! What a waste of time. Now I understand that my son broke his first one, but there was never mention anywhere that I wouldnt be getting a brand new. Im dissappointed not only in the customer service but the actual product. Will NEVER purchase again.
 These are great little tablets.  I have bought five for my grandchildren age 4-9 and they all love them.  I will be purchasing two more as soon as my younger grandkids are old enough (as long as they are still available).  The warranty is great and I actually had to replace one due to a broken screen.  It was not a problem and the new one arrived promptly.
 Our kids love these tablets. We got our 9 and 5 year old these for this past Christmas and they use them daily. Being able to gate their access to games behind spending time reading is huge for us to ensure they get their reading done for homework each day. The time limits are amazing, especially since they give them warnings leading up to the time they'll run out.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint, and it's a big one, is that the charging ports are absolutely terrible. We've already had to replace both tablets and it's only been a little over two months since the kids got them, and it seems that another one is on its way out. Kids are not gentle on their tablets. Even my older child, who doesn't play with it most of the time while it's charging, has had the charger stop working on her tablet completely. For awhile, if you jigger the cord around and then don't touch it, it will charge. Eventually, however, it will stop charging altogether. I do not feel that this is worth the price, especially because we have to send back the old one before we can receive a new one,and that's not common practice for most tech companies in my experience these days.<br/><br/>Overall, the kids love the tablets, but as parents, we aren't their biggest fans.
 I have to say i'm a little disappointed. Thankfully, this isn't for me, but for a 4 year old who doesn't seem to care that it's SLOW and that some of the Kid's setting is not very responsive.  The idea of the apps is nice but it doesn't always switch from apps to books, to shows, to whatever, very smoothly.  If it were for me, I would have returned it without remorse.<br/><br/>When I have it in the "adult" mode it appears to work just fine although the battery life doesn't live up to the advertised life.  I'm glad I have an iPad for myself.
 It is disturbing how terrible this is.<br/><br/>I'm going to go ahead and get over the fact that it's an HD display and I can stream movies on it (sometimes) and read full color magazines (sometimes) and all of that which is absolutely amazing. But, it's not 1982 and I've had several smart phones. The "amazing" of a tablet is not part of this. Yes, it's incredible that this thing that fits in my hand is more technologically advanced than the Apollo Lunar Modules. Got it. But it's 2017. Tablets have existed for years, smart phones, smart TVs, computers... blah blah blah. Yes, it's amazing that it works. Now--what it promises vs what it does?<br/><br/>Given the current progression of technology: For a 7th generation product, this is a terrible product. Terrible.<br/><br/>I bought this for all of the wonderful things that are supposedly part of this. Freetime, kid-friendly, etc. On top of that--fantastic, I get a tablet. A good sized HD tablet. Nice!<br/><br/>This arrives at our house and I "fire" it up. I set everything up, set up Freetime, create kid's accounts for my two daughters, and hand it over.<br/><br/>Within 3 hours they fill up every bit of storage downloading apps and books and whatever. "I guess I need a SD card?"<br/><br/>I order a SD card on Prime and it arrives 2 days later. I install it... and it doesn't seem to recognize that there's an SD card. I can't move apps, etc. Looks like I have to "restore to factory defaults". Fine, whatever.<br/><br/>I restore to how it was when it first arrived two days prior. I set everything up, again. This time I look at the book section--hmm... my kids go to a German school and routinely read German books. I bought a German-English dictionary for our Kindles, so I load it onto the tablet. Low and behold... it WILL NOT show up on the kid's profiles. The main profile--sure! Kids? Nope. I try everything. And then "chat" with Amazon tech support.<br/><br/>Guess what? Instead of noting that there's a problem with this poor excuse for a tablet, she has me ... restore to factory defaults. I go through everything, set up the child profiles, etc. etc. etc. and... the dictionary still doesn't work on the children's profiles.<br/><br/>I'm told that it "should" work and she adds it as a "support request". I'm told that once it is resolved, I'll receive an email stating that it's fixed. This was in June. Still no "fix".<br/><br/>"Do you have any other questions?"<br/><br/> this may be paraphrasing]<br/><br/>"Yes--my kids filled up storage on the first night they had this. In order to keep that from happening, I'd like to add per profile storage quotas. How do I do that?"<br/><br/>"That's not possible."<br/><br/>"So, my kids can download gigs worth of apps and there's no way to prevent it?"<br/><br/>"No. You can delete any apps you don't want them to have. Is there anything else I can help you with?"<br/><br/>"Well, within the main profile, I also see the option to save apps and data on the SD card. That doesn't seem to be an option for the child accounts."<br/><br/>"No, that's not possible. Only the main profile has access to the SD card."<br/><br/>"Okay...?"<br/><br/>Nearly everything I try to do on this to manage my child's profiles is not possible. Basic things. You know, like, DON'T DOWNLOAD APPS. No, they have access to all apps Amazon feels are "child safe". No, I want to approve, or, download apps myself. Nope. Not an option.<br/><br/>Native Android apps (like snapchat) don't work. Nope. Amazon doesn't include the Google Play APIs to make native Android/google apps work.<br/><br/>Okay...<br/><br/>The Kindle Fire has turned into an annoying tablet. The kids don't even care if they use it--it's slow, it runs out of space, and it's just not user friendly.<br/><br/>Okay... what use is this thing? Oh, I subscribe to The Week. My paper subscription is up, and I can download it to the Fire. Okay? Something I can do with this expensive paperweight.<br/><br/>I subscribe to digital version of The Week. It offers "realistic" magazine things like "curled pages". I don't need that. Just give me the text.<br/><br/>I breeze through 4 magazines (wow, I can read them so much more quickly on here!) before I realize that the "text only" option LEAVES OFF ARTICLES!!!!<br/><br/>WHAT!?!?<br/><br/>Okay, I guess I'll read the "realistic magazine".<br/><br/>Three weeks ago it starts messing up. I go to read it, the magazine won't load. I re-start the Fire, magazine no longer shows up. I tell it to download the magazine again--nothing. I re-start it, I repeat all of these steps, days go by, and... I wonder why I canceled my print subscription.<br/><br/>And, here I am. I have a smartphone--a Moto E4. It was on sale for $80. It does EVERYTHING I want. Amazingly, the Kindle app works PERFECTLY on my Android device. Why do I have this $90 Kindle? This Kindle that I have to fight constantly, that doesn't work, that is NOT what I'd expect for kids...<br/><br/>It's like a cheap knock off. Not an Amazon product.<br/><br/>And I'm not an Amazon hater. I have an Echo, I use Prime for just about everything, I've had multiple Kindle readers (they seem to break often too... hmm...), we do Subscribe &amp; Save, etc., etc. ,etc.<br/><br/>But this Kindle Tablet? What a piece of junk. I should have bought 2 Moto E4s!
 I gave this tablet as a Christmas gift &amp; it is now January 9 &amp; it is not taking a charge. I have no idea how to contact seller to report this problem. I am very disappointed with this tablet. I bought 2 fire tablets &amp; one works great while the other does not take a charge nor am I able to download many apps to it.
 This product was bought for my four year old it has problems all the time ranging from it not opening her apps to oops something went wrong and you being forced to restart the tablet 10-30 times a day. This is the most infuriating piece of crap I've ever bought. The customer service representatives are worthless. They just continuously place you on holds and literally have no clue about the device either. So now I'm factory resetting a tablet we have had for maybe a month.
 My original review that I wrote was taken down. These kindles are junk. Full of advertisements, won’t let us download our public library app, my kids perfer YouTube kids to their free time which is NOT free. Both of our screens cracked after a year. Used the warrenty, got two refurbished kindles, Had them about a week and they BOTH are broke. Our children’s kindles with the cracked screens worked better than the ones they sent us. They are going in the garbage, we will not be replacing them. Go with Apple products they work better and they last. Our iPad fell into a swimming pool and survived. These are JUNK.
 It works well for our 2-year-old. He is able to watch children's videos that we have set up for him.<br/><br/>The device is quite durable with the protective sleeve to protect the tablet. It is easy to find and the 7" display is plenty big for how we use it. It is not the easiest device to get set up for children under 3 years of age. We are still working out how do get downloaded kids apps onto the kids' profile.<br/><br/>If you are very tech savvy, then this will be perfect. If you are not tech savvy at all, I would suggest you find someone to help you get it all set up, as it could be a challenge.
 Best value for a pre-schooler about to enter Kindergarten. Right out of the box with a charge and begins running updates and it knew it was a replacement on it's own. Imported all the same content from the old one via cloud. Literally, a hands free transition. Just amazing how intuitive Amazon Fire products are. I also have a 1st gen Echo a 2nd gen Echo, a Dot and 1st gen Fire stick and 2nd gen Fire TV. The eco-systems and cross compatibility are fantastic and second to none. I could go on a lot more, but you get the point.
 I bought this for my granddaughter. It is a very secure tablet and great way to safely use the internet  and a great teaching tool. Computer skills are an absolute must now, and will continue to be even more important for her to develop skills to open up opportunities  in her education  and succeed in  in any career she pursues. She has mastered the ability to use the tablet to a degree that she is teaching her mom, who has a very high technology IQ.Only problem so far is that an SD card is an absolute must, and 64 gig cards are dropping in price so quickly that they are not a huge investment. Bottom line is that she loves the tablet. Highly recommended
 This is 2nd unit purchased and gift for a 4 yr old; older sister has had first unit for 2 years and only issue is the battery takes longer to recharge than the new one; the protector works great, no damage experienced; we limit screen time to 2 hours per week unless on a long car trip; I like that the content can been set to age appropriate; works best with WiFi hot spot when traveling; I also download my kindle books not it
 This product has been a huge disappointment.  My child’s screen freezes up constantly, downloads are slow regardless of WiFi connection speed, and content randomly disappears.  We’ve only had this for a week and I’m returning it today. I spent 1 hour and 37 minutes on the phone with a customer service rep. She concluded it must be the WiFi connection.  I conclude it’s a buggy product and not worth the money. Thanks a lot Amazon.
 I ordered this tablet for my toddler with the sole purpose of putting our Disney movies that came with digital codes onto it so I could put movies on to entertain him during doctor appointments. He doesn't play games or go on the internet. It came with this Free Time subscription, free for a year. Fine...but we didn't need it, use it, or even know how to use it, and at the end of the year it should have just expired, or at the very least given me the OPTION of renewing. Nope...Amazon took it upon itself to renew automatically and charged my account! I can't see that I have any recourse on this...who do I contact? The tablet itself is fine, but if I had known this was going to happen I would have just ordered a regular Kindle Fire like I ordered myself and saved the money for the difference. The fraudulent 'purchase' of the 'Free Time' pretty much negates the Black Friday savings we got on this tablet. Not happy, Amazon!
 The Battery ends super quick. Yesterday night was 100%. Today morning was 58 and counting...<br/>My advice, If you want a reader bought a regular Kindle. If you want a Tablet, buy and Ipad. This fire is in between and is not okay for any of this uses. I am only not sending it back to Amazon because I do not live in the US. Otherwise, I will already send it back to them.<br/>​
 I ordered this tablet for my two year old for Christmas and he loves it. It's the perfect tablet for younger kids or older kids even. Especially since it comes with the free one year subscription of Amazon free time which allows the kids access to so many amazing kid related videos, games, learning channels, and music. I'm super happy I bought this. It's made very sturdy and comes with a hard rubber case for protection from accidents. I definitely recommend for the younger kids especially.
 I as well as my son absolutely hates this item, would not recommend any parent to purchase<br/>Reasons : you cannot use the tablet unless you put a major CC on it which in my case my 6 yr old can order which ever games he wants when ever with not needing my permission which in turn not means when he is on it I have to supervise his every move on it because he would select an ap n keep continuing and little does he now not I have a 9$ charge or what ever price the app is one month my CC was charge over $50 for games that he didn't even play he just lied the picture and would select it and my card would get charged. I would recommend purchasing a Samsung tablet not this device. def. one of the worst purchases I have ever made.
 Extremely, extremely slow! Glitchy and my goodness did I mention slow. Takes for ever to download an app and just very low quality. If you want a tablet for your child I'd say this thing is good once it's working but just prepare yourself and kids with lots of patience.<br/>Physically it's not bad, very light weight which is good for kids. Personally I wouldn't recommend it, I don't believe it's worth its price,and yes I will be returning it
 I seriously hate these things. We bought two for our twin 6 year olds a year ago and while i love the concept of a cheap device with the warranty and free downloads, these are a POS!<br/><br/>First the batter sucks. Second the interface sucks. I have no ideas what is loaded on the device and what is not.<br/><br/>We just spent over 10 minutes trying to download one app on a really fast WiFi connection.<br/><br/>My advice is to get a used iPad and go with that.
 I bought this for my daughter for her 3rd birthday and she loves it! the only thing i dont like is that you cant download youtube kids on it, which kinda sucks since all those dumb suprise egg, and suprise toy videos are on there and my daughter loved them. Otherwise it is great. I would suggest getting it set up before you give it to you smaller child though. The apps come pre loaded but you still have to download them to the actual device and with the limited space without added storage it fills up kinda quick and my daughter just clicks everything. The best thing about this device is that i can download netflix on it and you can download certain shows and movies to watch without internet and data so my daughter can watch it in the car. Overall great product 4/5 stars.
 The kindle itself is good. The charger it comes with is not. The kids have only had their kindles a couple of days and we found one of them having issues with the LCD already. After some quick troubleshooting, I found out the connector on the USB charger was corroded. The bad connection made the kindle screen flicker and go crazy.
 The holiday dilemma...what to get the grand-kids?  The five year old needed a durable tablet that he couldn't get into destruction mode with....that would also have safe-guards.  The eight year old and her three year old brother...he wants everything she has....so perfect for all.  All three have the protection (physically and age appropriate) that is sure to please.  I couldn't be happier with the purchase!  #Nana Rocks
 My kids LOVE them! However I don't know what I was thinking to get them something like this because it killed their natural play (like playing w their cars, or puzzles, or even reading a book...)<br/>But I digress...<br/>I bought them thinking we'd be able to download a school program (IReady) -so they could get their weekly minutes in. For some reason (I'm not tech-y at. all.) the program won't download, so it defeated my whole purpose for getting them. That is where the 3 stars comes from. Otherwise I'd give the product a 5 star rating.
 Don't believe worry free guarantee!  My nephew's unit stopped holding a charge after 6 months.  Had to call Amazon 3 times and spend hours on the phone just to get a shipping label.  On my third hour-long call, they offered to email a label.  Also, was told that a technician would check it to see if it could be repaired!  What happened to "just return the tablet and we'll replace it for free?  In the meantime, my nephew is without his tablet going on 2 weeks and I have no idea how long it is going to take to get it or a new one back.
 I have waited so long to write this review.I bought this Amazon tablet for my daughter and even encouraged friends to buy the same but just 2 months into using it without any hardware issue ,we noticed the whole screen went blank and that was it till date.It just does not come on anymore.Once you power it on it gets stuck at the AMAZON logo and never goes past it.I tried to return it since it has a 2 year worry free warranty but unfortunately it was returned to me without any replacement and not even a repair saying its a wrong address.I have been so disappointed since then and that has given me a negative impression about these Amazon devices.We are stuck with this defective device for months now.
 very slow response on tablets, charging port stopped working contacted amazon for that no questions asked replacement and was asked if i used the charger that came with it? yeah. did you restart it? hmm kinda impossible to do since it won't even turn on. The new free time update is the most absolute evil! i have two toddlers who just go crazy clicking every thing they see the last dashboard was so simple and amazing. I am in the market for a different brand tablet now for both of my kids now.
 I like that this tablet is very kid friendly. I brought one for my sons. I notice I have to turn off airplane mode and bluetooth a lot. Not sure if its because of my kids or the tablet.  I have recently noticed that the tablet freezes a lot now. It doesn't have a lot of storage to download much due to all the content pre downloaded. I have had to buy this tablet a few times due to malfunctions. But it is by far the best tablet I have yet to get
 I bought a tablet for my 4 year old and another for my 3 year old. They started off great and the kids loved them, then after a few months my son's tablet would no longer hold a charge. I went out and bought different chargers thinking it was just a bad charger but nope that did not fix the issue. So I messaged Amazon since it was under warranty and they told me I had to have a live chat with someone regarding the issues we were having with the tablet. I did a live chat with someone and they wanted me to try different things with the tablet, at this point we could no longer turn the tablet on because it wouldn't charge at all,  it took a 40 minute chat with them to realize what I was saying before they agreed it needed to be replaced. They said they would send us a new tablet and that they would email me a return label so I can send the broken one back to them, so far no email has come to me so I guess we'll see if we really get a new tablet within the next week.
 Helps keep inquisitive kids at bay.  The parental controls are good. However, when one is traveling international, one has to be aware that the original settings are set based on the home / default times.  Thus, we ended up just limiting our kid's access manually.....which really then defeats the purpose of the parental controls.  A time zone feature would be helpful.<br/>The audio is loud enough in that the content is audible in a room where there is not a lot of activities going on.  Obviously, if there are lots of people around, the volume needs to be increased dramatically.<br/>The bumper cover is awesome....drops are dramatically non-events....for the rare occasions that our kid does drop it.<br/>An app for video chatting would also be great !
 I'm giving it 2 stars because this is the 2nd Fire 7 Kids Edition Tab I order. The first one it stopped charging. It would go in and out. I had to wiggle the USB for it to work. The 2nd one the same as the first one. My child liked the tablet, loved the apps. Fix the charging issue and the tablet would be great.
 I bought the tablet for my son who is 7.  I'm not able to benefit from all the features of freetime unlimited because certain features such as videos etc. dont work in The Bahamas, or outside of the US.  However, the tablet is nice, I'm having trouble with the storage space though, it keep telling me i have to archive.  But as a parent you get to control what your kids watch and play.  Its a great feature. Unfortunately for me being outside of  US, I'm not experiencing all features.
 Less then two years after buying this tablet for my daughter (the second one), it no longer charges and will not turn on.  Soon after buying it a brought two new charges, which no longer work to charge the tablet.  Due to the fact that this tablet has all the learning games and other things my child loves, I had no choice but to get it again.  My hope is that she get more that 16-18 months out of it this time.
 We love the kids amazon fire tablets. We have them for both kids, four and two years old. They come loaded with kgames and activities that are just for kids. They are much more functional are really more convenient than a regular tablet which would come without the kids app. This tablet came with a blue case to protect it. For the price and gaurentee I don’t think you can go wrong - Fast shipping too!
 My daughter had a tablet before this one and it ended up breaking on us (twice) so we decided to purchase the Fire Kids Edition tablet for her. She absolutely loves it, especially with the Freetime Unlimited app and all the games, videos and books that comes with it.  We love the fact that we can lock down access to the web and to individual apps that we don't want her to have access to - though it is a little tedious to go through 12K+ items and block each one out.  It is nice to have that level of granularity though.  Overall we are all very happy with this tablet and will probably buy another one for our 2nd daughter when she's old enough to have one.
 Purchased this for my 3 year old girl. She loves it! In the beginning it was a bit of a steep learning curve. After 2 months, she is a pro! She can turn it on and off herself, adjust the volume on her own and even switch between our families different profiles. This is an EXCELLENT educational tool. Rich with fun learning apps. It's bulletproof too. Very comfortable and lightweight. AND THE VALUE IS ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR!
 I purchased two of these tablets in July 2017 for my sons' birthdays. My sons (ages 6 and 4), absolutely love them! As do his father and I. They're very neat. However, one of them will no longer charge. It has only been 6 weeks! It did come with a 2 year, all around warranty, but I have looked everywhere and have clicked on every link that suggest a return or warranty and can not figure out how to contact someone about returning and replacing this. Any info would be greatly appreciated! Other than this, I would highly recommend this product for children!
 We own this and it takes NINE minutes from the time we push the "on" button to get to videos on the sd card playing. NINE MINUTES! Ridiculous, and I wouldn't recommend unless you have nine minutes to spare every time you need to go somewhere. That kind of time adds up.
 I really wanted to like this device but there are so many things about it that make it subpar:<br/><br/>Pros<br/>- cheap<br/>- durable<br/>- includes freetime<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- The user interface is a mess - its confusing for both adults and in the kids profile.<br/>- SLOW - using this device feels like the early stages of smartphones and tablets.  Everything lags resulting in accidental clicks, selecting incorrect options, etc.<br/>- kid focused device - but doesn't have the ability to disable the touch screen.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this device.  I'd rather get an older ipad with a kid-proof case.
 I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. At first he loved it. Then tonight, less than a month later, it will not turn on. There’s nothing wrong with the charger, we have two other fire 7 tablets and it charges them fine. It’s been on the charger for over two hours and will not turn on at all. It’s very disappointing. After reading some of the other reviews I’m skeptical about calling customer support.
 What I liked about the Fore 7 Kids edition is that it has a sturdy case protector which is ideal for toddlers and kids dropping things every minute. It has an accessible price and it comes with a lot of fun apps for the kiddos. What I don't like and why I would Not recommend this is because of the weak charge port that has...this is the second time the tablet that we have is having issues to charge. We try with a different usb, different adapter different outlet,everything and still doesn't charge at all unless you spend some minutes moving around the usb wire into the charging port...until it does contact and makes any sound...then when you think you got it! there goes again to fail to get charge.  Unfortunately I will have to send this one back too,before my warranty runs out! and I'm not thinking about having another one! Sorry! Amazon! this time I don't think you are that great!
 Great product. My child got one of these for his birthday last year. He loves it. They're sturdy for the price and work pretty good. Could use a "delete all" button for the apps though. He installs a lot of them while playing kid's mode. Uninstalling programs 1 by 1 is very annoying. -2 stars annoying.
 My three year-old daughter loves the Free Time apps and options. There’s a huge array of games for all ages, which is awesome. I love the parental controls and the ability to lock everything down so she can’t get into things she shouldn’t.<br/><br/>The issue is the battery. We’ve had the tablet for just over a year. I charged it to 100% and unplugged it last night. Within 12 hours (without any usage at all) it had dropped below 50%. When my daughter uses it while it’s plugged it, it drains power faster than it charges. We apparently had ordered our tablet before Amazon instituted their 2 year return policy on the kid’s tablets so we’re just stuck with an item that’s becoming a rather expensive paperweight. I’m incredibly disappointed, to say the least, and won’t be investing in another Fire tablet.
 This is everything we could've hoped for and more. We LOVE the parental settings and how much learning content we can provide our children access to.<br/>We've purchased tablets for our children before, but, weren't thrilled with how much unfavorable content they could still access, and even worse what they could pull up on YouTube.<br/>These are definitely worth what we paid and so much more. Not only are we happy with them but our children ages 6 through 11 absolutely love them.<br/>Great job on integrating Minecraft and some other popular games as well. It feels good to be in control over their learning while still allowing them some of the games they like. Love the "block all entertainment until learning goals are met" option. The system is also smart enough to recognize if your child just flipped through pages quickly to pretend they read it
 So far so good. We got our kids ages 3 and 5 these tablets for Christmas. They live then and I love the parental controls. The cases they came with are very durable and have taken a few hits as I'd expect from the kids but the tablets are well protected so no worries. We enrolled in the unlimeted free time and it has a more than I expected. The only thing I don't like is the slower download speed we encounter for some of the games and that there definelty needs to be more memory added because the system itself and all the pre downloads that can't be removed take up a bit of space but all in all I'd recomend this product if you're looking for a good tablet for your kids.
 My son and I love the tablet for multiple reasons.  He loves that he can download certain movies(Wild Kratts especially) and games that he can watch when commuting back and forth to school.  I love that I can set how long he plays on it,  and have it set up that he can only do certain things before playing.  Plus, given my son is only 4 I love how durable and easy to use it is.  The case that comes with is definitely a huge plus for little ones.
 I purchased this for my grandson and he absolutely loves it!!! He was always using his parents cell phones to look at videos and not really getting anything else out of it. I spoke to his parents before I purchased this and had them read through all the features and benefits. The goal was to take advantage of the fact that we can set goals for him so that he can watch videos but he also spends time on educational activities. This tablet delivers everything that it promised in a great way. This item arrived very quickly, I would order it again and I highly recommend it.
 I love this kindle for my grandson. Although I cannot yet tell where to access Netflix...LOL!! Everything about it to set it up for his age range 12, and the fact I can access his kindle from mine is a great plus. I can monitor his use, as well, as how long he is on it...nice. His is better than mine, which is about 5 or 6 years old. He can flip his camera, but I can't O, well. Another great product from Amazon!
 I've spent the last two days getting to play with two of these while I get them set up for my nieces. Quality packaging, simple to follow registration and a pretty good age based selection of apps, books and videos. The parental control options are also phenomenal. Can't wait for the girls to unwrap them on Christmas.
 I'll just give you the good news first. It is durable. The apps are good so far. I like that it has a parent profile so that you can use it to. Bad news. It's like the kids version is stuck in the app store so anything they click downloads to the device. So day 1 and it's saying device storage full. I want it to have a normal home screen with the downloaded apps only. Also if I go to settings in the parents profile under running apps. It says under kids 124mb when everything else is under 20mb.
 I bought this as a gift for my 9 year niece for Christmas. So far we love it. I own a kindle myself and appreciated that It came preloaded with age appropriate available apps and search engine plus I could add or delete anything I wanted.  The case is rugged yet not too bulky for her small hands. Great job Amazon
 Just hope it doesn't break...  Been online with tech support for about 30 minutes and they keep telling me that it is going to sleep.  No, it is defective!  I have been in IT for 20 years and things don't "go to sleep" while you are playing a game.  Tech support is clueless.  Do yourself a favor and save your money.
 We bought this for our 4 year old daughter for Christmas and are thrilled with this tablet! It couldn’t be simpler to use. The tabs are easy for her to navigate. All of the apps are there ready to be loaded with one click and once they are she can play them offline. It also has a video link with lots of popular kids shows for her to chose from. I’ve owned inexpensive tablets before that were such a pain to try and set up and let her use and then the loading time would drive us crazy and ultimately she’d get bored after a short while of trying to use it and ask to play games on my phone instead. She loves her Fire so much that thought has never crossed her mind since she’s had it. The size is also great and the fact that it comes in the rubber case (those can cost a pretty penny on their own) makes this tablet an excellent value. The only downside to the tablet, as I read in other reviews, is that it is a little on the slow side to charge. But once it’s charged she gets plenty of play time on it. Overall, we are very satisfied with this purchase. It does have a regular mode that can be signed into with all of the features a tablet for us adults have, but I haven’t had a chance to pry it out of her little hands to try that out. Overall, we are very satisfied with this product.
 The little guy took to the tablet immediately and was soon absorbed for three hours in educational game programs. My daughter-in-law noted how great it was to have her Kindle back because my grandson now has his own with programming just right for him. The tablet is intuitive, durable and bounce-able although I wouldn't push that feature with him. The screen is bright and colors are attractive. This is a class product.
 I think it's a pretty decent tablet for the price. Have had the tablet for about a year now. Haven't had many issues up until today. The tablet's battery had died and my daughter was plugging it in. Shortly after my daughter heard a pop and came running to my wife who noticed smoke coming from the tablet and quickly unplugged it. The Cord was melted and the port on the tablet had melted as well. I called Amazon Costumer service due to the device still being under warranty and well it should probably be reported for safety reasons. The lady I talked to you was very nice and apologized and informed me she would have to submit the issue through their safety department which makes sense and told me they would be reaching out to me soon about this issue. Answered some questions for her and that's it so far. We'll see if I get a replacement with the 2 year warranty. I have had several of these tablets and never had issues, so I think this is a rare issue, but something people should probably be aware of.
 We purchased this and paid the extra money for the warranty. The device stopped working/charging (no fault of ours) less than a month after first use. It was very disappointing because a lot of data was lost but I was even more disappointed when Amazon replaced our basically new device with a REFURBISHED one.<br/>The device itself was very very slow and not responsive before it stopped working. I would not purchase again even for my kid because it frustrated her when she couldn't open apps or they took forever to open.<br/>But i would've let her deal with it had the warranty been better than it is.
 I did not like how difficult the kindle fire kids was to use and set up. I own one of the earlier kindle fire tablets, from about 2011, and I thought for sure they had come a long way since but they have not. The user interface is terrible. (Unless you plan to pay for the subscription, your have to go under users and create a child's profile) Even If you do get it set up it has very VERY limited access to apps that my children were used to playing on my phone. Most of the apps available for purchase were not the typical 1.99 or so but 6.99 apps! I know people that like these tablets but I really hated it. I never do returns when it's an online purchase but I had to this time, just was not worth it. Got A Samsung kids tablet and love it!
 My daughter loved her tablet but unfortunately less than a year of having it the tablet will no longer charge. For a couple months I was able to get it to charge if I wrapped the cable around the tablet with a little tension on it. Of course this was after trying a different charger which was the same issue. I can’t get it to charge at all anymore. We got it as a Christmas gift but she didn’t actually start using it until about March when she was 2 years old. I liked the idea of taking it in car rides since we are often in my car for long lengths of time and it had lots of learning apps on it. So, in reality she only got less then six months or use out of it.<br/><br/>Update:<br/>Contacted by Marcy with great news that I wasn’t aware of. There is a 2 year warranty for this tablet. So, although I had issues with the original tablet I’m glad to know that at no cost to me my daughter will be receiving a replacement tablet. Thank you Marcy and Amazon for contacting me so quickly.
 It is slow. The case is foam material. We have a 6.5" Samsung that is functionally better. With my tablet that gets mobile data from my carrier, this is a huge downgrade. Loading into kids mode takes so long it times out the display and goes to sleep mode. So as a tablet it is trash. It gets 2 stars for the attempt. The positive is it's an Amazon product. I'm hoping that Amazon services make it worthwhile in the long term. I've liked how the platform has grown and trust the content they have curated for our young ones. If I had to choose fast youtube tablet vs this archaic amazon exclusive? I'd choose this one because of the promised content. The dang thing is too slow to actually use though.
 OS on the kindle is horrible. I guess it is good in a pinch but make sure your apps are downloaded properly before you take it off line. I bought for my two year old for a 6 hour plane ride to watch movies and play games. Of course the downloaded apps didn’t work causing a major melt down on the plane. Should have just gone with an iPad mini instead.
 I bought this for a 3 year old, and he really enjoys it. Out of the box it worked great, but pretty quickly the audio stopped working. Right now that's ok since he's only 3 and doesn't even notice, but I will be taking advantage of that 'no questions asked warranty' eventually.<br/><br/>The account management though is terrible and even frustrating to sort out. But for the price and the warranty, I don't really care that account management is a sloppy mess.
 Had this for about just over a year. Worked fine in the beginning, then when memory started getting used up, the tablet starts locking up and going haywire. Have to keep deleting apps for it to function. Then the charging port started acting up. Started out it would connect and disconnect from charging. Now it wont charge at all. Tried several different charging cables....nothing. Now it's just a paperweight.
 My son is on the spectrum and had a leapfrog epic for the last 3 years we cherished. It helped us teach him to read although he is nonverbal. So when the leap pad stopped powering on, I daughter out a new tablet. I was hesitant to change as kids on the spectrum are suckers for routine and familiar items but was impressed at the price point and amount of apps/ videos he could watch. I purchased this and was thrilled to see his excitement at its unboxing. However the screen had what appeared to be a slight crack- if you know spectrum kids once they see something they are playing it no matter what. I allowed him to play some of the apps while I initiated the return process. He plopped down on out carpeted floor and the screen cracked even more! So much so that I had to take it away for fear glass pieces would get stuck in his finger as he swiped. He was most angry. Maybe consider a better shipping method?
 While being used, it’s okay for what it is. The kids love them. Still trying to figure out the parental controls. My main issue is that when you turn off the tablet, the battery continues to drain. Hopefully that’s a setting I can figure out eventually. The tablet isn’t as user friendly as I was expecting...but I’m an apple user, so maybe that’s why. Will update my review if the problem is user error.
 If I could I would give this NEGATIVE stars!!!! Such a waste of money!! We originally bought one of these 7’s for our son and paid $100 for it. Within the first month it became a huge hassle to use and now is a complete paper weight. I’ve tried repeatedly to charge it and when it’s finally able to get enough charge to try to use it the thing won’t actually work! It unlocks but then NONE of the apps or downloaded items will open anymore. The screen will just freeze and then go black and lock. This is so frustrating. I’ve spent multiple occasions trying to deal with getting it replaced as it says is “guaranteed” but it’s IMPOSSIBLE to speak to a real person about the issue or get the information to send it back to be replaced. We are very frequent and committed prime members for years now and this situation ALONE has made us STRONGLY consider ending our membership! We have never had such a horrible or difficult experience from an order like this.
 My son hated this tablet and I hated this tablet.it was slow, app store sucks,battery was crap, couldn't even put downloaded vids onto the kids mode unless they were obtained from the amazon market. I returned it after a week .
 Love the pic of protective case and haven't seen anything go wrong with the tablet physically however I was highly disappointed that after waiting for this to be in stock Almost immediately we started having issues with charging. I did purchase two of them one in pink and one in blue. The blue one which is the one I'm reviewing is the one that I had the issue with? The pink one works perfectly. The blue one at this point no longer holds a charge and cannot be used unfortunately I'll have to send it in.
 Really awesome tablet for my 5 year olds, and worth the money. Easy to figure out (for the most part), tons of apps, books and videos. My only complaint is that you cannot separate downloaded apps from the thousands of apps available to download on freetime. There is a carousel on the home page, but only shows the recently used apps. My children would have to scroll through the thousands of apps to find the ones that are downloaded with a check mark in the corner. I didn't want them to be able to download everything they see, which is easy to do with just a tap. The only solution I found was to block every app except those that are downloaded. You would think there would be an option separate them, given that this is made for a child, but I guess not
 We bought 2<br/>They didn't work, kept getting stuck on a restart, delete cashe screen. Called for help once fixed kept doing the same thing after being started up and the fix would no longer work. Sent back for two new ones... had the same exact problem with one of the new ones. Tech support couldn't fix the problem. Returned all four.
 The FreeTime Unlimited did not actually come with the tablets.  I had to spend over an hour on the computer chatting with Help to try and resolve it.  I was told there was some sort of glitch and it needed to be escalated to another department and that I would hear back in 1-2 days.  I signed up for the FreeTime, being told that they would refund me after they got the issue resolved.  A week went by without hearing anything, so I called back and had to spend another 30 minutes on the phone and was told yet again that they would contact me in 3 business days.  Also, the FreeTime app will stop responding during use, sometimes as often as every 30 minutes, requiring me to restart them.  One good thing - the customer service rep I talked to did credit $10 to my account; however, I would've preferred the issues just be resolved.
 If you are a "strict" parent with your child's education and free time, know that this is very difficult (time consuming) to block content. Tons of content is on the tablet. You must "weed" out unwanted items either by typing key words, titles, authors, series names, etc. takes days. To do "by hand", you see one tiny icon and often cannot read the title, let alone the author. Exhausting.  BUT, if you are good with the "norm" and you do not care if someone else decides what is appropriate for your child, this has an AWESOME amount of content. Tons of stuff to read, play, watch and do. Must be Wi-Fi connected to utilize device. Also, has Alexa which I hate. Check in app buying setting every time you turn it on!
 First I'll say the tablets are great, user-friendly, with lots of available apps and even an adult can use it. I bought 2 of these for my 7 year old and both did not last for even 1 year. I bought the 2nd one at Best Buy and the tech guy told me to be sure to buy a warranty because the Fire tablets are known for having charging issues with the port. With the tablets I bought, in both cases, the charging port failed to work properly I'd say within 7-9 months. Lesson learned---I will not be purchasing anymore of the Fire tablets.
 Fast shipping. This was the replacement I had for a damaged one that under warranty. My 3 year old daughter dropped her original one in a puddle and it would not turn on. This is the second one they had to replace because my child dropped her first one and cracked the screen. They sent us a whole new one with all of the accessories this time. I love the Kid's apps and I signed up for a yearly membership. It's so worth it. I can monitor the content and time she is on her Kindle. We also have an iPad and I prefer for her to use the Kindle. She also loves her Kindle. Well worth the investment for the Kindle, warranty, free year of Kid's time, and case. I would highly recommend a Kindle fire for kids.<br/><br/>There isn't anything I don't like about the Kindle Fire.
 We bought my oldest son one of these a few years ago and he loves it, plays with it often and has learned a lot from the apps. My younger son has started playing with his older brothers and asked for one for himself. He’ll be getting his very own this Christmas! It works great, easy for kids to use and when my oldest son broke his, it was quickly replaced with no questions asked!
 I bought this for my little one back in October for Christmas.  Little did I know that they were going to be changing the interface.  Now you no longer have the carousel and always have to click on "see more" to get what you're looking for.  While this is good for older kids, for a little one just trying to find her movie, it's ridiculous.  I'm debating sending it back, but for the price I paid it's just not worth it.
 The tablet is SLOW and freezes up a lot. I am unable to manage content under the parental controls because the tablet freezes up every single time I make a selection to block or uninstall content. I am constantly having to turn off the tablet and turn it back on. This is the first tablet I have purchased for my children. I wish that I would have chosen a different brand.
 Super slow processor. My child had a hard time navigating and using this and would loose patience with the slow processing speed. Had to return it. My daughter accidentally dropped it on my foot and it fractured my toe and it’s still bruised four weeks later.
 Can’t say enough about how great this product is. My daughter is learning so much from the apps and services included. Can’t beli I was late to the party on this purchase, but glad I made the decision to buy it. The amount of apps and services and are included are priceless. This is a great buy and also a great investment for your child’s education. It has helped her with reading and encourages her creative and musical gifts as well.
 I'm originally from Ohio but was in Niagara falls for Thanksgiving. On Black Friday I went in to a best buy to exchange his current one. I had just the tablet and receipts. In Ohio they return the purchase of tablet and insurance and they switch it out and put new insurance on the internet exchanged, in New York they do not. I didn't make a big deal about it I told her I would just to Ohio and purchase it. The associate proceeded to tell me I had to give her the charger and the new bumper and only take the tablet and the box. I gave her the charger and just walked out of the store.. not even a month and a half later the charging portal to the new tablet stopped working....what are my options??
 Love the case, warranty and year long subscription for apps and games. I did, however, have trouble with downloading apps I wanted for my son to this. I had to DL it to my fire tablet and then share it with him, and then open/ redownload on his tablet.... a lot of work for something simple. Also, i wish there was a way to hide the "home" button as my son hits it when playing, thus exiting the games.
 I bought this item for my 7 year old son and he loves it. It came very fast in the mail and was packaged very nicely. It is a very fast tablet with the capacity to let my son watch endless u tube videos. The rubber around the ends is such an amazing idea ...in case he drops it!!! I would recommend this tablet to anyone. And it would make such an aweome gift, plus the price for the quality of this product is a no brainer!
 I purchased two of these in July- I didn’t fully appreciate them until I recently moved into a house with very steep steps that my little ones (2 &amp; 3) have trouble getting down. Throwing these tablets down the stairs is now a daily occurrence, it’s great to know my kids can just throw it down and use two hands to get down the steps safely. I actually stepped on one yesterday. Durability is amazing.<br/><br/>As for function, we only use FreeTime, the app is wonderful- parental controls for age appropriate videos and games plus controls for how long they can use it at a time. The tablets are full, storage is definitely a problem for us and I’d recommend upgrading the storage for more games if that’s what they’ll be used for. The only other thing is that one of them is easily disconnected from the charger, likely from a 3 year old tearing the cord out. I’m very satisfied.
 So far, not thrilled. Difficult to find instructions regarding downloading content for use when NOT connected to wifi. Thought I had downloaded several games for an upcoming flight, only to be prompted to connect to wifi every time the apps were launched. Led to a very frustrated little boy. I've googled and read everything I can find online and it's helped a little but I'm still not feeling like I have it set up correctly for my little boy.
 When trying to hunt for the perfect Easter gifts for our kids my hubby suggested tablets. Upon lots and lots of research these tablets were consistently considered the best! Eventually I decided to bite the bullet and believe the reviews and purchase them.<br/>They arrived promptly and were thankfully already charged! They were easy to set up and have a user friendly look! I love the fact there are so many possibilities for games and my boys can even watch episodes of their favorite shows.<br/>A downfall is that when powering on, the tablet defaults to the parent profile. My youngest (2) was able to somehow purchase a movie on my account, as I wasn’t aware that it happens. Thankful amazon was great and took care of the problem. Now I am aware and the problem has been fixed.<br/>All in all these are GREAT kid friendly tablets that have endured their share of drops and are still hanging on strong!
 meh It's okay... but I had several issues with the screen freezing. I had to replace it once. Although it doesn't completely freeze it reboots on it's own , it's pretty annoying.  Also the childrens profile is super slow so slow that it annoys my 3 year old... The parent profile is ok but I honestly hate this android tablet, the interface is horrible and you can't make this your own. The web browser is trash.
 Got two of these for my daughters for Christmas last year.  First one stopped charging after 4 months.  The other one belonging to my older daughter did the same thing after 6 months.  Contacting customer service initially was no help (through chat), but after writing a negative review, Amazon reached out and was able to help walk us through troubleshooting to fix the problems with both tablets.  We'll see how the hold up now!
 It's a nice durable tablet and the parental settings are out of this world but idk if I did something wrong setting this thing up but even though its rather cheap I'm paying a monthly subscription every month. I had to have WiFi to set it up then they wanted so this information and then my credit card information and I had no way of bypassing the screen where I had to agree to pay a monthly subscription to even access the main screen before set up.
 Great little tablet for kids, but don't expect it to perform as a more higher end tablet. The device tends to be a little sluggish, but luckily the only thing my daughter really uses it for is watching videos and playing her Strawberry Shortcake baking game.<br/><br/>My only real gripe with this tablet is that the FreeTime unlimited is pretty much unusable in Canada and Google apps (YouTube kids, etc) is not available in the Kindle App store. Not that big of a deal if you're willing to do a few workarounds and lock down the "main" interface and forgo the FreeTime one.<br/><br/>In other words, if you want an affordable tablet for your kids you should definitely look into the Fire 7 Kids Edition. The price and worry free guarantee really outweighs the cons in my opinion.
 Ohhhh boy, let me just say, we started off with an iPad. A beloved iPad that lasted almost 2 years till dad sat on it with keys in his back pocket. Sad day for my then 3 year old. I tried the munchkizs tablet which is not only over priced but insanely small. It also didn’t work half the time, froze up constantly.  This fire tablet is literally the best thing next to mint  chocolate chip ice cream! It comes loaded with TONS (I mean TONS) of apps, books, etc. It lets you set controls, you want your 5 year old to read 2 books before play time on games? DONE! It’s amazing!!! If you’re wondering if this is worth it, it IS! Plus a 2 year no questions asked warranty?! Umm yes please!
 I just got this and the battery does not last a very long time even if my child is not using it all day. I don't shut it down though because it takes a while to load! I've had other tablets where even if you don't turn it off, the battery will still last you at least 5 days. Also, this tablet freezes a lot and sometimes it takes a while to load. I don't think it's our wifi because our other tablets doesn't take that long to load...
 Returned the first one for replacement after screen was cracked.  The replacement one worked about a week and then wouldn't charge.  Grandson tried multiple chargers.  Interestingly, I purchased 3 of these Fire tablets and my grandson's was the only one that turned out to be a dud.  Supposed to be kidproof....but just made the gift seem like a flub.
 I purchased the bundle so my son and daughter wouldn’t have to share my tablet anymore. I was so excited when it appeared freetime came pre loaded with several apps and games only to be sorely disappointed when I discovered clicking those games in the freetime app pushed a download that NEVER downloaded. I am now having to go into the adult version of the tablet and search for apps I’d like to download for them to have, which will only get lost in a sea of apps they can’t have when I go back into freetime. Imagine being a kid and seeing all these bells and whistles (apps) that you won’t get to play and trying to find the apps you can actually play that are mixed in with those. Freetime is completely flawed and whom ever designed it CLEARLY doesn’t have kids! I’m more than half tempted to just do away with freetime and give them the adult version of the fire.
 Although not used daily, it started slowing down significantly after about 6 months. It's much slower to reboot, to load any application, or even navigate existing items already downloaded as compared to the other fire tablet we got in the bundle (which is an identical Fire 7 Kids Edition). Then, it started not charging at all last week.<br/><br/>Trying to contact Amazon for replacement is *not* easy. It seems all reviews that complain about Amazon not honoring the no questions replacement policy are true. You can't chat about this issue online because it's now an old order. They suggest to call the customer service and when you call the customer service, they suggest to chat. I don't know yet how to break the infinite loop!
 I rely on customer feedback before I purchase items, so I certainly wanted to share my feedback too for all those considering buying this.  Love this tablet, I purchased 3.  Very kid friendly.  You can even add apps for them if you would like (ie: Netflix).  I have replaced it once already about 6 months after getting it.  I simply chatted in (better than calling I think), and within 5-10 minutes, they sent me a label via email.  The only part that required effort on my part was printing the label, boxing the damaged tablet, and shipping it off.  I read other reviews about how much of a hassle it was, but for me, it was not.  I am now having to replace another of the 3 tablets for a different issue (yes they are durable, but kids are destructive LOL), and I had a great experience yet again.  Chat took maybe 3 minutes and label came straight to me in my email.  Once Amazon gets the damaged item, they ship you out a new or refurbished tablet (depends on how long you've had it) via 2 day shipping.
 Love these! We got one for each of our kids(ages 4, 7, 9) and they are amazing. The content is great...huge selection of popular books, videos and games...even audible books which is a nice bonus. It is also super easy to set up and use. I was worried that the parental controls would be difficult, but they are so easy. I can do most of it from my phone. Would definitely recommend.
 My kid loves it, but it is just ok.  First off you MUST buy an additional card to do ANYTHING.  It ships with barely enough to run the operating system so you have to buy a Micro SD card if you want to download content to play.  Otherwise it is pretty reliable. Battery life seems to be ok, but i'm not the one using it.
 Got these for 3 year old twins.  They are great!  The kids use them like they know exactly what they are doing!  It didn't take them but one day to pick up on how to download their videos, games, and even get back to the home screen.  The parental controls are amazing as well!  So useful!  You can even download apps from the app store on parents profile then give access to those apps in the kids profile.  10 out of 10 would recommend for small kids getting ready for school!  Such a great learning tool!
 I feel misled. This is not a child specific tablet. It is a regular tablet with a child specific app called feet time. With this tablet, anybody who has the password to unlock the screen, a sitter who may need to unlock it after charging a dead tablet for example, can edit any of your Amazon settings if they want to. The Amazon password is not needed for any purchases or for any changes made to your account through the Amazon applications on this device. My child is not able to take advantage of my prime account because I have to create a completely separate child account with none of my information on it so that the sitter and other people do not tamper with my personal settings.
 The tablet itself is great. It works well and has a lot of great features. The battery life doesn't last as long as I would have hoped for longer travels but it charges quickly. HOWEVER replacing a broken item was horrible. My 5 year old dropped hers shattering the screen and I was under the impression that it would be simple to replace with that being the main selling point of this device. There was nothing online I could find on replacing it so I called amazon support. No one would help me.. I was transferred 4 times before anyone could even tell me if they would help me. Then I was told once that since I bought the item on sale it was depreciated and I couldn't be helped.. finally I was connected to someone who could send me a replacement as long as I let them hold my credit card info as collateral until the broken device was returned. My review is buy the device for the actual kindle, not the warranty that they promote so highly.
 Bought the kindle fire for my son Christmas 2018, 1 year later the charging port quit working and will not allow a charge to take place. The tablet continues to run out of storage space and sometimes would just shut down unexpectedly.<br/><br/>I attempted to call about a replacement but was transferred several times with no resolution.<br/><br/>I will NOT purchase another one. I’d rather spend more and get an IPad.
 First the tablet see nice and everything.... got the deal 2 for  $149.99  version 7..... all features are great but don't worth anything if your not in the state's whether your a prime member or not.... it sucks bcuz i wanted those app's for my twin boy's but guess not..... why allowed online shoppers be able to be a prime member but can't  have the privilege of prime offers.... it's  not  fear it's  really not nice all the app wont work where i am living.... sad..... Amazon need to let international shoppers get those  advantages as well... but honestly the tablet is really great....
 I bought this almost 2 years ago for my grandson with a 2 year no fault warranty. No matter what happened to it, Amazon would replace it. As we approached the 2 year mark, he accidentally broke the screen. I called Amazon, they sent me a shipping label to return it and a few days later he received a new tablet with a new silicone case. I love it, he loves it and we are happy! He spends all day watching train videos so it was a blessing that it came so fast.
 My grandson loves his Kindle, but it won't charge.  Having the same problem as many others, the USB port and the cord do not charge the tablet - this started happening 5 months after using the tablet.  I am now on hold with customer service trying to find out about the warranty.  I have been on the phone for 30 mins and 3 different people have asked me the same information - name, address, S/N.  The technical team wants to troubleshoot the charging problem over the phone - does that make sense to you? I want to know if I can get a replacement.  Do I have another charger for the Kindle?  No, I was only sent one.  This is soooo frustrating!
 Exceeds expectations.  Would buy again. Great for 5 year old to pass the time.  Can do activities at home on wi-fi and also can load things in advance to keep her busy on road trips away from wi-fi. If you are shopping for a kids tablet for road trips away from wi-fi do your research first they vary widely on what you can do when off the grid. This works great I would buy it again.
 We bought this for my daughter who is 5 years old.  She loves it.  It has tons of storage for games.  It is easy to use.  Not buggy.  We bought this after "grandma" had stepped on a different brand inexpensive tablet in the same price range.  This tablet is far superior.  Our 5 year old daughter uses it with ease, my wife has an easy time programming it the way she wants our daughter to use it as well.
 Wonderful tablet thus far. The free year of Freetime was an excellent bonus. For what we paid, this was a great deal. My kid gets a lot of entertainment out of it, and you can download all kinds of educational games for it. My kid's OT even recommended one in particular for speech therapy. I like incorporating technology into her educational experiences as it's pretty much inescapable these days. Anyway, the case is SUPER sturdy; my toddler has not been able to give it so much as a nick yet.
 I don't write too many reviews and it actually hurts me to write this one as we have many Amazon devices that we use daily but this is a waste of money. I understand it's a cheap tablet but it hardly function if it functions at all. I. The kids mode (the entire reason we bought it) most apps won't even load after freezing on the opening screen. If we are out of WiFi range the home screen will just go blank even though many apps have been preloaded. I can't give this to my son without him having a tantrum 5 mins later because nothing will work correctly. I hope the higher priced kids tablets work better than this but this was such a let down that I dont think it will be worth a shot.
 I was a little hesitant to purchase this tablet after reading some of the reviews. However, this tablet is everything we had been looking for. We wanted a tablet that was 100% kid friendly. Our son is 3 and has never used a tablet before. I like that there is his own personal screen with only kid shows/games he can use. He isn’t able to get on anything he isn’t supposed to. It also has tons of shows that he already watched regularly, such as: bubble guppies, super truck, blippi, and train shows. Plus we were able to purchase a case in his favorite color yellow. I am so glad we purchased this tablet instead of getting just a basic tablet with parental controls. I will be recommending this to my friends and family.
 This is my second Fire Tablet purchase.  These tablets are extremely durable.  My 3 year old is autistic and has meltdowns when his tablet needs to be charged so I purchased a second tablet for him that way one can be charging while he's on the other.  The rubber edge does a great job protecting the tablet from regular drops on a ceramic floor.  My child has easily learned how to work his tablet and select the apps he likes.
 I got this for my 3 year old daughter for text to speech type of app books and it has been perfect. She has a limited time that it lets her play on it, and these were timeframes that I set for her to be allowed its use. She has already dropped it twice and its been great. The cover is super sturdy and durable and seems to really absorb impact great. I would absolutely buy this again.
 The user interface is not very kid friendly. The processor speed is inadequate. I bought this for my 3 year old. He has already grown out of the children’s games on the device. He navigates my iPad with ease but he gets frustrated with this device. I cannot turn off the device passcode and still keep a child’s profile. I cannot just hand him the device, I am forced to log in and then switch profiles. I don’t appreciate the OS forcing this on me.
 I love that it came with the kid proof case because my son is still too small to know better and he's quite rough with it.  Also,  if he does end up breaking it I love the fact that it came with a 2 year warranty.  It took some messing around to figure out how you download videos so he can watch them without the wifi (prob should've read the instruction book), and there isn't the greatest collection of videos that can be downloaded.  But at least my son can watch Paw Patrol when we pick up the wifi.  Awesome tablet,  highly recommend.
 You really can't beat the price but I think you get what you pay for. The case seems very durable and the layout is nice for young kids. We've only had the kindle for maybe two weeks and I noticed when we turn it on, there are times that the content (ex. downloaded tv shows) will be repeatedly flashing on and off the screen so you aren't able to click on it. It can be really irritating for your child who sees it but then once they're about to click on something, it disappears.
 These tablets have serious charging port issues. The charging ports break fairly easily. The "no questions asked and 2 year worry free warranty" is a joke. They refuse to replace the defective devices and give customers a very hard time doing so. "Keerthana" customer service rep is lacking quality, effective customer service skills and completely disregarded the warranty customers are promised.
 The kid kindle has parental controls but it must had been designed without any parental input. Basically kids have access to freetime content for kids but the content is full of junk. A better design would grand parents access to preselect content for their kids. I don’t want my kids to have access to unlimited content because there is a lot of junk there. But there is also some good content that I would like the kids to have access to. An amazing potential for a enriching learning tool, but with this design it’s just unlimited access to plenty of junk.
 I purchased this for myself, because I really like the blue foam case it comes with. You can't beat the no-questions asked 2-year warranty either! As a long-time Apple iPad and iPhone user, I found this Android-based tablet's UI a little different at first, but now I'm enjoying it! Great for web surfing, checking email. It's not a speed deamon, but for surfing, it does the trick. Has the Silk browser re-installed. No issues with this. A perfect item for your kids, or yourself! Recommended.
 Got this for my kid but you can't even download YouTube kids or other kids apps...<br/><br/>Amazon free time sucks and my babe is uninterested<br/>Had this about a year and I like it less and less<br/>Takes forever to charge<br/>Doesn't hold a charge long<br/>Can't watch things offline like YouTube as it's not the traditional app it's some knock off<br/><br/>Like the case
 I should’ve heeded the negative comments I read before committing to purchasing this tablet. I bought it for my son for Christmas and after a couple of light uses it broke. The screen was having imaging and brightness issues that made it not usuable. My son didn’t even physically handle the tablet himself. On the few occasions it was used I had it propped up for tv viewing. I am extremely disappointed. Why does Amazon put out such useless crap like this? It’s inexcusable. Where is the quality control? Save yourself the frustration and buy an older gen refurbished iPad.
 battery life is aweful, navigation is difficult, everything is just too slow and apps keep crashing! never again
 I purchased 2 of these tablets for my kids. (Pink &amp; yellow) they opened them at Christmas &amp; at first they were great. After my kids played for a couple of weeks, the internal storage was full. So you’ll HAVE to purchase a sd card along with this. Now, 3 months after opening my daughters tablet won’t turn on. It’s not charging. My sons won’t stay on WiFi &amp; has troubles charging. Since I ordered them in July when they were on sale, I can’t return them. Very disappointed. However, they’re super durable.
 My 9 year old brother loves it!! I had a small issue at first with the tablet somehow looping back to the activating page but customer service was great at helping, very patient with me. I love the idea of being able to add extra apps and purchased movies onto his channel, i was able to sell up a time slot for my brother to control how long he is on his tablet. Another thing i loved was setting a goal after the tablet is unlocked from the time slot, all apps were still locked untill my brother completed 30mins of reading on his tablet. He loves the apps!!<br/><br/>2 things i wished was available are:<br/>  1) allow the ability to add music<br/>  2) ability to had mutiple time locks<br/><br/>Other then that both my brother and I love the device
 This is the second Fire Tablet I have purchased for my Grandson. Both time I purchased the extended warranty. The first tablet started to have charging issues and we messed with it for months to get it to charge. By the time I checked the warranty it had expired. I figured it was my fault and I purchased another one and again got the warranty. Guess what charging issues again at under 1 1/2 years, the same as the first one. This time we did not wait around and called about the warranty I purchased through amazon at the same time I purchased the Tablet. After trouble shooting we were told that it was charging. Yes it does charge if you mess around with the cord and then check it every hour to make sure that it is still charging. They stated that nothing would be done until it no longer worked at all. This is unacceptable and I will never purchase another Fire Tablet if this is not taken care of. I do not recommend this product.
 If this thing worked all the time I would give it 5 stars but it seems to have a mind of its own. I have 2 of these for my kids and they both have the same problem (both tablets are the 7 series).<br/>Pros: warranty is great. I replaced one already and actually got the newer model, at the time anyway. Kids interface is pretty easy to use, Freetime apps are great, pretty durable for how my kids treat them.<br/>Cons: Extremely slow to download everything. It’ll sit there thinking for up to 4 minutes before the download even begins, erases downloaded items randomly, becomes completely unresponsive, frustrating UI when not in Kids mode.<br/>I would not recommend the 7 series, looks like the 8 has the same processor, perhaps the 10 works better.
 I absolutely love this product it allows your kid to have free play without you worrying about the content that is exposed to the tablet has an adult profile also has a kid profile and allows you to have so much control over your child's play time you can set an off timer shut off timer shut off on time absolutely love the tablet to death the cover is very good for the tablet protect tablet a lot and plus the 2-year warranty is a major plua
 I was cautious about buying this due to the negative reviews on the charging port but so far, I've had no issues.  It is extremely light in comparison to my ancient original Kindle and my daughter loves it.  It also came with a year of Amazon Free Time.  I only wish that the base model had more storage... I have to delete games and such every few days to have enough room.
 I only bought this for my daughter about 14 months ago and it just stopped charging last week. I went to see if it's still under warranty but nope. So that really discourages me from buying more Amazon electronics. Because this isn't the first time I've had an issue with charging their devices. It's a bummer because my kids really like them. They clearly need to figure out the charging issue.
 This review is technically for the Kindle I purchased 3 years ago, which I bought a replacement for after losing it. The new Kindle is great, but I had to share this story that testifies to what a quality product this is:<br/><br/>On February 3rd, after attending a basketball game at a local high school, my son's Kindle was lost. When we realized it was missing a couple hours later, we assumed it'd been left in the bleachers. This was a Saturday; had to wait till Monday to see if it'd been found and turned in. Meanwhile, I did the "locate my device" and remote alarm repeatedly, but the Kindle battery was seemingly dead as neither worked.<br/><br/>When it didn't turn up by Monday but also didn't show as being turned on or having any failed log-on attempts, my husband said, "What about when you fell?" We live in Wisconsin, and the night of the game it had been snowing and was icy out, and as I chased after my husband and kids to the far parking lot, I went to descend a snowbank and fell on my back hard. I had been carrying my son's little backpack, and the Kindle very well could have fallen out. Right away I KNEW that was indeed what happened, and my daughter and I immediately went to look in the snowbank, but the plow had since been through and cleaned all the parking lots, adding a whole new layer to the snowbank I had fallen in and burying the path I'd used.<br/><br/>Husband and I went back a week later when there was some warm weather, thinking it might be visible now, but no such luck. My intuition told me it was there, though. In the next week or so, the weather alternated from sleet to snow to rain, freezing one day, warm the next. Today, after 2 days of rain that melted a LOT of the snow around here, (and no school since early release yesterday due to the icy roads, meaning no one to spot it if it was visible now), I asked my hubby to cruise by there after work and check once more.<br/><br/>Lo and behold, there it was!! 2.5 weeks buried in snow, rained on, frozen and thawed repeatedly--and it STILL WORKS!! Kudos to Amazon for one hardy device and a killer protective case (it was the old Kid's Kindle case that came with the Kindle, the rubbery-puffy one). VERY impressive!!
 The moment we took this out of the box it ran extremely slow. I was hoping it would speed up... It has been almost a month and we are shipping it back. It takes ten minutes to load a game, if it loads at all.<br/><br/>While my 6 year old son was playing sonic, in the middle of the game an ad poppped up... ADVERTISING RIBBED CONDOMS WITH A WOMANS MOANING VOICE.<br/><br/>Will never recommend this.
 Yes, I'm one of those parents. I bought my 2-year-old a tablet. He does NOT watch it all day. I really bought it because we like to stream music in his room at night and for the occasional learning activity. My wife's tablet had been abused too much.<br/><br/>Pro - This tablet is tough. It can stand up to falls and spills.<br/>Con - The biggest drawback in the worst battery life. For overnight use we use it plugged in. For road trips you will need to use the car charger.
 Has been about 4 months and have had no issues. My 3 (going on 4) year old loves it and is able to use it fluently. I recommend this tablet to all parents! My favorite part is actually that the battery doesn’t last very long. This may seem negative to some but it ensures he isn’t using it too much. I’m a full time college student and let my son use this while I’m doing school work. I sometimes lose track of time so this way I know he can’t use it too much.
 Got it for my kids to use on long trips. The battery did well for the first few months then slowly the battery has a half life on one of the tablets I purchased. I got 2 of them one with yellow case and one in a pink case. the pink tablet still run and no problem other than along charging time which is fine considering I charge it over night and it's dead usually around 7 Its only played with at breakfast time when I'm cooking after lunch before nap and in the afternoon 6ish I'm a big fan of the kid time on it  nothing that is not kid friendly or a learning thing is on the tablets and that's awesome. All in all there a great product as long as u have amazon prime to keep the kid time. I'm in contact with Amazon now to return the yellow one and hopefully that will go over well!
 Bought this for my oldest child to cut down on the space that gets taken up by all of the physical books.  Functions very well except when the memory starts running out.  That starts to cause lag.  This is remedied by removing books or videos that have been downloaded.  I highly recommend buying at leas a 32GB micro SD card to supplement the internal memory.
 I love the Kindle Fire kids edition for my 7-year old boys! They are rough with everything they own, but the rubberized case keeps the device from taking any major damage.  The only issue we have with this product is that it has been not charging properly for sometime, and when I just got outside of the replacement window, it stopped charging at all. I will end up buying another,  but I would have loved if we had gotten it to last more than 14 months!
 After getting a replacement for a broken tablet me; Amazon sent me a faulty replacement that has had an issue of rebooting every 15mins. And now it won’t download any movies or games. I have spoken to several different customer service reps who have offered varying responses with no solution. I asked for a replacement and was told to send this back- I did and when I received my tablet back after they “worked” on it over a week. It still has the same issue. Save yourself the hassle of poor customer service buy an iPad!
 I honestly expected to be totally overwhelmed and hate this when I got it for my kids.  But it has been great.  I love that the parental controls are already in place and I don't have to worry about what they are playing/watching/reading and if they are buying things.  I also really like that I can make the tablet the bad guy, not me, since it "magically" knows when bed time comes around and shuts down.  I was not really expecting to use it myself, but I read my own books after they are in bed on the kindle app.  Overall, money well spent and I've recommended it to a number of my friends with kids.
 Stopped charging 6 months into owning it. Won't hold a charge. Wrote this review was contacted by someone right away in email but they stopped responding to my emails. They want me to charge it after I told them it won't hold a charge at all! Very irritated! It has a 2 year warranty and my warranty is up this summer. Don't bother waisting your money. Tablet sucks and the customer service sucks!!
 The tablet functions well sorta. When I first made a profile for my daughter, it switches over to a “kids friendly” screen which is good. But it got stuck in a loading failing loading loop. I ended up deleting the profile restarting and making another profile. It worked (whew). I was not impressed with the load time from boot, but it will teach the kids patience. Games are good and speed along. Adult profile / screen is good / friendly but haven’t spent too long on it, 1st impressions are a thumbs up. I would buy it again and make sure you pick up at least a 64gb micro sd card or higher with a high data rate ~90 Mb/s so games stay smooth. My daughter filled up 10gb in 2 days. ( and she’s barely cracked the top of them ) Games range from 1gb to 50mb so its up to you.
 Well I wanted to love this. I mean you put in the child's gender and age when setting it up and it automatically pulls up age appropriate content. I bought a pink one and blue one for my kids for Christmas and charging them has been a nightmare. This blue one in particular now will not charge AT ALL I've bought and tried new chargers, the chargers that came with them, even tried plugging it into my laptop to try and charge it. Will not charge!!!!!!
 When I originally got the kindle for my son a couple of years ago it was amazingly user and kid friendly. We have gone through two since that time because all of a sudden they just stop charging. So now we are on our fourth one, and low and behold amazon has decided to change the entire product and way it’s done. No longer user friendly and after six phone calls and countless hours with “professionals” the last woman finally was able to unlock the apps games movies etc.. still very non user friendly and my very intelligent almost four year old has to ask me for help which he never did with the original kindle<br/>I really wish companies would stop changing what’s already good<br/>If it ain’t broken don’t fix it!
 Our kids love them. They have been a perfect electronic device for our family. The free time subscription is awesome and it lets us always say yes to downloading new content -as opposed to coming from the iOS environment where we almost always had to say no. The tablets take a beating and keep on trucking. The major problem is with the plug in for the power cord. They seem to always get a loose connection and have difficulties charging after a period of time. Each time this has occurred Amazon has quickly issued a replacement device.
 Bought this for my two year old. We had been looking at cheaper options but the warranty on this alone makes it worth buying. My son loves it! Freetime is great! The are so many options and so much educational content. He has learned so much in just a few weeks. And a first time mom this is also great for helping me figure out the best ways to go about teaching him new things like colors and letters.
 This is great for the price. Meow bought this to replace the adult model of this after Meow broke it. It was suggested to Meow to buy this as a replacement, as the child's version has a 2 year no questions asked warranty. Meow is a old retired tom, and uses this to watch videos when in waiting rooms, long lines, etc. to keep the boredom away.  So since Meow rarely uses it, getting a high priced tablet would not fit well into this Cats budget.
 We've had this for a week and i've been very pleased with it as a parent, and my daughter feels the same.  It has great battery life, easy to use controls for me to set what apps and videos she can see, and the parent controls on time are great when trying to set limits on how much screen time she gets.  The case is well built and has already saved it from a few falls.
 I don’t usually write reviews but....Wish I could give this 0 stars. I must have received a faulty tablet. This thing sat on our table for 8 months out of the year that we’ve had it because it was useless and didn’t hold a charge. Not to mention once it did actually work it took forever to load and my kids easily gave up trying to play games or watch movies. We used the original charger that came with it as recommended and also tried another charger so we know that isn’t the problem. Tried holding it down for 40 seconds and all that.  Maybe I’m spoiled by having an Apple iPad mini 4.  I bought this for my daughter hoping I’d actually get to use my phone and tablet again but waste of time and money....I’d like a refund.
 My little boy is so happy we just now signed in and he's deciding which game's are appropriate for him to play because I explained that if it says M at the bottom, it means those are only for moms to play! It worked because no kid wants to play a game his mom plays. LOL. But thanks so much. You are an amazing seller and extremely quick delivery. My husband and I were like WOW. HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY.
 So these tablets can’t get on YouTube Kids. It’s kind of a bummer, but my kids don’t seem to mind with all the other games and fun stuff on it. It is seriously kid proof. You drop it and it bounces, landing safely. It’s well worth the money. Originally I bought two crappy tablets off amazon for half this price and once I returned them I bought two of these. Happy with the purchase.
 First let me say that this is an excellent product, and my daughter absolutely loves her tablet. Second, Amazon free time is worth the monthly price, but in this case, a 1 yr free subscription with purchase of the tablet is even more awesome!<br/>Now, that being said, the reason for the 4 star rating is due to the fact that it’s somewhat difficult to setup. The parental controls menu is not very clear or user friendly. There is no users manual to consult for help. It’s all online. So you have to go back and forth between searching on your phone/ipad/etc back to the tablet for setup. Soooo annoying. If you need to get in touch with tech support (they are very friendly)  be aware they know absolutely nothing. I did get everything finished. However, I could’ve gotten it done in less than 20 minutes if I had just been given a users manual in the box.
 This is the most confusing thing to set up. Then, once you actually set it up, you realize that you can basically only use the kid profile if you have access to WiFi or own the content. There is no way to download content from amazon prime, let alone any other app, onto the kids profile. Sure, you can download things to one of the parent profiles and watch that way, but then you’re not even utilizing any of the seemingly cool kid profile features. We attempted to use this for a long car trip and basically just ended up downloading a movie onto my profile. My son never even experienced the kid profile or freetime unlimited because we promptly returned the device.
 OK..  My son is autistic.  One of his ticks..  He likes to get mad and THROW things.  I've gone through about 5 tablets now. This is the best EVER!  Throw it on cement..  Still works.  Throw it across the room.  Still works.  Throw it at the wall like he's playing pitcher for the new York Yankees..  Still fricking works.. ! And the best part...  You can't even hear it hit the cement floors.  It's so quiet..  Lol
 This is the second kid kindle that I purchased. I got this one for my niece for Christmas. Last year, I bought a kid kindle for my nephew and he's though on electronics, but so far, so good. He still has his and it works well. He's a third grader and this keeps him entertained and it helps him read. I love these. I think they are a great way to keep kids engaged and entertained.
 It is slow. Was expecting it to be faster than the kids dragon touch. Screen size good, clarity fine. Touch screen could be more responsive considering this is designed specifically for an impatient child. I think amazon could do much better with these devices overall to be honest. It should have come preloaded with some apps or games. Price point was very reasonable.
 I was hoping for more... a lock screen option so my toddler can’t accidentally mess with display.  It’s also slower than other tablets I own, loading videos, books, etc.  still have not figured out how to save videos to play without WiFi.  Still a good tablet for the price!  Also durable and easy to use.<br/><br/>I have owned this product for a couple of months now and I like it less and less everyday.  For the newest tablet I own it is by far the slowest and buggiest of any of them.  Not very satisfied with this product, suggest looking elsewhere for children’s tablet.
 Battery would not hold a charge. I sent it back for a replacement and got an automated reply that the device was and it was shopped back to me less than 24 hours after they received it.  How could they have tested the life of the battery.  Then the did not send back the protective case or the plug!  So now I have the original device (with a faulty battery) missing he protective cover for my child and plug both of which I paid for already!<br/>Then it is impossible to find someone to speak to and once I do the agent has no idea.  Keeps asking me generic questions about what would I like.  I ask for a replacement device.  She puts me on hold and never comes back.  After 22 minutes I finally hang up.  Infuriating!<br/>Buyer be ware, it says its covered under warranty but I now have less than what I paid for after getting a faulty battery.  So much time has been taken from me as well.
 My 5 year old got this when she was 4. She still religiously uses it. It is awesome! Parents- Make sure when you first get it you password lock transactions. Because it is automatically linked to your AMAZON account, your card information is also linked. We learned the hard way. Luckily Amazon was able to refund the money our Daughter spent on some APPS over a few days. Other than that little hiccup, it is perfect and we are going to purchase one soon for our 2 year old!
 Not as intuitive as I thought. I had to buy a larger sim card immediately. If using on car rides, you have to download movies, etc. Updating. The charger port is broken &amp; machine won't hold a charge. For the price it was a decent buy. However, our daughter only uses avout 2 hours a week &amp; she was meticulous about taking care of it. After q7 months it is trash.
 My son LOVES this tablet! It has held up great! I bought this Christmas 2017 and it still works great. We do notice the battery doesn't stay charged near as long as it used too. But it still does it's job for the most part. My son maybe plays with it a few times a week, as he isn't really big on electronics. Which made it a little frustrating that the battery is already acting up. But overall it's been great!
 Love that it came with a year of free content and the 2 year no questions asked warranty. What I dislike is the fact that on the lock screen, you can log onto other kindle accounts linked to your amazon account. My kids managed to figure out how to log into my kindle account from their kindle account and purchased a few things.. The storage also isnt that great but you can easily add more too it. Its a great tool full of educational games and shows that kids can play on while on a car trip or to keep them busy as you finish making dinner.
 I got this as a gift and it was working great at first. Within a month the battery started to die shortly after charging. I contacted customer service, they tried to troubleshoot the issue and ultimately sent me another one telling me this “new” tablet could be new or it could be refurbished. Anyways, We got the other one and it was worse than the first. It’s battery life is ok but I keep getting an error message when I try to play shows. It also seems to be way slower. I seem to wait forever for it to even load a show after touching the show thumbnail several times. Again I contacted customer service and they took me through steps to fix it. It worked that evening but the next day stopped working again giving me the same error message. Luckily, I have my iPad and have been able to use that and I think I will just stick with it instead of trying to get this to work. DONT buy this kindle unless you want to deal with customer service.
 This tablet is perfect for my kids!! I bought two tablets one for my 5 year old daughter in kindergarten and one for my 3 year old daughter. The best part about this tablet is setting the different accounts based on their ages! I also have a 1 year old so while my oldest daughter is at school and we have to run errands I let him get on hers and play the toddler games on his own account! My least favorite is that it doesn't seperate the learning games from the just fun art games and such and I bought this to better encourage my 5 year old to learn her phonics and math skills better! But it does have a TON of learning ganes I'm the freetime application and it being free the first year is so amazing!! We really love this tablet and plan to buy my 1 year old one if his very own tablet for his 2nd birthday this summer! Its a must buy and by far the best price for everything you get! Also I love the fact I have my own account one them too to control what they are doing and setting parental controls and glean even use it as a kindle for my books if I want!! The ckver is also incredible especially for younger kids!!
 I really was dissapointed with this. It just didnt meet my expectations with the representation Amazon has. Please dont take this as a completely negative review. The padding is great, the screen is nice and durable to withstand my 4 boys all under 6 years of age. I think I dislike whenever its not connected to the internet we have problems with opening the apps. Some of he downloades items will not even appear in the device but will show a blank space. If you have continual internet then its great. I think the next generation is something to look forward to. The battery life is great when playing games on the 4 different profiles.  I wish there were more educational items and games related to grade level. Once you enter the date of birth for each profile, it supposedly pulls up age appropriate material. However, most of it is games without substance, a good amount of books, but there were not very many "interesting" sight word games or math.  There was plenty lego games, my son loves those. I wish it were more educational content/games that would capture our attention and occupy it.
 This tablet is very durable and keeps my 3 year old entertained. TONS of things to do, books to read, games to play. However, I was under the impression that at least SOME of the games, videos or apps would work without wifi and it doesn't. So if you're taking this on a long car ride I hope you parents have a wifi hotspot on your phone or built into your car otherwise the tablet won't work. The other negative thing is the quality of the screen. Doesn't show too clear but it gets the job done. Out of all the kid tablets I researched, this one is and has been the best compared to competitors. For a kids tablet, it's worth it until they're responsible enough for something more high end.
 I do not like this product because there is no way to block your child from downloading apps. Also you have have the membership to actually download the apps your child wants if it was not for the fact my kid will not part with inwould never by one again than i have another for me that was given to me for christmas and i have all kinds of ads on and they cannot be removed everytime i want to use it on either of these devices there they ads. Not a goid product do not waste your money.
 Every weekend we babysit for 11 hours a day our great-grand kids - ages 1 -2 - 3 and 5.  We only have 3 of these so we have the kids tell us the name of an animal - the one who keeps going with names gets to use one - the 4th child get to play Memory or look at ducks on you-tube.  Great Granny Sue
 My 8yr old doesn't have much experience with tablets and needed help navigating the initial logging in the first few times.<br/>It doesn't come with any games on it. You have to log into an amazon account to get anything connected to it.<br/>The volume comes on at factory setting level every time it's turned on. It is easy for her to navigate on her own. It doesn't seem to freeze or have glitches while playing games or watching videos.<br/>She hasn't dropped it....yet. but seems very durable.
 Our 4 year old can spend hours playing on this...if we would let her. The battery life is excellent with a variety of apps for her to use. It's durable case I'm sure will save it when it gets dropped (and it WILL get dropped).
 After having this tablet for a couple months, I have a couple of comments:<br/><br/>1. The maximum volume is LOUD. Way too loud for prolonged exposure of small ears. The parental controls need to include a way to control the maximum volume.<br/><br/>2. The content we get through Amazon FreeTime is mostly pretty good, although it lacks some content that we have had on other platforms, so your kids may still be asking for your iPad or phone. For example, the Kindle gets several Sago Mini games, but not the Sago Mini farm game. Overall, the 3-5 year age range is weirdly lacking in good games involving trucks. Not sure why this is.<br/><br/>Overall, it's working well for us. My son learned the interface quickly, the battery life and overall performance have been good, and the content fulfills its promise of being age-appropriate (if sometimes irritating to adult ears).
 I'm the Mom who will not allow my kids safety compromised online at all costs. The safety feature is the best I have seen. You are truly able to curate what you kids are allowed to watch. And they were a huge hit with my kids when we flew for the holidays. Not to mention they are a great tool for motivating them to do their homework, chores, improve behavior, etc. or no tablet. The screen timer, was a game changer. Less helicopter parenting for me all around, but with peace of mind. Plus I get to check what they are attempting to access and have accessed. So I still maintaining personal control over them without them knowing it. Only thing I would recommend is a screen cover. The case is just a foam rubber bumper, which is good enough for a while but there is nothing on the screen part. My kids are rough on their toys. And I would also recommend purchasing a carry case.
 I traded an iPad mini for this tablet, thinking my grandkids could use it and I can't even figure it out!  I've never seen a device so difficult to use!  I'm sticking with Apple products from now on.
 i lvoe the fact that you have alot of control over what children can do and watch. I dont like how cheap it feels. its extremely light. I'f my toddler were to get his hands on this and throw it, i feel at if it would break. The apps are really nice and he gets to do his reading. i really love the fact that the device locks everything that is needed for purchasing. the only thing that i didnt like is that its super light weight. other then that its A M A Z I N G!
 Not impressed at all. Cannot use unless you are in wi-fi and even then it is extremely slow to process anything and not user friendly - especially for children. We thought that we would eventually get used to it and then it would be easier to work but no. Even if it was easier to navigate, anything that we try to do on it takes forever. Downloading a game, book, or even trying to search the web is nearly impossible. I wish that we could return it.
 My daughter dropped her original tablet off the table, it cracked the screen on the inner side of the tablet (you could see it but not feel it), and because it was under the warranty still, I was able to easily contact Amazon support and they sent out the replacement tablet, while giving me a prepaid shipping label I returned the cracked tablet with no hassle.
 I let my daughter on this tablet for just a couple hours a day. It seems great as a solo playtime or for the both of us to interact together. I love how there are SO MANY learning apps and I can control exactly how long she plays on it for which days and activities.<br/><br/>I also love the fact that if it breaks, it's replaced for free.
 Space filled up really fast. Not all the games/ apps etc that it comes with can be "downloaded" at once. the download speed to get them ready to play is super slow. I wasn't able to put youtube on the kids page. It was nice being able to access any of our amazon products from any tablet. you pull down the drop screen and switch devices. so even if one kids tablet was dead i could access their tablet from mine or their bothers. that was nice. But i wouldn't buy this again.
 i bought the two pack for my boy/girl twins that are two years old. they are young and rough on pretty much everything and i loved the fact that amazon would replace them if my twins broke them. We have had them for a little more than 8 months and they have held up great and have not had any issues. They are really worth the money and the fact it comes with Amazon FreeTime unlimited for free for a year is the best part! Another nice feature us that it has a regular mode and a kids mode so if im using it i can use it in regular mode but if one of my kids is using it i put it in the kid mode for them. The case it comes with is very durable and makes it even easier for kids to hold onto.
 Hey, guys.  This is the best thing since sliced bread!!!!!  It is everything the ads say...and much much more.  My step=daughter is Level 1 Austistic amd doesnt handle new thinghs well.  But she wont give this thing up!!!!  (hey hey...parental settings!!)  This should become mandatory for special neeeds kids!!
 I bought two of these, one for my 2 year old and one for my 4 year old. I like these tablets quite a bit. The setup and getting all the apps took a bit longer than I expected it to but overall I'm pleased with these. They're very durable and you can set parental controls to limit content and how much time they can spend on them so that they will lock automatically after a certain time of night or after so long of use.
 The charging ports on these tablets wear out quickly and are very weak! Compared to the iPad 2 which is older - these tablets are not worth the headache. I cannot figure out how to return one of the two tablets I purchased, it's useless at this point due to the broken charging port. Also, the charging cords these come with are not that good. You have to buy new ones and also memory cards. I give them a meh rating.
 This tablet is a great mini entertainment center for my daughter. I wish it had more Disney content such as movies but it only has apps for Disney. It can also entertain adults with a separate profile protected with a password. I love the fact that when I downloaded YouTube to my profile there were no ads interrupting the videos which is fanfreakingtastic. I'm not sure if that's because I have the Prime trial or if it has to do with the free year of free time? Either way it's great &amp; I hope it's a feature that lasts. The child proof case saved the tablet from a high drop on the first day. It has great sound &amp; nice picture. It's similar to android but has different features here &amp; there. I hope I don't have to replace this tablet for any reason seeing how a lot of people have issues with the 2 year warranty. So far we love this tablet. Will update if that changes...
 Let’s begin with exterior features, this Kids Edition is amazing! No matter what happens, your kindle will be safe. But the reason that I’m giving 3 stars is because of the touch and interface. I didn’t like it at all. The touch is really slow and I didn’t get this interface spiritual. I also try to make some downloads to play while offline, but it didn’t go well and I have no idea how to do it in another way. Overall, it’s cool to have a device for your kid instead of giving yours, but it still needs some improvements.
 I dont like the memory w out an sd card. I went to remove some apps and it wouldn't allow me too under admin or guest acct. I will get that resolved w costumer support at some point.  Also a passcode option to buy apps should be under the Amazon options. Tablet is great if you have a sd card or if you know how to fix the storage. Prime should come free like the free time for 1 yr at least. Also this is great for kids learning tablets.
 I bought 2 of these for Christmas 2017/2018 for my girls ages 4 &amp; 8. They are hard to navigate for kids &amp; adults. I still can’t figure out how to put apps like Netflix &amp; Hulu on the “kids” profile. I have to switch it to my adult profile to let them use these apps. My younger daughters on/off button won’t work so the only way to get the home screen on is to plug in/unplug it.  Now the batteries on both are terrible and the tablets are out of the replacement window. My older daughter has been charging hers for 4 days straight (yes I checked everything is functioning and the charging symbol is on). After 4 days still on the charger I just checked and it’s at 53%. I give them 1 star only because it won’t let me give a 0. Don’t waste your money. Buy a cheaper used iPad instead. 100x easier to use and not a total waste of money.
 The tablet is good for a first couple of weeks. After that it started showing terrible lag in performance. Gets stuck for no reason and shuts down on its own. I wasn't expecting a lot from a cheap tablet for kids but why does the battery drains off in just 3 hours? Takes terribly long time to charge to 100% and even after that lasts only for 3-4 hours.<br/>This is my second fire (the first was Fire HD 7) which died on its own one fine day and refused to get back to life. The customer service from Amazon will ask you a billion questions and even after that will not guarantee a replace. Never ever will I go for an Amazon product again.
 My 4 year old beat the crap out of my ipad mini and this is pretty durable.  It's been dropped and (probably) kicked and still doing well.  Great for letting you control what apps and content your kids are allowed to use.  Mostly our use this for some of the apps we've downloaded, along w/ Disney JR and Nick JR.  He'll be on his first plane ride this summer so here's hoping this saves the day!
 This tablet is perfect for the kid. She was using an iPhone with WiFi only capability however she lived on YouTube.  The freetime ability in the fire tablets makes it perfect to only allow her access to certain things after completing educational requirements &amp; also setting a cap on screen time.  The downside is she doesn't use it much since she has to "learn first" but that isn't so bad since it means her eyes aren't constantly glued to a device anymore.
 We bought this kindle fire for our two year old. We had an iPad for her before, but she is rough and likes to drop things, so we did some research and found this kindle fire. We absolutely love it. The parental control is great and easy to control, the case has a nice grip to it and the battery life and storage is amazing. Our daughter loves to use it and the free time is a great app. She is learning a lot through the apps. The kindle is also very durable. I would definitely purchase another one for our second child once he’s old enough.
 These were purchased for my toddlers for flights and long car rides. We loved getting a free year of the Free time for kids with this purchase! The kid-friendly games and videos are easily accessible on my sons' own profile, parent-lock settings prevent them from browsing internet/purchasing apps. The case is perfect to help them hold on and has protected the tablets from accidental (and a few purposeful) drops.
 I was very excited to introduce this tablet to my daughter. She has had many different tablets but this one was a little more expensive and "advanced." A month after purchasing this tablet, everything stopped working. It wouldn't turn on and was completely unresponsive. After making several phone calls they did replace the tablet for a one time only replacement. Which was great, but also the appropriate thing to do considering we only had it for a month! About 2 months after receiving the replacement, the same thing happened to our new one. quite a bummer and a bit disappointed. When the tablet was working it was great and my daughter did enjoy it!
 My daughter absolutely loves this tablet. I like the Freetime app on here because it’s full of educational games and videos that my daughter finds on her own and she’s only 2! I hear her counting along and saying the alphabet along with the videos it’s the cutest thing!<br/><br/>The tablet case is extremely durable as they described. It still looks brand new despite being dropped a few times.<br/><br/>My only complaint is buying a memory card is almost necessary because there’s not that much storage and the battery drains pretty quickly even when the tablet isn’t being used.
 Bought these two on sale in July for Christmas gifts.  They were bundled and came with a two year, no questions asked warranty.  Gave them to the girls ages 6 &amp; 8 on Christmas day.  The first one quit charging and responding around February 1, the second quit on February 18.  Two girls live in separate households and both quit within 2 weeks of each other.  Am now wading through the process of getting them replaced.  Like the concept, love the two year warranty, not impressed with the quality.
 Useless outside of the US. 99% of contents not available. Instead of just loading/displaying what is available they make you click on each one to find out. Poor poor poor! Waste of money!
 Tablet worked great for the first 6 months but now it won’t hold a charge. I’ve bought 2 additional chargers to see if the original charger was the problem &amp; it’s still not working correctly. Amazon customer service is a joke. I’ve talked to 4 different representatives in one day arguing that it clearly states it’s under a 2 year warranty &amp; they are trying to say I’m not “in my window for returns.” This has been a total disappointment because I paid almost $120 for a tablet that is defective. I had higher expectations seeing it had good reviews. I will never order another electronic off here again.
 Loved it in the beginning for my 2year old. Started freezing and battery wouldn't stay charged long. Bought it for the two year no questions asked warranty replacement which translates to being transferred 12 times between 3 separate chats, sending it in to be replaced and them saying there was nothing wrong and sending mine back to me.  Not very happy with the way this was handled.
 I just bought this as a Christmas gift for my kids. I want I‎t ready to use on Christmas, so I have charged it and downloaded some apps. I’m pretty sure that the kids will love them (I bought two). The cases are very durable. Screen quality is perfect.
 Bought this with the promise of a 12 month freetime unlimited subscription being free. After over a month of trying with tech support it was impossible to activate that membership. I was left with the choice of either returning the device or just buying the subscription. I bought a year's subscription, Big mistake!<br/>The parental controls are half backed after all these years, their don't work at all. When I try to tick the option to finish the educational time before being able to watch videos, that doesn't work at all! Kids are able to watch videos as they like before finishing their reading time. These are the sole selling points of an otherwise slow, laggy device and Amazon can't even get that part right. I wish I knew of a better alternative for kids, so far seems there are no competitors and that probably explains the bad quality of the hardware and interface.
 I had so many problems setting this up and turns out that even though it gives you options to allow children to have a web search and add apps unless you change their age to basically an adult, they can't even look at cartoons like peppa pig or sing-a-long songs on youtube. It's not set up completely to be a child's tablet and it has to have a lock on it and switches back and forth between the adult login and the child's log in which is a hassle when i bought this for a 2 year old child that cannot put in a code to open it up. I wouldn't buy this again.
 It you are used to work with apple ipad, you will immediately see that working with this tablet is not easy. It is very confusing and hard to see what is going on with apps that you downloaded. Besides, some apps needs wifi otherwise they do not run. Another downside of this product is that it consumes a lot of power, You have to charge it almost everyday, although my child does not use it even some days, and it does, only 20-30 min.
 No protection from the screen cracking, aside from that, the kids like it. Also, I purchased a set of 2 &amp; one of the 2 stopped charging, so it no longer works at all.<br/><br/>*****Update: After posting my original review, the very next day, Amazon contacted me directly via phone and email. They immediately sent me a return label to send the Kindle back for repair. They apparently were unable to repair it. Therefore, I received a new one in the mail only 3 days after I sent the broken one back! Top notch customer service, Amazon. Thank you.
 Bought for my granddaughter.  She likes it, but its a little slow. She is used to playing on her mother's iphone, which has a much faster reaction time.  We thought this would be a great way to keep her hands off mommy's phone.  She isn't yet 2, so her attention span is short.  When things take awhile to load she does get bored - I think its because she was used the speed of an iphone.  She's had it for 5 months and is getting much better at patience then she was at Christmas time though.
 I am SO glad I bought this tablet! I have two toddlers and they are always stealing my phone to play games. I bought the 2 pack so they each got their own tablet, so no fighting. The games are fun and educational. There is so much I haven’t explored yet. This was a very good buy!
 The only thing I dislike is the ad feature. I dont think kids should have to watch and dismiss ads. And for some reason when updates are done I have had to reset my purchasing settings. I have a code for purchasing that no one knows and somehow it has been enabled and thus my kids who are younger than 8 have made purchases. And amazon has a lot of internal memory used. But I love the sturdiness and great customer service and warranty features. The color is vibrant for my kids. They love all of their fire tablets
 I bought this tablet for my 2 year old great grand daughter and she loves it ,the quality, durability, and price are perfect for her age ,the frist tablet I bought for her she had 2 weeks and it got stolen while at a friend's house and my g-bany cried the whole 2 weeks,so I bought her another one and it's very hard to get her to put it down she has learned her A,B,C's in less then a month and can count to 25 all because of this tablet and the apps we put on it for her ,I also bought my nephews who are twins with autism one each for their birthdays they are 6 and nonverbal, but since they have had this tablet they are saying momma,love ,go,eat,sit,baby,play all because of this tablet, I would recommend this tablet to anyone ,my g-baby has dropped, thrown, and sit on hers and it's still in perfect shape. I bought 4 of them in a month s they got to be good.
 I bought this for my 3 yr. Old grand daughter. She loves it. She can get age appropriate apps, stories and videos. The case is great especially for little hands and when she drops it, it doesn't break. If she had her way she would be on it 24/7 but we limit her with the parental settings. Love the 2 year replacement and free 1yr kids freetime. Order the extra SD card for storage, you'll need it with all the apps.
 The sturdiness to these tablets is the best feature. The thick foam style case is amazing, feels and looks great. The tablet itself is less than I was expecting. Not all the apps in the kids section work, the tablet freezes up often and we have only been using it since Christmas. It's difficult to get some games/videos off that my child downloads. I wish it was a lot easier to use for a child although my children do enjoy using it. In my opinion it's just not worth the price even with the sale.
 Device is great, however make sure you adjust your settings to disable the purchase options. As they are disabled on my amazon account I thought they would have defaulted to no-purchase without authorization on these as well when set up. They did not. My boys spent about $30 each on apps etc. without needing approval before I noticed I had been charged.
 My daughter has barely used this tablet. After under a month the tablet won’t hold a charge. It dies in under 10 minutes. The tablet is also very slow and under powered. I understand it’s a kids tablet, but the lag makes it difficult for children to navigate.
 My Kids love these. I got a blue one for my son and a pink one for my daughter. I was amazed at the picture clarity.<br/>There are so many apps to choose from. Something for all ages. I love the timer you can set on them because my kids would stay on them forever if I let them.<br/>Pro: Keeps my kids quiet. Great for road trips!<br/>  Great battery life.<br/>  Great picture quality.<br/>  Nice selection of apps.<br/>  Good Parental Controls<br/>Cons: I haven't found any yet.
 fire tablet for our 3rd child...<br/><br/>Pros: Awesome tablet, bigger and faster than the older version.  Also comes with an SD card slot so you don't have to archive your child's data every other day.<br/><br/>Cons: Amazon cancelled our subscription service used for our second child because we added a 3rd to our prime account ?!?.  Nearly two hours on the phone with customer service and we had to upgrade our kid's fire subscriptions to a family plan.<br/><br/>Now I am unsure if I am going to upgrade the other two tablets to the Fire 7...
 Great tablet for my 5 year old. The blue kid-proof case is soft but durable, almost like NERF. Of course the Kindle Fire is a great tablet on its own, with plenty of processing power for my son to run any of the games available on the app store. I like that I can set parental controls so he is locked out of things I don't want him doing, or I can restrict what he can see. All in all, a great tablet, with an awesome case, with plenty of storage for a ton of apps.
 Terrible. I bought this so I can download my kids' learning apps recommended by their school for homework. You can only use with Amazon Apps, rendering this device useless to me. Also, the new interface looked similar to the Amazon Fire TV experience with lots of "recommendations" for my kids. This made it a daily battle to keep them focused on the few apps I thought were educational, when all they wanted to do was watch whatever was "recommended to them."
 I absolutely love the tablet for my two-year-old great grandson.  He lost his first one that he's had for years but he can navigate and play anything and everything in the tablet that we I have set up for him. We're going to put the navigation system on at this time that we can find it. He is learning his alphabet numbers and his phonics. I would recommend it for any young child.
 Honestly I'm not sure how this product has any good reviews. Anyone with any knowledge of tablets and electronics should know better. We got two of these for our kids and have never been so grateful for Amazon's quick and easy return policy. We have other Amazon Fire products that we love and are so easy to use. These products we're slow and to be honest just really annoying. It seems like it's gonna be cool that they will have access to free time but EVERYTHING free time has to offer is on the home screens and not downloaded. So when your kids clicks on it, and they're gonna, it takes forever to download. Also you have to link them to your Amazon account which means you have to set up new profiles and it automatically links other profiles to each of your other Amazon products. Let me tell you again how incredibly SLOW these are. I know it wasn't our internet or anything cause our other electronics were working fine. Save yourself the trouble and order another tablet instead.
 This is a really great item. My grandson is going to love it. Even though I made the mistake of ordering the pink instead of the blue. I love that it has a camera. Took me a little while to figure out how to load some stuff. All I had to do was load from my stuff. I really want to keep it for myself. :) Guess I'll have to order another one for myself. Maybe I'll order the blue and trade it out with him. I highly recommend this.
 Bought this a year ago, not from Amazon.  I read all the reviews and figured I'd give it a shot. My daughter loved it but didn't use it a lot. Now she's after it again and it won't charge. It says it's charging but when you check it an hour later it has dropped in power. I can have it plugged in all day and it won't charge even though it says it is. We gave up and got her a Samsung.
 bought 2 of these fire 7's for my granddaughters,  both units failed after less than a 100 hrs of use.  very disappointed in the quality of the units.  figured that they would be heavy duty for kids.  I mean they are directed at that market.  I have had my original fire tablet seems like forever. I don't understand why these 7's  failed after such short usage. neither will take a charge.
 I have loss communication with my grandson since I've purchased this item. He never looks up anymore. LOL ...I purchased one for my grand daughter almost 5 years ago and its still going!  This is a must have.  Its sturdy, plenty of learning/educational games and have proven the test of time. The cover keeps it safe, there's a warranty that I never had to use.  It just keeps on going and going!  This was a winner and I think his favorite Birthday/Christmas gift!  The screen is larger than the older model and the price is definitely worth it!!
 Love the kindle as do my babies. It takes away the constant concern of purchasing items without my consent. This was an issue with my own kindle. Many apps appropriate for age group. Way too many subscriptions offered that make my little ones upset they can’t access. Having these available for viewing on my profile vs theirs would definitely be an improvement.
 My son absolutely loves the tablet. It’s amazing how it’s geared towards his age. The battery life isn’t that great on WIFI, I expected all day considering he doesn’t play with it and is entertained with other activities but once placed on airplane mode I’ve noticed a battery change. I also wish he had more apps with the airplane mode but I love how much he is able to learn and it makes trips a lot more smoother now.
 This was great for about a week. Then it stopped charging. DO NOT BELIEVE THE 2 YEAR WARRANTY. You get 30 days. Since i had purchased this for a Christmas gift that means it worked for about 3 days before the return window tan out. Purchased a new charger, still wont charge unless you actually hold and press the charger in place. Never charged by a child, defective port. Amazon customer service is a bad joke.
 Pray to god it isn't a gift and breaks, you will jump through hoops to get a replacement. You will need the recipient of your gift to win the lottery to get the process completed. Oh did I mention the only problem is it won't hold a charge and that is uncommon so you need the three year old you bought it for with 5 open heart surgeries to add your address to the registration even though you bought it as a gift and you gave them the purchase number. Guessing this is a process of national security. By the way he broke his first one by stepping on it so i figured you know what not their problem, why play the system and try to get a free one. But this is no fault of his. Nice Christmas present. Too bad leap frog is a little too advanced for a toddler. Great learning tool terrible terrible awe full support if it doesn't charge. Hey Prime see the orders in my basket there they will stay.
 My daughter uses this nonstop and the convenience of free time with amazon is amazing. Just beware if you are buying this for someone and want to step it up for them because as soon as you finish setting up you activate the free time with amazon. Other than that they have a two year hassle free insurance and it rocks.
 I bough two of these for my twin grandsons! This is one of the best things Amazon offers for small hands. I don't have to worry about the content they are viewing and they are able to operate by themselves. They absolute LOVE these tablets. Buy it, buy it, buy it. Don't hesitate, seriously, and signing up for the child content could not be easier. We can even change the child's name easily on the tablet if they pick up the one that is not theirs. I am so happy with this purchase.
 Perfect for kids. Fantastic parental controlls i set up what my kids can see based off what is appropriate for there age range so they can see tons and tons of games books and videos for that age and nothing more. Its very easy to use my only complant is there isnt a discription of the books games or videos you have to down load them to find out what it is. Only a minor inconvenience as you can of course remove the item if you dont like it. My kids throw it constantly the protective case is very effective
 This worked great until this month. It has only been 3 months and the charging ports on both of the tablets has quit working. I purchased two of them. I am currently trying to figure out how to return for their 2 yr worry free warranty.
 We purchased two of these devices for my kids so they could watch movie and read books.  The price was hard to beat as I figured Amazon constructed the tablets using inexpensive and somewhat older materials.  The truth is that they are cheap.  The batter didn't last 16 months on either of the two devices and neither device will charge or turn on.  I've tried multiple cables and usb chargers that work on other devices, so bad cables are not to blame.  Save the headache and spend a bit more to get something that lasts, like an iPad.
 I’m generally pretty dissatisfied with this product. It’s quite slow to load and download apps within free time (which is what we use almost exclusively with this kids’ tablet) and, for some reason, we regularly have to restore it to the factory settings to get it to show freetime content ( we get an error message that says “use web” even though it was working correctly just minutes before. When it’s working it’s great, but that’s such a small percentage of the time that it’s overshadowed by all the problems we have with it. Overall I wish I would’ve either gone for the newer version or just bought a refurbished iPad for family use. Very disappointing, and much worse than our previous fires (which we’ve enjoyed very much).
 I was afraid to buy because I was unsure that it was going to work as expected for my little one who is just 5 month. But we’ve been using it for a couple of months now and it really entertains him and it’s something that he’s going to use for years so well worth the money. It has so many baby/kids videos and song and you can control what applications your kid is allowed to use. Can’t find enough words to say how much we like it.
 They apparently knew about the problem, but wanted me to answer a bunch of questions so they can properly "fill out the form for return".  whatever, if no questions asked, great, but if you gonna ask questions, take that slide off of the product information screen.  They honored the two year warranty, which, btw, the kindle died after a year and a half.  There ARE alternatives.  Thank goodness for capitalism and freedom of choice.
 Great tablet EXCEPT it's only been 6 months, and it won't hold a charge. It slowly took longer and longer for the battery to fill up, and now it won't even turn on. We tried different kindle plugs, and different outlets but nothing works.<br/><br/>My daughter is so disappointed, and so am I. I have kindles and none of them have ever had this issue. Not worth the money IMHO.
 I WOULD NOT recommend this item. I am seldom disappointed in the items that I order from Amazon. This is the third Kindle that I have purchased, but the first Kid's edition Kindle I purchased. I can honestly say that it will also be my last. It is wonderful that there is a two year warranty on it, but it can be time consuming to have to send it in to be repaired/replaced. This item DOES NOT hold a charge very long at all! The only plus that I have is that it is light weight and the case is nice. It is also simple enough that my four year old can  use it, the problem is that it was purchased for my 7 year old.
 I've had the tablets about 10 months. I still have to look up video tutorials on how to use/manage them (I bought two tablets, one for each kid). Today I logged in hoping to get help via chat on how to lock the screen while a movie is playing so my 2 year old wouldn't change it constantly, come to find out that isn't an option. During the chat I was transferred 4 times and explained what I was needing help with 7 times. So customer service via chat is just as bad as on the phone! For being a kids tablet I expected it to be much more user friendly and to have things like disabling touch screen (how is that not standard?!?). The apps that will disable it aren't available for download on them either. Pretty disappointed and wishing I would have gone with a different tablet in general.
 Really loved these for the kids when we got them. But they very quickly have slowed down &amp; they don't have that many downloads on then. Slow, charger hole seems loose, lag, buttons don't respond all the time, &amp; horrible at keeping a charge. Don't hate then though. They're super tough with the bumper/case + you can't beat the child profile so they can't access the bad you tube &amp; search the internet.
 I bought this tablet for a 3 year old. I absolutely LOVE it! Its the family's second tablet from amazon and it has blown my mind! When you recieve it and turn it on (you will need wifi) the set up is so easy u can do it in a handful of MINUTES! The protective bumper feels like the same material super light gym shoe bottoms are made of, like a durable foam. Youre allowed to have multiple accounts for multiple users. The free time that comes included is amazing! No flipping app to app to find something to do. There are little tabs similar to internet tabs on a web browser that help you go from books to videos to games to even a break down of which character youre looking for!  Its way easy to operate! I HIGHLY recommend over other products we have tried such as the sprout cubby, ipad, and the leap frog tablets.
 Absolutely terrible. You cannot get on YouTube as advertised. You cannot add YouTube to an approved website list. You have to add individual videos to the approved lists, you can't even just add certain channels. You cannot do something as simple as changing the lock screen image. Basically your child can do what amazon has decided your child can do with their free time subscription...
 Best thing I could have spent money on for my kids. There are kid friendly activities shows and learning games. I can also add Netflix and Hulu for them as well as the Xfinity Stream app so they can watch their favorite shows and movies. With all the things installed on them it runs very smooth. The case it light weight yet the tablet it very secure and safe. Charges fast lasts nearly all day. Very easy to navigate on both kids and parental account.
 Pros: separate profiles for multiple family members with separate passcodes, childproof case is amazing for protecting against falls, resolution is good, volume can get impressively high.<br/>Cons: all you have to do to download a new app is touch it, so every single thing my kid touches in Amazon free time gets downloaded and I spend a lot of unnecessary time deleting things to free up space, takes forever to charge and dies pretty quickly, doesn't come with a screen protector, space fills up very quickly so definitely invest in an SD card.
 This is very easy to use- my 5 year old had no problem figuring it out and he has very limited experience with tablets. We got it for a 5 hour flight and it was great. My only negative is that it doesn’t hold a charge for a very long time particularly when not in use, the battery dies pretty quickly. It lasted for about 4 hours after continuous use on the plane which is pretty good. It’s just a bummer when my son picks it up after a day and it’s totally dead.
 I have one of these for my 5 yr old and my soon-to-be 3 yr old.  They have been poked, dropped, sticky with food, etc. for a month now with no consequences.  Very durable!  Amazon freetime app (comes with one-year subscription) is an absolute must have for my family.  Parents can add additional content (music, books, games, videos, etc.) to the freetime app to allow kids access to things outside of the default app.  Everything is pre-screened according to my kids' ages, all ads and paid content is automatically disabled (even for things I add outside of the app), I can set time limits and goals for my kids; I can't say enough good things about this service!!!!!!  Imagine a life that includes YouTube videos without the possibility of your kids unknowingly clicking on a paid ad or even worse!  As long as freetime is on when you push the power button to put the tablet to sleep, it automatically opens in freetime.  At any time, I can leave my kids' freetime profile and use it as a fully-functional tablet that is password protected.
 Kids love it, Freetime app is awesome.  My only gripe, it is a big one though, is that it says they will replace it if anything goes wrong no questions asked and they have put me through the ringer.  The device won't charge so the battery is dead but I have been on the phone with them for over 45 minutes now 'troubleshooting' the device, plug it in turn it on turn it off hit this button hit these two buttons, on and on and on.  Eventually after getting transferred 3x and an hour later they sent me a mailing label to send it back to them to try to fix it.  Fingers crossed.
 It wasn't working properly after a month. I had to call 2 separate times to get it replaced. They first told me it wasn't able to be replaced and gave me the run around having to talk to 3 separate people every time I called. It definitely was NOT NO questions asked and was NOT easy to get replaced.
 Lasted only 2 months before this tablet stopped holding a charge. Had no way to keep battery charged. Took many calls to amazon before they told me to send everything back that it came with and they’d send a replacement. When it arrived I had no charger or tablet cover since I sent it back with tablet.  I had to go back in and buy a charger and cover separately.
 Purchased 2 of these last Christmas. Both worked well at first but within 4 months they started to malfunction. Eventually, they simply powered down &amp; never would reboot or recharge. Since it came with a 2 year guarantee, we returned it, but the replacement had the exact same issues. No wonder why it came with a 2 year “hassle free” warranty. I wonder if these were all just a bunch of refurbished tablets to begin with.  I still have time to return them for yet another replacement but I figured what’s the use.
 I've never been disappointed or dissatisfied with anything I've purchased from Amazon. That is until today. I bought this with the worry free insurance and the tablet worked great until the charge port went out last week. I repair devices for a living and it was a no brainer what the issue was it's very common for tablets. So I set up the repair which took 3 transfers and hours of hold time and needless questions despite me cutting thru the b.s. of troubleshooting. I was to ally told they would just send me a new one. 6 days later it arrived I recovered the data from  loud and got it ready for my toddler so he could enjoy in the a.m. It came at 80 percent, so I was thrilled and got straight to using it and my 2yr old was thrilled. I go to charge it and surprise surprise. The devices charge port does not work at all 10 chargers 8 cords and 4 were original Amazon chargers. Now instead of Kao ken × 10 it's fml × 100.
 I'm not very fond of this -- it works fine, but battery life is nothing to be impressed with. I guess I'm used to iPads and samsung tablets where battery life lasts for quite a few days and even longer if not in use. This battery doesn't last a whole day whether you use it or not.  The apps are OK. If I could go back, I'd save the $ and put it towards a different tablet.
 I love this device and I am so thankful for the 2 year no questions asked warranty. My son is not the most careful with electronics, so this is a blessing! I really like the child safety features and how you can choose how long it stays on etc. so he only gets in 2 hours a day! I really enjoy using it to download books and watch shows on my account while my son can also read books and play learning games on his account. I would highly recommend this product! There is something for all of us, however, just know if you are not connected to wifi you cannot download any content. You have to pre-download what you want on the device before you go on a trip or out and about without a wifi connection.
 Our daughter asked for a Kindle Fire for her birthday. We've owned the Nabi and an IPad, so I was curious how this Fire would compare. It operates very smoothly, with no lag. The games my daughter enjoys on our iPad are available on the Fire interface. This tablet met and exceeding my expectations. We ended up purchasing a second for my son for Christmas. The bumper case is a nice detail, and the tablet itself is very lightweight. I honestly prefer this to the Nabi, and my daughter (8) is very happy with the game and app options.
 Bought this as a replacement tablet for my 7 year old . Her old one lasted a year and had a broken screen .. She absolutely loves her fire tablet . Seems very sturdy. I love that she has unlimited access to books and apps . I'm glad I purchased it .
 Bought this to replace my 5 yr. old's Naby, and he absolutely loves it.  He can play so many games and use it to watch his favorite shows on Netflix.  The only complaint I really have is the limited internal storage.  However, I just bought a SD card to give it more storage, and we were good to go.  Shipping was fast, since I used my Prime to get free 2-day, and I think the price is definitely reasonable.
 Parental controls are top notch. Getting it set up with the kids alexa takes some doing but it wasn't unbearable. The girfriend's kid loves it and asks for it every day. You I'll need to have your personal account on the tablet in order to control it efficiently and make changes so choose a really good password. Battery life has been horrible but that may be because there is something running in the background I havent found yet, we just leave it plugged in as we limit his exposure anyways to avoid being dependant on technology/phones as so many kids are nowadays. The games are fun and entertaining, and they have a large library of downloads. It does have a camera so the kids can take pictures. Seems very durable, which was my number one concern as this kid breaks everything, lol.
 I have never had a bad experience wih any purchase I have made on Amazon. I also had a non-kid Kindle Fire HD with ZERO issues foe 3 years. The only reason that I no longer use it is because it was dropped without tge cover and that killed it. :( However, I went against what a lot of other reviewers were saying about these kids tablets and purchased two for my kids for Christmas last year. That was December. At the end of February I already had to use the warranty and send one in because the battery no longer charged. They replaced it with no issues so that was nice. However, 2 months later and it looks like I have to send the other one in for the same reason!! Also, the storage space is horrible as is the camera quality. So disappointing. I wish I could go back and juat get regular Kindles and put the parental controls on it. Dont waste your money!!
 We have had 3 of these tablets. The first one lasted 8 months before it wouldn't charge anymore. We got a second one and returned it to the store within 6 days because it kept saying "oops something went wrong ". I was able to return it to the store and exchange for another one.  Within one week I was returning that one too as it kept freezing up and no matter how many times you tapped the apps nothing would open. Returned his one too and got my money back. Will never buy one of these again.
 It worked fine for 4 months. Then it stopped working and Tech supported tried to helo me solve the issue. The tablet was not charging and would not turn on at all. I retuned it and I waited a whole month until I had to speak to Tech support again to get a full refund because they just wanted to give me. $70 dll credit. It was a terrible experience. Its sad because i was looking forward to get another Fire tablet but no. Not like this.
 Good tablet. But they updated the freetime software which takes away the app carousel which allowed you to only give access to certain apps for your child and gives them access to all of the apps which is very stupid on their part. Amazon told me I just had to deal with it which it's for my 2 year old son he cant have that kind of access.. cant even let him play with his Christmas present with. Thanks amazon..
 Concerned my 6 year old nephew was not getting good hands-on exposure to technology, I purchased this for him. I could not find a better tool than this offering by Amazon. 1 Year of Freetime, 2 Year Free Replacement warranty, for under a $100. With over 10,000 selections of Books, Apps, Videos for his age group, and clear, simple Parental Controls. It's a small investment for a child's future.
 The tablet is not used friendly. It's takes a bit of time for setup. I purchase this tablet so my child could download the disney now app.  Each time we try to open the app it says "bummer.....". The unlimited time is terrible. Those apps take forever. I've had a fire tablet in the pass, but this was a waste of money.  Just spend the extra and get the better product.
 The tablet worked fine and was easy to set up. But there isn’t a very good selection of apps to pick from. Most of them aren’t educational in any way. It can’t be used at all if you aren’t connected to wifi. I tried to download episodes of tv shows on Netflix and I couldn’t even access those while offline. If your kid wants to play dress up games while sitting on the couch then this is for you. If not, don’t bother.
 I have purchased many Kindles and all the charging port seems to lose up and not hold the charger after a couple of uses. Very poor design. Customer service was able to replace this one since it was in the warranty time frame. My other one was over the warranty  by 2 month and could not be replaced. Customer service said that the newest version has a updated charging port. Happy this has been changed.
 I bought this for my 4 y/o to use primarily offline (because I didn’t want him using all our limited internet) and at first we loved it! Then 5 days after we got it there was an update and it completely ruined the offline homepage! The update took away the tabs/categories that separated everything and now all the apps, games, videos and books were jumbled together in one messy page! I called customer service (the woman I spoke to was very nice 👍🏾) and she told me that unfortunily this was now the offline homepage. They realized now that it wasn’t a good idea but it couldn’t be corrected until the next update and that would be months away. So I was stuck with a tablet that my child had no interest in because he couldn’t tell what was games or books or videos. DONT BUY UNLESS YOU PLAN TO LEAVE IT ONLINE ALL THE TIME!
 I have bought many Kindles. I think they are perfect for all ages. However, I am not a fan of this one. I like the case and the protection it offers. The kindle itself is similar to the rest. But the unlock button isn’t so easy. It takes a couple of swipes to unlock it. You are able to switch between kid mode and adult mode with just a password. There has been many problems with accessing the apps that are already downloaded when you are not around WiFi.
 The timed based parental controls are amazing. I love that you can set time limits on usage, and that your child has to earn time to play games by reading books and so on. I only wish that you could prevent them from downloading apps or games. Durability wise, it is top notch. Our four year old gets mad at it at times and chucks it across the room, of course he looses his privilege with it when that happens, but it happens.
 I love that i can trust whats on here and see what they are doing and knowing they are not seeing or buying anything without me knowing. i love the case it comes in and as for the batter life well its ok it works it dose die after 3 to 4 hours of on it strat but kids love it. i love that it has a worry free 2 year and kids games lots to pick from. I will be buying a 2nd one if i need too.
 I don’t know why my wife and I didn’t buy this tablet sooner! It’s amazing! The only thing I’d recommend parents buying for it is a screen protector. The tablet was super easy to sync to my Prime account. The toddler proof case that comes with it has already survived several drops by the 4 year old. We couldn’t be more happy with this purchase.
 Got this for our 7 y.o. granddaughter and she loves it. Something we didn't realize when we bought it was everything she downloads comes thru as an Amazon purchase so we know exactly what she is downloading. There are hundreds of $0.00 download books and games. We have 3 kindles and hers has more of a protective frame on it that we also like. This is no toy. This is a nice mini pad. Great purchase on our part.
 This is the 3rd kindle tablet that is gifted to my kids. They broke 2 because it's very difficult for a 7 year old to come to Daddy every time that the tablet need to be charged. As they try to plug it in in the wrong way, and AMAZON keeps designing this KIDS tablets with this ridiculous plugs year after year... Plug it in the wrong way and it's broken!<br/>Now the kids are totally prohibited to try and plug them themselves, and we have to be doing it for them all the time. Can't believe that AMAZON hasn't yet figure out a way of a plug (like most new devices) that can be inserted in either direction. BIG FAIL GUYS.
 So far it's great!  Gave as a gift to our 6 year old because of the very stringent parental controls.  Has a start and end time during the day, we can limit his time for specific activities, limit content, and require him to read books for specific time periods before accessing games or videos.
 We are on our third tablet and also the ability to add free time to another device has been an issue.  The tablet doesn't allow you to kill all running programs and it's slow response time is annoying.  I regret giving away out Tab A as it was a better tablet and hope if this one dies they allow me to upgrade at a pro-rated fee to newer device.
 Ordered this Item for my 3 year old god Christmas 2018..... Opened it on Christmas Eve! It wouldn’t work 2weeks later!  Put in for a return to card! Never received a refund after 3 weeks later! System stated product on the way... Which means it was picked up by ups and showed in Amazon system but I never received a refund! That’s what I call getting over on loyal customers!
 The tablet itself is great.  I love the way that I can set up profiles for each child and limit what they can see. My kids love it.  However, the sole purpose that I bought the tablet was so that my kids could use the ABC mouse (I will be writing a review for them as well).  I did finally get the main page of ABC mouse to work on the tablet, however the add on apps that you can use while offline are not available from the store.  I do not like that all the apps in Freetime are required to be connected to the internet.  I am going to have to search more and see if there are other apps that I can download that they can use offline.  I haven't decided if I am going to keep it or look for an android tablet so I can access the play store and not be so limited to Amazon apps.
 The kids loved it first bought a blue and pink one for my 6 yr old twins birthday. It's been 3 months. My son's just hums and dies and my daughter's won't take a charge at all. It was really awesome at first. Lots of room for apps. Great screen clarity. The camera was grainy and horrible. But I kind of expected that for a kids tablet honestly. Overall I liked it but am just disappointed it didn't last longer.
 Absolutely wonderful. Very easy to use. I would suggest buying the memory card with it. My daughter is 3 has had it since she was two. It’s phenomenal I would highly recommend. Lots of parenting options on it as wel!
 I bought for my 4yr old that was not an everyday user of his tablet. I would have given 5 stars but the tablet completely stopped taking a charge after just 14 months. The warranty had just expired in 12th month which was Nov. 2018. Prior, the tablet worked well, no issues, love the parental controls. So many options for kids of all ages just dont like how it didnt last long.
 This Kids Fire would not charge after three months use.  After sending an email to CS I was informed I would have to speak to an agent.  The first one had to forward me on to one in Kindle support then this one sent me on to a Kindle tech.  Each of these were a five to ten minute wait and explain the problem again.  I hope my problem is finally solved but I still have to take this to the UPS store and then wait for repair or replacement.  This procedure could definitely use some fine tuning.
 We had an iPad for 4 years before it finally gave out, and this was recommended by another family friend, she loves the books, and the games, she also found on her own how to watch the amazon kids videos &amp; shows! well worth the money, charge stays for days before getting low. the case is heavy duty for a kid, and easy enough to take off to add a memory card or another type of case.
 At first the tablet was great. We were able to limit the time and what content our kid could see. Then there was an update in November that opened up all sorts of content like a suggestion tab and trending and all kinds of apps and content you can't hide. The only option is to manually block the thousands of apps in the Amazon store. Another issue,  if you leave your child's profile signed in. If you have the parental control on to limit the time it will say the kids profile had used up the allotted time for the day, even if the tablet had not been used for days or even turned on.  Often it will require you to turn the tablet on and off multiple times and you will have your password burned into your memory after you have entered it for the millionth time. I am looking into if I can return the tablet now.
 I bought three of these for my three kids. All of them lasted around three months before we started having some issues. First we would get notices about critically low storage. I got around this by resetting them to factory defaults, but then I would have to reload everything onto them. This worked for another month, but then the critically low storage notification came up again. When I reset to factory settings this time, they just don’t register at all. It says authentication failure. I know technology won’t last forever, especially with kids. But, I thought they would last more than four months.
 My mom got this for our 2 year old for Christmas. We were really hoping for it to at least meet our needs for videos and toddler games because it is affordable but....It doesn’t respond. It doesn’t shut off. When he tries to play games the side bar doesn’t go away so he’s constantly hitting it and the game disappears so it just frustrates him constantly and becomes an aggravation for me instead of helping. My 8 year old has the 10 and it’s okay but the quality is just not there. I love amazon but these are disappointing.
 My kid is loving this so far. Definitely gonna get freetime once the year is up hopefully they will do a deal on it instead of only 3 bucks a month or w.e, but all around so far this product is amazing. I got it on sale for 80 so it made it even better. (:, And the worry free two year warranty is amazing cause I might end up.needing that my son is destructive lol
 I purchased this item for my daughter as a Christmas gift. We set it up Christmas Day and 5 months later the tablet no longer works. I called customer support who attempted to trouble shoot the problem over the phone with no luck. The tablet will no longer turn on. There is no physical damage. We chose this tablet due to the “worry free guarantee 2 year replacement” that was adverstised. After speaking with several customer service representatives, I was told we would have to send the tablet in for repair which could take several weeks. Had I known this I would not have purchased. The tablet itself was good when it worked however I would have expected longer then 5 months use.
 First, let me say that the the stars represent an average, Amazon itself gets just one~two stars. We bought a two-pack of kids' 7" fire tablets for $145 for our grandkids, and you can't beat the bang for the buck. They're not top-of-the-line, but at $72.50, who would expect that. IMO You get more than you pay for. But, Amazon does a horrendous job setting these up to be easily configured if you are anywhere outside the "parent (who has an Amazon account) buying for their own kids," norm. If your situation is anything but that, do yourself a favor and just call, or "chat," with Customer Svc before you do anything. It took quite awhile to get everything straight on both units (and I'm pretty tech savvy), but both Customer Svc reps I worked with were knowledgeable and patient. Five Stars for the reps I had, five stars for value, and between one and two stars for Amazon and their inadequate set-up for handling (what they believe as) non-typical purchases.<br/><br/>*Update 12/17/17: Amazon tech support has since contacted me to follow-up with my experience and the resolution. They have also granted a generous rebate to help compensate for my trouble, which I did not request. Rate that as you will, but follow-up after the sale is important to me. I once had a supervisor tell me that having an issue with a customer is an opportunity to build customer loyalty, provided you handle it to, or beyond their satisfaction, and/or, expectations. Their ultimate resolution exceeds my expectations, but I stand by my previous advice, and rating.
 We bought this item for our son and he really likes it. It’s nice that it has apps and games that are educational. My only problem (and it’s enough to drop the rating to 2 stars) is that the battery life doesn’t seem to last. I’d understand if it was because he was on it for long periods at a time, but that’s not when I notice the battery drained. It’s when it’s not being used that I notice it drains the quickest. If I don’t have it charging the battery drains even if not in use. For example, It was at 60% last night but when I went to go use it this morning it was completely dead. I’ve turned the screen brightness way down and turned on power saving mode but it hasn’t helped.  I really like the idea behind this product and my son really likes it too, but I just wish we weren’t battling battery life.
 Pretty good tablet. I like how you can restricted the kid's usage, time or when they can use it. All 4 kids have a Fire, their ages are 2, 4 5 and 7 years. They can download preapproved videos, apps or movies themselves as well as access preapproved websites. I was a bit confused on how to download new items for their usage. I first had to download them to my screen and then add to theirs.
 Love this! My 3-year old is easily using his tablet and playing fun educational games, downloading great books and watching age-appropriate videos. I love being able to view what he's doing on there and being able to set limits with FreeTime. I don't have to worry about him making purchases without my permission! The case is so tough and durable, perfect for kids! All 3 of my kids have one, in 3 different colors and love their tablets!
 We have these for our three children.  This was a gift for our 3 year old.  The only issues that we ever had with them were charger connection issues, because kids tend to be rough on the ports.  We solved this buy purchasing magnetic port chargers on Amazon.  Have had our other two tablets for over a year with zero port issues now.  The cases are built tough, but if yours does break, it's hassle free to replace it for up to 2 years!
 My daughter has certainly enjoyed her tablet over the past year of having it. She got it for Christmas 2017... No doubt just after a year later the Freetime subscription ends, takes the few games she plays away (I refuse to pay 36 bucks a year for her to have access to the same 5 games she always plays, which I thought were downloaded on the tablet anyway, but conveniently disappeared when the subscription ended....) That's not the main problem though.  As I said, the warranty just expired because we've had the tablet just over one year, and NOW the charging port has gone bad. Not one of my 20 chargers in the house will charge this tablet and now I have a paperweight.  When I go to look the problem up, I see that I am far from being alone in this issue.<br/><br/>I am not a solderer, I do not take things apart or get computer technical with hardware.  I cannot just order the part and fix it myself.  I was hoping Amazon would like to maybe hook me up and put a new port in for me. But no.  Guess I'll be taking my business back to Apple. At least I'm guaranteed a good charge and a fix if needed.
 Received the kindles and instantly knew they were defective. The we’re taking forever to set up, their running speed was extremely slow and their interface is poorly designed. Had two replacements sent which had the exact same problems. Returning all of them. It’s worth the money to get an iPad instead. The kindles are garbage and so is Amazon customer service.
 This is the 2nd Kids Edition Tablet that I've purchased.  The first one was riddled with performance issues as well, but the apps are amazing and my daughter absolutely loved it.  It died a little over a year later and I reluctantly decided to purchase a 2nd one but this time I included the additional SD card hoping that would help.  We started experiencing performance issues within 3 months and sent it back to Amazon for repair during month 5.  The Amazon customer service response was poor.  Save your money, it's not worth the constant frustration your kids will have dealing with this device that performs inconsistently after 1-2 months at best.  I would have been better off spending a little more for 1 reliable device that my child could enjoy for years.
 I bought both my nephews a Kids Kindle Fire for their 6th and 8th birthdays and they both love them! Their parents love them also because they have so much more control over the content they are using and the time they spend either playing games, reading or watching videos and for that they have become Kindle lovers themselves!
 I bought 2 of these in 2017 for gifts.  One quit charging within a few months.  The 2nd one has now quit charging also.  Looking through the reviews this seems to be a common problem.  I got the 1st one replaced easily.  Just had to send it back in.  Getting ready to contact them for the 2nd one, but getting nervous reading these reviews on  the troubles others had with replacing it.  After I finally found how to contact someone I had absolutely no troubles getting it replaced.  I will send it out Monday and hopefully get a return in 5 days.
 Absolutely love the Fire 7 Kids Edition. You can set it up as a regular kindle or you can create multiple users on the kids screen. Makes it easy for you to control what your child is  doing and keep an eye on them right from your own Kindle without even messing with theirs. You can set time limit of how long they can be on it before it shuts off wether it be the internet or a game you are in complete control. Plus if something happens to it you get a two year replacement guarantee which is an added bonus.
 I am super disappointed. I purchased this product just over a year ago, it is very rarely used, and it has already stopped working. This is the second Kindle Fire I've had where the charging port stopped holding a charging cable. The first one died, so I opted to upgrade and buy a new tablet. But here we are again and I just can not afford to keep upgrading these.<br/>My attempts to contact and get a response have been unsuccessful.
 It’s a wonderful tablet just bought it for my Goddaughter for her December Birthday. I totally believe kindle is the best child tablet out there. Between the ability to download apps &amp; easy child friendly navigation throughout the tablet makes it a wonderful choice. I’ve already bought my 3children a tablet &amp; it’s the best choice everytime
 I am giving this a 3-star because of three things:<br/>1. Really slow.  one has to wait for quite a while for a video or book to open up.  (maybe I am more used to ipad speed).<br/>2. It would have been great if there is youtube kid app included in this device.<br/>3. The one that I bought for my daughter, who is usually gentle with her things, is broken after only 3 months' use.<br/>I got a refund, and I have not yet place another order to replace, and I probably won't.
 I am trying to download one episode of Daniel Tigers Neighborhood and it has been trying for 6 hours on wifi and it hasn't worked. This is very disappointing since that is my son's favorite show. We bought this for purposes of travel and entertainment and it isn't measuring up.
 My 5 year old son loved this gift.  He loved it so much that I had to go in and put limits on how often he could play it.  I'm not sure that I would purchase it again though.  After a year, it just completely stopped working.  It will not even turn on.  I tried using different cords to charge it and that worked for about a month but now it just flat out doesn't work.
 Great for kids. If you’re going to hand a device to a child - it had better be disposable or at least inexpensive and relatively safe. The kids kindle features are fantastic. The games are fun and engaging. I love that you can limit up time and kindle is the only device that supports multiple user accounts so when the kids are done you can read books or do other things on your own profile.
 My son loves this tablet but he’s had it less than a month and it’s already broken.  The charging port is loose and will not charge so I don’t think this product is as “kid proof” as they advertise.  However, the warranty process is very easy and quick and their associate was very helpful.  I did buy the 2 tablet deal and so far there have been no issues with the other one. They were easy to set up and very easy for kids to use.  I am overall happy with it but had to take 1 star off this review for how quickly it broke.  Hopefully there will be no more issues after this.
 I had an issue where the battery would go from 100% to 40% overnight, while not in use. The device was no more than 4 months old. I thought it was a physical battery issue, but Amazon Live Chat told me that the Wi-Fi drains the battery and I must turn it off while not in use to avoid this.<br/><br/>In other words, yeah, the battery on these devices is crap and they're aware of it.<br/><br/>On top of that, the device is not very easy to navigate. In order to install apps, you need to log in to the admin account (the child cannot download Free games themselves). It's not the best device for kids if you just want to give it to them and go.
 My daughter LOVES her Fire Kids tablet! The only true downside is that when it is being played on the battery life is HORRIBLE. It’s worth it for the cost at the time but opposed to the lenova tablet my son has the battery life on this one is nonexistent. I do love that it’s connected to my Amazon acct. I only wish the battery life was better.
 We absolutely love these tablets we bought one in June for our oldest whos 4 and just bought one for our 2 yr old for trips we only allow learning games and we do allot of books. We love that it's age appropriate content for them. It does get lound so I'd invest in head phone we blocked internet from the kids and I love the parental controls
 I ordered these in December 2018. It's April and they still work perfectly despite plenty of drops! We used these to fly and drive several hours, keeps my autistic child distracted in Walmart, holds charge for several hours, and has easily customizable settings. You can also have your own profile, and boom it becomes like a regular tablet!
 Best $50 EVER SPENT. EVER. Purchased on "Prime Day" so got a great deal. Our almost three year old didn't really need it but for the price and trying to get her away from wanting my phone, I figured it was worth a try. She is obsessed with this and loves that she has her own "iPad" like her big brother. I was skeptical because of the pre-loaded items and the having to be connected to wi-fi issue (versus cellular), but it has worked out fine.
 I bought this on Prime day and should have bought two! My boys ages 10, 8 and 5 would LOVE it. Update: So about 6 months later, the tablet stopped charging.  I contacted amazon and the customer service was very helpful.  I sent in the defective tablet with their shipping label, and within the week they had sent me a refurbished replacement.
 This is the third kindle fire we have purchased. I bought this one to replace one for my son because of a bad charging port. Imagine my surprise that this has the same issue within 6 months of purchase. It never plugs in correctly because the port is loose.  We use for travel and emergencies shopping and at restaurants but just not reliable... Also, battery life is pathetic. We can’t wait forChristmas to give our kids iPads and move on. Never again will I buy a Kindle product.
 We love these tablets. We have 4 kids, and now each one has a fire tablet. The case is surprisingly durable. We haven’t had any cracked screens or anything. After trying other “kid friendly” tablets, this one has been a dream. The case also makes it easier for little hands to keep a good grip on. I also love that you have access to amazon underground - where you can get free games and apps. I let the kids pick out a new game each week, and there is always plenty of variety. Battery life is great. The screen is a good size with clear graphics. The only problems we have are with the chargers wearing out - but that’s not a problem with the tablet as such.
 It is not as user friendly as I thought it would be. We have had a lot of problems with it. It also does not have a lot of memory, so my son filled it up fast! Now he cannot do anything else new, without deleting the games he enjoys. It is remarkably lightweight. When we picked up the box, we thought it was empty! The case is a bright yellow color, which makes my son SUPER happy!
 This tablet has everything a parent and kid could possibly want. I get to set the age-range, time limits and he gets to play like he has it all under control, you know the typical "me do it!" mumbo jumbo our kids say. Now, it does take some effort to keep enough space open for EVERYTHING they HAVE to download. Meaning, I have to go in and uninstall games or books that look super awesome to them but totally hate after .5 seconds. There is a slot for a SD card which I have not utilized. Oh, and it does work without wifi, something I'd have to ask my 4 year old how to do. Fyi.. the protective case is dog proof! I'm buying my rug rat another one right now because after 2.5 years he finally broke something on it..the charging port. He shed many tears and we may have to have a proper funeral.
 Bought it as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. Worked great, until it stopped charging mid February. Now it won't turn on at all. Return/help window closed Jan 31 and it stopped working around valentines day. No help or response from company. Disappointed that a great gift turned out to be crap.
 Got this for the kids and it's prone to crashing, wifi drops, and generally poor functionality. It's operating system is half as user intuitive as Apple's.<br/><br/>Now the safety case is a 5 star addition that I wish they made for iPads. But as I paid for the kindle fire, I'm giving a poor review based on that!
 As far as I am concerned this is the best tablet for toddlers, my granddaughter loves the fact that that she has her own tablet and in pink, and that she doesn't have to borrow her grandfathers' tablet.. She already knows how to find her favorite shows, and sing along with them.  Thank you Amazon for this wonderful product.
 Overall it meets our needs, but compared to the ipad our kids were used to it, it is very slow to load. Also, being an apple user it def is an adjustment to learn and use. I havent found the games to be a great fit for my 4 yr old. We are still trying to find games she can do without needing to read directions. I feel she needs my help much more on this device than our ipad.
 I really want to like the tablet because the replacement program is so generous.  The thing is that the tablet itself is only okay.  It restricts you to only use the Amazon app store which is far inferior to the google app store.  The c=second problem that I have is that the charging port is very very weak.  I have had to have the tablet replace a couple of times because the port becomes loose and will no longer charge.  Amazon will replace the tablet, but after the third time I got tired of going through the replacement process,
 So we ordered this on Amazon, did not receive it. Called and explained my problem and ended up going to Bestbuy for the purchase. My son goes everywhere with this. He tosses it all the time and it still holds up. This thing is a life saver when you need to occupy your kid for a few minutes. Though I wish the battery life was better and the charge time wasn't so slow.

Today, he chose an app Amazon.com recommended for his age-group to develop fundamental problem solving skills. I attribute Jack's love of learning primarily to these new technologies.
 I really like the fact that my 3 year old has been able to use this device without breaking it! He’s already tossed this tablet twice and the screen did not crack, the case that comes with it , offers great protection to this device. I algo love that there’s tons of educational options for him. If you’re debating on wether to buy your toddler, an iPad or this Amazon fire , there’s no doubt about it, you should go with this Amazon fire  tablet !<br/>The price is right ; unlimited access to apps and case included. Plus 2 year protection included ! Apples iPad can’t offer that nor gurantee their screen won’t break after a toddler throws/drops it.
 This tablet routinely flickers, and will not stop until you shut it down; this is an awful tablet. It also requires payment information be entered just to get it running, which is very sketchy (and sadly, now typical of Amazon greed). A child is using this...why do you need payment information?<br/><br/>Terrible product.
 I’m an Apple user so anything new just throws me off. So right off the bat I need to Declutter all of the apps or get more storage, the battery seems to die fast, even when not in use. But the reason I put the 4 stars is because I’ve been able to just hand it over and not really worry about what my kid is seeing because it’s all set up for her age. I still want to tweak some things but until I figure it out, it’s working great!
 I absolutely LOVE this tablet for my 4yr old (i use it occasionally too). I bought it in January of this year, and now all of a sudden it wont keep a charge. I had it charging for over 6hours and the highest percentage it reached was 24%. My kid is really upset because he has to sit right next to the charger to play on it or he can use it for 30mins before the battery runs out. So that means he cant take it to anyone elses house or play with it on the way to go somewhere. (We never leave it out in the car or expose it to water/heat/cold)
 This tablet is certainly designed for kids.<br/><br/>However, the Kid's profile is extremely confusing. I needed to teach my wife and daughter exactly how to get to the profile, since it kept asking them for my Amazon password instead.<br/><br/>If you know this is supposed to be a Kids tablet, you should have access to the Kids profile by default and easy. Only a "special button" or something of the sort should be used to access the parent's Amazon account.<br/><br/>Not happy...
 we wore really exited about this purchase but end up disappointed. we did not get this for kids to be entertained at house, we got it mostly for a car on long drives, and all travels and that become more of night mare then help. at 1st we didn't know you have to upload in cloud space to be able to use it.  once  we did that, most apps wouldn't show picture of what it is, would show just a square, our kids are ages that they don't ready so they keep asking me to get apps on, what is not helpful for parents, also sometimes apps would work sometimes not what end up making kids more irritable and less pleasant to travel with..
 This is great for the kids! The case is sturdy and survives small drops. It is nice to have the protection if something happens to it. One of our kids devices got a crack in the screen and Amazon replaced it quickly-without any hassle! I like the year free of Freetime. You can set up different kid's accounts and limit the amount of time they are on there. Kids can play games, watch shows, and read books from there. This is much better than letting them go on YouTube and end up watching something that is not age appropriate.
 Kids Kindle was purchased for my son and he cannot access any sites, books or applications.  We have purchased several Kindle Fires over the years and this is the first time we have ever had a problem with any Amazon device.  We are going to return the product to see if it is an isolated incident or if Amazon’s quality control has process cannot up with supply and demand.
 My kids are pretty rough with everything and this tablet has been through a lot and is still in perfect working order.  My son dropped it over a2nd story staircase balcony and I watched as it bounced off the floor and survived perfectly.  Very happy with this purchase.  We are almost at a year of ownership and it works wonderfully.
 The only thing I don't like is that you can't use the parental controls for his device from my device. Like,  say, HYPOTHETICALLY,  his device automatically linked to Amazon and HYPOTHETICALLY he purchased some games and apps. If you were at work, your only option is to delete your ow n payment options until you get this thing out of his hands.  I would have loved the opportunity to set him an allowance or be able to remove his access to my payments from my phone. Luckily,  in this totally fictional example,  he spent a very conservative $2. Other t hands that, he loves it so I love it.
 Return policy is not accurate my device is having issues, im well within the exchange policy. They have no interest in replacing it. I expressed that the apps were slow to respond or completely non responsive. Instructed to do a factory reset. Unfortunately due to low battery that wasnt an option. However a factory reset would delete everything. There would be no way to know if the apps were not opening.
 My son had a nabi for years. The batteries never lasted. I was hesitant to buy a fire because it doesn't have Google apps like youtube kids. However for the price this is a steal. Tons of storage for an amazing cost. The battery lasts forever. Plus freetime is amazing. Tons of free included apps. My only gripe is it needs to stay in kid mode. It immediately goes to parent mode when restarted.  Otherwise it's a great deal.
 Didn't even have the tablets for a day and already having issues. Can't get them past the set up screen. Contacted customer service and support and they can't figure it out either. They suggested sending out replacement devices but are having trouble with that too. I can understand if it's just a faulty device but I purchased two tablets and the same issue is happening to both. Really skeptical about the fire brand now. Worst part about it is I was supposed to give these to my kids yesterday for a important personal family issue and I wasn't able to. Now I don't know when. Really disappointed and I still don't have a resolution
 Everything about FreeTime is just about perfect. I love all the ways I can customize my kids’ experiences and what they can access. However, the battery life is really bad; even with WiFi and Bluetooth turned off I think we average 5 hours or less off a full charge. And heaven-forbid we forget to plug it in over night with the WiFi on, consistently a loss of 50% battery or more.<br/>Overall, my kids really enjoy it, but I have no expectations that it would last long during any sort of travel.
 I already had one, so I already knew what to expect, but having a second one now prevents the kids from fighting over who gets to play on them.  The apps are great--ranging from books to games and learning, you can easily set up parental controls and you get your own pin protected profile where you can do everything an android tablet does along with doing your own kindle reading.  I would recommend this for kids over any of the other tablets out there.  The protector is great, it has handled several drops already and the 2 year Amazon you break it and we'll take it back no questions asked gives a lot of peace of mind.
 PURCHASED FOR MY GRANDAUGHTER LAST DECEMBER FOR XMAS GIFT. STOPPED WOKING OUT OF THE BLUE, OK WITH THE 2 YR WARRANTY THE TAB LET WAS RETURNED FOR EITHER REPAIR OF REPLACEMENT, AMAZON SAID CANNOT BE REPAIRED SHIPPED REPLACEMENT SOMEHOW GOT LOST IN TRANSIT. NOW I WAS REFUNDED BUT PROBLEM TABLET IS $20 MORE THAN WHAT I ORIGINALLY PD. I NEED TO REBUY AT ORIGINAL PRICE. THIS IS UNFAIR AND CRAZY!!
 Excellent screen quality. Set up was easy especially if you dont mind registering the device to you. In my case this meant my kids three free time profiles transfwrred over automatically. The downside is I only boughy this for 1 child so i don't need all of those profiles and as it stands it resembles my kindle more than being just my daughter's.  The other downside which wasn't clear when I ordered was that Alexa is not enabled on the child profiles.<br/>Other than  that we love it so far and the year of free time unlimited is great!
 warranty B.S. no reply they dont seem to care,that they broke down,kids odnt have their gift,I want my money back!!!!!!!!!! I will come and bitch,and bitch,,,,,
 My 9 year old daughter loves this; and I don't have to worry about her watching something that she shouldn't be watching. I love that it came pre-loaded with tons of games and children's TV networks. The only thing that could be better is if it came with a stand that she could perch it up and watch it without holding it. Other than that, it is a great way to keep kids from being bored, and there is a lot of good educational content. I definitely recommend it!
 Painfully slow, freezes constantly. Can't understand the interface and it seems to be built around being connected to the internet all the time(the is no way to make online content icons not show up if you're offline)...<br/>People who built this OS and apps clearly never used it or just don't care.<br/>On the bright side... It is kind of indestructible and works ok for movies.
 I love this product because i am confident that my child can navigate this on his own while staying within his age group. This has SO many videos he can watch, games to play, and books to read. Games and books can be accessed without WiFi so great for long car rides. You can also download some videos that are available to watch for 48 hours while not connected to WiFi. You can change the age group your child is in to grow with their interests. The case is a live saver. The only thing i wish was slightly better was the battery. I have the ability to switch it to a regular tablet if i want to use it for anything. This is a great product for my kid, and a great product for mommy’s sanity! 🤣
 I expected better for the rice, I bought one for each of my kids and they both freeze up a lot and for whatever reason when watching YouTube it has a lot more ads then on my Samsung tablet. The kids do like the apps offered with the free year trial but they aren't that great, there's better ones you can download for free on the App Store. The only good thing about these tablets is the warranty so I don't have to worry about them breaking it but honestly I wish I would've bought them a regular tablet and bought a protector case for it.
 It's a great little tablet but very frustrating that the app icons disappear and you only get a dotted outline for each when you don't have and available wifi making it hard to find the app that you can play without wifi. Made for a lot of screaming from my preschooler on our road trip
 It's a great Tablet, I love the child warranty. This is the 2nd kids fire tablet that we have purchased. We love them. The only downfall is you cant download very many things as the memory isn't very high. It comes with a full year of freetime that is wonderful. You can easily control what content your children can be exposed to. I definitely recommend this tablet. You wont be disappointed.
 These are a pain to set up. Make sure you charge them, buy a memory card, be prepared to pay for Amazon Freetime -which I did not know, and if you want your grown up apps/music/etc on them, that can be a pain when setting up more than one. As far as parental use, I wish they made it easier. For the kids, it's easy.
 This has been a great tablet loved the idea of 2 year return no questions asked but... I can't figure out how to return it and am having no help with support. I won't take a charge anymore!!
 It's fast with no lag or delay. YOU CAN NOT DOWNLOAD GOOGLE APPS. I was bummed out because I didn't realize youtube kids app was a Google app. That was my main reason for getting my kids this tablet because they like youtube kids. Amazon apps has a video kids app but it has low ratings. However they really enjoy the games.<br/>For the most part it's easy to switch to adult and kid accounts and to use the settings.
 Took my 2yr old about 15 min to dive into exploring this tablet and she LOVES it.  The amount of kid-friendly material that came pre-loaded, and the fact that it comes with the case AND 2yr no-questions-asked warranty were my deciding factors.<br/><br/>Only downside is the time it takes to download the material to the tablet itself - we all know 2yr old's have zero patience.  I should've waited until bedtime to get it all ready and given it to her tomorrow ready to go.
 Awesome for kids! Very durable and nice interface!
 I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old grandson. He had a very cheap tablet with a 4" display that he loved. I knew I was taking a chance when I bought it for him at Christmas but I went ahead with the purchase. He loves it and wants to use it all the time, however, he isn't allowed to. He uses it in his crib or while sitting in the living room. It does not hold a charge real long but not bad--anyway I am happy with my purchase and so is my grandson. So far so good
 Up until November 2018, we loved the tablet. However, with the latest update, the tablet has become nothing more than a paperweight. When my child is using freetime, about every 30 minutes an “oops something went wrong” message appears and the only way to get rid of the message is to reboot the entire device. Not only had this been happening every 30 minutes, but the battery drains SUPER fast since the last update as well. My daughters tablet used to last a few days without being charge but now we will only last a few hours. This is a problem effecting almost every amazon freetime user and despite complaints it has been over a month and a half and amazon still has not fixed the issue.  I will never again buy an amazon product.
 This is a good product for kids.  The low review is for the no questions asked replacement promise.  My daughters stopped charging/working for no apparent reason, after 7 months.  We tried all the troubleshooting suggestions with no success.  We thought no problem!  It took two phone calls, about an hour on hold to finally get the replacement on the way.  The second time I was told that because it was out of the 30 day warranty period, it wasn’t eligible!?  So, I had to go through several, non English speaking, “supervisors.”  FINALLY, got a new one on the way.
 This was a replacement PURCHASE after the charging portal would no longer charge on my granddaughter's original Kindle, which was slightly over 1 year old. We searched high and low for instructions about exchanging the tablet through their HIGHLY ADVERTISED NO Qs ASKED replacement policy which closed the purchase deal for us--only to conclude that there ARE no instructions to be found because they don't exist. I really hate being lied to.
 Every single device I’ve gotten as a replacement and the original device itself has had problems. Either books won’t load, games won’t load programs don’t stay in the devices memory, or the device won’t charge at all. I like the idea of having a device specifically for kids , but the execution of this product is horrible.
 I got both my niece and nephew the kid tablets when Amazon had their black Friday sale going so they could have their own tablets they both love them but yet both complain which it's also a concern to me. I had set them up so they get 3 hours a day and it's weird if they leave them on or like when you plug them in to charge them they automatically turn on and even though the kids aren't on them as long as the tablets are on it runs their 3 hours out. Not sure if there is a way to fix this issues.
 Bought it for 18 month old. He loves it. Unfortunately it is confusing for adults on how to share some videos and programs for kids. Usually I have to sign in on mine and let him watch it, which sort of defeats the purpose. Some videos and applications will not move to storage card, making space on tablet sparse. Especially the preloaded ones. It is durable in its case.
 Great price, somewhat buggy in kids mode. I hate the fact that the kids can turn wifi on and off along with some other device settings. Very slow, at least in kids mode.  Search functionality (in kids mode) is terrible.  My kids love these, but I get very annoyed that I have to keep managing settings they should not be able to access and fixing freezing/bug issues.
 My toddler loves this tablet and she's only 2 ! She loves watching the songs and trying to sing with them ! We were a little leary about buying a child so young a tablet but she loved using mommy's cell phone to go to Pandora. Now she can listen to age appropriate songs and watch age appropriate shows. Love it !
 Awesome kid tablet. Got a great deal on it. Love the case and love that there is no ads. It can be glitchy at times but overall I am very please with this tablet.....<br/>Update just had to call Amazon the tablet just stop charging all of sudden and they sent me a brand new one with no question asked in less then a week. Awesome customer service unlike eBay were no one speaks English.
 The device works fine, a little sluggish but works well for the kids. The absolute worst part about this tablet is the charger. After about a week it will go bad, I’m now on my 4th tablet with the same problem, and you have to set up the cable to be angled in a certain direction for it to charge. It also falls out incredibly easily, making it impossible to charge while using it.<br/><br/>I’ve got two of the fire kids tablets and both have been sent back for the charging problems just to come back and have the same problem a week later.
 There is very little on this device that you can remove.  It has great parental controls on its apps, but I do not like the fact that you can't remove the Silk browser, Alexa, or just purchase individual apps.  You must pay for FreeTime in order to use the device.  It's the difference between Apple Music and Audible books.
 Good tablet for kids. We have six of these and the warranty alone is worth the price, but unexpectedly this foam case makes them very durable even without a screen protector. Ports break with children wiggling usage, but they do on phones adults use too. We've had two screens break due to being stepped on but they replace with no issue as long as they have been added to your Amazon account, so be sure to do that! My son broke his on the way home from the store and it took a long time to get it attached in order to get the warranty replacement.
 I purchased 3 the 7” kids iPads.  The 2 year warranty was a plus as I would not have purchased if I know that the warranty would not be honored.  For the record,<br/>2 of the pads worked great, however, the third unit purchased in January was not opened until early April ..at which time I realized that this unit would not charge<br/>Therefore, if no use to my very disappointed child.<br/>  I am seeking a replacement for this fire 7” kids edition....it is in its original box and totally is “unusable” Rd Please email me a label to return the it.  Juneabee@gmail.com.  Thank you for your help in this matter.
 I love how user friendly this is for my almost 3 year old. All the content is toddler friendly. He has access to books, videos, games, whatever he wants and he is able to navigate it without needing my help. The only thing I wish is that it didn't take so long to load what he wants. He gets impatient sometimes. It seems to just take long the first time you click on the app, like its downloading or something. Overall, we love it!
 So far so good! This is the second kids fire we have and so far they’ve been great I love the free time stuff that’s already on the tablet it keeps my kids occupied during “wind down time” at the end of the day and has tons of options for leading games, shows and more! You can also down load things for when you don’t have WiFi they can still watch and play
 I just bought my second tablet for my younger daughter and I noticed that both tablets were in sync with each other so I wanted to separate the two tablets without deleting my oldest daughters account. When customer service contacted me (Daniel was his name, which I doubt) I was sure to ask him two, if not three times if deleting my oldest daughters profile off the new tablet would delete it from both (because my daughter has 1 1/12 years worth of progress on her tablet in her apps) he said it wouldn't affect it on the other tablet. And guess what, IT PERMANENTLY DELETED IT!!! Now I have to explain to my 8yr old what just happened. Daniel should be properly trained in his field and English if he's going to be in tech support. They offered me $20 credit. Sorry, but $20 isn't enough for the hours on the phone, downloading new apps, and most importantly an upset 8yr old.
 I bought this for my 4 year to play games, listen to music and watch movies while travel and such. It is perfect for the price and what we need to use it for.  I bought another 7in for my 10 year old and an 8in for my 15 year old for the same purpose.  It is so easy to switch users on each tablet and I love the parental controls.  I would recommend this to anyone who just wants a tablet to play around with. It isn't very fast but isnt the slowest tablet we've had either.
 It's a good deal. But we've have gone through over 2p of these between two boys! Like all other the cheating port is junk and just stops working and comes loose. Amazon used to be cool and just send new ones. Now. . . . It takes 2 hours of yelling at 4 yes 4!! Supervisors to get a rapleacement sent out. . . AFTER we mail the old one back. . .. THEN call to ask why the new one hasnt shipped yet. This is more of a chore then it's worth to get replacements.  Hey amazon. . . Fix the damn charging port and your save millions!!!!!
 These are great tablets and the two-pack value is fantastic! I love the kid-friendly colorful cases, the parental controls which allow you to control everything from their time allowed daily on videos, apps, books, audiobooks, and "shutdown" hours when kids should be sleeping. My kids love them and I love that they are set up to make it so easy for parents to create a kid-safe, limited media environment.
 I had originally gotten the kids a refurbished 3rd gen Fire with only 8 GB of internal storage, and no expansion slot.  This quickly filled up with books and apps and we were constantly having to purge old items to make way for new.  With this model I also got a 128 GB micro-SD card and they are loving the experience now.  No more passing the tablet to mom or dad to clear out the storage.  Definitely a win-win for us!
 I give a 3 stars because:<br/>Good things:<br/>1. Easy set up<br/>2. Age limits<br/>3. Easy for my daughter to navigate around<br/>4. Packed full of content<br/>Dislikes:<br/>1. Battery life is horrible, I feel like if it's not being used it better be on the charger<br/>2. Runs extremely slow, and we haven't even had it for 4 months yet<br/>3. Not much space although I knew that upon purchase<br/><br/>If you want a simple tablet for your kid, and it's on sale purchase it. It gets the job done. But I'd still research for another alternative, and if something is better I'd buy that first.
 Bought for my daughter. It's a fully functioning tablet which I guess i didn't realize. Their "kids edition" simply includeds a heavy duty silicone cover. Free time is nice but we still have to activate parental controls. Which can be a bit of a hassle when we just wants to watch cartoons.. We're getting used to it
 I bought this for my 2.5 year old to have on long road trips and when we go out to a sit down meal. She loves it and so do I. Since she's so young I don't let her use it when it's connected to a wifi connection just because she'll go through and download a bunch of random apps and books. I also double check apps once I download them to make sure can play them with out asking for help. Her 2 favorite atre the Disney counting and alphabet games, they are fun and she's learning so it's win win.
 this device is defective.  stops holding a charge after a few months.  after they replaced the first one (under 2 year guarantee replacement) the charge problem has occured on the replacement.  It has happened on the second device that i bought at the same time for my son as well.  They do not have a TRUE 2 year hassle free warranty.
 hmmm, i'm on the fence here...i'd prefer the old ones when we can still download the youtube app... my autistic kids love youtube videos... our old one broke, and we got this replacement, and now we can't have the youtube app... u can still add youtube videos but you have to add them one by one...very time consuming... i'm sure it serves great if your kid is typical....
 This is everything I thought it would be.  No misleading information.  There are tons of free apps and books, and tons more when you have amazon prime.  I love the fact that the content offered is tailored to each kid's age and there are internet controls built in.  I am so relieved that they can look up information about big cats and actually see pictures of Lions and Tigers instead of......well you know.
 I bought this thinking it would help keep my toddler happy while I ran errands and grocery shopped. The damned thing wouldn't work without wifi connection. it was absolutely useless outside of the house. The free time app itself had nice games and what not but they ran slow. so slow that by the time they finally opened my toddler was done with the whole thing entirely. it was work just to get him to sit down and try using it because the apps ran so slow. So I returned it. Took 3 weeks for Amazon to get my return. Now it's going to be 3-5 business days to get my money back. and to top it all off the shipping comes out of my return plus I didn't have a box for it for shipping so that doubled my shipping cost. yay. I don't recommend this tablet.
 good product, just watch for sales and offers. it often costs as much or close to the same price of a fire 8 or other models.<br/><br/>it is prone to component failure as many reviews point out, but is a great value for the money. If you take the time to set it up properly you will avoid many of the content and profile headaches other reviewers have complained about.
 My Son spends hours with this thing everyday.  Everything that can be said has been said but at the end of the day when the Specifications and all the other stuff is put aside the most important thing is how useful and how much fun is the product. This gets a solid 5 Star Rating. Nothing I have bought him before brings him as much joy as this tablet.
 You can't go wrong with these things, and oh, how us parents love the padded exterior! Great job Amazon. We have one of these for all our kids, and they hold up well. They are comfortable to hold, don't break when dropped (within reason of course) and the kids can do anything they need to on there, be it watching videos or playing games. I'm not a fan of the in-game purchases, as I'm not very computer savvy and had some trouble with the adult/child setting controls, but so far so good.
 This thing is absolute garbage. Worst battery life on a device I've seen in the last 20 years. The interface is buggy and laggy at best. A lot of games come up that are meant for older kids and you can't block them. There's no way to remove unplayed apps easily. It constantly freezes and needs to be restarted. Downloading content is SLOOOOW! It rarely works off of wifi; it just says it's offline and nothing works even though there is a lot of downloaded content. Just stay away from this. The LeapFrog devices are wayyyyy better and the Samsung kids tablet is better. Amazon is just a failure.
 My son really loved this tablet however, he is upset that he has to hand it over to me for him to watch his favorite YouTube shows that are kid appropriate, they just aren’t considered for kids. Things like reviews on electronics. As promised it does let your child watch unlimited shows/movies that are age appropriate and play kid friendly games. It also had a ton of free audible books.
 1. No Youtube, Grow up Amazon, quit fighting with Google, don't be like Apple.<br/>2. Some Kids videos on Prime Video are blocked. Annoying parental controls don't appear to work correctly.<br/>3. Screen looks good, case seems to be good.<br/>4. CPU seems good enough<br/>5. Limited time with it so far, I can't talk about battery life yet.
 Bought at best buy. Was working great for about 2 1/2 weeks. Around 3 1/2 weeks the screen randomly started to get stuck on the previous screens. Rather than having to deal with mfg to replace. I exchanged it. Hopefully it was just a defective one. I could barely see the screen to factory reset.<br/><br/>Will update with this new one
 I have to say for the price, this seems like a great deal. However this our second tablet in the last year that has just stopped charging out of the blue. First time it happened, we sent the old one in right away and received a new one no problem.  Upon reading other reviews, I see that I am not alone. This is frustrating because in my opinion it is not even worth contacting them again to see if they will fix the problem. Money NOT well spent. Just because its cheap does not mean its better.
 This has been a great product so far. I love the fact that it is already set up for Amazon prime video, and has access to all kinds of books and games for my little guy. The protective case is also a must have feature and provides excellent protection from accidents that come with a three year old. Great buy!
 Get this and if you have an issue and like to be asked irrelevant questions abt software updates when your tablet clearly has a hardware issue. Be my guest.  Horrible horrible horrible.  Was on the phone with amazon for 1 hr trying to get this stupid thing replaced.  Amazon seems to think we are the 4-5 year olds we give these things to.
 This has proven to be a total waste of money.  My kids love watching YouTube Kids and because of whatever agreement Amazon has, YouTube Kids is not available for download on this device.  My kids hate it and never want to play with it.
 I'm a big fan of the Kid's Fire tablet.  I purchased one for my youngest daughter and when my older daughter's Nabi began having problems, I replaced it with another Fire.  No complaints or problems at all.  The kindle is easy to use, easy to set up parental controls, has good battery life, and the amount of available books/apps, etc. are great!
 This was a good purchase! I love that it comes with 16g memory and a case, plus Amazon protects it as well because kids will be kids! It holds a charge, is very user friendly and allows the parent to have control over daily tablet time and what's allowed to be viewed. It's perfect for younger children, it's easy to use, my kindergartners love it and so do I!
 So slow.  Cant watch videos offline. The apps randomly disappear and you cant manage kids settings without wifi. Absolutely useless for road trips. Very difficult for a toddler to use, too.  Horrible tablet for kids.
 Bought this for my sons 3rd birthday to use on occasion. It’s barely been used but all of a sudden the sound decided it wants to stop working ONLY on the kid amazon free time profile. It works just great on the profiles for his father and I. I have to restart it a bunch of times and mess with the settings to get the sound to work on his profile so he can watch Dora or bubble guppies or anything at all on the kids profile. Even then it only works for like 15 minutes. The WHOLE point of this tablet was for it to be a KID tablet. Not so I’d have to switch it to the adult profile just so my kid can use a tablet I spent $100 on. Very unhappy.
 Bought for my toddler and was excited for her to have. It runs SUPER SLOW!!!  We don't use it too often, so I kinda just put up with it, but it takes forever to an app to open or load. Also, runs out of battery so quickly, even when not in use. I'll give it to my daughter's fully charged and she'll play with it for about an hour, maybe hour and a half, and then I'll leave it turned off on the counter and by the following morning it's completely drained and wont even turn on. Not very pleased with this, but I think it's too late to try to return.
 I bought one for each of my grand kids. It was easy to set up and tailored nicely for kids. The kids absolutely love them. They seem to be very durable and able to take the rough treatment the kids give them sometimes.
 I have purchased 2 of these in the past 24 months. Both tablets charging connection failed inside of a year. The connection seemed secure but the tablet would not charge unless I manipulated the charging cord (putting the laptop in weird angles to apply pressure from the cord to the tablet). This method eventually stopped working as well. I would not recommend any Fire tablet products. This is a flaw and I have yet to receive an explanation or a refund.
 I bought 2 for my daughters.  One is 2 and the other is 5. It's very kid friendly.  The content on the tablet is educational and fun.  From apps to games and videos the girls really enjoy their tablets.  Parents can limit screen time as well as internet and app content so they only have access to age appropriate content.  Great price and it came with payment options so you can break up the cost in monthly installments!!! That was definitely a plus during christmas time.
 I purchased 6 Fire 7 Edition Tablets for grandchildren for Christmas 2017. They are supposed to have a 2-year warranty. One grandchild  has been having issues getting it to hold a charge. I called support; they said the parent could handle this issue with Amazon; and I as a Grandparent didn't need to. However, now I find out from grandchild that she didn't even get one replaced as she received it from me. No pink hard case; and to top it all ; it won't hold a charge either.  Very dissatisfied. I only wish that they were the ones that had to explain all this to her. Not GRANDMOTHER!!!!!  VERY DISSATISFIED !!!!!!!!  Why will it not enter my comment without marking the overall rating? I want my comment entered; so I guess I will have to mark one star.
 I purchased these for my 2 year old son &amp; 5 year old daughter ...I regret it. Unfortunately, upon setup these started to malfunction. Would not recommend unless you're already preparing yourself to return. I gave the item 2 stars instead of 1 because Amazon attended to my issues quickly, the same day and issued me a refund! Also, the tablets with the color bumpers are very cute it's just the system SUCKS! Thanks♡
 It is pretty nice I bought one for my son and daughter. I wish there was an easier way managing content. And a way to remove the adult profile from the kids tablets. You can have a password for the adult profile but let's be serious, kids like pushing buttons and my daughter is three and even though she has a profile she locked the tablets up pressing buttons on the wrong screen.
 This tablet would be perfect, if not for one major problem: the faulty charging port. We've had my son's tablet repaired twice and replaced once. Same problem every time. Eventually the charging port will become so loose that the device will no longer charge. Once it's reached this point, it's useless. I think I've finally reached the point where I'm not willing to fight with customer service to have it repaired/replaced again, and am ready to move on to a different device.
 I bought this tablet for my autistic son, and he loves it! He can be able to watch his fave cartoons and use the educational apps that he needs most since he's nonverbal.<br/><br/>As a mom, I love how durable the tablet's case is because I know that it can withstand bring dropped and will still work. It's sort of shockproof, which I like about that. Plus, i love that it has 16GB + a place to add more storage because when my son isn't using it, I can be able to access my books from the Kindle &amp; Audible apps when I want them. This is such a great and innovative tablet!
 I AM HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE BATTERY LIFE IT ONLY WORKS FOR 1 HOUR THEN IT IS DEAD. THEN I HAVE TO CHARGE BATTERY IT AGAIN FOR IT TO LAST ANOTHER HOUR  AND DEAD AGAIN, I HAVE A SCREEMING 3 YEAR OLD CHILD AND HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE BATTRY PROBLEM. I NEED YOU TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT . PLEASE ME KNOW.
 Bought two at a Amazon special for my two granddaughters, age 5 and 3. So happy to now not have to hide my iPad when they visit. It will be a Merry Christmas indeed...can't wait to see their faces. In fact, I was compelled to open them and check-out the pre-installed apps. From what I can tell, they will be familiar with them and enjoy the new things, as well.
 This is a sweet kids tablet. Extremely durable So far my child has only used it to watch her favorite kids you tube videos ( Baby Shark, etc) The sound quality is good,I appreciate the parental controls &amp; the available content seems to be pretty good. We had a Sprout Cubby a few years ago. This tablet is way better!
 I really like this tablet - and it is amazing what you get for the price! A really good value.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that it should have some type of setting that freezes the screen. This is the biggest problem with a young child and a tablet - they touch the screen and it alters or stops what they're watching. Something like this, that's made specifically for kids, should have a feature for that.
 Bought this for our trip to California.  When we took it out of the package and set it up seamed to be okay.  tried playing the first movie and it froze.  We then tried to turn it off and would not power off.  When we finally got it to power down on the start up it froze on the Fire screen.  This same situation kept happening.  I am returning this product!
 I bought the pink and blue tablets for a long car ride for my 4 1/2 year old twins. One was operational but my sons was a problem from the minute we started using it on the trip.  It would have issues finding the network, all of he content would temporarily disappear, etc, while my daughters would be just fine. I spent hours on the phone both through chat and call with amazon trying to figure out what the issue was.  After an almost 2 hour phone call one night they finally agreed to take the fire back. I received it back today, apparently it’s ‘fixed’ - we will see.<br/>If I had to do it again, I’d splurge on an iPad. I regret this purchase completely.  I also don’t like the apps as much as on the iPad.
 My daughter has really enjoyed playing with this.  There's a lot of variety with Amazon FreeTime.  I've downloaded some good educational content, which she likes, and she has investigated her options and downloaded a number of games she likes.  I love that PBS Kids shows are available.  Today she was having fun watching "Odd Squad."  We are going on a long airplane trip with a long layover, so I think it will be nice for her to have so much of different kinds of content then.  I haven't added the extra storage yet but will probably have to soon.
 I bought two of these for my kids for their birthdays! 8 years old and 2 years old! My kids love them! And we don’t have WiFi so we had to download all the games at my sisters and they work just fine wit out the WiFi obviously some things you have to have WiFi for. Also my 2 year old decided it was a good idea to soak hers in the dog water! It stopped working and amazon in sending her out a new one! They were so awesome over the phone I had a great experience!
 Perfect size...tons of options.... and parents can use the tablet under their own profile with all access just like any other tablet... very durable... the bumper is amazing and is so big it helps them keep their thumbs off the screen when holding it.... my kiddos like to scroll through youtube watching kid videos and youtube isn't automatically on their profile but you can go to settings and add videos from YouTube that they like so they can still watch and scroll.
 I love love love the kindle. First off, it  comes alreAdy setup to your Amazon account!!!!! Second it has awesome limits and restrictions for kids! I love that I can set up that my kid has to read a book before he cAn access youtube... I love the design and the  child proof case it came with :) I've bought two in about to order one as.a gift for my friends kid!!! (Had the first one for over 3 years and it still runs good and I still love it)
 Wow!! So i got this for my three year old for trips, car rides, etc. as of right now this thing has been thrown, kicked, slammed by his 1 year old brother! Still intact and working perfect!! So.I bought an extra one for his brother. As for the content, amazing!!! Alot of educational videos, games, apps, etc. great purchase!
 Horrible.  Locks up all the time---even from the first time it was turned on!  This was a Christmas present and we have hardly been able to use it.  It is always updating (every day) &amp; you have to wait atleast 10 minutes to update.  We even got the extra 32 gb sd card &amp; I don't know why because it doesn't help<br/>  I do not recommend this.
 I love the foam case. That’s about it. I’m annoyed that I can’t figure out how to get an app to reach the internet. It’s slow and hard to navigate. Everything pretty much puts you back to your favorites screen not your search terms for videos. I should have just bought another iPad.
 While it takes a little bit to get use too, I love it as well so does my son. Awesome parental controls so I can just hand it to him and he watches his tv or movies or plays the different games, a little difficult understanding how to download watchables so that he can have stuff to watch while in the car but totally worth the struggle because he loves his tablet an paw patrol while driving around. And bonus the adult profile is a full profile so not only is a kid tablet but also a tablet for you the parent!!! Definitely a worth it purchase.
 Since the MOMENT I received this it has been nothing but a headache. Since Day 1 this tablet has lagged and it is obnoxious. Half the time my apps won't open and other times I can't even watch the movies I purchased because "they can't be found". I have wiped it, deleted accounts, and even sent it back to Amazon where they said it was working fine. I also tried to get support with the Amazon Chat and I was transferred to 15 different people, 15!! PLEASE BE AWARE if you need service on your tablet and it is determined you need a "new" one, they will only give you a  refurbished one. Overall very disappointed with the product and the support, which sucks because normally Amazon is great.
 Purchased this for my 2-yr old great granddaughter.  It came preprogrammed with scads of learning programs as well as reading and writing modules.  Plus there's a 1 yr. free subscription to Amazon and a 2-yr warranty.  She started using it right way (yes even at 2) and she loves it.  And, yes, she's very spoiled!
 I love that this came with a one year subscription to Freetime! I will most likely continue to pay for the subscription when it expires too. My son loves having the freedom to access hundreds of educational and kid-friendly games, books, videos, etc. I love the kid-proof case and Freetime filters anything that’s not for kids so I feel safe knowing he can’t access anything else. It has options to control usage &amp; content, it’s easy to use, and a great quality tablet for the price. The one downside is the processing speed (not internet related). I personally don’t use it so I don’t know if it’s just slow in Freetime or the entire tablet. Overall, we love it!
 Are you kidding Amazon!? Its a great tablet. It would do everything my kids would want...if they had access to the prime video app! Come on guys. Why the hell would you block your own kids content? My kids should have access to the noggin channel on an amazon product if I purchase it from amazon! Its worthless!
 Update: everything below is true, and then some. Think twice before ordering this item, but if you do remember to return it very quickly. Now we're stuck with it and hoping that the irritating repair policy of printing up the label, going to a UPS store and mailing it in to receive... another of the same unit... is somehow okay. Let me repeat: buy a different machine. Spend the extra money and get an ipad.<br/><br/>short battery life, buttons often don’t work, too many options (while also being oddly rigid about how customizable it can be). basically it looks as though amazon offers this thing so cheaply because it’s both low quality AND functions as a glorified sales portal. stick with apple. pricier, but at least they’re designed for the user more than for the seller’s benefit.
 This is the 2nd one we had to get and they are absolute crap. I put a screen protector and case on this and both times the screen has broke right down the middle. The first one we got my daughter had only dropped 1 time on a padded chair and it had a crack. This one didn't get dropped or anything and now somehow has a crack even though there is a screen protector and case on it. Really poor quality.
 I’m giving this a 3 because it’s definrely not a *bad* tablet, but it does have some glitches. It loses battery really fast, sometimes it freezes. This one is actually a brand new one we got to replace my son’s first replacement of his original. The original worked WONDERFULLY. No issues, until my son managed to crack it when I was in the hospital have his sister a year ago. Oops. They send a replacement and that one I believe was refurbished, but it downright sucked; I had to send that one back and they sent me this brand new one! This one is a tad glitchy, but my son still loves it. And it’s a great price considering the bumper, the free membership, all the awesome apps that come with it. I would definitely suggest this to a friend.
 I really wanted to like these but I cannot stand these tablets. I bought 2, one for each of my boys.  They are SLOW, so slow.  They have access to everything, which as a parent is very scary. And if you lock out down, half the apps are no longer available.  Downloading an app takes an eternity and try explaining that to a six year old.  I miss my Samsung kids tablet 😒
 It's durable for a toddler which I like.  However, if I put parental settings in the device, I have to enter it EVERY time he changes screens, which can be quite a lot with a 2 year old. If I don't he can order random books and subscriptions that have a charge.  Other than that... It's GREAT.  I elected to go this route instead in the nabi ( other kids starter tablets) and the ability to call Amazon and speak to a person makes it 100% better from jump.
 Hi when I thought this fire seven kids edition it had paid to your kid proof warranty and I saw it on my list Of purchased &amp; I never got it in the mail but I thought it was a verbal warrantee with the purchase of the tablet could someone get back to me. Because now it’s broken and we don’t know what’s the matter with me and I like to return it to see if you could be fixed thank you Karen Sherman
 My child loved this tablet! Her grandparents got it from target for her birthday. We limit her use to about 30 minutes-1 hour a day if that, so it did not get much use. After 3 months of this, the tablet stopped holding any charge. We would plug it in for hours only to get 5% or so charge. This past week, it stopped charging all together and will not turn on. Reading the reviews on the "no questions" warranty, and seeing that our parents bought it at target. I am not hopeful that we will be able to replace.....
 Seems to be a fun little tablet. We got 2 of these for the kids for Christmas. My only real complaint is all of the stuff that is available to them. We really try to monitor what our kids read, watch and play and I found having to go through thousands of apps,videos and books to block the ones I don't want my kids to have access to, to be very time consuming and tedious.<br/>That being said I love the fact I can go in on my kindle fire and go into their profile and edit and block as I see fit. So should they come across something I don't want them to have access to I can block it from my tablet and it will just look like it disapeared off their app. I also love that I can share apps with them from my account. Our 7yr old has been begging for a tablet for a couple years now. He's going to love it! And I love that it comes with a 2yr replacement plan cause lets be honest.... Its going to get dropped or scratched or something.
 This is an amazing purchase for our kid. We had an iPad previously and dealt with multiple issues of her watching items that she shouldn't have been in, and to top it off a broken screen. This took out out all of the worry with her using it by herself. The bumper on it keeps it safe from drops and dings. And she loves being able to play without us over her shoulder the whole time.
 Very disappointed after 3 months it stopped charging. In fact it was as if the area inside was broken as it wiggles. Even purchased new chargers from Amazon in case something was wrong with the original cord. I bought 3 as I have 3 kids and now one is miserable. Waiting for the other two to go.
 Pros: tablet has been great for a 3 year old. Plenty of games and applications to keep him busy for hours.<br/><br/>Cons: Does not have a great battery life and the charging port broke after 6 months of light use. Has been on charger all day and the battery is still dead. “Worry free” guarantee is false advertising. Had to speak with 3 separate customer services reps before I was told I need to send back and they will try to repair the problem or send me a refurbished one. The whole process will take up to 2 weeks. Wish I would have purchased a different tablet all together (not kindle).
 This is a great device for my 2 and 5 year old. Great content and they do beat it up and it hangs in there with the case. HOWEVER, please note - both of the ones I got, I have had to replace because the USB port to charge will bend if you plug it in with the kids case still on OR if you let the kiddos continue to play with it while plugged in. Amazon has been awesome with replacing them, but thought it would be good to let people know about this issue!
 For kids, this is a good system, at a good value.<br/><br/>One thing that has been aggravating is how the Home screen basically lists all apps, videos, books, etc, regardless of whether they have been downloaded or not. This is confusing to kids, as they will push anything on a screen. Then, when they have to wait for the app to download, they think it's not working.<br/><br/>The actual apps that have already been downloaded are listed at the very bottom of the home screen, under "On This Device".<br/><br/>To be more efficient, the home screen should just be "On This Device".<br/><br/>Also, it would be nice if you could easily remove the Espanol apps from the home screen.
 I love that I can choose to use the children's option (i can have it set up based on the child's age) or use it as a regular fire tablet. I was able to put netflix on my 4 year old's account and she gets to watch all her "good" favorites from youtube without seeing all the unapproved videos floating around even the youtube kids app because it is already available on the tablet. My daughter also has some options of her favorite games (like the dentist one) all in all, I highly recommend it for a child who can work their away around a tablet. I am looking forward to learning the rest of the features but so far, I am very happy with the purchase.
 I got this so my granddaughter could use it while she is here. She's played on it a couple of days. It's really nice and very lite. Great case. She has her own account and mine is locked with a pin code. She can't get on anything inappropriate. She's almost 3 1/2. It comes preloaded with apps to download. We're still learning.
 Tablet worked great, exactly as expected at first. The charger port on the original purchase became too loose to charge after almost a month. I'm not sure if that's the quality or my child to blame, but the warranty was extremely easy to call in. Hold times were more than reasonable and the staff were very friendly. They emailed me a shipping label immediately and I boxed the broken tablet up and shipped it on a Tuesday, the replacement was here by Friday. My daughter is so glad to have her tablet back, and I was very pleased with the speed and customer service.
 Gave it as a gift to my grandson for his first birthday. At first the parents love it, he can handle it without worrying it breaking, he likes to put it his mouth (cause he's teething), but he like's watching on it to. I got it to replace my daughter-in-law's cell phone, which they used to have him watch the show's he likes to keep him occupied. They use it on car rides cause he doesn't like it and it keeps him busy.
 BUYER BEWARE!!! We're on our second of this device. The charging ports stop working. Within months. The first one was short of a year old and the second one quit working 2 months later. About to return it again. I'm at the point where I'd prefer to get my money back. Don't know I'd this is a design flaw or what.
 We originally purchased this back in 2017 and the games and books were free. Amazon did an update and started charging $7 a month for "unlimited" with out any notice in order to access new apps. The update also screwed up the profiles and erased all the previously downloaded apps that now magically cost money if you don't subscribe. It's just poor service and a big f u to the customers. Some apps are free but you now have to go i thru the adult profile to download, then go into the child's profile and add it to them just so they can play. Very inconvenient.<br/><br/>Customer service was also very unhelpful with the issue.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this versus any other tablet, it's not anything special.
 I'm concerned about my item. It came with a charger cable in a not well condition,. I don't want to have a problem with this after a year or so with cable or the tablet itself, hope it's brand new. My boy would be very happy with this gift on his birthday though. Great for kids.
 My grandson loves his tablet but this is the second one in less than two years where the charging port has failed. Trying to return to replace the last one and will have to call. There is no option for me to do this on line. Not happy at all!!  Right at the top of the page it says "IF THEY BREAK IT, WE'LL REPLACE IT. NO QUESTIONS ASKED".  And he didn't even break it. It's a flaw in the device. Really too bad because it works really well - when it works.
 We got these for all of our kids and have actually bought 3 more after that.<br/>You need a micro SD because the system itself takes up a lot of space.  I suggest a 32GB. The kid profile is set by age. We used the return and repair multiple times over the 2 year warranty.<br/>Our biggest problem is that we have 7 children and it only allows 3 kids profiles.
 This cheap device was always slow even younger children are frustrated with waiting for it to process and play anything and less then year later it quit charging and is now useless.  Super slow regardless of being wiped constantly to have minimal programs to maximize ability to play one video to entertain a two year old.  Worthless
 This kindle is great for my daughter who is 3 yrs old. She loves it and it's easy to use. I would have given it a 5 star rating but there's one issue that I've come accross on all of the kindles we've had and that's the charger port. After awhile the charger gets loose in the port. Even my kindle does it. We just lean it and it still charges but really that's the only issue we have.
 I have had it for barely a month and I cant keep it charged. it dies super quick highly disappointed<br/>I did a lot of research on this and expected better quality.<br/>I would not recommend this tablet.
 The kid-proof case is wonderful.  I certainly don't encourage this kind of behavior, but I will give a shout out to all those dealing with little ones who throw things.  They might crack your head or a window, but unless something else comes up, the tablet will remain unbroken and usable.
 This is a nightmare! Buyer beware they connect your credit card to this tablet so if you gifted it to a charity the child can charge games!!!! Amazon is terrible with customer service and I have no choice but to cancel my credit card and call the attorney general of my state because I believe they are committing fraud! What a nightmare receiving emails about games I “purchased “!!! I would give no stars to this scheme! I feel bad for the children who received them cause I bought 2.
 I have had a kindle for a couple of years no problems , bought these for my grandsons birthday , they have been giving problems since the warranty ran out , the charger no longer charges , very disappointed boys. Not sure what the problem is , I cannot find anyone to check it out.
 When you got four kids and three tablets, life gets interesting. This tablet ended the squabbling. I already had pink, blue, and green, so this yellow was perfect. They all have their own tablets. The freetime included provides content geared to age group. I love the two-year replacement warranty. this is one rugged little tablet. Very happy.
 Our child is 15 months old, and this has to be the best purchase we have made for her to date.  We love the fact that everything is age appropriate and we don’t have to worry about what she is exposed to.  The two year guarantee can’t be beat.  For what you get as far as content, buying one is a no-brainer.  It streams perfectly using the hotspot on our phones when we are away from home.  Battery life is comparable to our phones as well.
 My 2.5 yr old grandson LOVES this tabket. I studied up on all of them &amp; obviously I went w this one so cant say anything bad about the others but you cant go wrong w this one.  I bought for his for xmas &amp; je wasnt into it as much until last couple months but I'm sure that's because hell be 3 in July so it's more interesting for him. I like that you can download games &amp; then not have to worry about having internet to play those. It is durable w that big holder on it,  he has dropped it many times &amp; stl good as new. It wasmt charging a few weeks ago &amp; my daughter called cust service &amp; they were friendly &amp; helpful &amp; rebooted it &amp; been working great. I know how important reviews are for me so i hope this helps.  😊
 My daughter LOVES this tablet so I HAD to buy one for my son. She got it when she was 3 and has learned SOOOO much from it. Only issue is with the “kids tube” app, highly inappropriate ads being allowed by amazon like CANNIBIS ads show up on her screen. We deleted the app but kids are resourceful.
 Absolutely the best gift gift my 3 year old son.  Durable,  withstands sticky fingers and dropping off the couch.  Great learning tool, and very easy to use.
 It's fantastic for a baby, but I have issues with the software. Why can't I lock out menus and buttons? My kid keeps opening menus, turning the tablet off, etc, and they don't know why, it just frustrates them. Add on some confusing account things (juggling multiple accounts) and you have a decent but flawed product.
 Main reason I purchased this tablet was for my 2 1/2 yr old Granddaughter. Her Aunt was buying Teddy Ruxpin for Her and a tablet is needed. Well I gave the Aunt this tablet. She wanted to have everything set up for Christmas Day. THIS TABLET LINKS WITH TEDDY RUXPIN BUT IT WON'T PLAY THE CORRISPONDING VIDEO WITH THE STORY BOOK! I can't believe it. Thanks Amazon
 I was trying to add a children's reading and math learning site to the list of websites my child could access and Amazon will not let me add it. It is a site designed for kids. Now my child can only access them through the parent account. This is awful. It was the whole reason I purchased this tablet. Bad on you Amazon for making choices for parents, bad on you.
 Bought a brand new tablet it developed a line in the screen after one month sent it back to A****n they sent me a refurbished tablet. I paid for a new tablet not refurbished. Posted a bad review and A****n told me my review didn't meet the qualifications to be posted and they never posted the review. Can't believe they felt it ok to send a child a refurbished tablet when the child had a brand new one bought for them.
 I will agree the tablet replacement is a huge hassle and the internal memory is poor but the enjoyment this tablet brings my child is worth wild. My son could use this thing all day every day if I allowed him. This tablet has been thrown down a flight of stairs, bite several times, dropped more then a billion times, thrown out a car window onto gravel, buried in the backyard, had juice spilled on it, and been covered I. PB&amp;J and it's still standing. This will be our second tablet and mostly because momma is tired of fighting the older system and clearing the games. This time around we are doing a memory card.
 I love the fact my child can use it and I do not have concern of him getting into material that isn't age appropriate.  It works great and the book app's have been a great addition at the breakfast table as we group read stories before school. Things I wish were better, enlarging text, some book copy hard to read due to size.  App's and Video's, you cannot set for books to be read before apps or videos are allowed to be played.  Because an app or video has a character from a book they are considered open to use in book reading mode.  It would also be nice if the read along books would be considered a book in the menu for it is a great learning tool that cannot be accessed if you turn the app and video's off so your child reads books first before having free time to use apps and videos.
 My children, 2 year old girl and 9 year old boy would I ever think one product would entertain both of my babies. You can personalize to their age specifally. This was thought out when made love that amazon is a part of this product. Makes a world of difference which is probably how they came up with this concept. Looking forward to what will happen after the first year guarantee with the subscription of kindle. Easily understandable for all ages!
 I got it for my 3 year old... she loves it... she likes all the nick characters and FreeTime has so many books, videos and apps on nick characters. The 1 year free FreeTime is a plus. My daughter also throws/ drops the kindle lot of times, but it is so durable with the cover. It does not even have a single scratch or crack till now. Would recommend the product.
 My boys amazon fire tablet was about 1 month short of the two year warranty when the cable would no longer stay in the charging point.<br/>Amazon promises a two year hassle free warranty, and they delivered just that. They not only replaced it, they paid for shipping, and with 48 hours of my broken one being received, a new one was not only sent out, but was at my door step. All it took was 5 minutes of my time on their chat box, and a card board box.<br/>The best part, we sent in a 5th Edition and the replacement, brand new in the box, was a 7th Edition.<br/>Its rare you will ever find a company willing to stand behind their product, and Amazon, you nailed it!
 i love this tablet. Having books, full episodes and apps to choose from keeps my son entertained for long periods of times which helps during these Christmas road trips and long plane rides. The battery life is great and i love having different profiles on the tablet so that i can monitor what is being watched. i do wish there was a 2 step download process as just clicking on an icon immediately downloads the app. this causes an overload.
 bought 2 of this for my kids got one first and test it out and didn't like the fact that it does not have Google play app my kid wanted to download an app that was not available on here because Amazon uses a diferent software. Also I was disappointed that it says it comes with a 1 year Kids free time were kids can watch videos and games and books free one year but in reality it only gave me a 30 day free trial after that then am suppose to pay about $5 a month. Other than that it's a good durable tablet decided to keep the first one I received because my kid ripped the box and packaged and I got it on sale.
 Do not buy ! Without subscription you cant open anything No joke . Not even apps you have on your device already . So now what? Garbage!
 My girls(5 &amp; 3) love their pink tablets!! It's perfect for them to be able to use on their own and I can have relief that it is safe for them.  They love them! My only complaint is the cord that plugs into the tablet to charge is easily broken.  My 5 year olds cord is messed up(it's 3 months old)  and does not charge her tablet anymore.  I have to use another cord to charge her tablet. Other than the cord, I have no complaints! Perfect for my kids!
 Like others I loved the kids edition and the ability to customize what they can play, when they can play it, and for how long was great.<br/>But we're about to have to exchange each tablet for a 4th time because of the charging port going out. It has been the same issue for each one and I would think by now amazon would have figured out a fix. We'll be looking for a different brand of tablet this time instead of returning both and then being stuck with unchargeable tablets when our warranty is up.
 My 5 year old twins received these for Christmas. They absolutely love them and the huge assortment of apps available for them. A big negative is storage, you HAVE to buy an sd card for extra storage or you can really only download about 10 things before you're out of space. Extremely durable and have been played with for hours on end
 So far it works great. I have had to restart it a few times because it gets "stuck" on a screen. Battery seems to hold a good charge and I like the pre-loaded shows and games. We bought this for my son to start using ABC Mouse, there is a little lag but it doesn't seem to bother him much.
 got this tablet and started it up.  couldn't use it for anything but free time games.  tried to access other games.  couldn't.  life of the battery is short.  about 15 to 20 minutes.  have a phone I use for the same thing and it lasts for over an hour.  the only good thing about this purchase is the kid proof cover.
 We are an android family, and I was getting tired of my kids using our phones.  After reading all the reviews, we decided to get two of these Amazon Fires.  Well, maybe its just me being used to the Android system...but Im really not liking these at all.  And I have a feeling my kids wont either.  Definitely not as user friendly as an android tablet.  Pretty sure these will be going back.
 Not super impressed. Apps are hard to navigate and doesn’t give you the option to read about what it does or for what ages. Also you have to download games but your home screen only holds a couple and the rest disappear. Battery also SUCKS, my son maybe used it ten minutes a day and it dies within two days even when not being used. Kinda bummed
 This review was originally given 1 star,.....<br/><br/>Original review : Well, this is the reason I hold out on reviewing, purchase made in Nov 2017, my nephew and niece are now telling me their kindles are shutting off , not holding battery and they are upset, that their kindles are no longer working or just not working properly. I am going back to amazon and asking them to replace them, will let you guys know the outcome. But I am shock that this happen, I have purchased more than 3 kindles, this non performance just shy of 1 year is interesting and not customary of amazon goods.<br/><br/>Updated review:<br/>Amazon has agree to replace the devices and their customer service were great and first class.
 Purchased two Fire Kids Edition tablets for my kids for Christmas. By the end of January one of the tablets wouldn't charge anymore. Defect in the charging port on device, Amazon replaced fine and great per their warranty. Now, the second device purchased at Christmas is having the same problem. I will have to go thru the return process for my other child's tablet now. To be honest I would like return both tablets for a refund and get my children another brand of tablet. I feel this is a bad product, wouldn't recommend.
 I was searching for a way to have my granddaughter’s tablet replaced that I purchased last year on Oct 2, 2017. The description clearly states guarantee replacement warranty for 2years. The tablet seems to have stop charging. I also purchased a second tablet for my grandson and his tablet is having the same issues. Both grandchildren are very disappointed which makes for a very upset grandmother. Amazon has a great brand and I’ve usually had good experiences but this has killed their record. Please honor your word and replace both tablets.
 We purchased this specific tablet so my son could watch his favorite shows on his own tablet.  It just so happens his favorite shows are videos available through Prime Video which does not work on this device.  You cannot access streaming shows from Amazon Prime which was not articulated in any way in the product's description.  Shouldn't Amazon shows be accessible by Amazon products?  You'd think so, but they are not with this device.
 We have had this tablet for over a year now.  It has been such a headache.  We got it as a gift for a 3 year old. The internal memory on this thing is pitiful and it seems it wants to store everything on the internal memory even though it has a memory card also.  It says you have 16gb but ours says it has about 8gb total so it must use the rest for its terrible processing.  What can you do with 8gb nowadays?  And forget about trying to download even purchased content from Amazon.  It wants you to use it on wifi even if you've purchased the content.  What good is it if you can't travel with It?  We even spent time on the phone with Amazon trying to see if they could get it to work any better but with no success.  We have tried deleting apps and removing anything we could but the most common thing you will see is the spinning status thing.  We have tried resetting the entire tablet.  Nothing helped it and the time we spent trying to make a terrible tablet work was all wasted.  If you and your child love watching that spinning thing indicating the tablet is thinking or seeing error messages that you have to be on wifi to use content you've purchased, this may be a good choice. Otherwise, it's a terrible choice.  Amazon needs to do a lot better than this.
 This was a great investment as our grandson was kept busy for most of a 2 hour trip. You have to download the apps before starting any trip, but once they are, your child has access to them wherever. A lot of great education and fun apps to choose from, all geared towards your child's age group. I have already recommended to my daughter she buy one for both her kids.
 we have used several kids tablets, this is by far the best. My son adores this tablet. Amazon customer service is always so nice and helpful anytime I have had to call with questions about the tablet as well. Highly reccomend!
 If there was a way to lock out the screen so you could toss this to a 2 year old and have it play the whole video without them being able to unwittingly shut it off that would be great- maybe a remote control with a lockout feature or a lockout timer. The Amazon Free Time is great for the kids, but they do not understand how to use a Kindle and end up turning whatever video is playing off fairly quickly.
 This was a great product, especially for smaller children. It is very durable and easy to handle. Coming with the case was a plus because you don't have to search for the right one to fit and you do not have to worry about buying one that doesn't fit and returning it! Very good deal!!
 Charged my card twice, had to contact company, told me that neither of the charges went through, had to call bank on other line to confirm, the lady in customer service was very rude to both of us, had to talk to manager in order to get money back. Got product and its just a plain kindle, its not a tablet and it is not good for surfing the web and the apps for kids are not free
 Bought this for my 3 year old and he loves it.  I read through reviews and it does take a few hours to set up and get apps downloaded.  I have two  kindle fires and those accounts are also linked on his.  There are thousands of games and books for him to enjoy.  I'm able to download other apps in my setting but not his so I haven't had a chance to play around with it enough to figure that out.  I did buy a micro SD card but I haven't figured out how to download movies yet.  Some things aren't as intuitive as I would like them to be.  As far as durability, it is great!!!  And my little guy really enjoys playing with it.
 I like that I did get a replacement for the one i had a problem with but the issue is still there that I have with it like the battery power is not good. The tablets run down within 2/3 hours. My twins love these tablets they r great but when that battery dies, u can imagine what they do 🤦‍♀️. Looks like I’ll be buying another brand later this year.
 My grand daughter actually loves the fire and has since the day she got it. At two years old, I love eating ask for her tablet. As to the warranty, don’t let the great ads fool you. She dropped it water today and upon calling Amazon, it’s “warranty service”.. not actually replacement. I got a shipping label wHere upon Amazons receipt they will then make a determination in a week or so whether to repair it or replace it. Either way, expect to be without it for weeks. Unacceptable if you have a two year old asking for her tablet. What happened to the belief given of the ad staying worry free replacement for two years? After a hassle maybe.
 battery life not good from the first day we received it and it stopped charging at 5 months.  Now I am  trying to figure out how to get it replaced as it states in the original ad for up to 2 years.<br/>I bought this for my grandson who I care since my other grandson had one and loved it.  My other grandson would use his all day off and on and the battery would not die.  This one i bought for another grandson, he would use it for a couple hours and it would go from a full charge to 30%.  I'm thinking this one i have is a lemon!
 I wish I could give this thing no stars. Please please please don't disappoint your kids by buying this for them. And at this point I'm honestly worried because, when I turn it on, it acts like someone else is remotely operating it. I use it mainly to play music for him and i can sit there and watch 'someone' delete songs and go into the tablet settings. I will be contacting amazon about this because we bought it for my son only last christmas and it is absolute garbage!
 Bought this for our 9 year old. It worked fine except after about 3 months the charging port stopped working. We sent it back to get it fixed, they returned it saying they had installed newest software and it should be good as new. However, despite giving them specific information about the broken charging port when we sent it back, the charging port was still not working. Not sure they looked at it at all. When we chatted with customer service, we learned we could send it back again, but if we wanted a refund it would be based on how many months it has been used. So now we've sent it back again with an actual note on the device to the technician. Hopefully they check it this time. Can update later.
 Its just ok. After reading the reviews on how slow it was, I figure it could not be that bad. Well, It is.<br/>I use to let my kids use my old smart phone to watch play their games. They sure notice the slow response time. Once you get in the App or movie you are wanting to watch it plays well. The lag is trying to get there. Sometimes you cannot tell if the touch screen did not pick up the press or just trying to load. I would not buy it again. My 5-year-old Nexus response much faster then this.
 We have always purchased regular amazon tablets without the free time software on them. They are great tablets and have plenty of options for restricting things from the kids. I decided to try the kids version this time and I absolutely hate it. It is over complicated, and slows down the tablet greatly. I am returning it immediately and ordering a regular fire tablet instead.
 Very useful and plentiful in appealing digital games and shows for my child. There are limitless things they can do and I am envious since it is better at performance, when compared to my older Kindle fire. It's easy to use and way better than her last tablet, which was a cubby or something.
 Don’t trade in your iPad just yet . Does not have YouTube kids and the videos in free time didn’t work . I kept getting error code 4527 (video unavailable) . A true nightmare on vacation
 I bought this tablet for my 12 month daughter for her birthday and she loves it. It keeps her occupied and busy. She is able to watch shows, movies on Netflix, play games and I read her books. I just connect the wifi to my hotspot on my phone so that my daughter is able to use her tablet while we are out and about. It is great quality. I am definitely satisfied with my purchase.
 I love these tablets because they have thousands of games for my 4 year old twins to play. They love everything about them. I’m just really annoyed with the charging of the tablet. It sucks ! I’ve literally bought 10tablets so far, within 2years and its the same freaking thing over an over and over again. The charger mess up before they can even crack the screen, they just stop charging the tablet and won’t cut on again. I even tried to use another charger and it doesn’t work. I put insurance protection plans on them and they get replaced immediately(Brand New). Still the charging breaks again within a month of time an I charge the tablet on a flat surface no bending or leaning so it’s charging right. Now I have to replace again. So annoyed with these tablets.
 I like the warranty but the thing loads a little slow and the battery life is horrible. Takes forever to charge with included. Charger and drains in under an hour of light use not sure if that is a defect in this particular unit or if they are all.like that?
 Totally recommend! The cases on these tablets are AWESOME!! The kids app it come pre-loaded with is great! Lots of parental options and very simple for kids to use. Totally recommend this product! Cant beat the price for what ya get. Happy with my purchase (i bought two)
 He was so excited to get his pre-birthday gift last November 2018, a month before his birthday in December 2018. He loves it!  He tries to sing along with the characters and walks around carrying it everywhere he goes. He wakes up looking for his tablet. He calls it "tablet".
 Bought as a birthday gift for my toddler. It is mainly used for her to watch cartoons and not monopolize our tv. We bought it in August and by January the charging port was no longer making a connection and wouldn't charge. Thanks to their warranty it was replaced with minimal hassle. Took 4 days it receive a new tablet from the day it was mailed back. My only complaint with this tablet is freezes up when using certain apps and is constantly refreshing the home page.
 This was a great product for exactly three months when it quit charging. I had been the one to plug it in all the time not the child so I know it wasn’t abused. I am very disappointed.<br/><br/>I was able to find a after market cord that fixed the issue I was having. The one that came with the kindle wasn’t connecting inside the port. The reason I actually came in and took the time to change my review though is a phone call I received from Amazon. They called a couple days after I posted my review to fix my issue with the kindle. If your having troubles Amazon has great customer service and will back up their product.
 This product should come with this WARNING: This product and the Freetime App is intended for use in the United States, once online and abroad more than 90% of the content is NOT AVAILABLE. Not even original Amazon content included with Prime Video. Adding to this nightmare Parental control make the tablet adult proof too making it impossible to install other apps. If this were not enough: THERE IS NO NATIVE YOUTUBE APP AVAILABLE, and no Youtube Kid's App available etiher, so get ready to be strapped into a hostage situation with Amazon content. The only available option is for you to download videos and media from the web (legally ripped o course) and use them as a $99 videoplayer.
 These kid kindles were awesome at first. Now they barely hold a charge, if I can get them to charge. Downloads are so slow and I am on my second one that was replaced after a week because it wasn't working. Spend the money on something else. Amazon customer service is going downhill
 I have 4 Kindles so when I bought my nephew one I was expecting the same awesomeness that I have with my other 4 kindles. I wasn't! The charger isn't a fast charger &amp; it take almost ALL day to charge. Needless to say it stays on the charger longer than in his hands. Disappointed!
 Bought 3 so far we have had one for 3 yrs. And the 2 year worry free warranty is AMAZING. My grandson has cracked the screen and broke it 5 times.and once they sent me a defective one.We just call them up answer some questions and volia they mail or email a shipping lable. Put in any box and take to ups or have them pick it up FREE  a few days later a new one arrives. That simple. Its awesome<br/>ALL of my Grandchildren have tablets. On Samsung Kids tab. Hopefully she never breaks it.
 SO disappointed in the kids Fire :( this device was working fine for our kids, but the problem is with the charging port. The port became loser and loser with each use, until eventually it stopped charging all together. I looked up what to do, and apparently it’s a common problem that many buyers have experienced.<br/><br/>Amazon should have fixed this issue already!<br/><br/>We’re so disappointed that this “special” gift only lasted 8 months. Meanwhile our iPad has been going strong for 5 years with no issues.<br/><br/>I hate leaving negative reviews, but this purchase was planned out, highly anticipated, and now just a big disappointment
 We recently upgraded to the fire 7. My son loves it!!! But.. yes there is a but... Once storage gets low it's really hard to clear it. I've uninstalled everything that was down loaded , games books , picture video. Clean slate you'd think... Nope. No room. With a cleaned out tablet. We upgraded because of this exact issue. Also it only works if you pay for free time. I have four boys.. four tablets.. free time charged per tablet, instead of per household or account . Other than that. The parental controls are amazing. The learning setting before they can play a game is great. It's a good product all in all. Just storage, space, and fees arey issue!
 This tablet is good but its not great. My biggest dislike is the battery charge. It lasts a very short time. Had the tablet off the charger unused for 2 hours and the battery went from 100% to 78%. My son used it for two hours after that and the brightness was at 30%. The tablet was down to 34% power! I'm shocked that it drains so fast compaired to when I use my phone. I do like that it has a protective case and I like how crystal clear the screen is. It's a good tablet for a child to play on for awhile but not to use for long periods of time.
 For the price and the built in apps, it’s a good deal but it was a little buggy about downloading videos for offline watching at first, and I wish the kids interface gave more options to see what an app was like before downloading. Additionally, a lot of apps don’t really work offline but there’s no easy way to filter that — since we bought this primarily to use on an airplane, that was super annoying. If I had a bit more budget, I’d spring for a refurbished iPad mini.
 My kid loves it. It's a lot faster then the previous Kid's Kindle he got a couple years ago. His old kindle had a 32GB memory card in it so when I told him this kindle has a memory card twice the amount (64GB) he was thrilled. He had that 32GB card filled and I was continuously deleting old games and stuff for him to keep playing.
 These tablets are excellent the first year. Shortly after the first year passes, everything starts to fail. It won’t hold a charge. Games and videos won’t load. The apps crash, won’t remember wifi settings, have to power it off because two games will overlap on the screen and it takes forever to reboot. Very aggravating to me and my 5 year old.
 I had to wait to place my order for my pay check which was just before Christmas.  I ordered the tablet for my grandson but the delivery was scheduled for January 9.  I was initially disappointed that he wouldn't have his gift for Christmas.  However, the week-end before Christmas I received a delivery up-date which indicated that it would be delivered on the 24th.  It arrived as stated and I was able to give my grandson his gift!  At only 3 years old, he is loving his new tablet and all the games and educational programs that he has access to.  Thank you for exceeding my expectations!!!
 This model is just as bad as the previous ones....super slow, super buggy, just absolute junk. I'm still within my timeframe to replace - but Its not even worth replacing, I wish I could return and get a refund. I'd purchase an ipad mini or something else that will work and last.
 Easy to use but you need prime to take advantage of all the features. My son loves watching videos on it and there are endless games and books with Freetime. Parent accounts function as a normal tablet and the kid profile allows for parental blocks of any website, allows you to set up time limits as well as requirements for educational apps and reading to be completed before any games or videos can be watched.
 I loved the idea of getting my toddler the Kindle fire with the kid proof case. However the content available for download isn't great.  The actual kindle is very very slow compared to other devices.  My son is used to Apple products and going i and out of different apps, he cant do that with the kindle and gets very frustrated and throws it which makes the case come in handy.  Dont get me wrong, its great for reading but my 17 month old just isnt quite there yet.  Maybe it will be more useful then.
 Works well, the kids mode puts all the apps that the kids like together very accessibly for them and the case is very sturdy and adds a nice kid friendly grip to it. My only complaint is that the battery life seems very short. It feels like every time I turn around I'm being told it's dead. A solid purchase for the price.
 I wanted to love this.  My son likes to watch shows occasionally. And I was excited for Amazon Free Time. I don’t know if it’s defective or just bad luck but it will not stay charged.  It will be at 100% then within 30 minutes it’s down to 40%. This is right from the get go.  Super disappointing and frustrating.
 I bought one of these for each of my 4 daughters. They're 10, 8, 6, and 2 and all 3 of them love it. The device allows you to set a profile that feeds them a ton of content such as eBooks, videos, games, and apps appropriate for their age range. You're able to download a lot of the content for offline use, and enable popular apps such as Netflix, Movies Anywhere, and stuff from your Amazon video library. The device is really sturdy and resistant to anything they've thrown at it. My 2-year-old dropped hers from the second floor and it landed safely without a scratch. I can't recommend this device enough. It's worth every penny!
 Bought these for my 2 grandchildren who had to fly across the country. Ages 4 and 3 . They loved them. Need more memory so I bought a memory card. The graphics are clear and wonderful, easy for them to use.  Parents can set timers so the children are not on all the time. Hold a great charge.
 This is the 2nd tablet I've purchased for grandchildren. Each of them LOVES their tablet, and these really stand up to toddler treatment! I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE IN DIFFERENT COLORS! Which, when you have more than one, is great to be able to distinguish whose is whose. A friend mistakedly bought 2 of the same color, and sadly, the tablet with the dead battery somehow always turns out to belong to the younger child...
 I ordered this for my son for Christmas of 2017.  Used less than one year and it is no longer working.  Was not even used regularly as my son still prefers my IPad.  I thought that perhaps the charger was no longer working and ordered a new one, but, the table still does not charge.  So disappointed.  They claim they will replace with no questions asked but there's no return or replace option on the invoice.
 First tablet had a power button problem but Amazon replaced it immediately. Pro: I like the Kindle security features and variety of apps and products. Con : Took Freetime off my 5 year olds tablet because it seemed too juvenile. Would have kept it if it was more customizable.
 I had high hopes for this tablet, but it's terrible. We've had it just over a year now and hardly use it because it's so slow! It freezes constantly and struggles to load the apps. The ones my daughter really loves crashes all the time. The kid side is also not very user friendly and I'm an adult! Apps prompt to update user permissions but not how to do so. None of the same apps can be accessed on the adult side!<br/><br/>I wished we hadn't wasted our money...
 We bought 2 Fires for grandchildren ages 3 and 5. You can download age  related games, movies etc. Nice feature. What I didn't like was the fact that these were gifts and apparently because it was the 3rd and 4th tablet registered in my name the contents of my personal tablet was automatically shown on the kids tablets. Wish I knew how to delete that from the kids tablets.
 very restricted. Cannot add popular apps due to having to stick with amazon app store.  Won't allow non app store games in kid mode. Took about 3 days to figure out how to lock purchases from the child side from both amazon and the app store. Get a NABI Tab. You'll be happier
 So many great things about the FIre for kids but I want to suggest a few more security features.  My son will try to log out of the Free Time or his Profile and after several attempts it asks if he wants to reset the device, and he does.  This totally defeats the purpose of having a device with restrictions.  If I have it set as a childs profile how is he able to reset the entire device?
 This was a new year’s gift for my 3 y.o. daughter. She had the same tablet just not the kids version and she totally destroyed the screen. This bumper/case seems super durable. I cannot imagine a child still being able to break the tablet unless they were directly hitting the screen. Also, it came with a free year of Amazon Freetime which is a preloaded selection of games and videos for kids. I thought it would be corny at first as all kids are not on the same level, but she loves the game selection. I am very satisfied and if your purchase is for a child 2-5, I would def recommend.
 Bought as Christmas gift for 5 year old.  While I was setting up the free time for him I thought the apps seemed too young but I was wrong he has been having a ball with it.  I love the parental controls. I did have to do a Google search for good educational apps because there are so many apps  and the ones I initially loaded were more just for fun.  The battery life is not the best and the apps take awhile to load.  But for the most part I am happy with this tablet.
 I bought this for my nephew since he always loves tho watch shows on my phone. I was so glad to how much comes with thiz. The only down side is it doesn't say if the apps are free or not and I ended up paying a ton of money on games unknowing it. Was not pleased when I checked my bank account the next day.
 My 4 year old LOVES this thing! I was able to set my master account up with ease, before setting up a controlled account for him. Easily navigated and controlled, long lasting battery for road trips, and a durable protective case. My only complaint is sometimes curfew doesn't start on time, and if I need to log on while under curfew, but forgot my password, there isn't an option to access the password reset option
 My daughter loves it. If you are worried about the storage you can buy memory cards for them. There is enough storage on the tablet for a ton of downloads. I was worried about but this because all the negative reviews but I’m really glad I did. It’s a really good tablet for kids. My sister has them for her kids and gave me the idea to get them for my daughter. We love it.
 Bought Tablet for kids, and these are a god-send. Will buy again, when needed. These keep the kids busy and have a ton of stuff for them. Recently had one fail after a very long time, It was still under warranty and they replaced without issue. They sent the newer model as well as the older model was no longer available. Gotta love Amazon.
 This kindle is just as good as others and can be used after the kids grow out of it. The only thing I would add is a way to lock the screen so the little ones don't scroll off when they are watching something. They tend to want to mess with the screen and lose what they are watching.
 I bought two of these last year for Christmas.  Love the tablet but there is a problem with the charging port on one tablet.  This started about six months ago but has gotten severely worse lately.  At first the tablet would on charge if the charging cable was in a certain position,  but as of this week it wont charge at all.  I looked this up online and it seems to be a common problem.  There are directions on how to fix it so we are going to try to problem solve.
 Bought 2, both stopped taking a charge after a year. Warranty replaced one, other one died after warranty elapsed.  Kids loved them while they lasted
 I recommend Fire to EVERYONE, kids and adults alike. They're sturdy, run well, have great battery life, and have very few gaps in accessibility to cool features (there are maybe a half dozen games my 10 year old borrows my phone for, because she can't get them for Kindle).  Excellent tablets.
 Decent tablet for kids.  Love the warrantee.  The battery though.  Sucky little battery.  Even when the device is not in use the battery quickly goes down.  I had the device fully charged, sitting unused on a shelf, and after 2 days it was fully dead.
 I have 4 year old twins, Grammy bought them both one and within 3 months they both stopped charging. Weird that both started to do the exact same thing on the same day. If i plug it in they will turn on and can still be used but won't charge just shows the battery bar at 1% (enclosed pictures) I've contacted Amazon via email and was told to call the customer service so we can get them replaced. I just don't get what's going on with them. Other then that issue my kids love them and stay entertained for hours. One of the twins is autistic and he will get upset and his has been thrown down flights of steps, stomped on, you name it and its with held fairly well. If it wasn't for the charging issue is for sure give it 5 stars!!
 I spent well over an hour deleting all the preloaded stuff I didn't want my kids to use. I'm thankful for that option but don't  understand why sooo much innapropriate content was in there when you have to type in your kids age. Lots of dark, haunted, wicked, ghost, vampire teen stuff. It also takes HOURS to fully charge and that's a bummer. But other than that my kids love them.
 We have been very happy with it and our granddaughter loves it. But here recently it us not connecting to the internet. I received an email about my card. Well from what I read we got a free year of the service it's not letting us in so I'm not paying for anything I wad supposed to get for free and also that I haven't been able to connect since day one. This was a Christmas present. Please let me know what we need to do to resolve this issue.
 Tablet has a problem loading numerous apps. We're constantly uninstalling and reinstalling them to work. The controls on what your child has access to is retry poor. This is a slooow buggy device that's not worth half the price we paid. Seriously regret purchasing this instead of an iPad mini.
 The tablet is slow and often locks up. It is sometimes so slow it is unusable. The point of purchasing this table was to get my kids off my tablet. They still spend more time on my tablet than their's because the battery has a short charge and the system is continually fowling up. I experienced very similar issues with the 1st generation Fire tablet and assumed that the kinks would have been worked out by the 7th generation; I was very wrong. Stay away from this tablet. Save yourself the trouble and headaches and buy something else.
 My daughter is obsessed. She's one year old so wasn't sure how into it she would be but she enjoyed playing games on her Grandpa's  iPad so I got this for her for her birthday. She can navigate easily through the various games, shows, and books I downloaded for her. Factor in that it has a warranty and its perfect! Love it!
 Both of my sons love there tablets and FreeTime is pretty good price for all the books games and videos that are included.  All though my oldest son did have charging problems with his we seemed to have resolved it by buying a new charger and had no problems since ....my youngest hasn’t had any problems with his so far
 Bought as a Christmas present for my 4yo on Black Friday. Got it registered and setup for him on Christmas morning. At that time it looked like the content available through freetime was age appropriate and so, trusting Amazon’s parental controls and content filters, I let him use it unsupervised...<br/><br/>Tried to load some of our son’s movies to the devices internal storage via USB, but unfortunately it seems there’s no way to access internal storage without the parental control passcode... Giving the parental control password to our toddler is not really an option, which makes this thing pretty much useless without WiFi, if you want to use it as-intended out of the box. It sure was fun riding in the car three hours to visit family on Christmas while having to repeatedly explain to my toddler why he couldn’t use his new Christmas present...<br/><br/>Then it all got worse, MUCH worse. When we finally got back home, I decided to look into the internal storage playback issue some more to see if I could fix it. That’s when I noticed what you see in the first two pictures. That’s right, the top suggest video for my 4yo was now “Cabin in the Woods”, a rated-R horror movie full of ghosts/demons, pagan rituals, and human sacrifice. I thought maybe it was just a bug and it was just showing the wrong title photo, but I was able to play the entire movie!<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>My initial review prompted a swift response from amazon customer service. Turns out it was I who accidentally added the R-rated content to free time. It’s very easy to accidentally select content that is NOT kid safe, and there are no warnings or safeguards against it, so be VERY careful when adding content from prime video for your kids to watch online. Turning Free Time off/on again doesn’t clear out everything, so you’ll have to carefully search for and remove any accidentally loaded content.<br/><br/>Customer service confirmed that there is no way for me to upload my own content to the tablet for my kids to watch offline through the kid-friendly interface; I would have to either give them the passcode that unlocks everything, or change their account to an adult account and try to rely on regular parental controls, which would NOT block them from seeing adult video/book cover art in the store. So I’m stuck with either WiFi only, or re-purchasing all my kids favorites through Amazon video.
 THE WARRANTY IS AWESOME!!! it is really easy and convenient for both kids and adults to use. Super easy to switch between profiles, so your kids do not get into your stuff, and you do not get into your kid's stuff. The battery lasts for a long time. Feels very durable. Very quick, no freezing/buffering/loading like other tablets.
 They changed the freetime profiles in such a way that it makes the tablet almost unusable for children who are either too young to read or have a disability that makes them unable to read. It's past my window to return so now I'm stuck with a "kids tablet" my kids can't use.<br/><br/>I spoke with Amazon support about this issue and was blown off.
 I didn’t expect this to be some incredible machine but it won’t even open the application, whether it be a book, game, or video over half the time. AOL was quicker to login to in the early 90s. It’s shocking it’s even possible to make a product that works this poorly. We wanted it for a cross country trip for our toddler. It shipped late and now we can’t eveb get something different in time for the trip. We’re returning.
 The tablet is pretty slow, and battery doesn’t hold charge that well.  My daughter do use it a lot, a few hours at a time, and we basically have to charge it every time. But she loves a lot of the apps, and has became so good at putting puzzles together.  I mean she is 2, and putting 30 pieces together! I feel the hardware is somewhat below my expectation, but the child mode is awesome!
 My toddler goes between loving and having this. He had an iPad first which is probably why. It's much slower, takes forever to download anything or even open an app, and the battery life is awful. The case does do a great job of preventing anything happening to the screen. When he does play on it, the puzzels are great and all the books are nice to have.
 I purchased this for my 3.5 year old for Christmas. This is his first tablet. I am very impressed! The tablet comes loaded with TONS of content and I can't recommend Amazon Freetime more. I love that  he has access to fun content that has been hand picked for his age. The parental controls are also awesome and very easy to set up and manage.<br/><br/>I also LOVE the fact that this tablet includes multiple user profiles. That means that when my son isn't using it, I can use it for my own personal use! Great purchase!
 My son loves this.  I got him a different tablet first and he  wouldn't use it.  He uses the fire 7 for hrs.  It's really lightweight which i love because my son is young.  The bumper is great.  It's very easy to set up. I can even use it,  and my account has a pass code so it's very safe for kids to not be able to access anything that's not kid friendly.  It has alexa on it too, my favorite feature for me. The fire 7 is a great purchase.
 Excellent perfect for toddlers! We bought it for our one year old and the learning apps available are outstanding the tablet functions great! A little slow on charging but holds the charge well!<br/><br/>Update: after using this product it’s a definit NO unless your child is over 5 years old but then you run into the problem that they can access the parental side fairly easily! For the younger ones there is too much to scroll through and download they can’t find what they are looking for! It’s almost impossible for them to find their favorites with out a regular home screen!
 I ordered a bundle of two (Blue and Yellow).  The blue one looked like it was a return, which was repackaged as the accessories were loose in the box. After my kid used it for a couple of weeks, I can now confirm that he does not hold a charge for very long!  It also reboots inadvertently.  They are both slow to load as well.  I guess in retrospect, I would go with a higher end model.  Buyer beware!
 A lot of issues to talk about. First I have 2 kids Fire Tablets. Both sync each others data with each other and when space is already limited on this it quickly make the devices unusable. Consistently have issues with wireless. The device will lose connectivity to the already saved wireless profile Even though it says it is connected. If you forget that profile and attempt to re add it says there are authentication problems even after validating the credentials. I want to return these and get a product that will actually work and not waste time fixing problems that take a full wipe of the device. Never will I recommend a Fire Tablet to anyone. Waste of hard earned money.
 I have bought 2 and currently in the process of buying a 3rd!  My kids love this!  It's super durable and very easy for them to use!  I love the "just for kids" setup a being able to block out any nonsense that is not appropriate for them!  I would buy this a million times!!!!
 I love the fact that it has a setting where kids have to complete the designated time for educational exercises before they can access the entertainment games and videos. And I really appreciate parents have easy to set controls to keep children from accessing adult sites and inappropriate videos. My child continues to learn and can be rewarded with games &amp; videos they love! Opted for this tablet versus The Switch and got more bang for my buck! Worth the purchase!
 We cracked up our iPad mini and decided to save some money by getting this. It is so incredibly frustrating to use. You can't do searches of just the videos. Its very slow moving from one screen to another. I was thinking it would just have apps that you can add like a regular tablet. But no, there are fixed screens with only Amazon content on it. We will be going back to an iPad.
 The tablet itself is wonderful!!!! The battery lasts quite awhile. With the case on, it's virtually indestructible. However, should something go wrong with it....the "no questions asked" warranty is not no questions asked. You have to call them and the hoops you have to jump through to get it replaced is rediculous! If it really were no questions asked and I could do everything online instead of having to call and sit and wait to speak to someone....then I would give 5 stars.
 Yuk. I am an amazon fan. This is - Slow cumbersome and very hard to navigate. I thought after a few months this would get easier but still confusing between all the profiles passwords, what works offline what doesn’t, what comes with a kids subscription. Also very very slow. We end up using an iPad with parent controls on. Much more familiar and easier interface.
 I wouldn't recommend this tablet. There are too many charging port problems. Both my kids have and both have been replaced because they would no longer charger. One of the replacements has once again stopped charging and Amazon will not replace as the warranty from the original just ran out. We will be looking elsewhere for something of better quality. It unfortunate Amazon will not stand behind thier hardware issues.
 This childproof paperweight is really stretching the truth calling itself a tablet. It's terribly slow, has hardly any storage, and adding an sd card gives it seizures. It's extremely difficult to give the kids profile access to content that's not within the Amazon ecosystem and the content that is, isn't accessible consistently. My son is 3 and he hates this tablet. A device for children should excite them, not frustrate them. Waste of time and money. My son prefers to use our old Samsung tab A that won't hold a charge and keeps restating over this useless piece of trash.
 My only complaint is that this is meant for a child...and doesn't contain a screen lock. Also, there are no reliable apps that do screen lock for it either. So I can't give it to my toddler to watch shows because he keeps tapping the screen everywhere. The only use we have is to attach it to the car for road trips.
 The all new Fire 7 kids Edition is a big hit at our house. We bought our 4 year old one two Christmas ago, the last few months we had her 3 year old brother and two year old sister fighting over her device. Finally I gave up and bought two more. Yay!! The three kids sit side by side each happy with their  own "I-pad" according to them. Thank goodness for three different colors! We have had absolutely no problems with the original breaking, etc. We highly recommend the device!
 The tablet stopped charging after a year. I purchased it for my nephews 6th birthday.<br/>It stopped charging by his 7th birthday. I was excited about the promise of "return no matter what" up to 2 years. I wish I had read more of the reviews before purchasing. I'm giving it 2 stars because there was no issues while it worked.
 It seems like it's up to par fo the price.  We purchased this so my 2 year old could have his own device for watching Disney cartoons because he always wants his sisters phone when she is using it... and only when she is using it!!!  LOL!!  There is some lag when accessing things like Disney Now but for the price you can't expect much more.
 We bought our daughter a Kindle kids edition and the battery drained so quickly that overnight it would go down to zero. We called customer support and they had us do a factory reset saying that might fix the problem then we do that, the kids free time app now freezes does not show icons has problems downloading items. I called customer support again and they said they can take it back and try to fix it or give us a refurbished one I bought this Kindle 7 days ago and already I'm getting a used item in replacement for the brand new Kindle I just bought. Luckily I am still within my return window it is definitely going back.
 Don’t like the fact that the parental controls don’t automatically come on it. It’s a kids tablet. My son was buying things without my knowledge and they charged my card $50 more than once for some subscription. The tablet is really boring and not worth the $100 i spent for it.
 I finally broke down and brought my newly nine year old her own Kindle... And she loves it!!  I love the Kid Zone so I don't have to worry about her online safety... Really great product 😁😁😁
 The battery stopped charging after one year.<br/>And my second one had to be replaced after a couple months because of a bad port.<br/>*So follow up they told me that they would give me a refund but they gave me $7 when I returned it!  Now I'm out 99.00 and I can't even take the tablet to get fixed properly!
 Fastest shipping ever! I ordered this tablet last night with free shipping so I expected it next week. Nope! Showed up today! Wow!<br/><br/>Love these tablets (we now have three, one for each of our children). They are so easy to navigate and choosing what content my kids can download is a major plus. Thanks Amazon!
 3rd time replacing this tablet because it stops charging.  Dont like that you have to do all these extra steps to download Google play . Only good thing is the replacement warranty but everytime it's replaced I lose everything I had on the old tablet including games I've paid for
 Not a huge fan of the kid free program, sometimes she just wants to watch a Netflix movie and it won’t let her, no matter how I do the settings. It’s kinda slow at processing, and maybe were just spoiled with the iPad, but my 5 year old isn’t a big fan of this tablet.
 My grandson loves all extras that came with this tablet and so do I.  I hope that the charging port does not go out on this one like his last Fire tablet.  The one complaint I have is that the case does not have a stand or cover, so I have ordered another that does.  I think they should consider making a case for this kids tablet that has a stand and cover.
 My son is very hard on tablets. His last one lasted three months before he dropped it and stepped on it so much that the screen cracked. And that was with a foam padded case! This tablet has held up so far with the punishment and he loves it. Freetime is a great app that keeps him safe from apps with advertisements. Love the tablet all around.
 I bought this for my son last year. It doesn’t have much storage on it and it isn’t user friendly to navigate from the parental side. My son doesn’t have trouble using it from the child perspective and seems to enjoy it. After having it one year (with limited play time), the charger no longer works.
 Was skeptical at first based on some of the previous kid tablets I’ve purchased. Love the timer feature, soft case, and functionality of the device. I gave it four stars because it freezes up every now and then and the ‘unlimited free time’ that features the wonderful apps and games is only active for one year. Then you have to purchase the app if you want to keep the apps/games. Comparable tablets offer games permanently installed within device. We’ll see how it holds up.
 My son who is not 9nly clumsy but is notorious for accidentally breaking things has had this tablet for 6 months without ever having an issue with it! We have added several apps without issues, put passcodes on them, and parenteral control. Love them so far!
 I like it, all things considered.  No Google Play Store on this though, which is disappointing because the kids have paid apps on their Google accounts that they can't get to.  I've heard you can jail break them but you open yourself up to all kinds of calamity so we chose not to.  But if we had one wish it would be for Google and Amazon to kiss and make up and make this tablet awesome.
 This product was great until after only 5 short months it stopped charging. I've tried every troubleshoot that I could possibly find and think of. Now I am trying to find out how I go about returning it, as it says 2 year warranty, easy return, no questions asked, but they make it hard by not providing information on how to return it. Any info or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
 Wish i had read the reviews more carefully. Tablet lost charge about 6 weeks in and no concept of returns of a faulty product. Currently i have sent this to be repaired, hoping that i will not be sending it back in another 6 weeks. Lousy product for Amazon to sell and support.
 My 3 year old loves this tablet it has the pre installed toddler games, it has the best warranty! Its very easy to navigate my son has been threw 3 tablets this one right here has saved me so much money an time because he could not navigate the others as he can this one . it has the best case for toddlers he has dropped it 6 times an nothing any other one would of been sitting there with a broken screen so yes this is by far the best tablet for ages 1-any age because not only dose it have all that but you can also create a parent user an use it as any regular tablet with all the functions as any other i give 5 starts
 We bought 3 for our kids. I love that you can you control how much time they spend on it and content they can/cannot see. I’m not the most tech savvy person, so I could be missing something, but I don’t like how they can download at any time and then they use up a lot of storage. I have to keep monitoring how much they download. Overall, it meets our needs for what we wanted.
 Excellent tablet. We have had it for two years, and it works great. We did have problems with the battery not staying charged. The customer service was great. They walked us through some trouble shooting issues. A week late it was doing the same thing again, so they sent me a shipping label. We mailed the tablet in, and the new arrived just over a week later. I would definitely purchase this again for my other kids.
 Bought for 2yr old niece and she loves it. Fun educational and art games. Love the fact so many games can be played offline. From potty training to alphabet, numbers, barber , Animal feeding cooking type activity games. Also movies, disney, nickoledein and other shows . keeps her occupied and learning at the same time in car, doctors spots etc.
 I purchased one each for my son and daughter. It's a normal Kindle Fire but with the FreeTime and case...and two year warranty. The case is amazing...lightweight and durable! The kindles have been dropped, thrown, and stepped on, but they are as good as new!
 I got one for each of my kids for Christmas last year. They loved them but within 3 months they stopped charging. Both of them! I was so upset! I called amazon and they replaced them which I thought was amazing. My son’s tablet is working fine, my daughter’s has been nothing but issues. Apps will not open half the time. When she tries to open apps it will open something that is above or beside what she is pressing on. It takes forever to download. These things have been nothing but junk and I will never buy another one. Next time I will spend a little extra money to get something that is better quality. Save you and your child the frustration!
 I bought two of these tablets less than a year ago for my children, the announcement says that they come with two years of warranty, I break it and they change it for me. But of course I'm going to break it if it's made with the worst materials, the life of the battery is a joke and in passing the recharging port is easily damaged. what is the use of creating a product for children who need to constantly recharge to watch videos, read books or play if the usb port gets damaged so easily. I had to send to repair the two tablets 3 times in less than a year. I am already tired, disappointed.
 My  7 yr old grandson loves this tablet, however he had gone through 6 of them. He has 2 new ones and the problem we have repeatedly is getting them to charge. I bought new chargers and even with that the connection to the charger site seems to always have an issue. Lately every time they do get charged the tablet says woops there seems to be an error and I have to shut down and restart. The newest tablet was a free tablet as a replacement of another one that would not turn on and seems to have the worse time getting it to charge, most likely refurbished. if it wasn't for this charging issue, the only other issue is you have to keep removing apps due to storage full even with a sim card in place, kind of a pain.
 These tablets are great...when they work.  My kids love them.  But the charging port they install in these tablets are horrible.  I've lost count of how many I've sent back. Thank goodness for the 2 year replacement program or they would've been gone a longgggggg time ago!
 It is very handy to have on long car rides or places where a kid may be bored. The battery life isn’t as good as some of the other tablets I have used, but my daughter uses it quite often for the learning apps. The case is super durable and has protected the tablet from many falls. Its a really great thing to have and the price is amazing!!
 So far the only thing I can say is that it is pretty neat! I love how you can read books to the kids, have them play games, and watch kid shows. The casing is cheap like I thought it was rubber, it is not it is like plastic foam stuff but it'll hold up to drops. I don't know about an actual toddler disaster because my son is 4 going on 5 and he is pretty good with electronics, my daughter on the other hand who is 2 going on 3 would probably destroy it in a month. It is for Christmas this year so I can not give you my 100% opinion as far as storage and all but I will try and post more about it later.
 Thank you Sweet Golden Baby Jesus for the Amazon Fire Tablet and the indestructible kiddos case it comes with. Cheaper than and iPad and gives basically the same educational, tech and self-focused results for our kid (7 yo and 3.5 yo). Bought two tablets and can honestly say it was one of my wiser parenting decisions to date.
 Got the fire a little over a week ago. We charged it for its first initial charge. And now it doesn’t charge whatsoever. And no one will respond to me. This sucks.
 My kids were so excited about get tablet for Christmas. The only thing I wish it would have come with was more memory. My boy love to learn and as a military family we travel ALOT! Don't get me wrong I was very pleased with the durability of the them! When you on a plane for 6hr. Or in car 26hr They kinda get bored with the same old stuff.
 This tablet is great for my 2 year old,he loves it.Important to note:If you want them to use youtube,switch to the regular fire mode to download the app it's thier,I had trouble with this early on,but now everything is covered.I choose this over the 8 inch because it would be easier for him to hold. He throws the tablet around,comes with a case nothing ever happens to it,its built to last.My child uses this for his YouTube machine,but Amazon free time does have alot of content on it.Parental controls are great and allows you to fully control what they watch and what apps they can and can't use in regular firemode.This will do the trick for kids any age and I highly recommend this product!
 If you're inquiring a tablet look no further this one is ahhhhmazing purchased it for my toddler and I can't put it down. We all have a inner child and mine will not let me stop playing the endless amount of games this tablet has lol.
 This is an amazing tablet. The case is solid even after a year and a half of my daughter having the tablet. its been dropped a few times on concrete and around the house and no damage was done. The freetime membership keeps everything kid friendly and my daughter has learned a lot using the tablets apps
 This is the perfect tablet for children. My 2.5 year old loves hers and she can operate perfectly on her own. It has helped her in her potty training journey. She watches Daniel Tiger potty training videos, that she downloaded on her own, while she goes to the potty. I will be buying another one when my son gets older.
 I bought one for me and one for my son. You really can't beat everything that you get for the price. Freetime unlimited is great and keeps my son from venturing into the scary parts of the internet. The case didn't look like much but the tablet feels very protected inside. I do wish the battery life was a little better. Using the tablet is OK but there's occasional lag and it doesn't transition between apps and whatever else very smoothly. Don't expect a tablet that can compete with an iPad or other bigger tablet. It is perfect for reading and watching videos.
 What a mistake was this purchase.<br/>When you are traveling, Try explaining to your kid that the video he wants to see (or anything on the carousel for that matter), isn't  available due to geographical licensing restrictions.<br/><br/>Should have gone with any cheap android tablet.
 I purchased this tablet almost a year ago and I didn’t have any issues with. Recently my son damaged the screen so we sent it in and they said it couldn’t be fixed. So another one was sent to us, and I’m positive it’s refurbished we’ve had nothing but problems with it. When my son tries to open an app nothing happens I have to turn it off and back on for it to work and it does it again shortly after. And a message always pops up “oops something went wrong”. I don’t understand why someone else’s problem was sent to me instead of an attempt to fix the screen.
 It's a good tablet for my 5 year old grandson. Bought the cover this time to protect it from breakage. Screen shattered on first fire we got for him. A
 I bought this in 2017 for my great grandson he loves it ....BUT now there is a problem with it and no one is answering where I need to send it Because its under a warranty.
 Six of these have been owned in my household. Two have failed in the same place. The USB charging port is not kid friendly. After a while, with kids plugging it in every day, it fails. 66% success rate is terrible. The kids edition needs a USB-C charging port! Amazon, please step into the future now and start putting USB-C ports on all your devices. It is so much better for kids...and everyone!
 So far so good! I purchased two for the special price of $75 each because I have twins. They’re 26 months and they love it. They have no problem scrolling through and figuring out how to use the tablet. It was fairly easy to set up. Not being used to an android, I did call the Tech phone number a few times and the people answering couldn’t have been more helpful.
 My daughter loves this and it's definitely useful for long trips or to keep them occupied watching their favorite show or movie. This isthe second one she had after the first one shattered when it fell. Amazon was great and stood by their warranty and replaced it with no questions asked, even though it was originally bought as a gift from Best Buy.
 After less than one year, unable to return item with a 2 year no worry guarantee,  it stopped charging, unable to speak to anyone to get it replaced
 I bought this for my middle son's birthday earlier this year. A few days ago, the charging process slowed down to where it is taking literally a full day to charge. Even overnight of charging is not enough. I haven't called about getting it replaced yet, but 8 months is a very short life span for a tablet.
 Every single time I change screens or what have you in the parental mode I HAVE TO RE-ENTER THE PASSWORD. EVERY SINGLE TIME. And a three fold paper to tell you how to plug it in, and what the buttons mean. That’s it. Smh
 What I disliked was I could only register one grandchild so they all played under one name.  They love this tablet and have a hard time waiting for the hour to be over so they can play their hour.  I wish I could afford one for each of them.  I love the parent control.
 The device + case is sturdy for my 3 year old, and the concept is great... but the child's interface not as intuitive as I'd hoped. Ultimately, I had to return it because every app or movie we added to our child's profile wouldn't work. We followed instructions and downloaded 6GB worth of entertainment, games, apps, etc but never could get them to work on the child profile. The apps showed up on the child's profile and when we clicked on it, it appeared to be 'working' (icon spinning) but would never actually load. Easy return process though.
 I just love it.<br/>Its kid friendly easy for them to use they can't get anything that they should not have or see.<br/>Light weight they can hold easily and I love the protection it comes with the cover and the screen protector. I love every thing about it
 Exellent product! My daughter love it!!... With the option of a free year in applications and games for my girl, she enjoys a world. Not to mention the protective case, is very comfortable when holding it with your little hands. And I really liked the ability to alternate between the common profile of a tablet and the right profile for it. only with a key that I administer myself. Fully recommended this product for children.
 It's okay.  My child will love it but I wish I was able to lock the feature to download more apps so she won't overwhelm the storage. Not very high tech. A bit lackluster tbh but for a 4 year old it's fine. Wish I could set a custom wallpaper for the kids mode as well.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R4QWMRBVROHJF"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1aCxSE1+iS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812iMhgPNfS.png"/> I purchased this tablet for my one year old for Christmas . He only had it for a month and it froze up two times already. The first time it was frozen for a hour. I tried everything nothing works. I tried turning off and plugging it in but it still remains frozen.
 my kids love these tablets.  A little too much sometimes, I have to limit there screen time or they would play these all day.  My daughters tablet had an accident and the screen was cracked all the way across.  I called and was emailed a shipping label to send it back.  It took about a little over a week but they sent us a new tablet.  I am very impressed with their customer service.
 I do love this, but I wish there was more customization allowed on the menu. I want to arrange things in particular orders. And I want to delete entire categories (I don't like the video option). You can lock it in parental control, but I rather it just not be there at all.<br/><br/>That being said, there are some AMAZING apps. Anything by Toca or Sego Mini is rad.
 Only had them since Xmas but the kids love them. Only thing that I don’t like is the storage is so pointless which makes you have to buy an external sd card just to have some applications and games. Takes a while to download even on a fast WiFi connect and I wish you could change the background wallpaper to something more kid like. Other than that it’s so far so good.
 My granddaughter loved it before she broke it and I was happy to replace it for her--but had to pay full price for it despite the guarantee to replace it for free.
 These tablets are so unreliable! It's maddening! They stop downloaded randomly, so we have to triple check things are downloaded. They delete downloads when reconnected to the internet even for the briefest time, they aren't easy to lock while in media (for 2yo watching and bumping screen), they freeze frequently...We have 2, so I know it's not 1 device. I wanted to like these, but I struggle to find anything positive. Particularly considering they're children's tablets.
 We got our first tablet this past December for Christmas. At first I loved it &amp; rexomnded it to everyone with kids. It stopped charging a few months later. Used the warranty &amp; amazon sent a “referbished” one that didn’t work. Sent that back &amp; customer service gave us such a hard time that we ended up going to Best Buy for a new one. Literally two months later and this one is working like crap too. My son isn’t rough with it. We only use the chargers that come with the product. He isn’t on it 24/7. It’s literally just a piece of crap and I’m very disappointed. Looking into a new tablet or iPad that will actually work for my little one.
 I purchased two of these...One I couldn't ever get to even set up and be used and the other one didn't last a year...the charger quit working then even when purchasing another charger the charger port quit working. Pretty disappointed in this product
 This tablet worked okay for us. It was suuuuuper slow at times, which as you can imagine, can be frustrating for a toddler. It also froze numerous times, requiring a hard restart. Tonight, our 22 month old son dropped it on our floor, and the screen cracked in about 5 places. Given the thickness of the blue rubber case, we were shocked at the amount of cracks we saw. Now the screen is almost a hazard due to the rough edges of the glass. We expected much more from this product.  It makes me wish we had gone with an Apple product.
 Honestly ive never gave anything a bad review in my life but this is pretty terrible its not "for kids" its barely user friendly for an adult letting my child use an old crappy cell phone was unfortunately 10 times more efficient the layout was more simple it worked right it downloaded faster was excited to get my child something "nice" terrible purchase your child would have a better chance figuring out a whole computer on there own.
 I have purchased 3 regular fire tablets, one kids.kindle and all 4 of them stopped charging due to.a loose port. The kids kindle was replaced by Amazon under the factory 2 year warranty and did not even last 2 months. They are going to replace this one too. But how long will it last? As far as the regular fire,no replacement,as the warranty is for only 90 days. Just out the money on those. Seeing as most of these reviews state the same thing,you would think they could fix this issue....
 Don’t count on getting the free time unlimited that is supposedly “included” with this purchase!  Apparently, if you have multiple kids sharing a profile, it is—and I quote—“impossible” for Amazon to give you the year’s subscription on any subsequent devices.  And furthermore, they are completely unapologetic about the fact that they won’t do anything to make up for the loss in value of those subsequent device purchases.<br/><br/>Instead, the multi-billion dollar business that is Amazon just walks away with that money without providing all “included” features of your purchase.
 I bought the tablets for my 1 year old grandchildren.  They don't quite know how to use the device but I'm confident they will learn in no time.  I used it to read a couple of books and it was user friendly. It was everything I expected it to be!!!
 I have been a loyal amazon customer for over 9 years and I trusted this when it said “amazons choice “ but do not buy this ! I bought it for my son and it says on it “ free unlimited free time for a year !” But the tablet won’t last a year. This tablet had a warranty so I called the technicians within the first few months of having it because it would no longer charge .... now this “new” replacement they sent will also NOT hold a charge ! It’s garbage , don’t waste your money .
 I cannot even begin to explain what a savior this has been. I have a 2.5 year old who doesn’t speak much at all. We try to read books to him but he loses interest and wants nothing to do with them. Enter the Fire 7. He has had it less than a month and is speaking more sentences, interacting with the tablet, and getting excited while I read him books off of it.<br/>Also, he has to sit through a lot of his brothers’ sporting events and he’s “busy” to say the least. This has helped keep him calm and occupied (as well as other players’ siblings) so we can watch games.
 My son loves it and I love that it comes with the one year of free time. One thing I didn’t see in reviews was how lightweight the case is. It’s like a rubberish texture but the weight of foam. It doesn’t come with a built in screen protector or any screen protectors so you do have to purchase one separately but it’s a really great buy.<br/><br/>Also it came with my account signed in already and I thought that was pretty awesome because it made setting it up so easy. All I had to do was turn it on and make him a kids account which only takes a minute.
 My grand babies love their tablets, they can’t get enough of the educational games. My daughter loves them because everything is geared towards kids, no need to worry about adult content sneaking in. The tablets so far seem to be very sturdy, a 5 and 6 year old have not broken them after two weeks of use.
 It's easy to use however it is very sluggish and can freeze completely a quick restart of the device helps this. My biggest complaint is when u go offline you get a warning message everytime you try and play a downloaded video stating you can use the video for 48hrs then u need to reconnect to wifi to use it again. Fine I understand the reasoning but my son has a short 4 min video and it pops up EVERYTIME and makes it difficult for him to navigate the device they need to include a I understand feature so you only have to acknowledge this warning 1 time in the 48 hr period
 I probably should have done a little more research but this tablet is not good. Being that it is 2017, I did not expect a product worse than my 2013 Nexus 7. The screen sucks (poor resolution and color), the performance is terrible (slow!), and battery life is not good. I feel guilty letting my son use this but I guess it's my fault for expecting too much from a $60-$100 tablet.<br/><br/>UPDATE: To add my frustrations, I didn't realize Freetime was bundled. I wasted 10 minutes canceling and getting a refund. DO NOT BUY THIS.
 I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she has not put it down since she's got it. I love how you can make them do educational things before them getting on apps and I love how you can make it turn on and shut off at certain times so they do not get too much screen time. The bumper that comes with it is so nice too. Well worth the price!
 Perfect size and form for my young son to use. Rugged, good warranty. Free Time is a good service. The age appropriate content is decent. The only depressing part is Google's decision to block the Youtube app from the device. While I guess Amazon bears some responsibility for not selling rival Google's devices, I won't knock Amazon's devices for that decision.
 I got this for my granddaughter. It's actually perfect. You make a profile for them and it tailors the apps to their age. Its crazy how much is available to her. No problem finding something to entertain her. The case is soft so it makes it easy for little hands to hold onto it The best thing is that it has the 2 yr warranty if anything happens to it you just send back and they replace it.
 We haven't had this tablet but maybe just a couple weeks and it has stopped working.  A few days ago, apps stopped responding. Yesterday the tablet froze completely (even the volume and power buttons failed to respond) while sound from Doc McStuffins continued to play in the background until the battery died. Twice. As of today, the darn thing won't even turn on. My todder and I are frustrated to say the least.
 Cons:<br/>Very slow<br/>you mostly need internet<br/>Battery runs out quickly if you forget to turn it off ( but that’s also a pro sometimes)<br/>Screen is low res after being used to iPad retina<br/>Pros:<br/>Keeps kid occupied<br/>Gives a timeframe on how long he can use it<br/>Easy for kid to control by himself<br/>Preloaded with stuff (though you still have to click for it to download before first use)<br/><br/>Overall a good but for the bargain price (was $70 on sale)
 Great for kids!  The case makes it pretty resistant to the frequent drops.  Only challenge is, it would be great if app downloading would not be allowed without initial setup required upon startup.  I was very surprised when I started receiving charges for apps being downloaded. The tablets were a gift and I had not anticipated paying for apps.  App downloading was allowed and charged to my account without even the need to provide a password.  This seems like a flaw.  Thankfully, Amazon was great in reversing these charges once discovered.
 Started off fine, but software updates from Amazon seem to keep slowing it down.<br/><br/>The amount of bloat it keeps getting through software updates grows, requiring me to constantly juggle installed apps or offline movies.<br/><br/>It does a really poor job of holding a charge when not in use.  A iPad not in use can last weeks, a Fire Tablet can be unused for a few days and you will come to find it completely drained of charge.
 I bought 4 of these for an upcoming trip with the kids. If I had realized, and not trusted amazon's advertising and reviews or parents that park their kids in front of these home, I would have bought something else. Offline content is a headache that has taken me, someone that's reasonably tech savy, WAAAAAAAY too long. Save yourself.
 Incredibly easy for my 2 and a half year old to use.  She can play games, watch videos, take pictures in a safe space.  She cannot download anything I have not approved.  Locked with a pin number. Easy to troubleshoot when removing and replacing apps and videos.
 So you know the "access to 15,000 popular apps and games, videos, books, and educational content" you can have through FreeTime Unlimited? Ya, only if you have wifi. Wanna download one of those shows to use on a plane? NOPE!! Oh, so you know how you can download shows through your prime account? Wanna share those with your kid on their tablet so they can watch in a plane? NOPE!!  Sure, they can watch downloaded prime shows, but using your account and the regular interface, not the kid-friendly interface. So I just bough a regular tablet with a doughy case.
 5&amp;6 year old kids. Not worth it!!! Toooooo many choices of content makes it difficult to choose for them as well as figure out what to block for me. Nice parental controls but the lag time for opening apps/games or downloading new ones is a time suck. Battery does NOT last, I.e. you’re charging it every day. We also bought all the Osmo stuff to match, also NOT worth it. Kids played a few times, it’s repetitive without being fun.
 I have bought 6 of these, they do not last long at all, won't charge. Waste of money, spend more and get the kids something better. The only good thing was access to all the games, books etc, but if you only have this item for a few months, still not worth it.
 Absolute success.  This is the second firs 7 kids edition at let I have purchased.  Only difference was the color is brothers know which one is theirs.  It was as I predicted. Th eolder child immediately gave his tablet to the younger child and wanted the new one.  Silly boys.
 My 3.5 year old daughter loves it. The case looks pretty sturdy and seems it will protect it properly from breaking.<br/>Screen (Display) clarity is very good I would assume Fire 8 to be better, but this is more than what kids will desire. It comes with one year air time subscription so it has plenty of apps to keep your little ones busy
 Es una buena tablet para niños pequeños. Me gustaría que viniera con youtube kids y una batería de mejor rendimiento
 I love the idea of this tablet. I hate that you basically have to block each app on free time individually and then unblock the ones you want your child to access. Super unhappy with it for that reason.
 It’s super slow for a kids tablet. Kids want things to load instantly. The fact that you can’t install Netflix is also terrible. Amazon video has the worst selection for kids videos. You get what you pay for. Spend a couple more dollars and get an iPad.
 My son is 3 turning 4 in July and LOVES his tablet. My son is a little rough with his sometimes so we shall see how it holds up. Now we've only had it a week but so far so good. I will do an update in about 6 months. However I do have a nephew who has had his for about a year now and he loves his as well...no problems.
 Awesome tablet! As usual the expectations for quality of build and usability were met with this edition of the Fire. Especially appreciated being able to set up child user and being able to monitor usage from my Fire. Kudos for including free year of Free Time.
 Hate this so much.  You have to download everything yet it comes with 400 plus things uploaded that only work on Wifi.  Bought it for a plane ride and a long car ride, huge hassle.  Will never recommend this -not user friendly and certainly not good for children if parents can't figure it out as well. We are Apple users and I have never witnessed such a mess in a tablet.
 Love it. It is lightweight and easy to use, my 7 year old is in heaven. Also, loving the freetime app, totally worth it. My favorite part is that I can be involved setting limitations but still give her the freedom she is looking for.
 Some good stuff for kids, but you can't preview the apps to see what they are before you download them. We wind up having to delete a lot of stuff because it isn't what we thought it might be.  That being said,  my 6 year old grandson seems to enjoy it a lot.
 We bought this tablet for our 4 kids to share - FreeTime is definitely what we needed! The tablet is fantastic, the format is simple for kids to use and we like the oversight we have over what they can install for games. Cons - the storage is zapped FAST! They only have a couple of games downloaded and the storage is often almost gone. I will need to buy a micro SD. If I had it to do over, I would definitely have bought it with more storage (I got it based on the amount I have on my phone, which is ample for me and 1000 photos, but apparently not for a couple of children's apps 😕)
 It made me put in my credit card number just to set up an account for my kid.... now I know how there are stories about kids buying stuff in their parents accts.  It isnt their parents.  I mean the tablet is called KIDS edition... a block for everything else.  And Alexa available only in grownup accts, that's dumb.  This again is my KIDS tablet.  They want the Alexa.  I dont need any features.  And let me just download on my KIDS acct.  I definitely loved the kurio setup way better.  My kids are too little to invest in iPad and all they do is watch YouTube and maybe play a game I download.
 I got this for my daughter for her 1st birthday and she loved it- she still loves it and she will be 3 in a couple months. I have had it replaced a couple times with the warrenty and that couldn't have been easier. I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend to anyone
 I bought three of these after reading lots of reviews. I wanted a tablet that I could utilize almost solely for educational purposes. However, the parental controls do NOT work. I have each child set up to read for a specified amount of time prior to playing, but it doesn't require them to. I have controls set to not allow them to download, but they can. I have purchased some educational videos that are shared with profiles and downloaded on my account on the device but will not download on the children's account. I should have gone with the iPad as it has guided access that I can lock them into a specific app.
 Thank you amazon for making this purchase a worry free one.  Not only is this kindle great for my kids to learn on, it comes with a free year of the free time subscription and there is so much content on their to keep my kids learning and entertained! The rubber casing is great at protecting from damage.<br/>I had an issue with one of the kindles not charging after 3 months and they replaced it with no questions asked in less then a week!  I would definitely recommend if you are thinking about a tablet for your child
 We bought the tablet for our 4 year old daughter who loves it. However, the frustrations are great when the tablet doesn't work with no internet service which makes car trips intolerable. Let alone the battery level only lasts three hours and that is when fully charged! And the frustrations on the parents end clearing out the thousands of apps, books, and videos that Amazon puts on the tablet for your child. Each of which need to be individually blocked. Yes, I have the settings targeted for our 4 year old... My 4 year old doesn't need apps on physics or biographies on political figures when she can't even read yet.
 This kindle is great for a 5 yr old especially a boy who likes to run around and drop things all the time. It has great apps on it specifically age appropriate apps and the battery last long too. I wish I would have waited a little longer because I bought it at $99 and it went on sale a month later for $79...all in all, it arrived on time, decent price and is still working great after 6 mos so far
 Overall a good little tablet. Apps and games are great for kids. Parental controls are good too. So far my little one is really enjoying this tablet.<br/>Foam drop case is great too. It really does protect the kindle. Easy setup and user friendly; easy to use.<br/><br/>Cons: Storage space is limited. Need to purchase extra storage (sd card). Tablet gets finicky when storage space starts to run low.
 Made the mistake of thinking i could save a few bucks and not shell out money for a better tablet for my daughter. Very very slow and lags constantly. I dont know if i have a bad unit but I am very disappointing.
 I gave it 2 starts because when it did work it was great ! I have had it for 6 months but my son only plays with it about once a week SUPERVISED so I was surprised when it wouldn’t turn on one day. I plugged it up for an entire 24 hours and it still won’t power up. I am very disappointed I didn’t read down into the reviews where other have had this issue. I am now seeing a lot of complaints about receiving a refurbished tablet. So I’m just going to return mine and go to target where I can get a tablet that will last!
 I was lured in by the price but I am disappointed with this tablet. Many of the video titles included in the  year subscription that comes with it are ads for full length features. It takes forever for things to load, way longer than a three year old wants to wait. Research what you can really do with this tablet and if it's what you want spend the money to buy a newer faster version.
 It doesn’t work outside USA, it’s quite a shame, you can’t play any video, the App Store doesn’t have all the apps you need
 this is a life saver. great set up for kids. easy to use. little bit slow on the download. we ran out of space soon because my dautghter is a selfie queen at the age of 4 lol. other than that i am super happy with my purchase.
 Lasted 6 months and the charging port would no longer work (with the supplied charger).  Sent it back to Amazon, they sent me a refurbished one that lasted 2 months and had to send it back again.  The third time it quit, I just bought a different one at best buy.  My daughter is really gentle with her tablet and this one did NOT hold up.
 it is a very great device! my kids watch Netflix and play games in the car. they love them. the case that it comes with is very durable! the UI for young children is great for my son that is 2. it has a lot of fun apps that are not littered with adds. overall I don't have any negatives. they arnt crazy beastly tablets but for the purposes of kids and some web browsing streaming they are not bad.
 The parental controls software is a disaster.  Good luck adding any software outside the Amazon store, endlessly entering parental passcodes, and some software is just inexplicably unsharable.  I have a Samsung and cant wait to pass it on to my son so I can throw this POS in the garbage.
 My 4yr old is in love with this tablet! She has special needs &amp; has a lot of learning delays &amp; other disabilities, this tablet let's her watch some episodes of different kid shows and play games she can understand.  She has a leap pad 2 and struggled to understand most of the games we tried.  We are so excited we ended up choosing this tablet!
 My son loves this. It is a pain to download things to the device. Also, does not hold a charge, I had it at 100% shut it off for a road trip, when we left the next day it was at 1%...I just have to plan to keep it plugged in before we use it in the car.
 They are great while they work. Battery issues on all 4 tablets that we have bought. Using my worry free guarantee on this one, and the lesson is learned. I will no longer purchase Amazon fire tablets.
 My kids love it, and I love how I can control how long they can play games on this tablet. Once there time runs out, it logs them out. So many online books for them to read as well, and don't have to worry about them going into a website, game, or books that is not appropriate for kids. I can see from my account if they have downloaded anything, or what games they have played and books they have read. It was worth every penny.
 I originally bought this tablet for my daughter for Christmas 2016, with one of the selling features being the '2 year, no questions asked replacement' warranty.  Well she cracked the screen with just about 2 weeks left to go in the warranty period and Amazon not only honored the replacement but had it turned around within a week of me returning the broken unit.  Well done Amazon!!
 My five year old loves this tablet. I just wish the battery would last longer. It always seems like I have to constantly charge it. The apps are easy and fast to download. He watches Netflix kids movies on it and the content looks clear. The volume is great.
 Amazing tablet for a kid! My son is two, I know its young but he always wanted mine so this was his Christmas present. He's not gentle with it, he's thrown it, dropped it, stepped on it, etc.. And it looks as good as it did straight out of the box! It's definitely durable, the case gives it alot of protection.<br/>Another thing we love about this tablet is the free games, videos, and books that come loaded on it. This tablet provides hours of entertainment, but you also have parental controls which allow you to limit screen time for your child.<br/>I highly recommend this tablet, the price is a little higher than a regular fire but it's definitely worth it! I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this item!
 This small tablet is perfect for my 8 year old grandson! I purchased this tablet to be used off line. The downloaded movies play great. I also like the process of purchasing movies, games and books, and adding them to the tablet. My daughter loves this tablet as my grandson is at work with her after school.
 I purchased this item, in December 2018, for the times when my great grandson comes to visit.  I see him approximately twice a month when he comes to visit for the day.  I limit his usage to no more than 30 minutes.  That means he has only used this tablet for no more than 5 - 6 times.<br/>The tablet no longer accepts an IP address so I am not able to connect it to our Wi-Fi.  It is very disappointing as I sent the seller a message explaining the problem and I have not heard back from them.
 Online search has found that others have this problem (even with non-kid version).<br/>Clicking search or some other function that requires a keyboard will either do nothing at all or show keyboard then rapidly remove it.<br/><br/>Also it is smaller than expected.
 After the screen finally broke on the tablet we had for our children, the search was on for a new one. With so many available (each doing roughly the same) we finally settled on the children's kindle. There is a payment plan available which is nice when you don't necessarily want to fork over $100+ right then and there. We also received one year free of the unlimited service. The tablet has been easy to use for both me and my kids. Set up is rather basic and I have found all the media to be acceptable for the age range assigned. I only worry a little about the case as it is made of a nerf type material.
 I'm so glad we bought this for our daughter. Now we can easily play her Peppa Pig and Bubble Guppies without having to give her our laptops or set her in front of the TV. So much more convenient than having her placed away from us or using our computers when we need them.<br/>It's also very easy to alternate between profiles (for adults) and children can easily navigate the Kids side of the tablet.<br/>The case it comes with is very resilient to tosses and drops as well. And if you have a kid who likes to gnaw on things, this will hold up really well to chewing too. Great product!
 This is the perfect tool<br/>For road trips or when you need some quiet time in the house. You can set time limits, time of day to turn on or shut off, or<br/>Give access to only books and learning tools. My toddler<br/>Finds it easy to navigate.
 Looks and works great.  I did have issues setting it up as a gift for Grandson.  The tablet assumes it should be mine due to the fact I have bought Kindles in the past.  It took me awhile to get the Kindle back to the Children's version.
 I honestly love this tablet for my daughter. I had purchased a different tablet for her Christmas present last year and regretted it. It hardly ever worked right and the battery life was..  Bad.  She had broken the power button on it since it was so flimsy. Hubby and I decided to go ahead and purchase this one.  First things first...  Amazon... Thank you so much for allowing payments on this item. That in itself was a life saver. And one of the biggest reasons why I decided to buy this tablet. Secondly,  2 year warranty worry free...YES PLEASE!  1 year unlimited freetime...  YEEEEEESSSSSSS! Child age appropriate content,  access to thousands, literally thousands of books,  games,  videos etc,  safety,  parental control,  ability to watch Netflix, have abcmouse, great battery life...  A DREAM COME TRUE!!!  The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because it takes a while to download games,  books etc and I wish there was a way to put her favourites in one spot she could easily choose from. Also be able to give her a cute background pic would be lovely. Those are the only reasons why it's 4 stars from me.  Other than that, I am definitely buying my boys their own when their current tablets hit the broken down stage.  Cuz they are horrible quality.  Really really should have gotten these from the beginning.  I highly recommend this product! My daughter can't get enough of all the fun to be had!
 After 4 months the unit won't charge. My grandson is very disappointed and the time to report this has expired in October. This product lacks longevity and there is no way to talk to anyone about it.
 Kinda difficult to set up and get the apps downloaded so that I can use it without internet. I got it for my 2 year old niece so she would stop using my cell phone all the time. She had no interest in the tablet until I told her it was my new cell phone.
 Love all the apps for kids but you can't download very many,<br/>  I am really disappointed with the $40.00 two year warranty. Yes it replaced my grandsons device but I had to buy another two year warranty in order for the new one to be covered. When I buy that warranty it should cover at least 2 or three a year. Especially when it come with a protective case. I would give it a 4.5 if the warranty was better.....
 Perfect gift for my grand baby. Got this for her for her 1st bday. Peace of mind with the 2 year hassle free damage return policy.  She loves it. Perfect size,  great price and frees up mom and dads phone when she wants to watch a movie.  Great for car rides too!
 Love this tablet. Its perfect for kids. The "free time" let's them play fun and educational games. The case it comes in is AMAZING! They are constantly dropping them and we haven't had a problem yet. I attribute that to the kid proof case. Keeps it safe. Best tablet for kids!
 Tables are all the rage now &amp; my 8 year old wanting one is no exception. Not quite comfortable with him having an expensive tablet, we went with this one.<br/><br/>I love the easibility of the tablet but I wish there was a way for him to ask for permission to download the games without my having to put the password in every single time.
 I bought it during Black Friday sale. Tablet is pretty descent. There is a boticvle lag while in kid mode that at times is very frustrating when u have impatient kids. But other than that it serves its purpose. Also, I still can’t figure out how to download YouTube kids
 Easy to set up and use parent controls. The Freetime subscription is so easy, no adding each individual app, it’s already there and ready to use. Got one for my 8 year old and 5 year old, both had no trouble using and enjoying. Battery does go quick so you’d want a charger for a long trip.
 I got this for my son's 2 year birthday and he loves it! The children's profile is excellent, and I've created other profiles also. One, so I can read on his tablet and one for Netflix, because he loves movies.<br/>Takes a bit to download the children's apps on his profile, but it's been 100% worth it for us.<br/>He loves the ABC games and has learned quite a bit from this gadget!<br/>Plus the case is DURABLE.
 I love it! Exactly what I was looking for when I needed it for my daughter! She loves the free time unlimited and I love peace of mind that she isn’t seeing anything bad. I wish I had ordered one with more storage but otherwise we are happy!
 Love this for my three year old- great content with FreeTime.  She loves it too!  However, I didn't realize it only works on wifi, and now I'm going to have to figure out how to add storage and download content to use on a trip.  I guess I'm used to an iPhone or iPad where you just click and go.  I'm not really technically adept and I turn on a laptop once or twice a year so...
 Love the ability to restrict access to certain things. Our daughter calls it her alphabet and has learned a lot since we bought it. We bought it because she had her tonsils and adenoids out and needed something to keep her calm for 10 days. Did a great job.
 I bought my child this tablet 1 year ago. It has been an excellent tablet. It has been dropped from time to time and the thick cover protects it well. All the apps that have been downloaded are free and there are tons of really good apps. As an adult, I like that I can switch it over to my Fire and use it as a regular tablet if needed. I did have to buy an SD card for extra memory because the tablets memory doesn’t go very far.<br/>-The only downfall to the tablet was the USB port became loose and the charging cord would not stay plugged in. I contacted Amazon and they replaced the tablet right away. It comes with a 2 year warranty which is amazing!! Overall this is an excellent buy!
 Why does the parental controls, not control the volume? And why advertise adult movies &amp; not kid ones? And then the whole issue of downloading them... I appreciate it &amp; thinks it's a great idea. But maybe make a tablet literally for kids, with parental controls for the volume.
 Easy to set up. My 5yr old loves it and we love the parental controls. We had an issue with charging after a few weeks. Sent it back thru Amazon warranty. Quick and painless. After a few days got notification l was fixed and it was being sent back. Probably my sons fault not the product but thats why we bought this one. The no hassle 2yr warranty is great!
 Tablet has a children mode to prevent them from accidentally making purchases or viewing things they shouldn't be. I can uninstall programs, locate the tablet, or lock them out of the tablet from the Amazon app on my phone. The hard case has worked well to prevent them from breaking it when they drop it. When connected to the internet, they can play Minecraft with my SO and I on the same server as our Xbox from their tablet, which solves a controller and split screen TV problem. Very impressed with how far this technology has come!
 I bought this older version for my youngest but was not expecting it to run so slow. Haven't downloaded anything and it's already low on storage. I've factory reset twice just to make sure there's nothing making it go so slow but it hasn't helped. Not sure if it's just this individual tablet or all of this version
 The intuitive nature of user friendly apps has worked out well for my 2 year old grand daughter.  Its amazing that she can navigate this device with no issues.  The included Amazon Free plan has added much valued educational content that she loves.  Great learning tool.  No Questions Guarantee also adds an extra poof to obtaining this.  Toddlers are hard on everything.
 I've ordered two of the Children's Kindle Fire Tablets.  The first one was when my grandson was 20 months old and he held it and even knew how to go up and down for programs we'd downloaded.  The second was for his 2'nd birthday so he would have one for his home.  So far, these have been God sends.  When we go out to eat, shopping, traveling and any thing else he's occupied with programs that are educational.  No one can believe he talks so well and we atribute it to his Kindle.  Thanks for a super, great product for children.  Ordered the bundle today for a friends two grandchildren.
 Overall great tablet but PLEASE find a way to add YouTube kids to the installed apps! That’s my kids favorite app and it’s not available! Not sure if to return the tablet now since it’s kind of useless to my two year old who is addicted to “Johnny Johnny &amp; family finger song” 😕
 I just love the easy set up, the apps, story books, a lot of fun to mg 4 year old girl. And is a one year membership FREE, then $83 ANNUALLY.  Super cheap for the best thing you gonna have. Highly recommended. Strong cover too. I forgat to mention that I actually block content that I don't want for her, you (parent) have control on everything, awesome!
 Edited- after the below review, Amazon replaced our Kindle! Changed to 5 star. Thank you Amazon. That was not expected.<br/><br/>Our son loved this...for the 2 years it lasted.  The charging port has been acting up for a few weeks but finally has given up and it will no longer charge.  It will say it's charging after you wiggle it and hold your breath...but then will disconnect. Ours has been at 2% for 3 days, even after constantly re-positioning and re-connecting.  This is really too bad, considering what we paid for it.  Not sure if we will ever get another.  Our iPad is 8 years old and we have had no problems.
 Painfully slow, to the point that it was unusable. I contacted support and they are sending me a replacement. I will adjust my rating if it turns out that I just had a defective unit. If they are all like this, then this product is atrocious for a tablet in 2018
 The kids app that allows my son to play is great, but I was expecting my son to be able to use the whole tablet, not just the app.  I did not realize that the tablet itself would have to be used under my profile.  This is very inconvenient.... I don't want to create an amazon account for my 1 yr old so he can use all the functions of his tablet.
 Amazon does not want to honor warranty after 1 year....<br/>Stopped charging, Amazon's description says multiple times it has a. 2 yr warranty. Amazon does not want to honor the description warranty and says warranty was only good for 1 year!!!
 I bought the Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet 7 for my grandson in July 2018. About a month ago it stopped charging. We tried several chargers and it just wont turn on. I been trying to find out about a replacement since it is less then a year. I just cant seem to get through to anyone, ;(
 Bought this for my 9 yr old for her birthday and she loves it ! I love the 2 yr no questions asked warranty and the 2 yr free subscription to books, movies, games and more ! Greatest gift for those children that love technology! Thanks Amazon!<br/><br/>P.s. I think that all schools should work a deal with Amazon to put these in all the schools to help young children learn !
 In April, I bought this for my grand daughter who lives in AZ.  I found out it has not been holding it's charge since May.<br/>I got a hold of some one who gave me some wrong phone numbers &amp; a process I'm suppose to follow.  We will see. But I'm not happy.. One of my children told me not to buy this because of the same reason... I trusted the reviews.  Im so disappointed.
 Works great, fast, son likes it. My only complain it's how your forced to have a password if you want to get the free year of freestyle. Whenever it goes to sleep from lack of use you have to type in the password all over again. My son is only three so he can't do it.
 Must have WiFi. That's really the only issue. Other than that it keeps my toddler entertained which is the main reason I made the purchase. Shopping trips and sporting event are much quieter now with a restless toddler lol.
 loved the following: Light, parent controls, case, variety of books, movies and educational apps for my boys! I gave it a 4 star because It doesn't  seem to block apps or movies until reading is completely done for the day or let's child know when to stop when they reached the goal...it just let's them keep going.
 We got this for long plane rides for the kids. Unfortunately, most of the items do not work without wi-fi. Even items we had downloaded suddenly did not work at the airport even though we tested them at home using the airplane mode feature. Additionally, the interface for trying to download content to the kids' accounts are not especially intuitive. Finally, and most importantly, the audio was just barely perceptible through headphones even with the volume turned all the way up. We tested multiple headphones.
 Okay tablet for the price. Very glitchy sometimes and my son managed to break it within about 3 months. Case doesn’t do anything except provide drop protection, unfortunately. Other than that, it works as described and kept my kiddo entertained for a while at least
 I am not pleased with this item. I bought it for a kid to use educational games however there is not much that can be played without wifi or a subscription. The parental controls block even the camera and video function which is part of the fun for a 9 year old. However, without the parental controls on, she has gotten to websites I do not want her to have access to.  I do not understand why parental controls can't be more specific. So I could turn on a particular app that I allow her to use without allowing access to things that I don't want her to see. Very disappointing. Tablet is automatically connected to my existing amazon account. Very disappointing.
 DO NOT BUY<br/>I beg you. As a parent of a 5 and 3 year old tmit sounded like a good idea.<br/>First it is slow and children are impatient.<br/>It has INCREDIBLY low memory so once your kid downloads a few things it is full.<br/>Speaking of download, it is easy. Just tap. On one of the fun bright colored icons that I promise every kid will tap away and download instantly and fill the memory within a day easy. We have to delete all the junk st tnight every night then redownload the stuff thst we notice thst like to play routinely.<br/>Every. Single. Day.<br/>So upset that we bought these POSs
 It’s  and awsome tablet the content is exactly what I wanted and the few shows I don’t want I was able to remove through the parental controls. Just be sure to set the parental controls so that you don’t get unexpected purchases by your kids. I don’t have to worry about Unappropriate content as they can all be tailored to your kids age. I love it I wish I would’ve bought it sooner
 Thankfully it’s for a 2 year old, who only watches Netflix and YouTube on it occasionally. I find it super slow? Downloading apps, loading videos, it’s just slow. I also find the battery life really short. 2 movies in and it’s dead. I have an iPad that’s about 8 years old and the battery last triple the time this one lasts. I do love the durability and the case. They layout of the kids version...is just ok. Also find the amazon free time not as useful as it should be.
 Wonderful for my 2 year old. He is able to navigate to what he wants to do. The apps for him are age appropriate and I can already see improvement in learning new things. Best thing ever he is so proud of it. Although he has dropped it a few times it has held up very well.
 This is perfect for my 2 1/2 year old. No YouTube junk! Tons of educational apps, free books, and great old shows you'll love to watch with your kiddos! The interface is easy to use and understand. I also like the easy limits I can set to monitor her useage.
 My 3, almost 4 year old loves this tablet. The selection of apps, books and video is sufficient for a young child; especially when subscribed to Amazon freetime. Great selection of kids friendly activities without exposing them to the whole web. My main complaint is that my kid frequently fills the miniscule storage size (be sure to add an SD card)! Battery life is ho-hum. Wish it had QuickCharge.
 I would not recommend this tablet for children or anyone. It either caught fire or something inside exploded. Parts of the tablet melted even though it was not plugged in, and had not been plugged in for days. I came home from grocery shopping and my daughter brought it to me and asked what was wrong with it. I contacted Amazon support around 1pm and am still waiting on the safety support team to call me. Its now 430pm. I am not very happy with this product, it could have caused a house fire.
 I had the old version which was so much better. This one crashed in 4 months, and they sent me a replacement which crashed in 1 month. this is very annoying​
 I bought this Fire 7 for my daughter this past Xmas 2017 and here it is July 24th and it now want even charge up are hold a charge at all. My daughter is only 6 years old she is heart broken over this Tablet because up until now she used it all the time. We tried several different chargers but none work leading us to believe and know it's the tablet and it still looks brand new as well SMH.
 Initially the battery was lasting only one hr. After leaving my review, a serviceman called to see if there were issues to resolve. When there wasn't, he had a new kindle sent right away and just sent the other back. Was very nice to have a timely response without hassle!
 My two year old absolutely loves this tablet. I only give it to her when I am putting her brother down for a nap so she has something to entertain her and keep the house quiet lol. I love how easy it is for her to navigate and knowing that she can't get a hold of anything that is inappropriate for age.
 This makes a great children's tablet. We got it for a very decent price on Prime day, so we can't complain, but I do wish there was more memory as it can be slow to load even with all apps closed. The kid friendly setup is definitely a plus. I like knowing that I can shut off all things Caillou, as well. ;)
 Buy something else.  The tablet is slow at best.  It's difficult to navigate.  You're restricted to Amazon apps, and what's accessible is pretty lame.  My son is 5 so I guess it all doesn't really matter to him yet but I will not buy another fire tablet.  I must say the thing is indestructible,  with a good case around it.
 We ordered the kids edition of the Kindle Fire for a Christmas present for our child. It was working perfectly in the beginning. After a month of playing with the kindle fire, he not able to charge it. The port is defective. The port does not recognize the charger. It has been plugged up for 24 hours, and it is still on 11%. I have emailed amazon about the product. They sent a link to fix the problem. They think it is a software problem, but it is a hardware problem. Customer service did not respond back after sending a reply back. Now, the link for assistance has been disabled. I just want to exchange it, because the one that I purchased was defective.
 Bought a two pack of these for my kids, one pink, one blue. The pink one is fine but three days after opening, the blue one just quit working. Having a hard time getting it replaced from Amazon. The tablet is ok, my kids were bummed that they couldn't install kids youtub on these tablets though so they still use their old ipads or my phone.
 My children absolutely love these tablets.  They were a Christmas gift for my 6 and 7 year old.  I am going on my 3 replacement because the charger connection port is horrible.  After a while you cannot even charge the tablet.  I have a feeling that the 2 year warranty will be nothing but returns.  I love Amazon, but come on someone really needs to look at the charger port and connector.  This is ridiculous.  Great price if you want the hassel.
 What an awsome teaching tool! Given as a present for an almost 3yr old. Some help is required at this age, but once shown, the child is working/playing on their own. Downloading age appropriate games is wonderful. Limit time to prevent frustration and eyestrain. The best thing is that the Amazon Fire can grow with your child. AND it is encased in a shock/drop proof case. Granny and child love it ♡
 We bought two of these for our grandkids and to be honest they didn't hold up beyond 6-months. It wasn't broken screens or bath tub accidents, it was simply the charging ports. Both lost their charge ports within a month of each other which rendered them unusable.<br/>I am trying to process a warranty claim.
 Its always hard to get something different than you are used to. Like for example my son is used to playing on my phone which is Android. So there are not all the same games and apps that he likes. And most cost money on Kindle apposed to them being free on Android. Its also a slow loader. But other than that its a good tablet with the pre-loaded cartoons.
 I thought what a great way to get my son away from my phone!? Wrong, this thing freezes and lags so bad my son can barely enjoy anything in it.
 I got this tablet as a Christmas gift for my child. It quit charging about 3 weeks ago out of the blue which I thought was weird as it barely gets used. I called and was told to send it back to have it looked at. Received an email that it could not be fixed and a new tablet is being sent. I'm a little disappointed but also worried as I have went through and read many reviews about this same thing happening to other people. My concern is that this "new" tablet will last a few months then the same thing will happen and eventually the warranty will no longer be valid. I'll be stuck with a tablet that doesn't work.
 Kid pleaser for sure... (3 and 4 year old)  You say you want to go out and have a family dinner with kids?  hahaha.....get a couple of these and have yourself a nice and peaceful meal.  Your welcome!!
 PERFECT!!! Fits great! My 2yr old needed something perfect to protect her tablet! It works amazing! I have no concerns of her dropping it. It's  thick where you could easy drop it and your tablet will be protected. She has thrown it a few times (like any toddler would) and with this case the tablet has no harm.
 I love the face and kid-friendly properties of this tablet. I love that my kid has thrown it because "mommy is the meanest mom ever and I don't want to eat that food right now". This tablet has seen my kid at his absolute worst.. and it looks better than I do.<br/><br/>I have to give it a one star because the charging ports DO NOT LAST.<br/><br/>We have now gone through 3 of these tablets in a year and a half. We've used the same charger on a designated charging table.<br/><br/>I wish wish wish this problem could be fixed. Until then, we will have to figure out another tablet option.
 Outstanding product.  The prepackaged software for the kids is exceptional  It takes the guess work out of finding what's appropriate. The menu and UI/UX  could use some work  and you can't play Purchased Amazon videos from the child profile.
 This is a gift for my 3 1/2 year old grandson for Christmas. What made me to purchase this item was that this has a warranty for 2 years that if it breaks for what every reason that they will replace it no questions asked. Looking forward for Christmas day to see his face when he opens up this present!
 Perfect for my son! He is autistic and this is the best device I've found for him. When his tablet was accidently dropped and the screen cracked, Amazon kept their promise. They replaced it with a new one after receiving the broken one. Determining it was too damaged for repair. Took about a week to send in the broken one and receive a new one. Over all I'm happy with all 4, yes I said 4, Fire tablets we have in this house and I reccomend it to anyone looking for a good tablet.
 My son (5) loves the tablet. He loves the games, access to many different books and videos. He can pick what games he wants to download and I can control his access. I had to turn on the parental controls when he got up in the middle of the night and retrieved his tablet from the charging station at 2 AM to play it. So, it now shuts off from bed time to the morning.
 I bought this for my daughters upcoming birthday. I've been downloading on to it and put an SD card into it. I've used it and checked it out and as far as I can tell it is a great little tablet. Downloading games takes a minute but nothing crazy
 This item was purchased last year for Christmas. It is a fine tablet for kids, it has VERY little memory. It just stopped working. I won't charge or turn on. I have attempted to contact Amazon since there is a 2-year-warranty. I have gotten no help from them. All I want to do is exchange it. There is no contact info anywhere
 I purchased this for outings with my 2 year old.<br/>We went through 3 tablets before finally finding one that not only is extremely durable, fast and easy to use. It's also lightweight and not super bulky; even with the heavy duty case.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a child friendly tablet that actually keeps up and isn't hard on the wallet.
 Overall it’s decent. My daughter got this as a Christmas gift and has learned a lot from it. But it’s now June and the battery life is horrible. If we don’t leave it plugged in constantly, it will be dead within an hour.<br/>Another thing I wasn’t too fond of is there is not a YouTube kids app like Apple offers. YouTube isn’t the only reason we purchased but she see some content she shouldn’t see just with the regular YouTube app.<br/>Honestly I feel like we should have put more money into a small iPad for her to get the proper use out of it.
 We bought this for my youngest son (3.5 years old) for Christmas. We have two other Amazon kids tablets in blue and pink for my two older kids, that we got two or three years ago, and they still use them and are still working great! I love the updated version of this tablet compared to my older 2. This version has a camera built in, came Alexa enabled and has tons more space for my kids games on it. I love that there are more color choices now, as we have two boys and can tell who’s is who by the color of the case.
 My child loves this tablet and how much there is to do with it. I didn’t realize I’d have to purchase a separate memory card right away but it is a plus that it comes loaded with games, apps and plenty of things to do... u just need more storage. Overall it’s a great product and we love it!
 It’s nice as long as you have WiFi. Without it you can’t play any of the games in the Free Time for kids. One of the reasons we got them was to help avoid chaos when going to appointments or long drives, however, it’s not a ton of help unless those places have WiFi. All they can do is watch downloaded movies or shows and even that has a limit.
 The kid-proof case really does its job well!  The first drop had everyone holding their breath but it simply bounced and landed safely.  No damage to be seen!  The apps are great and there is a large variety of movies, games, and videos and all are easy for the child to access.  The frustrating part we've run into is the inability to store and view personal videos.  Our little one loves to watch videos we have captured of her doing her day to day things, so we've had to find some workarounds. Other than the personal video issue, this product has been wonderful and better than expected.
 this is my son Christmas gift, i lov the fact it is made for kids, not like other tablets, the software is kids proof and you are the only one that can add or download apps and games for them.
 So i bought both pink and blue when they were on sale. One for my daughter and one for my nephew. I gave the blue to my sister and she loved it! After trying the tablet and seeing how kid friendly it was she couldnt stop thanking me for getting it for him. Its the only thing that calms him down in car rides!
 This is a pretty great tablet. The only thing I dislike about it is it is so slow. I bought two, one for a six year old and one for a two year old and they are perfect for them and the fact that they both run slow doesn’t bother them at all.
 Products for kids like this should really include a pin charging port. Kids are too rough with the micro usb ports and they can quit working within 6 months. I showed my daughter how to plug and unplug hers and explained to be very gentle with it. It still quit working. On the other hand, she has a Innotech Tab S 3 and because that uses a pin charger, it still works and she`s had it for 3 years.<br/><br/>Make the change Amazon and I`ll change my rating.
 I love this but most importantly my granddaughter loves it. Everything on  it is for her age group. All the tv characters she watches are on it with games and even show episodes. She is 3 and I can see this growing with her. I don't have to worry about her getting online since there is not a browser on it and her older sister can not install one. There is a lot of educational value as well as she is learning songs, counting, alphabet and thinking skills. I would and do highly recommend this for any young child.
 Quits charging after just a few weeks. Dont buy this product. Total garbage. Your kid will love it. Til it abruptly won't charge just a few weeks after showing in the mail. I expected alot more but Amazon seems to be turning into Walmart when it comes to the quality of THEIR products.
 Pros: I love the security features, price, case, and FreeTime apps.<br/><br/>Cons: first one broke/wouldn’t charge after a week. Amazon customer service tried troubleshooting and then sent a new one. Hopefully this one doesn’t have issues.<br/><br/>Operating system isn’t as user friendly as Mac
 Received FIRE 7 Kids EDITION Tablet 2/6/18 for my Grandson.  Several issues including trouble connecting to the Internet and the Touchscreen did NOT work properly.<br/>Attempted to return to AMAZON for a replacement on 3/12/18 but it indicated the RETURN WINDOW CLOSED 3/8/18.  36 DAYS after we received it.  So my question is why do you advertise this product to be a 2 YEAR WORRY FREE PRODUCT??  I would be fine if the warranty was even 1 YEAR but this is ridiculous.  I have several Grandchildren and have bought each one of them 2 each at this point . . .  WARRANTY DEPARTMENT needs to GET it together.<br/>Unhappy Grandmother!!!
 I bought this for my 4 year for her birthday and she loves it more than the previous one I bought because it has the case on it and she knows that she won’t damage her tablet now and I’m happy that she loves it definitely worth the money and the speaker on it is way louder than I originally thought
 These fire 7 kids tablets(2) were bought for a set of twins.  They love them.  Easy to set up and use.  Helps out Mom &amp; Great Grandma by keeping them busy for times when they are fixing lunch or just getting them to settle down.
 My son loves his new tablet.  I bought this as a replacement for his first Kindle Fire 7.  It stopped working out of nowhere, won't charge at all. I like that this tablet comes with a replacement guarantee if anything happens to it.  So far, it's been great.
 I'm not sure what your kid is like, but if ours sees pictures of games/books/shows that they can't click on, that is NOT OKAY with them. The inability to hide ads or control the content your kid sees on their home screen in FreeTime seems to defeat the whole purpose of the thing.
 My son absolutely loves his tablet. The case is very protective his definitely not easy on the tablet at all. The no questions asked return policy is also awesome. I've had it replaced twice, once for a cracked screen and once for the charging port. Both times completely free. I also like that I can use it as well with my own profile to read books and things.
 This is perfect for our kids on long car rides our for screen time at home. They love using it for new bed time stories and there's so many educational videos and games. We have the 7 and the 8 now and they are both great.
 My grandson loves it until it stopped charging now I trying to find out to send it back to have it fixed or replaced it suppose to have aa 2year warranty on it. It anyone known please let me known.
 Bought this for my 2 year old daughter who’s use to playing with my iPhone. She doesn’t play with it much because of the difficulty navigating the screen. It is not sensitive and easy to maneuver like the iPhone. Secondly, the YouTube app looks completely different so she can’t identify the normal red logo she’s use to seeing. The pink cushion makes it kid-friendly and throwable when it doesn’t work seamlessly for her. Lastly, the operating system in general is slow. After purchasing this, she is STILL on my iPhone for her entertainment.
 Bought it for our 5-year-old grandson.  He loves it and had pretty well mastered it within two days.  This unit is like an adult tablet, except that its built-in content is designed for kids.  It is ruggedized, practically indestructible, and guaranteed for life with free replacement if necessary.  For full use of its capability, you'll need a wireless wifi connection to the internet.
 We love these and have purchased 4. We've had them since November of 2017 and the only issue we've had is that we can't get plants vs zombies for our 5 year old. They're a little slow and I would definitely recommend getting a mini sd card for extra storage space, but other than that they're fantastic. There are tons of books, games and child appropriate shows/movies and downloading them for use on the road without wifi is super easy. One screen got cracked and they're replacing it with no questions asked other than how it happened and all at 0 cost. I'd recommend them. especially since you can purchase them in a two pack and save a little.
 We bought this for Christmas last year for our 8 turning 9 year old at the time. He has used it about daily and been pretty good at charging on a regular basis but a year later and the tablet will not recognize even its plugged in and therefore will no longer charge.<br/>Oh and we bought it knowing it had a two year no questions asked replacement policy but I can't find any way to exercise that now.<br/><br/>I would probably get a higher quality android OS next time.
 We were going to use it at the house for the grandkids. It was not used long then it was taken  maybe 2 or 3 weeks . Where do you find the number to identify one.Plus we had gotten our oldest granddaughter a kindlefire also but the 10 screen  about 4 or 5 yes ago.The last 2 1/2 years she left it with us and they took both . Makes me sick. She lives in Cal.and is coming to live here in Dec and boy is she going to be upset !! This was for Amazon !!
 The twins love these!  I got a yellow and a pink for their birthday so they'd each have one.  My son and daughter-in-law have to limit their time because they like them so much.  Not only are they entertaining, there's a lot they can learn using them.  This was a good buy!
 I'm giving this three stars because it entertains my child.  However, this is the slowest tablet.  It takes forever to load things.  Also, the battery life is terrible!<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure I'll stick to Apple products.
 It has stopped working and it has not been a year yet.  It was supposed to have a 2 year guarantee. It has not been dropped.  It has not gotten wet.  But I can't contact anyone because my window of chance has closed.  It did not last long at all.
 Family use. Was never dropped or misused. Within days it was sluggish, one power off suddenly, slow to charge and nearly useless with no large amount of added apps or memory space. I love Fire Tablets and Amazon products but this was a true waste of my money.
 Great deal!  Paid $60 and has protective case on it! It has so many choices for the unlimited apps, books, movies and shows! I mainly bought this for my daughter to use for ABCmouse app, but found so many fun games she can play too. I opened this and started downloading some apps and videos that can be used without wifi. There are options to control usage and pin number needs to be used to select settings and get to parent profile.
 Works only 1/8 of the time since the most recent update. All it does is crash and most of the time the apps don’t even open at all. Most of the time spent on the pad is shutting it down and starting it again and now half of the time that doesn’t even work.
 Device is good, as we have two others.  However, I was registering device before the item was given as a present and was forced to sign up for a subscription that I didn't want and included auto renewal payment on my credit card that is linked to my Amazon account.  I was able to call after christmas to cancel the auto renewal, but it is very inconvenient to do during the holiday season and didn't want to forget to do it.  Disappointed with registration process!  I was given the option to click "give as a gift", but discovered that the recipient would have to do the same thing!
 There is something wrong with the charging port and it stopped charging. I just tried to take advantage of the 2-year warranty (we've only had this a few months and we haven't been able to use it for about 3 weeks). I have tried every link and help page and yet I cannot access anything that will let me use the 2-year warranty. And I am still paying for this piece of garbage and can't find any way to exchange it. Thanks, Amazon.
 I'm really impressed.<br/>For a while my child had just a regular tablet but her accessibility to violent youtube channels and the free kids mode thats out of date and has nothing was too much.<br/><br/>I gave in and I'm pleased to say my child has a safe and controlled tablet for learning.
 I purchased 2 of these.  Right after the 1 year warranty was up, my daughter’s stopped being able to charge up.  I bought her a newer version.  Now, just a month later, my sons has done the same.  We never let them do the plugs, and we didn’t treat them rough ourselves.  I will probably skip it and get my son an iPad or something else - I have burnt up enough money here.
 My 3 year old son loves it! It’s a little difficult to get used to for me because I’ve used nothing but Apple products for years and years, however, I’m definitely not spending that kind of money on an iPad for a 3 year old. This tablet is very easy to use for him though and he loves it. I can set limits of what goals he has to real such as reading, educational videos and whatnot before he has access to everything else and he also has a completely separate login than me, which I absolutely love! That way he can’t delete or rearrange my stuff and me not be able to find what I’m looking for. So far it has been very reliable and has kept him entertained.
 It's not what I thought it was, more issues with trying to download games and movies as I purchased more space and still notice's come up stating we not the space for any given game or movie. It now sits in the corner and my granddaughter is on my iphone again.
 Very nice tablet. Case should have had a handle and/or kickstand. Needs more apps for 1 year old such as YouTube!
 My four year old son has ASD and goes everywhere with his tablet. He needed a kids case and his own tablet, since he kept dropping mine and broke it. This has so many apps that he enjoys and they came free with the purchase! I also love the guarantee to replace it if it breaks in the first 2 years.
 light-weight, easy to use, and kid - proof. It works well for my 4 yr old however it is very SLOW and I cannot figure out how to load things on it without it running out of memory. My daughter was also frustrated because Youtube was not standard on it and kids cannot access youtube on "their" restricted accounts.  I can see her "outgrowing" it....
 I really wish this was more like the regular kindle. My biggest thing is I wish it would not give you every movie/book/app option when your not connected to WiFi. And I can't seek to ever find the 25 videos I downloaded. My son gets very frustrated when he sees blaze and we are not connected to WiFi cause he don't understand we cant watch it with out wifi. My old Kindle allowed me to remove non downloaded videos from my carousel so he would not try to watch what was not downloaded.
 I bought this last Christmas for my 5 year old son.  Two days and a year later and the kindle no longer will charge.  Like all of a sudden the charging port is broken/loose.  I googled and apparently it’s a common problem with it.  Disappointed it only lasted a year.
 Love the kids free time app. But the tablet its self is only ok. It has storage issues and fills up really fast. We have 32g cards in then and they still fill up quickly. But i do love the kid safey in the app itself.
 Purchased for nephews in the 2 pack bundle. The charging ports are loose and not charging. Sent back for the 2 year warranty and tablets were returned still not charging. Email stated they updated software. I need them to charge!
 This is the seventh Fire I had, bought for my son. If you are buying for anyone older than ten, get a regular one. The child lock features are too difficult to navigate, now I have to have a separate pin for MY Kindle just to use it. What a waste and disappointment.
 Updated review - so I bought this Sept 2017 - it is now May 2018 and this tablet is great, except it doesn't stay charged very long. My 3 year old love this, wish it had more space for his games but I will just purchase the memory card for him. My son has dropped this tablet over a dozen times and the case is VERY durable.
 The tablet should be able to handle all the per-downloaded games and apps with taking up all the memory and then causing the device to crash. If you are going to purchase this device 16 GB is not enough....now that I think about it phones start off with more memory than that my iPhone has 64 GB (quadruple the memory) and I could have go more. Within hours of my kids using the tablets they were getting low memory warnings and they were only using the apps that were already on the tablet.  The only thing I like about the tablet is the parental controls which are easy to use.
 I love the variety of books, videos, games, apps on the Free Time Program. Easy to get from the parental controls to the child’s accessible content. I purchased it for my 46-year old son who is learning disabled. I feel he will learn to read better, enjoy books (not just TV all the time), and learn to spell better. He’s very interested in it, so I’m quite excited this will be a tool he can use to expand his world. Thank you Kindle!<br/>I had some trouble getting it set up, but a very helpful, patient Kindle support person, Teneisha, walked me through it and helped me undo the things I had done wrong. I was used to using Apple operating system.
 Loses battery power waaaaaaay too quick even with power saving mode on. But fun games and my son loves it. It just won’t last throughout The whole day.
 I bought two of these one for my son ANF one for my niece after a month it slowed down and completely stop working both of them horrible quality very upset will contact customer service also not so kid friendly my 3 year old son constantly ask me to turn it on for him very dissatisfied
 It's a good tablet, but the charging port goes out. About 4 months after receiving this item (as well as one in blue), they stopped charging properly. I had them replaced, but it has been another 4 months and the same issue is happening to both tablets. And the second time around, I did not let either of my children plug-in/ unplug the chargers. No sure what the issue is.
 Bottom line is I should have done my research and bought a Samsung tablet. This tablet is probably good for ages 3 or 4 above. I bought for my 2 year old and there is no app to lock the screen when he is watching a programme so he ends up touching the screen and doesn't understand yet. Samsung are way more user friendly and you have the ability to change basic setting to suit your needs. Also this tablet needs a specific amazon micro SD card and the kids case doesn't have a stand.
 This is the second kindle fire that I have bought for my now 7 year old. His first kindle lasted 7 years even with a child’s tendencies. We love kindles in our house and everyone has one!! Highly recommend as they have great customer support and tons of learning apps and games you can use for your child!
 The screen was too small and my grandchildren had trouble maneuvering the programs. I have an Ipad and they used it most of the time due to the issue mentioned before. I would like to return it but it appears that I have missed that window of opportunity. Live and learn.
 I am an iPad person so I was skeptical.  But I bought them on sale and my kids really wanted Tablets so I figured I would take the chance.  The touch interface is maybe one level down from iOS devices but good.  The colors and resolution are top notch.  Setting parental controls was a snap.  The app store was easy to use and well within 15 mins my kids were up and running.  Holds a charge for a long time as well.  Worth the money.
 The case is great absolutely the best idea they had with this, but like any android as I should have known it’s already glitching and my son hasn’t done anything but download maybe five little kids games and it’s soooo slow. The battery life runs out extremely quick he is able to watch maybe a movie and play a game for a long car ride and that’s about it. Kind of wishing I would have either just waited for when he was older and got a refurbished iPad.
 My dad bought it for my 2 year old but my 5 year old has taken it over and he would spend all day on it if we let him.  Has a lot of learning games, and the subscription that comes with it is great.  Definitely recommend.
 I hesitated getting a 1 and 2 year old these tablets but it was the best gift I could give!  They have already learned so much with the programs loaded on them and their parents have loaded!  My 1 year old granddaughter is doing puzzles! My 2 year old grandson knows how to find his favorite game and movie and is playing match games!
 Do not buy! They did a update 2 months ago and it keeps crashing. Kids are always crying because we have to restart it multiple times a day! Amazon customer service just keeps saying we are aware of the problem and working on it. Tell that to 3 kids! Billion dollar company and can't get a kids device to work!
 I bought this for my very intelligent three year granddaughter .  She has enjoyed so many learning programs, and she downloads them herself.  It has parental guards, so she can only get into what you approve.  she watched how to make cup cakes a lot, lol.
 I like the kids’ case for the tablet and that’s about it. I wish i would have just put the $100 I spent on this tablet and put it towards an iPad. It’s constantly freezing because it’s so overloaded in apps that you can’t actually delete from the tablet. You can have it on 100% charge, use it for less than an hour and it’s down to 80%. The thing has issues connecting to wifi, it’ll say it’s connected to the internet but then doesn’t want to load videos or pages from the web. I bought this for my som and I hate it because of how frustrating the darn thing is. I am going to sell it and put that money towards an iPad instead.
 Best tablet yet! I love that I can set time limits on the tablets and that I can see what sites they have search for as well as control the apps they download. Best gift for parents to their kids without worrying about your kids safety. It's a normal tablet but allows you to keep it child friendly and adapt it as they get older.
 There have only been problems from the start. We had the tablet replaced 3 times due to battery issues, screen issues, you name it. The tablet DOES NOT hold a charge so you have to remember to plug it in every night. Even if you plan to use it only once a week it will not have any power if you don’t constantly charge it. Other tablets will just sit and hold a charge until you use them. The tablet was of course dead so it was plugged in last night. Come to find out it didn’t charge one bit the entire night. Now when it actually works it’s great but it dies so quickly!
 After a year of ownership we tried using headphone jack for upcoming vacation and didnt work. So we ordered another tablet (same one) because we needed for entertainment for our 4 year old on plane. Headphone jack didnt work on day one. I'll assume we cant be only ones with that bad of luck. BUMMER
 I know people with cheaper tablets that lasted longer.<br/><br/>I ordered two of these tablets for the two kids in our family and neither tablet lasted one year. In fact, they barely lasted half a year. I sent one in for a replacement or to get it fixed, but a few days after I received the "fixed" tablet, it stopped working. (The issue for both tablets: charging ports-- the tablets would no longer charge.)<br/><br/>I will, however, admit that these tablets were great while they lasted. The very impressive FreeTime Unlimited and the well-made cases deserve 5 stars.
 My kids love this tablet! So much content! Easy to use. This is the second fire tablet I have purchased. I purchased the first one over 3 years ago and it's been used and abused and it still works perfectly, never had an issue with it. Sturdy affordable tablets. I would definitely purchase it again. My only complaint is that I wish the freetime unlimited content was better organized.
 My daughter loves this thing but, you can not go 5 mins without an advertisement. I've noticed that The "x" to close out of the ads jumps from right corner to left corner so that you wind up clicking the add and going to whatever website.. Also many of the kids games require that you buy characters. The game itself will be free but then you need to purchase new characters. Samsung is a better product.
 Cases are easy for little hands to hold. The tablet is fine, when logged in as an adult. When logged in under a child’s profile, there User Interface was extremely limited, and yet, there was so much content that the kids were overwhelmed. It was unclear how to limit the offerings, and dole them out as needed.
 I have tried for two days to try to get in touch with help to return my Kids Kindle Fire that has a broken screen.  I cannot get anyone to answer me at the product support.  I am very disappointed.  I purchased this product at the Prime Sale in July.
 This is our third tablet purchase! My stepdaughter chose this as her gift. She loves the pink case which is strong and protects the tablet. The fact is that it comes with preinstalled games made it so much easier for me! I simply had to download them and it was done. She truly enjoys it and hasn’t gotten bored of it.<br/><br/>It arrived so quickly. The perfect gift!
 Perfect tablet for pre schooler, durable, perfect size an handles multiple items an offers some great educational programs. We are impressed with the case an durability of the tablet. Well worth the money. The educational material that is offered as well as parental controls are awesome.
 I bought two of these tablets for my four and two year old.  They absolutely love them and I'm very pleased.  We've had them for about 6 months and we've had no big issues.  They come with protective covers on them, and so far there's been no cracking or breaking even though my boys tend to be rough with them.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because recently the batteries have been dying faster than they used to.  I used to charge them every three days or so, but now I have to charge them almost everyday.  Other than that, no complaints.
 We bought this for my four year old.  I really like the case and I like the kid friendly set up but I wish i would have realized that we wouldn't be able to download all the typical apps, like youtube, from the android and mac stores.  I may have chosen something different.
 This is the 2nd kindle I’ve purchased for my two kids. Both broke after 1 year. It says there’s a 2 year “worry free” warranty however Amazon says my replacement time frame ended at one year. I guess you get what you pay for, because I have an iPad that’s about 9 years old and still works.<br/>I also didn’t like that there were hundreds of apps on the kindle. It’s too many for a small child. I couldn’t find a way to remove the ones my child wasn’t using.
 The kids love it but the patental controls dont allow you to keep them from downloading apps in the freetime app so the tablet gets full everytime they use it and things have to deleted. Big headache.
 This tablet is very easy to setup for children to use and has excellent parental control options so parents can truly be aware of what their children are able to access online and through apps. Overall I would highly recommend this product to others.  I also love the fact that I can limit the time my children are able to spend on their devices and also can control when they can be turned on and off.  Incase anybody is wondering these were purchased as Christmas presents for my children who are ages 6 and 4.  Great investment, not only do the kids have fun playing on their tablets but they also can play and read educational books and games!
 I am so tired of the problems with these tablets.  We are on our third round of tablets in 2 1/2 years due to them constantly having charging problems.  The tablets constantly need new charging cables because the cables get loose and won’t work. We have also had three tablets that the charging port stops functioning all together. Then the tablet has to be mailed in. They try to fix it and you either get it back or a replacement one. This process takes several weeks. I am going to start looking in to a different brand because these have been nothing but headaches.
 it was horrible. bought my 3 year old for christmas. we did lose the receipt so thats our bad, but the screen cracked when the tablet got wedged in the arm of the couch. also, most of the apps have to be purchased. we bought our other son a cheaper android tablet from walmart and not only does it work better and seem more durable, but there are many more free apps for children at the regular play store. will never buy a kindle of any kind.
 Hardware and kindle itself is great. The kids portion is horrid.  Shows every book and app under the sun, cannot only show what is downloaded except by noting what has a little check by it. We got these for the car, well half the time the apps don’t work because you need to renew an app license. Going to let the kids use it as an adult kindle and just download a few apps that will actually work....
 Works great for the kids. Allows us to not worry about them watching something inappropriate, and limit them to an hour or two a day, and since the tablet is enforcing it, it reduces whining and complaints when it is time to put the tablet up. Looks sturdy, and has the warranty if anything does happen. Very happy so far.
 over all I like the device my kids love it... once you get the hang of it it'll be pretty easy to get around it... although at first you might have a bit of hard time to figure it out... I like a lot of the settings. but I also don't like some of the settings but I guess cuz I don't want to do the work but i'm sure the developers are being precautions.
 I really have benefited from having this Fire 7 for my son.  It works great and it allows you to hand pick shows and applications for your kids.  It allows you to set times that it works and rewards them for reading too.  Highly recommended if used with a plan in mind.
 This dies constantly. I loved the year of the free games for kids but this thing barely stays on long enough for them to play anything and then I have to charge it for another several hours just to get maybe an hour of use.
 This is an excellent device offered at a price you can't  beat, being that adults could use this device  as well for anything online. The "Free Time" app is completely loaded with anything imaginable that kids will love! The includes case is perfect for babies, toddlers, and kids throwing/smacking it around everywhere as well.
 I bought 2 of these in different colours.  This is a good case for kiddos, it is a deep sided case so any drops or falls haven't damaged any screens.  It is sort of a soft foam type plastic and my younger daughter (5) left teeth marks in this... if you are buying for a younger toddler I would probably go with something more substantial if you've got a chewer. Otherwise, we have had since christmas of 17 and they're holding up great!
 Had tremendous issues on freetime and general operability. Sent an email to the support team who said they have worked on it and resolved. Frankly, I didnt see a change!<br/><br/>The device is fine and works ok. However I cannot say that it specifically caters to the targeted audience as it should. The bugginess apart, it didnt come preloaded with anything useful. There were no guidance maps as well. For all practical purposes, this is a generic device and does its job.
 I love that this has 2 profiles - one for Mom and one for the kid.  Her profile is more suited for her and easy to navigate with big thumbnails.  Anytime I'm on her profile and need to get into settings, I just enter a PIN and it lets me modify it without having to log off her profile and log back into mine.  She's already dropped it and the case does a fantastic job - not scratches or cracks.
 bought this tablet for my 8yr. old and he hasn't put it down since he got it,,he likes it a lot .....the parental locks comes in very handy however i don't like the feature of it linking the tablet to my amazon account and ended up my kid downloading purchasing movies without my knowledge and ended up taking money out of my bank/amazon account until it was too late.this feature should be removed from kids tablets to get rid of unauthorized downloading.
 Got this as a gift.  Difficult for me to maneuver.  My son can navigate the iPad easily.  This locks up, we can't get to the home screen and get stuck in the freetime.  So many ad pop ups, I want to toss it out the window
 The most compelling reason I purchased two and later purchased another was the guarantee. Now less than 7 months later the first two refuse charge period and prior to charge they were losing games. The third is already losing games. I've had the first fire Kindle launched and it's still awesome. What happened?
 I am amazed by this tablet. It's a fully featured tablet with great parental controls. I can't say enough good things about it. If I had to find one thing I didn't like about the tablet it would be the battery life. I think battery life could be an improvement for the future. Easily a 5 star purchase.
 My daughter got this for a Christmas present from my brother. She absolutely loved it! But it only lasted a year and then stopped charging. I read reviews after that and saw where its difficult to get it fixed or a new one with the warranty and with it being a gift i figured I'd just buy a new one. Hopefully this one will last longer.
 I am so grateful for the great customer service from Amazon and the Kindle Kid warranty! My son ruined his tablet just days prior to needing to go into the hospital for a surgical procedure. The staff was incredibly understanding and expedited the shipping so that it arrived promptly the day of the procedure. He was able to use it while he was in the hospital all weekend. I am so thankful and so grateful for their compassion. Amazon never disappoints!!!
 The tablet is pre-loaded with a ton of content for the kids, which is great.  The problem is everything moves so slow.  Apps/games/videos/everything take(s) forever to load and will sometime pause in the middle of whatever you're viewing at that time.  Deciding whether to keep it or or return it and bite the bullet to buy an ipad.  The price-point is great, but the performance is not.
 It’s junk, and a rip off. They charge you way more than what it says....not sure how that happened...and they get you with an additional cost for all the stuff on the device...it doesn’t come with it. It’s a monthly subscription.
 Kiddos love it, easy for them to use. The “no questions asked” 2 year warranty is actually the asking a lot of questions and saying you need to mail it in to a tech first to evaluate and be without it for weeks... until you remind them of the policy!
 I love Kindle's...my sin got one for his 2nd birthday and he's about to be 8 and it's still going. This one I bought for my two year autistic daughter and she loves it. It's slot lighter than the other models. Works great!
 Nice device, but there seems to be no way to allow music to be played through the FreeTime settings.  I would like to have some kid-friendly prime stations or music from my personal library for my daughter to play.  Unfortunately Amazon does not allow this at all. If this had not been a gift from Santa, it would have been a return.
 The reasons I bought the Kids edition Fire Tablet:<br/><br/>1. Parental Controls/Content management.<br/>-The “Kid’s Tablet” from our cell provider had relentless advertising that targeted kids.<br/>-The parent controls are easy to use and allows me to manage the content.<br/><br/>2. The 2-year warranty! Because kids!<br/>-We’ve had the tablet for just over a year and we’re just having our first issue w/the touch screen not responding. Let’s test this warranty! I’ll post a follow up.
 I got this for my two and a half year old son. He’s always so interested in my husband and I’s tech, so we figured we should get him that’s just for him. He (and we) especially love the learning apps! We’ve tried sitting down with him and teaching him numbers and letters, but he knows we want him to repeat so he won’t. But with this we find him repeating without even realizing it!<br/><br/>It shipped and came pretty quickly! The box it was in was perfect too, it came brand new!
 I'm so excited to give these to my kids on Christmas.  You can't beat the price for two . I opened and set them up and they both work amazing ! Good picture, good quality tablet . I'm so happy . AND I got them next day !
 Stay far away from this product.  At first i was extremely happy with the kids editions, but about 6 months in the device began having problems holding a charge.  It continued to the point that the device wouldn't charge at all. 8 months in no charger would fit in the port correctly.  Upon further inspection,  the port was messed up.  I called customer service only to be left irritated and upset.  After a half hour on the phone with a service rep that i had to continually repeat myself over and over again with because she could barely understand english (or maybe she couldn't hear me over the loud laughter and talking of other people in the room with her)  i was left with...... factory reset the device and that will fix everything.  I never knew that doing a factory reset would miraculously fix a busted charging port. I don't know what has happened with amazons amazing customer service,  but it has definitely gone downhill.  The deciding factor in purchasing not just 1, but 3 of these devices was the 2 year worry free guarantee that whatever happened to the device it would be replaced no questions asked as long as it was within the time frame of the warranty.  Now, I'm left with a device that doesn't work. I spend thousands a year with Amazon and the fact that they won't back their own product/ warranty has me wondering if i should begin looking elsewhere for my purchases. I do not recommend anyone purchase this product.
 Works great for young kids. A bit of a pain to load kids you tube on and I am finding the kids don’t care much for the amazon free time package content.
 This table has really been great for our toddler, and gotten him to watch less videos and do more learning apps. However, some basic apps require Wi-Fi so it's not really ideal for on-the -move situations.
 These tablets are the worst. The simple child user face seems like a great idea but they almost never work with constant glitches in software and the inability to connect to internet and update software with ease. I have had to delete apps and call support multiple times in the short two months we’ve had these terrible tablets. I would definitely stick with an iPad... worth the price
 My niece is obsessed with this! It was by far her favorite gift!!!! She's 3 years old and was able to pick up on how to use it immediately. What was great is it has parental controls so her mom and dad are able to limit how much she can use it and what she's able to do on there.<br/><br/>My son is only 1, we don't need one of these yet. But when it comes time to get him a tablet we will definitely be purchasing another one of these!! :)
 My son loves his tablet! I like that these have a no questions asked guarantee for 2 years and I love the bumper. They have fallen and nothing has happened they just bounce back. I like that you can have adult accounts and child accounts and with the free time app it grows as they grow. I don't like how easy it is to change accounts im always having to change it back to his account. But other than that's I love it.
 My daughter loves it. It has everything for kids but u can’t download all of the games because the memory runs out fast and would have to delete some games so I suggest to get a memory card for extra memory if u want a lot of games .
 I have 4 boys ages 2-11 and I also have 4  kids fire tablets! We bought our first one in 2015. Never had a problem with any of the tablets. A few of the chargers have went bad but that's an easy fix. I never have to worry what they are watching. I love love the time limits and the parental controls. I highly recommend.
 For the Fire for the kids, I got a call after leaving a 1 star review (since my daughters Fire stopped charging this weekend) and they informed me that the kid Fire was actually replaceable for up to 2 years.  They replaced my daughters Fire very smoothly, easily, and she was extremely friendly.  I should get my replacement in 2 days!  Way to go Amazon!  My daughter loves her Fire and I was bummed that it died, but so grateful Amazon reached out to me and told me it was essentially still under the "warranty".
 Bought this tablet for my goddaughter for Christmas...she is very happy..she ignores everyone now that she has the tablet...it comes with a sturdy case..her mom said she dropped it a few times and nothing cracked or broke so far
 While it was working, it was very entertaining to the child. However, it was a Christmas gift and within less than a month, the tablet would not charge. It appears that the USB port does not take a charge. We even purchased new a new charger and it still won't charge. We took it to the Geek Squad and they couldn't fix it. Furthermore,  the tablet came with no papers. What if anything can we do to get the tablet fixed.
 Kids like them. Nice selection of books and games, just have to dowload them one at  a time. Charging port/cords are not designed with kids in mind.  Had to warranty both kids tablets after a year. One tablet wouldnt charge, the other would shut off after booting up any time an app was opened.  So far one replacement tablet functions perfectly, the other one will no longer charge.
 Bought it for my 1 year old, it was on sale for Christmas, thinking he could start using it in a few months. Took it out of box first time about 30 days ago. Will not hold a charge longer than 3 hours. Tried trouble shooting online, no luck. Very disappointing. If you but it I recommend warranty, even if it more expensive than the machine.
 The tablet is great for limiting your kids use of the internet and inappropriate apps. I love the time limits and reading requirement before app playing. The one downside is the battery life and the charger input. I have returned one already less than a month in.
 I got this for my 7 year old grandson he loves it.  I love it because I can controlley what and when he can use.  We can select what he watches together.  It is user friendly.
 My daughter has not been able to put this down. However the only downside is that you have to download Netflix, Hulu and all the other streaming apps on the main or parent profile if you will, as they can't be put on the kids Freetime account. Other than that its pretty good so far
 Extremely slow for downloads and overall functioning.  Slightly complicated to make work.  Mainly used for videos for the kids during long travel periods.  Continually asks me to pay for things that normally wouldn't require being paid for? Does not hold a charge for long.
 The great thing about this one is the memory card slot. This allows lots of apps to be available at once and not have the constant hassle of downloading and deleting apps.( If you don't have much storage space you are wasting lots of time and data with downloading). The protective case helps keep it from being damaged when accidentally dropped. It does freeze up or have no apps available when turned on just like other kids kindles sometimes do but turning off and on usually fixes that.
 Two main problems, battery life, and the so called "2 year no hassle guarantee".  Have had four amazon tablets, every one had the battery fail in less than a year. Trying to get a replacement takes a minimum 1 1/2 hours with at least three different representatives and the supervisor. to get the supervisor I had to keep repeating that phrase continuously for at least five minutes after 30 minutes of listening to rep try to sidetrack me from talking to the supervisor.  I bought an RCA 7", android table and have had no problems in almost two years now.
 This is a good tablet for kids. I like knowing it has the kid proof case that will keep it from breaking. I also like the parental controls and all the available software. Currently we are using some of the puzzles that help kids think how to complete the challenge.
 I have bought several of these for my grandchildren. They're very durable and perfect for toddlers who might drop or throw them. If you want a great tablet for any age, this is perfect.  I highly recommend.
 Purchased for my 6 year old Grandson SO I COULD DOWNLOAD SPEECH APPS FOR HIM AND UNABLE TO THAT.  WAS A PRESENT AND NONE OF HIS FAVORITE SONGS ARE AVAILABLE FOR HIM....HE USES SPEECH APPS ON MY FAULT BUT WANTED HIM TO HAVE HIS OWN SPEECH DEVICE TO TAKE WITH HIM.
 This is the 2nd tablet that has stopped working due to charging issues. The first tablet was a gift so it was not honored, so I purchased a 2nd tablet. I had to "convince" the technician that it was not working, which made me feel like I was trying not to be honest about it, then the solution was to ship my tablet to them, they will see if they can fix it, and if they cannot then they will issue a new one. I'm not sure how long this process will take, but it seems like it will take a while. It's not exactly "Replace it, no questions asked" deal though.
 This is our second kids kindle (second child).  The case is great and freetime is really cool.  It would be 5 stars if Alexa worked in Freetime (my son can't write so talk to text is very valuable) and not all of the apps you can download can you make available in freetime.  On side note, the warranty is great, I used it on our prior tablet.
 This was a warranty replacement.  90 warranty expired 3 weeks before tablet charging port malfunctioned.  Lesson learned:  ask questions if using warranty replacement!  Replaced with new tablet and purchased warranty replacement plan.
 Bought 3 tablets for each of my grandkids all 3 yrs old my grandson is autistic and is on it all the time it's been a learning tool for him. Has learned his colors and many animals names it also has interactive games he can play with his mother and sister. I just called because something went wrong with the charging port and he will be receiving a new one this week. Customer service was excellent when I called and a few questions and an email and the problem was solved would recommend to all the grandmas.
 Kid (age 6) loves it. We do her nightly reading on this tablet as there is a wide variety of books for her to choose from. She likes the games, apps, video selection included. She is very satisfied, although she wishes it had YouTube kids compatibility.<br/>Parental controls are good
 We have two of these for our 4 year old and 2 year old and they love them! Easy to maneuver and has many games and books. I love that you can play videos and games for 48 hours after you have left WIFI. Great for road trips.
 Well never buy again brought 3 of these and all 3  keeps freezing up and can't shut them off when I finally get them to turn on worst tablets I ever owned . I well stick with a Samsung Galaxy Tab a 2017
 Don't know what my grandson's reaction will be.  Purchased as a gift for the Christmas holiday.  Purchased tablet on sales.  Purchased FIre 7.  He is just turning two.  This tablet should be more than enough for him to be able to manage.  Will purchase another when he gets older.  No need to purchase more updated model for a two year old.
 I have a three year old that tried to lay claim on my iPad. When she got this little number in her hands and she was all like "i-what?" This thing is a life saver. I no longer have to go hide in the bathroom for a minute of quiet time. I can lay this in front of my kid for about 30 minutes of me time!! It's a blessing!! Thanks Amazon!
 This is a second purchase for us.  Bought one 2 years ago for my daughter and she tore up the usb charger plug OFTEN!  Amazon replaced each time without question.  Freetime service is great in getting kids to earn their play time by doing the things to improve reading, etc.
 I bought the two pack for my girls for Christmas and they have saved my sanity more times than I can count. I love that I can have multiple accounts where my 9 year old can not only play games but utilize kindle and read books as well as research for homework on the silk browser. When we don’t have WiFi she can still read and not be “bored” in the car. After almost 6 months the charging port struggled to catch a charge, I contacted amazon, shipped it out the next day and was sent a replacement within a week. Best investment so far.
 This is the third one I have forever for my 4 year old. One was replaced for free under the wastage after he broke it by accident. This one was bought because my husband accidentally left it at a restaurant. My kids both have one and they love the Amazon free time.
 Everytime I look around my daughter is coming to me about this tablet, something won't download or something is froze, I have to constantly turn it on and turn it off, sometimes take the sd card out and put it back in, it's frustrating, we are really not enjoying it, it's ok. I was going by the reviews and YouTube clips and decided to buy it, but it's ok.
 Loved the grip and foam protection<br/>Dont like how it does not have light for charging to let you know its charged or going dead. Meaning red light or a green light other then that Tablets are very Legit
 Worked great for 6 months then refused to turn on. Same thing happened with my sons around the same time and they still charge me for the free (free time) and wont make up time that is lost due to not workinh tablets
 We are on the third tablet as we keep getting replacements to address the issue of sound not playing through headphones.  I feel like I should have just spent the extra money on an ipad.  I doubt they have this issue.
 It is okay. I currently can not use it. The port to charge it won't let it charge. I called to try and see what can be done. They said the only way I can is send it back and let them see what the problem is. But I have to print off the ups return sticker from my email. I don't have a way to do that. So I ask if there's not any other way. They said they can't actually mail it to me. So I'm screwed on it! Highly upset!
 Thought these would be a great idea. I am technically savvy and have numerous devices. AMAZON SERVICE ON THESE DEVICES IS THE WORST OF ALL. 2 hours and calls. had hard resets on them twice, which means you have to set up everything again, another 4 hours total. And guess what, 2 devices still not working.  Now they want me to wait 2 weeks approx for me to send them in, look at them and then send them back. Contrary to the policy which stated 2 year no question asked return policy.
 Does not hold a charge very long. Constantly plugging it in. We haven't had it 3 months yet and it's frozen, with no way to reset, it won't even Power off. My son is very upset, he loves having this to play games and watch shows. I won't be buying another one of these.
 Great alternative to the iPad! Kid friendly. Easy to use. Great bargain on Prime Day.  Recommend getting an extra SD card for memory. The only con is when you are not connected to WiFi, it’s a little hard for kids to navigate the downloaded material, which is a pain when traveling.
 Great tablets! These are our second sets (my kid's lost theirs during a move... ugh). Durable lightweight cases and pre-loaded FULL of awesome kids apps and videos.<br/>Only cons are the charging ports. The ports will wear out in less than a year &amp; won't take a charge, especially if you let the kids play on them while they're plugged in.<br/>You'll also want to buy an SD card as these do not have much storage built in.
 Love this, everything I expected and more. Takes some time to get used to it. Love the option to limit time and activities, battery life is pretty good, don't feel like I am charging it often. Lots of options at your finger tips to download and play/watch on the go. I refuse to let my toddler have free access to You tube even "kids you tube" has inappropriate stuff. Bought the warranty plan and a screen protector. We have had it about 3 weeks now.
 I hate these. I purchased 3 of these for my kids for Christmas. I had to replace one a couple months after I bought them as it quit charging. I just got done replacing the other 2 because of the same issue and now the first one I replaced is now not charging again. Super frustrated!!!
 Highly unimpressed with this tablet. We bought fire tablets because of how much we love amazon and how many good things we have heard. These tablets are SLOW and that is honestly an understatement. I am beyond disappointed with the quality of the tablet and the speed. You can barely move from app to app without extreme lag. Very dissapointed overall.
 Purchased 2 not even a yr ago. Have had to replace both more that 3 times, for the same issue. Tablet will not charge or turn on. Kids have used them for at least 2 mos before they go bad. Mind you, these tablets are used for traveling. So they are gently used. The replacement process is a pain. As they have you on the phone trouble shooting it for at least and hr if not more. Then sending you a return label, you having to send  it back, then waiting to receive the REFURBISHED one. This process takes at least a month. NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY.
 I thought when I purchased this product for my grandson that it was somewhat child proof but the screen has a spider web crack on it now. I would of thought it was made for a child and all of their movements.
 Slow, glichy, the apps begin disappearing or become blank squares after a few days of use so you have to erase them and re download to see them again.  Freezes a lot very frustrating for my 6 year old.  Not intuitive. Disappointing.
 My son definitely enjoys playing on this.  The case is pretty sturdy.  He has dropped it a few times and chewed on it, but it is holding up well.<br/>My issue is only with the tablet itself.  We have not put many apps on it, but when he was playing one of the games on it, it would get a memory error.  He does not seem too bothered by it, but I was.  I have not noticed the issue in a few days, but I do not think he plays that same game anymore.  If I remember it was a Paw Patrol interactive game.
 Has worked fine for my 3 year old. Gave to him as a birthday present for long car rides. Downloaded the netflix app and then downloaded a bunch of kids movies. Tablet works great, battery life is ok. Tablet is sort of slow to charge, but just may be because he uses it so often. Also, the foam protector works great! He's dropped it about 6 times, 3 times in a parking lot. No cracks, nothing broken, still working great. No complaints. I would recommend this tablet.
 The tablet is disappointing. It's very slow even when connected to wifi. I got it as a present for my son for Christmas but most the time he just puts down to puts it down to play with something else.
 It stopped charging after 2 months. The return /exchange policy took a few more months. I gave up on this and bought a cheap Samsung. Now I have to figure out how to cancel whatever kids software is free for a year before they automatically charge me for it next year.
 kids love it! It runs somewhat slow but I love that i can limit how long they can play on it, what information they can open on it and what time in the evening they cannot watch any more. It has a really good selection of entertainment and educational.
 This is a Christmas present, so I  Haven't used it yet I hope it's just what I need for my two-year-old grandson Leo . I like the cushiony blue protector that comes with it. I hope it's as drop proof as it says it  is. I ordered a glass screen protector just in case.  I'm glad it offers a 2 year breakable warranty.
 Love the kindle fire I think this is the th one we've owned? Only disappointment was when I ordered the kids yellow I assumed the kindle itself would be yellow as well not just the case. Great product for a great price.
 Ordered two of these for my girls for Christmas. The products were less than satisfying due to technical issues with BOTH tablets. I returned them and after paying 80 bucks a piece they only gave me 62 a Piece back which is mind blowing considering I returned them exactly as specified. I will be reaching out to amazon about this because it seems unfair I wouldn’t get back what I paid for them.
 I bought two Fire 7 Kids Tablet almost two years ago as Christmas gifts for my granddaughters Naa and Gracie.  I must say that I was impressed with the Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet. The quality and warranty was exceptional.  Amazon lived up to the warranty by either repairing or replacing each unit two or three times, with only a phone call and a few questions. I plan on purchasing another Kids Tablet this Christmas for my other granddaughter.<br/>Great Product, Great Warranty!
 Doesn't operate like a real tablet. I'm having a hard time to figure things out and Customize tablet. I have Amazon prime so i have access to videos I can download. Which helps but my kids favorite shows are on Netflix.
 Absolutely love these Fire tablets for kids.  They provide the safety required to keep children off sites that aren't appropriate, have plenty of games, books, apps for the kids to play and are age specific.  What more could you ask for?
 I want to start by saying I'm reviewing this as the KIDS kindle fire. If I were reviewing just the features of this product for myself I would give it five stars easily.<br/><br/>There are definitely things to love about this device for use by a child:<br/>•two your replacement no questions asked, seriously this is amazing<br/>•a whole year of freetime unlimited for kids with a bunch of free apps, books,  and videos to keep your kid entertained<br/>•excellent case that seems very sturdy and hard for a child to remove themselves<br/>•multiple profiles for you and your child<br/>•parental control over times of use, education first etc.<br/><br/>Now on to the things this is lacking or aspects of it that make it less user friendly for kids:<br/>•a home button that isn't easily accessible: while this doesn't bother me my toddler who has mastered the home button on my iPhone and iPad is at a loss with this and gets very cranky she can't navigate back. This is marketed for ages 3+ so the basic functions should be very simple<br/>•I can't set it so my child can't download apps. Again, it says ages 3 and up my a toddler is just going to keep clicking to download (maybe I'm wrong and there is a way to control this but I haven't found it)<br/>•no feature to block kids from exiting a video during playback, seriously WHY IS THERE NO TABLET THAT DOES THIS?! My toddler is able to fast forward through the video or accidentally pause it and then she's cranky and she is usually only watching videos on this in the car so I can't help her because I'm driving.<br/>•on the kids profile you can't watch videos or use many apps when there is no internet connect, again I'm assuming most parents give these to their kids to entertain them in the car and this is seriously lacking for that purpose<br/><br/>If I hadn't gotten this for $30 off on Prime Day I'd probably return it, but since it was a good deal I'll deal with the flaws.
 Got this for my 4 year old. The navigation is a bit clunky and certainly not as intuitive as the iPad. However, for a younger kids, it's perfect. I do love the fact that it has a kid profile option. The parental controls and such are much better than iPad.
 My granddaughter LOVES IT!!!  She has dropped it a few times and it keeps on going.  It comes in handy when I'm babysitting and need to get some things done.  She is also able to learn at her own pace and enjoys doing it.  I LOVE IT!!! Thanks Amazon!
 very nice tablet and love the design. I can have multiple profile on it an monitor everything my son does. You can even disable internet access.<br/>Love the fact that as he get older you can change the setting of the tablet to fit with his age group.<br/>Very durable, 2 year worry free warranty that covers everything. Really a good and affordable tablet for children.
 This tablet has really entertained my grandson, but there is something wrong with the charging cord. The cord has to be propped up by something to stay charging. We found another cord for a mobile device and it works great.
 My 2 year old granddaughter brought this to my house one day. I was blown away by how well she could work it and all the different apps that she could play. So I ordered two ...one for my grandson, and one for my dad which had a stroke, and cannot talk. 3 different generations but very useful in all 3. I love the way it is so interactive, and useful for this young generation..Wonderful product
 My wife and I were hesitant about getting our little one a tablet.  However with the kids edition we have full control right from our phones. How much daily use. What apps are loaded on it. We can see and monitor whatever we need!
 Bought this for my 2 year old and so far do not like it at all.  Internet connection has been really slow for me, wherever I am (and at home we have super high speed Internet - but we have to wait and wait for anything to load).  For me, I don't find it easy to navigate at all (I'm used to an iPhone or i-Pad).  The screen gets stuck all the time and we can't change it.  I also thought it came pre-loaded with hundreds of kids videos, but ours did not.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but there are very limited options on this thing for a 2 year old.  We wanted her to be able to watch stuff like Peppa Pig or Sesame Street, and unless we bring it up on YouTube, we'd have to pay to download it.  My husband and I are both tech-savvy people who use a computer all day at work, and we both have trouble figuring out this thing.  Not happy at all, may either return it or sell it.
 The tablet with the freetime unlimited is a educationally packed party for my toddler. It’s easy for him to use because of its size and the case is sturdy enough to offer the protection it needs from a little boy. All in all we are happy with the fire tab. Our biggest issue is it doesn’t seem to hold a charge, this is our second one and we had the same issue with the first but we thought it was just broken. We charge it to 100% and if it’s unplugged over night it is dead by morning and it’s not being used at all.
 great for my 7 year old. THIS UNIT IS BROKEN. PLUG IN DOESN'T CHARGE. WHO DO YOU CONTACT ABOUT "PROMISED" 2 WARRANTY, NO QUESTIONS ASKED? NO AMAZON CONTACT AVAILABLE.
 These were the best gift for my twin grandchildren. They absolutely loved them and great features with parental controls. Pretty great you can set a time limit and determine what content they can view. Acts as a great learning tool too. Definitely recommend.
 Bought this for our 1 year old.  Sadly, she knows how to work phones and tablets.  It never really got her interest, maybe as she gets older she will use it more.  It’s nice and protected with the case, works as it should.
 My kids absolutely love this! We had a 12 day cross country moveabd these were lifesavers. The battery lasted long enough for us to get to our next hotel to charge them back up again.
 Love this tablet. Easy to use. Got it for my 4 yr old daughter’s bday and she navigates it in her own. Can set parental controls and manage the time spent on the tablet based on priority. Also has a great off line feature in case of no WiFi. Only wish storage was bigger
 I have a three and a half year old daughter and I got this for her for Christmas. She absolutely loves it. I have to actually take it away from her otherwise she would be on it all day. There's several books, games and videos to watch since it came with a free subscription. I think it's a really great deal and I'm glad I bought it.
 This was a gift for my granddaughter. It is very cheaply made &amp; broke within the first week.  Also, it allows internet access &amp; has a camera which allowed a pedophile to chat with &amp; zero in on  the granddaughters, luckily interrupted by their parents in time.  No more internet for them. Save your money &amp; avoid this poorly made &amp; dangerous product.
 I only wish you were able to download YouTube videos on this. Or videos from preferred websites. This only allows downloads of Amazon apps and I'm not a fan of the games and kids apps they have. I'm a faith mom and I prefer a more faith based content. It's still a great tablet but just didn't meet MY needs.
 This was a christmas gift for my son and he LOVES it! He drags this thing everywhere. The battery holds it charge suprisingly well and he can watch videos or play games without a lot of help on the tablet. If something happens to this one I will definately probably buy him another one to replace it!
 La estoy utilizando en Colombia y me restringe por mi ubicación geográfica, no me permite utilizar los programas instalados de Amazon en la tableta.
 The only way to reset is to let the battery charge out and then restart it. Amazon has a strict 30 day return policy. Lesson learned. The lesson is to buy electronic products at a dedicated brick and mortar store. Moved onto calling the trouble shooting line. Here is the problem.....Item is MADE  for children and I also purchased a case to protect such item. Now I have a young grandchild that is displeased that their Amazon Fire for Kids is not available to use. AFTER A MERE 32 DAYS OF PURCHASE.  Way to support your customers Amazon and Kindle.
 This is pretty nice but I do wish that the battery lasted longer.  We end up having to charge it every day even though she isn't on it for very long.  Other than that I really like this.  I like that I can control every aspect of her use of it.
 My children love the FreeTime program that comes with the tablet. The tablet is overall ok. The battery is terrible and a lot of the time my kids have to play with it plugged in which isn’t good because when the move around and pull on the cord it causes the charger to ruin and not stay in the tablet.
 I really like this tablet, however I wish it had a lock option for the open screen. My iPhone has a “guided access” option so I can have a kid friendly app up and they can’t click the home button to back out if it. I was assuming the kids fire tablet would have a similar setting but it doesn’t. Or at least I have yet to find it!
 I purchased this tablet for my son and it was horrible.  We had to replace the first one because all of a sudden in less than a week the screen would not swipe at all.  The second device that was sent would not start up at all.  This one will also be returned, I am not sold on this new generation tablet.  My older son has the generation 5 and it works great.  Amazon has to do better to keep selling these new tablets.  I think they are making them cheaper every time and they will not last long for anyone.
 Normally, I wouldn't buy this for my kid, but it was a gift from Nana, so of course my daughter loves it. It has good safety features and keeps kids entertained.
 Likes - durability, being able to use it with Amazon Prime, Very nice display.<br/>Dislikes - account management a little less than intuitive, battery life, there are some restrictions in place that seem a bit odd when the device is operated in airplane mode (which for us is most of the time).<br/><br/>We bought the device as an alternative to using bandwidth/data for streaming videos when traveling.  Doesn’t always work the way I would expect, but if I had to do it over again, I would make the same purchase.
 It's pretty much a kindle with a rubber case.  What sucks is I can't put YouTube Kids on it.  (Not without jumping through a lot of hoops).  Also, it has my profile on it and I had put a lock on it so my kid can't get it.
 Totally worth every penny!!! It comes preloaded with stuff that my toddler actually uses, like cartoons and educational videos. She doesn’t even use the tablet for anything other than learning right now. Her choice, not mine! She’s two so of course the childproof case was a bonus.
 Great product for younger kids, my son's been using his since around his 2nd birthday. he is 3 now.<br/>I really brought it for the 2 year "anything goes" warranty. I just had to send it back to amazon, becouse my son cracked the screen. 3 days later i had a brand new unit , popped his SD card back in and bam! back in buisness. Thanks!!!<br/><br/>I only gave 4/5 beacouse the unit is a little underpowered. but like i said for the games my son is uining it works perefectly.
 Since my grandson is running against its birthday I bought this one for him. If something happens within 2 years he will get a new one, but getting it out of the box and seeing it he must be pretty destructive to do so, which I hope he is not.
 Over all for what I bought the tablet for it was a good price. My 2 year old loves it. Perfect for his age. Battery life doesnt last long but that's expected when he sits and watches tv and learning videos on it. My child has thrown it a few times and hasnt done any damage to it. I dislike how he can sit and be watching videos and can close out the video and then he gets mad. He had a tablet before that he couldnt exit out of videos without the password being put in so he isnt quite learned this one yet but I'm sure he will with time.
 This tablet was extremely slow and the battery life was terrible. I contacted customer service and spent 3 HOURS on the line with them trying to sort out the issues that I had. The tablet wouldn't connect to freetime or open any apps without wifi.  I definitely would not reccomend buying these.
 Bought 2 for black Friday as a bundle...well worth the money! I have a 2 yr old daughter and son and they love the free time app( and so do i😁). They have managed to learn their colors, some numbers and letters, and songs unassisted from adults thanks to the app. The ability to block certain things and set time limits on their use is helpful as a parent. Added bonus for me is I can switch to use it like a regular tablet also 😁
 Loving this tablet. We've had it for a month or so now and it is sturdy enough for both my 4 year old and my 1 year old. It was easy to set up and makes changing users easy! I hadn't realized that it also functioned at a regular Fire Tablet once in my parental/administrative account. My one year old has unfortunately tried to eat it and thrown it hut it still looks like the day we got it. The case around it is really impressive. My only problem with it might be that there aren't enough reading along books but I'm sure more will come.
 My daughter loves it. The case makes it safe for her to hold herself and carry around without the fear of it breaking. The Amazon Freetime app has some of her favorite shows and some classics that I loved as a kid! (Big Comfy Couch, I mean come on! The best!) love that it comes with a warranty to replace it if it is damaged but the case is so sturdy that it's probably unlikely to happen. Fingers crossed!
 This tablet comes with everything you could want as far as  education. I have paid for apps in the past to get the full version and that adds up. This tablet provides everything you need and its free for the first yr. Best part is after the first yr its very inexpensive for the monthly fee. Im very happy with it and so is my daughter
 My boys each got one of these for Christmas this past year. They love watching kid shows on it. However it can be alittle difficult to use if your use to an Apple device like we are. Love the warranty and my kids are rough of tablets so I felt good about getting them these. I would buy again.
 I woyld probably love it if it had come with instructions. My husband and I have been trying off and on for weeks to get this thing set up for our son. Today is my son's birthday and we can't give him his present because it appears to be impossible to add content to my son's profile without paying money for it. Free time is no help at all.
 My boys loved these.  I bought them as a 2fer...the price was much better than buying individually.  Plus a 2 year replacement guarantee... Imagine the havoc that will be done to these.  Replace with no questions by Amazon?....the court is out on that point, hopefully I will never find out but the odds are against it.  let ya know  LOL.  The boys are 4 and 7
 GREAT purchase for the little ones to keep them occupied and they enjoy the Tablet with good program apps for young minds. Screen Protector is a SMART buy in addition to purchasing the tablet. The setup is a tad difficult but the option for Parent vs Kid profile is a good feature...
 I bought this tablet because of the warranty.  I have a very active and tough 2 year old grandson.  Within 2 weeks he broke the screen.  it was very easy to replace.  I'm sure this won't be the last time this happens.<br/>Also, I like the picture quality and sound.<br/>Great tablet for the price.
 Not a single flaw yet.<br/><br/>The case is great. The functions on this kindle are amazing. I'm able to set a time frame in which my child can play on it. I can set a reading goal before any entertainment apps are unlocked that day. I plan on buy another for my other Daughter as well!
 This little bugger rocks!  Full power in a kid's package.  Heck, I have been using it here and there and it keeps up (and I am an information scientist  wink wink).
 It’s okay. The parental controls are very nice and the best feature. The case is superb for clumsy kids!  From there, the content of the included kids unlimited is sufficient. The drawback is the performance. It is disappointing. My daughter is used to my iPhone or iPad. The fire kids had the appropriate content and I can manage it - she simply does not prefer the device and the interface. If she does not want to use it, what good is it?  I regret not buying this thing years ago prior to her becoming accustomed to the iPad.
 I BOUGHT  THIS  FOR MY LITTLE NEPHEW.  IT  WORKS  REALLY  GOOD. IT  TEACHES  HIM ALOT.  ITS VERY STURDY  I LIKE THE BLUE AROUND IT.  PRICE  WAS  GOOD  FOR IT.  GOOD LEARNING ONE FOR A CHILD
 These are annoying to deal with and don’t even get me started on the shabby battery life. I know the website says 8 hrs - wish I had read that prior to purchasing because I’m so tired of plugging them in constantly. I literally have to charge them after one hour of use. Don’t waste your money. Also this same device is only $30 at Best Buy right now.
 We were not impressed with this device at all. Purchased almost 1 year ago and it never worked properly. From day 1 my child could not access all of the benefits as we live in The Bahamas (nothing ever stated we could not access all features outside of the US) and within months the device was very slow and sketchy. It shuts down on it's own or freezes. Even with an SD card inserted it keeps reporting that it's full.
 purchased this for my son who has broken previous pads and this was perefect. good heavy duty case, even when dropped the screen never hits the floor. it also is set up with kids videos games and etc. will be buying another one for my daughter.
 My daughter received this as a gift for Christmas. We haven't been able to have her play and watch on it because the battery life is horrible. We charge the tablet and in 2 3 hrs it's all drained, before we have used it. My almost 3 yo jokes "no battery, no battery " every time she picks it up and puts it to the side.  As for the content, it's really great how how can preload content but I just don't see us using it for long trips which was the point. Maybe we got a defective unit....
 I bought this for my almost 3 year old Grandson for Christmas. I downloaded puzzles, videos and games for him to play while he is at home and in car because they don't have wifi.  He loves all the puzzles for toddlers.<br/>As he grows I will be able to add and delete will age appropriate content.  Love the hard case it comes with.
 Love it. Everything can be done and I love that it has the parental controls also that I can have my account and then my child can have one as well which I can monitor everything that is done in that profile.
 Excellent item THANK YOU
 The tablet is itself is awesome. I feel like Amazon was misleading with Amazon Freetime.  I was under the impression I would be able to download the videos while on Wi-Fi so that my son could watch them at a later date. At least there's a year free, so we didn't have to pay for Freetime. Other than that, the tablet runs smoothly. No bugs, the battery doesn't last as long as I would have hoped. Has proved to be very "kid proof". My child has dropped it, thrown it, spit macaroni &amp; cheese on it, and it runs perfectly!
 This is our 3rd fire tablet. We bought two on Black Friday but without the case and the screens cracked very quickly. We decided to go with this style the second time around and it has been great!
 I bought 2 of these fire kid tablets &amp; I already had to return one because it stopped charging. I received the new one &amp; so far it charges good but slow. Now I am having a problem with the other tablet, where it’s Not charging at all. I even tried different chargers &amp; it doesn’t seem to charge. My boys do love playing on their tablets but now they are fighting over the one that charges. I would NOT recommend this item. We’ve barely had less than 6 months &amp; I have problems with both tablets.
 First impressions: Inferior product on both hardware (cheap material, slow CPU, etc) and software (cluttered, not user-friendly, software monitors your key stroke and suggests matching products on Amazon.com).  Anyway, my kid received the tablet on Friday 12/7 and is now returning it on Monday (12/10).
 Slow, sluggish, and what a pain to use.  Bought this for my kids for Christmas, and coming from using so many Apple products, this is just meh (at best).
 The Fire 7 tablet for kids is easy to navigate and is very well made. It comes preloaded with audio books, videos, and games for children.<br/>The parental controls are easy to navigate and customize for your own needs. You can set a time limit as well as educational goals for your children to achieve before having access to videos or the web.<br/>I would definitely recommend this tablet!
 Love these.  We use ours for appts and travel only and they're great. I had an old kindle inwas letting them use. This comes pre loaded with apps and books to download which i loved. So great!
 Our saving grace! My son loves his Kindle and it was the best purchase of the year! Great free apps. Everyone in my household has a profile on it. I do wish the battery life was a little longer; must be charged nightly.
 Bought two of them for my grandchildren and they love them. There is a parental lock capability and the ability to block them from making purchases if need be. They are very happy with them.
 DO NOT GIVE AS A GIFT WITHOUT CLICKING "It's a gift" or the one year free will only work on your account... my son got this as a Christmas Gift .. and we spent one month trying to get to work with my account (relative that got it lives away and needed his sign in) and then once it was on my account the FreeTime only worked for the free month and its silly to pay for the monthly subscription when it should be free for the first year... not impressed... I talked to tech support and they said the subscription can not be transferred to another account...
 Great tablet love the kids have their own section. My problem with it is getting apps on the kids section. My oldest want Lego nexo knights I had to download it on the parent profile and I have to log into my profile anytime he wants to play it. We have abc mouse and one tablet has it in the kids section but the other doesn't. That was another I had to download in the parent section and now have to log into my section so they can play it on that tablet. If there is an easier way to o this someone needs to school me please!
 I give it a three star rating for three reasons; 1.) It didn't come with a booklet<br/>2.) Unlike the movies that you download, the games are not able to be played without a wifi connection.<br/>3.) You aren't able to review any games before downloading them.
 I love the different apps the tablet has and I like that I am able to have peace of mind while my son plays it. My biggest issue and why I don't like it is  that since April of 2017 I have had to replace it twice. The first tablet  wouldn't charge and when i tried to exchange it I was told the edition I had was no longer made and a new one was coming out in June so I waited until June for the latest edition and in January it started freezing up and not charging. Hoping the third time is a charm and I don't have any more problems with the device.
 My daughter hated the kid mode. She’s only 1 and 1/2 years old but was used to her brothers iPad. The kid mode is very difficult to use and it tries to make you use only certain apps and games. After getting rid of kid mode and putting normal apps on it she seems to like it more now.
 I ordered this for my grandson so he would not use my home computer. The set up process was somewhat time consuming. Unfortunately, the "block" feature on this product did not allow us to pull up any of the educational websites suggested by my grandson's school. Even after spending 38 minutes on the phone with "customer support" we could not resolve the issue. I returned this product for a regular tablet with several reviews stating they had purchased it for their children's use. I was very satisfied with the new tablet.
 We got two one for my son and daughter for Christmas it is very kid friendly, love that afults can still use it, is very easy to add content to the kids account, canera is not that good but is perfect for a kids tablet the cover is very good too and love that i can add a sd card for more space
 My main issue is with the charging port. Becomes loose immediately. Have two. Had to replace one already. I like the speed and ease of it for the price. I hate the Amazon carousel being on the main screen. No privacy when everything you read is there on the main page for children to  to see until you can click on their profiles. 2.5 stars.
 Well worth the money!!! This is the 3rd one we have bought...and when our youngest is old enough, we will be buying him one as well.
 one star because i had to rate it. boots slow, responds to touch input very slowly, loses information constantly. if your looking for something simple for your child, this is not it. dont waste your hard earned money. it works but i would expect a bit more quality from Amazon
 This was a perfect addition to the family. Our daughter is constantly stealing our phones, and a larger screen makes it really easy to keep our phones safe. She’s always dropping it, so the warranty and child-proofing make this version so much of a better purchase. In addition, I can keep this locked from purchases, so she can’t download anything. Absolutely the best idea we’ve had in a long time!!
 Battery life is horrible. Charging port quit work right after the 1 year warranty was up
 Such a great tool as a parent. I let my child use the fire for long car trips or while I’m shopping and not only does it keep her attention, she is learning colors and numbers while playing the educational apps.
 Our issues with this product could Ben partly user error, but to be honest I was sharp raised by how many problems and complications we encountered within the first week. Apps/games appear and then disappear from time to time and the screen is very difficult to view if it's remotely sunny. Wish we had some more research before purchasing the product. Will not be recommending this product.
 I honestly love it! The offline feature is AMAZING! I download movies, videos at home then stream while long drives in the car. The different profiles, parental control is a great feature also. I can say so many good things, I would buy it again if I needed it to.
 Bought this for one of my grandsons after the other 2 grandsons had gotten one as birthday presents. They play theirs all the time so I figured buying one for Leihem would be great.  It comes with a no hassle 2 year warranty no questions asked.. I think that's great! Hoping he will enjoy it as the other 2 do. Wished it would have come with a traveling case as well for the price though. Overall great investment
 Bought this for my daughter in the US and brought it back home to Ecuador. Can’t take advantage of Kindle freetime, so I can’t download apps. In practice, useless. Hope there had been a warning saying I can’t use it fully in my country. BTW, I have a similar problem with my prime account. Lots of content I can’t use.
 The Fire 7 kids is okay it has some things that are really educational and exciting, my 5 year old grandson loves it, my 9 year old grandson not so much, he had a regular tablet and there are some things he isn't able to access, but there are some things that he does like.
 This has saved our end of day commute through traffic by providing entertainment for our 2 year old. Has successfully been thrown, dropped, drooled on and touched w ketchup fingers. It’s still works fine.
 Kids love the fire tablets. Have 3 off them,  the only issue is after a while the plug in port doesn't work the greatest. It needs to be just right to charge them. It would be really nice if they had wireless charging.
 Purchased these for my 5 year old and 3 year old for their recent birthdays. They absolutely love them! It keeps them entertained for as long as I need it to. The battery life is great!
 My grandson loves it. He plays games and watches Youtube Kids on it. We have had no problems with it. The case is perfect for kids. I haven't timed how long it stays charged but I again, have had no problems.
 My kid loves it and I'm considering paying for freetime because it comes with books and videos geared to children. The foam case is protected from drops and all the other abuses that come with a child. Screen protector recommended. Device itself is fairly large out of its form case.
 Bought this for my grandson for Christmas.  He is only 5 months old, but the Fire is packed with videos and apps for any age<br/>child.  It helps when he is riding in the car or in a waiting room. This will be a useful device for him and his mom for years to come.  Very<br/>happy with my purchase!
 It’s nice tablet for little ones. It’s loaded with lots of fun stuff to keep them busy on road trips. I wish you could download apps on it. Maybe you can but I haven’t figured it out.
 Well worth the purchase. This is my second one I have purchased due to my youngest taking over my oldest first one. The features for kids is great you can control everything they do and also import movies that you own to the freetime section. The case is very durable.
 We bought this for our 3 year old daughter for Christmas this year and she LOVES it. She has dropped it multiple times and it’s still in perfect condition. The only real issue that I have come across is that she has free reign to download stuff anytime she wants and fills up the memory daily and I have to go back through and delete stuff all the time. I wish there was a way to at least lock out the buttons so she can’t just search all the time and in one click download something. Not that the stuff she downloads in inappropriate or anything just wish she was able to fill it up all the time.
 This tablet is great for kids, though its child-safe interface will we outgrown by your kids fairly quickly. The adult interface is too basicand restritive and Amazon really needs to improve its eco-system or get with a real android interface. Overall good enough for the kids but will isn't good enough for an adult to borrow or use except in the case of dire emergency.
 My Son loves his tablet. The product is great for the little ones and with all the fixtures that Amazon gives with it, makes it a excellent buy.<br/>I not giving it a 5 stars because a customer service representative dropped the ball.<br/>But the last time that I called Amazon the two Customer Service Representatives that took care of me did the impossible to make my little one happy 😊. Thanks for that and for caring about your customers.<br/>I would continue recommending this product and if you don’t have one for your little ones, you should consider on getting one.
 I really don't like this tablet.  It's really slow to load and feels really cheap. I do like the band around the side because my toddler likes to throw it and if it didn't have that it'd be damaged by now, so I guess it is good for a toddler.  But it's kinda crappy.
 We bought these to primarily use on the plane for our almost 2yr old twins. I am very disappointed. The app - Movies Anywhere only works when connected to WiFi. It doesn’t allow you download and view a movie offline on the Kindle. So if you have a digital download of a DVD you can’t watch. We have a bunch of Disney movies that we can’t watch. Frustrating to say the least...
 This product is a joke and shouldn't be on the market its obsolete and slower than garbage we bought it for our daughter way to early and it is slow from every aspect. Not happy with the buy wish I could return it used it 2x is all.
 Returned as this we could not load Kids You Tube and many of the games would not play properly.  If your child is into reading and/or you have unlimited data this is OK.  For stand alone entertainment did not hold the attention of a 3 year old as much as an iPhone does.
 Got 2 of these for Christmas batteries seem to  last a long time compared to other tablets. my kids are on these all the time and love them! There also very light weight but seem very durable my kids have dropped them several times and nothing has cracked or broke. If you are looking for a tablet for a kid this is definitely your best option my oldest has a Samsung but always wants to use the amazon.
 Sorry but I did not like it at all it was very slow
 These are worthless as a “child’s tablet”. Very difficult for a child to navigate. They also lag terribly. It doesn’t offer apps that a child would actually use. You can’t get them Netflix or YouTube Kids, and the game selection is worthless.
 Bought for our 4 year old, and you definitely have to navigate it like a “tablet” and not a Leap Pad type device.  So, she can’t get any apps going without help.  The Worst part is IT DOESN’T charge!!!  From the beginning it was difficult to charge.  After a few months, we we’re trying other cords, twisting them to work, and should have returned it then!  I have had 2 Kindle Fire’s that I love, but this thing is nothing like those.  Total is piece of junk and waste of money!  Buyer Beware!  Get a Leap Pad!
 This is almost as good at Fire 8. it has less speakers and a touch smaller. It seems to have a lower battery life as well. I can tell the product difference in the two. The fire 8 is definitely an upgrade and a good idea with the added battery life.
 This seems to be a great tablet. My kids have enjoyed it. However, you can't use the kids time unless you have Wi-Fi or download games and such. The downloading seems to take awhile. The case is great and has kept the tablets from breaking so far. I would buy this again.
 Nearly useless. There is so much redundant and pointless security that a kid could never use it and an adult would not have the patience for it. The second-rate clone of Android makes compatibility with other tablets impossible due to how poorly the apps run. Best use would be as a dust collector or paper weight.
 Love the parental controls, and LOVE the warranty! Ours stopped charging after a year of use, so we sent it in and they are sending us a new one right away. Awesome customer service, and awesome warranty!
 These are not very intuitive and not that easy for kids to use. I bought 2 of these for my almost 4 yr old twins because I didn't want to buy iPads. They're constantly frustrated because they'll touch a certain spot on the screen that will take them out of the app they're in and they can't figure out how to fix it.
 Bought this for my daughter , so far a year of throwing and slamming to the ground and works great no cracks even with no screen protector. Love that you can customize when it can be used turns off on its own and the control the material they watch. I have the amazon free unlimited so worth it
 Great item but doesn’t last for very long. It’s been a year on February 14 and the item won’t hold the charge. The other one I purchased for my other grandson had the same problem
 Love it, bought for my special needs grandson that throws a lot, very sturdy rubbery case that works for that and he cannot get it off like others. Great for adult needs also when phone dies. Lots free apps via Amazon store also.
 Love this, and more importantly, my 4 year old loves it.  Easy to use.  Like that I can put timers, switch to my own profile, etc.  Wish, though, that I could customize his wallpaper and profile photo.  He's disappointed by that- and the backgrounds are pretty "boring" landscape photos.  He wants photos of his puppy or kittens as the background...<br/>Not a big deal, but seems like an oversight.
 We love it! I love that my daughter has apps that are geared to her age. Its easy to use for her and the apps don't have ads that she can click on to take her to a million other different things.
 With all the preloaded system apps there is very little space left for the freetime apps which this Kindle is intended for. Even after adding a 32 GB micro SD I'm still constantly having to remove books and videos just to keep storage available.
 This is ok, my son love it. However, I am unable to see all the PBS kids program as the device promised. Secondly, it loses it WiFi connection periodically and I have to reboot my router before it can connect again. I don’t have too many devices to connect to my WiFi and I do have a maximum of 10 yet this device keep losing connection.
 I liked how large the selection of games, books, audio books, etc was; however, I did not like that the files were all pre-loaded and I could not remove the audio books from my childrens’ screens. Also, I had to spend a lot of time going through the individual books and videos that I wanted to block in order to remove them and some continued to be on their display panel. Some content was inappropriate and as this was the kids version I would think the parental controls would be a lot better.
 I love this tablet. I brought this for my daughter, who is 8, and I'm able to control what she has access to and if I want to use it I can unlock whatever app or browsers and lock it back once done. This is her 2nd tablet. Her 1st one didn't have the case and held up for as long as it could, with the many hits to the ground it took.
 I might like this tablet more than my daughter! I love how much control I have over what she does and watches on it and for how long.  I was able to add all her favorite apps on it so she loves it. The case it comes with is very durable, she had dropped it multiple times and the tablet has remained in perfect condition. I also like the fact that I have my own profile and can use it too!
 My grandson loves it. Would definitely recommend
 It works pretty good for a kids tablet if you don't want to invest in a ipad. When my son isn't using it I use myself it lets you set up 2 profiles for a adult and Los which is cool. Apps where easy to download<br/><br/>The only things I dislike about this tablet or that it does pretty fast. Even when we don't use my son would wake up and the tablet is dead so you constantly have to charge it. The battery like isn't that good. Also it freezes up sometimes I don't know why.<br/><br/>Overall works good for kids
 I wish the charging plug wasn't so loose when plugged in. You really have to set it a certain way to make sure it doesn't fall out otherwise it won't charge. Otherwise, it's a great tablet for young kids and it allows parents to have control over everything.
 Its been a little over a month and the port to charge the tablet has broken, it will not charge with any charger.
 Within two months all 3 kindles would not charge anymore.  iPads are more expensive, but much easier to use and last much longer.  Also customer service wouldn't let me return without calling.
 I honestly hate this tablet. I’ve had nothing but problems since receiving it. The first day, taking it out of the box, the power button doesn’t even work. Only way to get the tablet to turn on is to plug it into its charger. My daughter hates it, it’s not easy to use &amp; she can’t get all the apps she loves. Really wish I could return it. Would I buy again? Definitely not!
 This product has been reset to factory two times and it just won’t work.  It keeps asking for a PIN before the child can get it open.  It is under my account and I have set it up without success.  Was unable to get tablet to 6 year old until today and he and I are frustrated.  It needs to be reset again with the WiFi in his house.  Why is a child’s tablet so difficult to work and protect anyone from using my account. I should have returned this item after Christmas when we couldn’t get it to work.  Sad customer!
 Great device,  my 3 year old grandson loves it. The only issue is trying to get him away from it. Pretty straightforward to set up and I really like the parenteral controls,  keeps him from messing it up.
 These are great! I purchased two for my 6 &amp; 7 yr old boys and they absolutely love them. Many different things for them to do and keeps them entertained. I do not look forward to paying the freetime membership each year but as of now it is worth it and I plan to keep it. It was packaged well and delivered on time.
 I bought Fire 7 Kids Tablet last Nov. 2017 and it says<br/>"One year of FreeTime Unlimited gives your kids access to 15,000 popular apps and games, videos, books, and educational content from PBS Kids, Nickelodeon, Disney". But that 1 Year of Free Time Umlimited ended this week. Only 3 months, YES only 3 months of unlimited access. All the  PBS Kids, Nickelodeon, Disney apps were gone and expired. How sad. My kid been enjoying the free apps and games. And it ended so soon. DON'T BUY this product. They deceive the customers.
 Food does tend to get stuck under the tablets. However the case cleans easily and it protects agains my 2 and 5 year old's ruff ways.
 Really disappointed with this purchase.  My grandson didn't have it long before it stopped working. I tried to get it fix but to no avail no one follow up with my request for a new product.  Now I can't even email the person I purchased it from because I have no email.
 It has all the things my 3 year old needs. The battery life isn’t great but it’s not terrible since my son is on it all the time. The only thing I don’t like is how long it takes to load.
 Good for a small child, can be easily overloaded with data, however.Also is slow at times and takes a few minutes to respond to touches. There is also a lack of customization and the OS is somewhat buggy but that is Android. Overall, good for the price and purpose.
 Bought 2 for four year old twin grandkids. They love it. This is loaded with all sorts of applications, games, educational programs. You can add any programs, games or remove ones that you don't use.<br/>I am amazed how easy it is for them to use and how proud they are when they complete an activity. I was worried about all the technology in kids so young, but as long as you monitor their use and don't use as a babysitter, this is a great tablet at a very reasonable price.
 Had some problems with the first Kindle, but Amazon helped try to solve the problem.  When we couldn't fix it they sent a new one immediately.  Kids love it.  Child friendly and safe.
 This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and son. They originally were great. The parent controls were nice to be able to control what my kids were watching and how much time they were spending. However, one of them stopped charging. We tried numerous plugs, including the original and they all failed to charge the device. The other one seems to be constantly frozen and unusable. Still working to reset it but the device still isn't performing. Disappointed. They worked for about a month.
 The Fire Kids edition is great and everything its hyped up to be. My only complaint is that there is no way to lock the screen when you have a movie playing so the little one doesn't touch buttons and turn it off.
 Working well for 5 and 7 year old girls, No complaints on accessible content. Some app;s are very slow to load and frustrates youngest user. Both children can access each others accounts on both units purchased. I am not tech savy enough to block this but it is no a big issue for us.
 Bing for search and no Google apps so they can lock into their ecosystem.  I just wanted Google play store and drive on this thing (which could work if not for Amazon's anticompetitive policies). I use Amazon extensively for buying real things in my life, there's no need for tricks to make money at the expense of my experience.  Really lost respect for amazon as a company due to this behavior.  Shame on them.
 This was great until it stopped taking a charge ! Then was on the phone for 45 minutes yoi dont get a new one they just try to fix the old one  i bought 2 for a 6 yr old and a 2year old however my sister got one for her son and it hasnt broke at all i guess it all depends if your lucky or not however it does have lots of books and stories on here that was the good part like i said was great up intil it broke good luck kids will love it but who knows how long intil it happens to you its a chance you gotta take
 I bought this to keep my 2 year old entertained on a plane ride.  Downloaded games and apps beforehand.  It’s unorganized, not intuitive and irritating for both of us to use.  He was frustrated and crying nonstop for me to ‘fix’ it.  Very disappointed.  Purchased an iPad for our next trip.
 We charged the Fire 7 over night and unplugged the tablet in the morning once it reached 100% charge.  Then we left for the day to run errands when we came back in the evening my son went to use the charged tablet and it had 0%!  There was no videos running and the screen was left turned off so not sure how this is even possible but speaking to my brother in law he had the same issue and suggested powering down the device when you are not using it so that is my advice to others as well.
 so much for "no questions asked". I called and was grilled with troubleshooting questions. I understand they don't want to replace the device that has a bad USB charging port. I was passed to two different people after initially calling.
 This is our family’s 4th Fire so we knew exactly what we were getting. We’ve loved our Fire tablets as e-readers for my husband and I and tablets for the kids. Great quality and parental controls are awesome. Great first tablet for kids as they learn how to be responsible with them!
 Third replacement in less than a year.  Kindle fire 7 for kids.  These constantly freeze.  Also... side note my son keeps downloading several items and then it freezes.  Toddlers don’t have patience to wait for games to download then the memory constantly is full.  Tablet shuts off randomly.  It has sat on a shelf for several months now because it won’t charge.  I’ve had nothing but trouble since buying May of 2017.  Need to send another back... but it’s such a hassle.  Wish it would just work.
 Kinda glitchy and the battery life is really bad after only a couple months of usage. Sometimes we struggle to get to the apps we want to view and its frustrating for a toddler
 Love this. My son, who is 7 now. Loves it, takes it everywhere. The only thing that worries me, isn't even the tablet itself, it's the charging adapter. The adapter fits loosely in my outlets and while charging the device it gets very hot after a short limit of time. The cord is also short. I have an extra adapter that we now use for it and it works perfectly.
 I bought this for my then 18 month old for Christmas this year &amp; he loooooves it. His favorite game to play on it is Candy Crush lol even tho he has no idea what he’s doing. 2 months strong &amp; still no glitches or scratches despite multiple drops.
 I bought three of thess tablets the do not good out side of the US. Internet connection is poor. No free time out side of the US. Waste of money
 I’m definitely recommending this to everyone I know wth kids ! 2 year worry free guarantee is one of the best parts. The kids free time area and profile is amazing for them &amp; it makes them stick to their stuff &amp; is so easy for them to use. I absolutely love it the options for apps, videos &amp; books is great!  The case is amazing
 We love this. I especially love being able to set the Freetime so that my six year old can only access age appropriate things. The Freetime only goes up to age 13 so my teens can't access what they'd normally watch unless I add  it to approved sites which is a bit tedious. I love it for my youngest child though!
 An okay basic table BUT the charging port is VERY flimsy. Also getting a replacement is much more than a "2-year worry-free guarantee: if they break it, return it and we'll replace it for free. No questions asked."
 I like the ease of use for a 6 year old.  This was the first tablet in our household.  My 6 year old has used an iPad occasionally at school, but no electronics at home.  She shows me how it works!  I don't like the parental controls - I mean I want them, but I'm constantly reviewing to make sure they're set.  I have the Freetime set that 30 min of reading has to be done before playing apps, but that has never functioned.  I also have app purchases password protected,  but she is able to bypass and purchase apps and tv shows.
 Such mixed feeling about this tablet. It is study and good in that aspect  Think my 2 year old got so used to my samsung that she had little patience for this kid's tablet.  Lots of things I cannot access because of my location....
 My 2 yr old loves this tablet! She now doesn't take my older kids tablets! No fighting.... happy mommy! Battery work just fine, you have to charge it every night. But works for a long road trip!
 How do I return it as it will no longer charge.
 It's a awesome little tablet, my 1.5 year old daughter loves the apps on it! The only downside is not having the YouTube app on it, or Netflix, or vudu. I also wished it charged faster than it does as well. Other than it works great!
 I bought what I thought was a new kindle. Instead it was someone else's. It's in a different language with a pin. I have a child who has been patiently waiting for a new kindle that I have no clue how to get into. Awful. The only reason there is one star on the review is because I couldn't leave zero stars.
 I would highly recommend purchasing this kids Kindle 7!  We got amazingly fast delivery and the product is beautiful,  simple and even has Alexa built in!!  My son will turn 7 in a few days and I can't wait to give it to him!  Thank you!
 Our daughter shared that her 16 month old is very" hands on" and will frequently turn the app that is playing "off".  States she will look for<br/>a setting so that she can't do that, but not sure there is such setting?
 I bought this for my two year old grandson.  He was intrigued by my Kindle, and I'd downloaded a few games and videos for him.  Somehow he hasn't quite grasped "share" as a concept yet, so it was time he had his own.  It's been a huge success - although his Mom has set strict time limits on how much he can use it.<br/><br/>I did go through the whole package and only downloaded age appropriate items - Barney, Thomas and the lovely Daniel Tiger.<br/><br/>I think, as long as you are serious about setting limits, it's a great tablet for a small child.  Love the cover which protects against two year old tantrums!  I know some will think these tablets are not suitable for young children, but I have to say I am amazed at how quickly he has learned to use it - whether we older ones like it or not our grandkids are going to have to be tech savvy to survive in the workplace today.  This tablet is a great starting point.
 Took the plunge and purchased my three year old daughter her first tablet. I was intrigued by this product as it was specifically geared towards children. It was extremely easy to set up and she absolutely loves it! She has books to read, games to play, shows or movies to watch. I can control her time on it as well as check in and see what she has played with or accessed for the day. Would recommend 100%.
 Has been a lifesaver on long drives and road trips. Absolutely love we can download stuff from Netflix so it doesn't need internet. We were also able to download movies onto an SD card and they played fine on the tablet.
 My 5 yr. old granddaughter loves it!!! She's only had it two weeks and over half of her 16Gb of storage is almost gone! She has soo much to choose from with Freetime.
 Tablet sure do with stand my busybody 1 year old. He has threw it countless times and the padding to the tablet is great. The film has kept it from being scratched. Still figuring out the videos and games.  The home page do not let you save a whole lot on it. You will have to go the categories on it. I want to sort the books it don't let you. It has plenty of learning games, books and activities.  Like it.
 It's a fire tablet. The only thing I didn't really like was the case that comes with it. It feels cheap. But it seems to work well because my toddler loves to throw her tablet. This one doesn't break as easily as without the case.
 This same tablet has been purchased for 3 of the 4 kiddos. We love them and the ease of downloading new games to the tablet. Youtube and Netflix are also accessible.  A reliable tablet that is durable (with the case)!
 You would think as a kids tablet it would have screen pinning. It functions as advertised but with no screen pinning or ability to lock screen while viewing movies it’s pretty useless
 This blue case is a life saver. It keeps the kids from destroying the tablet. But, they can access the kid stuff. And if it gets dropped, it might not be such a tragedy. My first tablet was destroyed by falling furniture. This is a replacement. And it has a lot of extra stuff for the kids. But, I can use it too.
 I just received my order and got two blue tablets, I’m utterly disappointed. The option for two tablets are one boy color and one girl color, and they messed up my order, 1.5 weeks before Christmas, seriously?!!
 The Grandkids love their new tablets.  I'm still learning how to control/add content.  Next to learn to add Netflix for kids and YouTube.  The 2-year warranty along with the fun designed protector in blue and pink are great reasons to feel good about buying this tablet.
 Its great for a child. My son is 2.5 and he loves his tablet. The case is super durable. He has threw it a few times and no broken screen, no damage to the tablet itself. Not super fast, or fancy. The children's profile is super limited so no YouTube, or Google play store.  I have it 3 out of 5. Since the camera is super pixelated,  the battery life is nothing to brag about, and the initial boot up takes a good 3 mins to get you into the OS.
 These things are horrible. Always giving problems from freezing to shutting off. I bought these to replace cheap little rca tablets that were dying quickly from age. WiFi won’t stay connected. Won’t turn on or off half the time. Went big and bought high capacity memory cards and the stupid tablets recognize them for a little while then won’t. Purchased three tablets two in the blue cases and one in pink. They all have the same problems. Would literally give zero stars if able too.
 Difficult to use. Non user friendly unfortunately.  Bought for my grand children for use mostly during car rides.....and it does not function most of the times.
 I think the kindles for kids is a great idea... but the reason I gave it only 3 stars is because they really need to come up with a different way to plug them in for the kids. My 4 year old has one and it is only a month old and we are already sending it in because something is wrong with were the charger connects and it will not charge at all. Even after using different chargers. I personally, have 2 kindle fires- one being 6 years old- and no issues at all with either! So, not sure if it is a kid thing, or what... that is why I am suggesting a different type of plug for charging.
 I got this for my grandson and he absolutely loves it.  Shipping was fast and easy.  I'm very happy with this purchase and so is my grandson.
 I got this for my grandson for Christmas and he loved it.  The case is wonderful,  a cup of coffee was spilt on the tablet and my daughter checked and case kept it completely dry. Highly recommend
 it is a good device, tho  the year subscription is useless because I'm not in US, despite here in Uruguay we have Prime to watch series, it doesn't work with freeTime, kinda inconsistent .to ofer just one service instead the whole<br/><br/>Putting that away, it has excelent sound, a good camera and is not heavy at all, it battery duration is ok, and for now my kid love it.
 This product is use to entertain my 18 month old grandson.  This is the best product ever to keep his attention while riding in the car and at home.  I asked myself what took me so long to purchase this item.  My fAmily and I are so very happy with all the learning tools installed.  You have a happy camper here.
 Bought 2 tablets for my daughters ages 2 &amp; 3 to keep them occupied during our travels. Usage in the U.S was great as we were able to get loads of content. However, when we travelled outside of the US shortly after purchasing, they were not able to view any video content. Disappointed they were! I returned them bought for a full refund and purchased 2 other tables instead.
 We have had the tablet for a week now. The kid case is nice. My toddler has already thrown it and the case was definitely good protection. But the tablet is VERY slow. Agonizingly slown when you’re dealing with an impatient toddler. And the screen is not very responsive. I sometimes have to tap a button 10-15 times to try and get it to respond. Other times it won’t respond at all and I have to try and close out of the program. I’m highly disappointed with its functionality.
 I bought this item for my 3 year old boy, he loves it! iIt has lots of learning games and activities to do that are all age appropriate you can download other apps to your liking! It came with a sturdy case and I can monitor his use!
 It’s very user friendly. My child loves it and I love that there are parental controls. The only draw back is you can’t use Alexa when the controls are on. Otherwise it’s a great device.
 Great for kids to use bought them for my grandchildren and 4 years still going ( mine are 2-5 year olds) easy to operate and adults can make it so they are age appropriate
 With a kid that usually removes any protective case, this case is snug enough to stay on. The kids content is fantastic!
 grandchild #2 loves her new kindle.  Big sis, grandchild #1 set the example, she loves jer kindle as well.  they are pretty much kid proof and parent (or grandparent) friendly to set up and get the littles ready to play, watch, learn and enjoy.  A Gammy certified best buy! grandchild #3 will get his kindle by the end of the year when he is old enough.
 Unfortunately after 1 year of having both tablets I purchased no longer work, even with protecting cases. I now am unable to even power on the devices after charging. This is one of the main reason I stopped buying Samsung electronics but I thought I’d five amazon a chance. I know now I’ll stick to APPLE
 This tablet is amazing and I love the 2 year warranty this is my second kids edition tablet I have gotten and I can say amazon really does stand by their worry free warranty. My son killed his tablet twice and I was able to get replacements both times. Since I love the warranty I just bought this one for my daughter and she loves it as well
 Durable with case.  This has been dropped many times!  I like that I don't have to worry about my child coming across inappropriate videos or games as all are kid friendly.  I do wish that the battery would last longer and charge faster.  Overall a good buy for the price.
 This tablet was a HIT with our 9 year old son! There are so many functions on this that I haven't even discovered them all yet. I love that I was able to create a profile on it for me and am able, from that locked profile, to control what he has access to. This is just the perfect size and the case protects the tablet very well. It (the case) is pretty thick, but it is very light.<br/>So far, we love this tablet. You wouldn't know that it was under $100!!!
 I love these tablets. My son 6 has had one since 4. My Daughter now 5 has well.y daughter loves the yellow. She says its like holding the sun.  Lol. The kids get to have their own account and it Awsome that you can set it based on age. I love how they can only do what you put on their account. The best part are the timers. Your able to set options that allow the kids not to be able to be on non educational apps before educational apps for a certain amount of time. Also set timer when the device can ne used and when it shuts off
 Purchased this product for my 1 year old and he loves it! He watches youtube all day on it and has learned his ABC's as well as say words and make sentences lol. Also a great help when potty training him
 Love this tablet. It’s the 3rd tablet I have purchased for my kids. The most awesome feature is parental control and limiting screen time settings. Least I like is the one year free time only. It should be free for lifetime. Overall great for kids.
 For our son, the tablet works fine. Having personally used an iPad, this thing is not a replacement. The UI is not friendly. The tablet is slow. Graphics are not as defined as other products on the market.
 Has lots of stuff on there for kids I like the fact that it was locked out by a team code to keep him from accessing the rest of the tablet I only wish you did not have to enter a credit card number
 Bought this after my daughter cracked a previous tablets screen. She loves the pink bubbly aesthetic. I love that she has beaten the heck out of it and it has taken absolutely no damage. Still holding up strong, still all in once piece. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good toddler proof tablet.
 My daughter loves it..the inclusion of the year of of free time unlimited has helped her use the tablet to its fullest potential.only issue I have is the battery life.right off the back the battery drains rather quickly...even when not in use after a full charge the battery will lose power quick.would be an easy 5 star if battery’s life would be a tiny better.small flaw for such a great kids tablet.case is amazing never had a screen survive some of the drops it’s been through.
 After one month of use I had to send it in for warranty. It would not hold a charge. Then you have to wait a week or more to get it back or for them to send you a new one.
 Love the bumper on this! This is my daughter’s third tablet, and by far this one is the best! It’s the same as her original fire tablets, just with a most awesome bumper around it! Thank God for square trade protection plans!
 Got this for my sons 3rd birthday. He uses my tablet and his sister's so it made sense to get him his own. I love that it has parental controls so I can manage what my kids have access to and the soft foamy cover keeps it safe from damage.
 Arrived looking a little rough, packaging could've been better. It worked though so I didn't bother exchanging. My 4 yr old son loves his tablet, good size for him and I like that we can add a me.ory card if we decide later.
 This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my 6 year old. I was a little skeptical at first as to the types of games would be available for him, i thought they would be too "baby-ish". I charged the tablet and set everything up Christmas Eve so that it would be ready to go when he opened it. He was so excited Christmas morning...he loves the games, books and videos that are available. I also downloaded YouTube so that he can watch his videos.<br/><br/>It downloads pretty quickly. Takes a lottle while to charge. But all in all it is perfect for him!
 My 2 year old son loves his tablet, It's just right for him and the protective case is the best case ever. He dropped it 2 times and it still has not cracked the screen.
 Im surprised based on all the positive reviews. Its slow and we have fast wifi. It doesnt have youtube kids which is what my daughter likes. Shes 3 and isnt fond of the freetime page. The popup ads are annoying.
 I got this as a gift for a friend's kid and it's so awkward when you send a gift with 2 year worry free guarantee and then it stops working within a year. The tablet is not working and not even charging. They did not even tell me about it and it just came out when the kid mentioned if I could get him something like that gift again. I am super disappointed. I will appreciate if you can send me a replacement or a refund for the product so that I can buy something better.
 Awesome tablet. But it stopped charging<br/>I actually bought three of them and each on had an issue , two plugs/ charger broke. Stopped charging and I’ve screen cracked
 I got this for my 1 year old daughter and she loves it. It's hard for her to enjoy it with her 5 year old brother around. I would definitely recommend this product.  I also use it it . All 3 of us have our own profile on the tablet.
 highly recommend. good features, tons of free apps. even my 3 year old can work it. Runs out of memory fast, might have to add an SD card but that is easy and could also just delete items not being used.
 My kiddos love this, but after three months of use it wouldn't charge anymore. With the two year warranty I had no problems buying this, but the customer service to try and get this returned and fixed is ridiculous. There are so many hoops to go through and it is so frustrating trying to get straight answers. I imagine these get returned on a regular basis, being for kids and all.  You would think that they would make it easier for everyone involved. Its almost like they don't want us to use the warranty that is provided with our purchase...
 Love these!! They are the best for kids! It comes with a "kids" profile with kid-centric games, books and interactives. My kids just turned 2 and we have to make sure they don't spend too much time on them! Plus, i can always switch it to my profile and use it as a personal tablet. Best buy for your kids!!!
 The Kindle itself is great, I like the case.  I do find the Amazon set up for Kindle to be confusing and not straightforward when it comes to kids FreeTime and putting videos on there.  This is our second Kids Edition kindle and we are happy with both of them.  I do suggest getting an additional memory card.  For younger kids who don't understand how to remove content or download everything they come across, it will fill up quickly and you'll have to clear space often without the additional SD card.  Also, if you want to store some shows/movies on there for car trips you'll probably want the extra space.
 Absolutely love this tablet so easy for the kids to use and gives me the comfort of the 2-year replacement guarantee! So worth the money! After buying many different tablets for my kids that all end up not working after so long I was so happy to get this with no worries if it broke. Will be buying another for our youngest son for his birthday!
 You get a great warranty for breakage protection with this tablet therefore it was a easy pick for me to buy this for my 3 year old works great and is totally set up for children
 The only reason I don’t like it is because you have to have internet to do anything on it. I’ve downloaded movies &amp; games for my child to be able to use while we are in the car &amp; it never works. I would return it but it was a gift. It just sits it the drawer.
 Perfect Christmas gift for my 21mth old grandchild..she loves it!.You have to pry it from her hands..Amazingly she knows how to scroll and operate her kiddie videos!! The battery has a very long life. It is strong and sturdy gor little hands. I am pleased with my purchase!
 Fantastic item  this will be for my 2 yr old Granddaughter. She uses her Moms kindle now and knows how to find her game and play it. Maybe Mom can get her kindle back now!
 Did not work out at all for us. Purchased one each for our 10 &amp; 8 year old, who were constantly fighting over (mom's) iPad. After a day or so of initial excitement, they started asking for iPad time again, complaining that their "Fires don't work." After investigating we found the devices to be super slow with apps constantly crashing. Also, while I love the Free Time concept, the available apps were just too babyish (and bumping up the age profile made no difference).
 I purchased the Kindle for my 4 yr old daughter at Christmas and it took her about a month to really start using it. Now that we have, we realize that it won't hold a charge for more than 1 day even when shes not playing it. She will only play for about 20 minutes before bed and the next morning battery is dead. I don't know if all the Kindles are like this, but it's extremely disappointing.
 Good tablet for my kids.  I can manage what they are doing for apps and reading and works well on vacation.  Both my kids have their own profiles, with my husband as the admin.  It also has expandable memory and the price from Prime day was awesome.  Early Christmas present!
 So far no problems with tablet. I love kindle fire products and it hasn't disappointed me. My God baby loves his tablet and uses it every day. His mother loves it too because it has educational games and the parental control allows her to set times for bed time. Overall it's a great buy!
 I bought this for my granddaughter.  It is easy for her to use.  The selling point was the free 2 year replacement plan although I'm not sure we will need it.  The case it comes in is very soft and keeps the kindle very safe.  I had also purchased one for my grandson 2 years ago.  He put it through the test as young boys can and we never had any issues with it.  I would recommend this to anyone who wishes to purchase a kindle for a younger child.
 So far so good - a great product so the kiddos feel like they have technology. The 1 year free of the kids access is great. It'll be cut off when the trial is over - way too expensive for how little the kids use it.
 Comparing this to an iPad that I’m use to using isn’t really fair at this price point.  The Fire is painfully slow opening and switching apps.  I like the kids mode but it’s a hassle having to switch to the adult profile to make any changes.  And one of the most irritating problems is that there is no way to lock the screen from getting touched.
 I'm not too sure about this tablet. What caught my attention was the protective case.... I wish it was an android.  The apps and setting under my toddler's profile are very Boring.  She still harasses me for my phone.  Maybe when she's older she can use it but right now she just lays it around 😔😔😔😕😕😕
 I bought this tablet for my 7 year old &amp; it has been a nightmare. We frequently travel &amp; this was supposed to be a source of entertainment but nothing seems to work. It worked for a few days then everything became "blocked" &amp; we weren't able to access anything. It is supposed to come with a year of Amazon Free but it's not allowing us to access videos, apps etc.... aggravating.
 Order this tablet for my 2 1/2 yr old because she wouldn't leave my phone alone. I tossed around the idea of a tablet for about a year before I decided to get it. Seeing her learn from the games on my phone was the reason I decided to take the leap. It came with tons of kid friendly material already on the tablet. I'm considering buying one for nephew for his bday.
 I originally bought this product almost 2 years ago. I love how you can customize the tablet for children. Somehow my 7 year old daughter managed to crack the screen 2 months before the 2 year warranty. But Amazon replaced it no cost.
 The best thing about this tablet is the 2yr guarantee. If anything happens to the tablet within 2 yrs of purchase, they replace it. Works great and the pink cover is the best. The tablet is well protected. Very pleased with my purchase.
 The new home screen on the kids FreeTime is just awful, forced update. Came with the one row of apps as pictured for home page then over night became a mess where my kid can't use it. No option for setup, now its  multiple rows where everything I mean every app  on the home screen is there good luck finding what you want
 I bought these for my four daughters ages 1,4,5 &amp;8 and I love the parental settings and how i cam set everything for their age level and how i can set limits and make them do educational stuff before playing games. Also love that I was able to putbour netflix and sling account on for them and download the movies we have so they can still watch them when were not at home with our wifi these tablets are amazing.  I do wish they had the Lexia core 5 app though. Unfortunately Amazon app store doesn't offer it and it's required by their school so they have to get on my android in order to do that
 I first bought this tablet, for my now four year old grandson, 2 years ago.  He is never without it.  I saw my great grandson (18 mo) watching Mickey Mouse on my daughters phone and knew he had to have his own tablet.  This is the only one.  It can take a serious beating, is a very manageable size for tiny hands and my grandson has no trouble navigating his way around the tablet.
 My daughter loves her new tablet and it's quite easy to navigate. I like that I can put restrictions on it which a lot of other tablets won't let you do.
 I have to have a profile on this. My son may only be four but he is smart enough to figure out how to access my profile and download apps. It's not very child friendly. The designers of this must think children are dumb and can't figure puzzles out...
 We bought this for our 1 YO to help us survive our long international flight. It is light, very easy for her to hold. You don't need to buy a case for it. The battery lasts a long time.  You even get a free one year unlimited subscription which is great. Our kid really loves it.
 I was very pleased with the worry free guarantee on the kids edition tablet. Our screen was cracked on the old one and they sent us a brand new one, no questions asked. This newer version seems to be a little faster and connects with the wifi better than the old version, which was our biggest complaint with the previous one. Great parental controls and the Amazon free time gives the kids a lot of choices of things to do.
 I absolutely love Amazons FreeTime app that comes on the Fire 7 kids tablet. It has special age appropriate content( games, stories and videos)for each child without the worries of them finding sonthing bad on the interenet.
 Not compatible with ABC Mouse and half of storage is taken by operating system. Otherwise, parental controls are easy and work OK. This is our 3rd time purchasing this product. This one, the charger doesn't stay put. Battery doesn't last more than a day. But it serves its purpose.
 I bought this tablet for my six-year-old grandson - he loves it!  His mother is happy because he is no longer using her phone for games, etc.  I just wish there was a way to stop the ads that pop up.
 The charging port on these is very poor quality and does not last very long.  Getting a replacement tablet is a huge ordeal. I recommend getting something else.  No questions asked hahaha 30 minutes of nothing but questions and multiple different people, reminds me of the cable company.
 It's only been a week, but so far we are loving the Kids Edition Fire Tablet.  I was able to reclaim my old Fire tablet from my 2 year old.  There is a learning curve and I still need to figure out how to use the FreeTime program.
 Started my grandkids out with an Innotab tablet but found it to be very limited and ended up letting them use my Kindle Fire. Bought my granddaughter her Kids Fire about a year ago and she loves it (4 yrs. old) and just bought this one for my grandson (2 yrs. old). There are tons of learning programs and learning apps available that will run on the Fire and they are learning all kinds of things.
 bought for my grandson for Christmas. He will like this a lot. He got an adult tablet last year and it was too much for him and frustrated him.
 I like the parental controls and monitoring, however it is very difficult to manage for older kids. I think this would be a great tablet for very young kids. My  sons are 7 and 9 and the content filters essentially everything but PBS level content. Also, it is extremely slow to load anything and tasks are quite cumbersome. I would rather get them a regular tablet and monitor their use myself.
 We got this because it has all kinds of great kids apps &amp; security features. But, you can’t get the kids YouTube app with all the parental controls on. YouTube kids is meant for kids... so I don’t understand why it can’t be added. It was the main reason we bought this. So our daughter could watch YouTube family shows on a safe tablet.
 Love the bright pink case and sturdiness of it. We bought this model for our son a couple of years ago and it's lasted well. Now that my daughter is older and wanting to use her brother's tablet, we bought her her own for Christmas. She likes the beginners games so far. She's 20 months old and catching on. We limit screen time and her attention span isn't too long using it so it works for us.
 This thing works great. It's already been dropped a couple of times so I'm super pleased with the kid-proof case. Everything in the Amazon Free Time is age appropriate so I don't have to worry. I've used it myself to watch a movie so I can honestly say the picture and sound quality are good for a tablet that's inexpensive.
 My son got this as a birthday gift from his grandpa, he’s used it for half a year and it no longer turns on. Definitely not worth spending $100 on when you’ll have to replace it every few months.
 My son loves it however , after 2 months it stopped charging. I’ve been trying to get it replaced through the warranty but amazon has you do a billion steps before they actually follow through on their promise of replacement. Hopefully the issue gets resolved soon, because my son wants his tablet!!
 The tablets are great for kids but the battery life is poor. Adults can have their separate account but, in my situation, my phone performs better than this tablet.  I would recommend it for a kid that's between the age of 5-10, when they are not interested in high-performance gaming.
 My son absolutely love his tablet he loves at books appisodes and videos amazon offers free for a year as well!! I love<br/>The fact that it is versatile and you can also watch youtube
 I use computers/phones/tablets all day every day. I find this one that’s supposed to be for a kid the worst set up to date. It’s ridiculous that you have to download an app in order to disable the screen when watching movies etc. Haven’t been able to find any of those apps to be user friendly or work. Have watched multiple how to videos and am still left confused. Since that was the main purpose of this purchase I wish we just splurged and stuck with an iPad.
 I dislike how the charger ports on tablet give out so easily. My child just received her tablet for Xmas 2017 last yr &amp; less than 2months later...the port started acting up. Buying charger after charger for it til it finally just stopped working. My other daughters tablet is still working but certain chargers won't charge it up. I have to constantly but new chargers for it in order for my daughter to use it. N those certain chargers that don't work on her tablet work fine on my phone so the ports mess up easiely
 Was scared to buy this because of some sketchy reviews about the charging port breaking , but I'm glad I did. It's perfect for my 6 year old and my one rule is he is not allowed to play with it when it's charging that way it won't wiggle and break the port. Duh problem solved.
 My kid loves the entertainment BUT I've had to send this back TWICE (probably more times in the future) because the charging port keeps coming loose!! So frustrating. Bummer
 Great tablet for the price! My son has been playing for about three weeks now and everything seems to work exactly as it should. It is 4 year old friendly and he can navigate all the games by himself. They are educational and safe for him to play.
 Very poor and not intuitive user interface.  For users of iPads the transition to these devices will be very difficult as the navigation is very poor.
 Great tablet for kids. Ordered for granddaughters  Christmas  gift. Very easy setup and quick charging. She loves it and keeps it with her all the time. Plenty kid only content will keep her busy for a long time. Highly recommended!
 We got this for granddaughter's 9th bday &amp; she loves it!!Gma &amp; GPA would love if it came with some written instructions like how to set the parental controls &amp; how to remove the case to put on a screen protector, but we're figuring it out!!
 I would give this tablet 5 stars but just like all of amazons products this tablet runs slow, when I click on an app in the kids profile it goes black for a few seconds before the app opens. There are a lot of kid apps on the kids program I’m not sure how great they are but there is a large selection. The bumper is really bulky but super shock absorbing so far it’s a nice little gift.
 I bought this for my almost three year old for Christmas. I love the warranty that is offered with the product ! I also love the free year of  free time. She has been looking at some of the books, watching the videos. We are still learning how to work it and will be loading educational games onto it this weekend! I like that it also has a timer that I can put on it. In a technology based world I want to limit her screen time.
 I have bought 3 of these for my grandkids. No problem with first one being returned and replaced but now trouble with second one and they keep giving me the run around.  The last one was a Christmas present and the charging port in that one is failing but I can’t get it replaced. I won’t buy another one.
 Just right for my 2 yr old son. I gave it 4 stars because I cant make use of the one year freetime because I live outside the US. So persons outside the US please take note. The covering is quite thick and sturdy. Tablet is well protectef.
 I really wanted to like this tablet.. the quality and material are good, but the functionality is bad.. Basically if i am offline the product will not work.. the apps that i download previously will not appear at all, or sometimes it will show just a few of them.. and the movies that i download will show every once in a while.. i rebooted, deleted, reinstalled the apps again and again and the same issue..
 This was the perfect gift for my 2 year old. He figured out how to use it very quickly and all of the apps from the Amazon kids subscription are GREAT and really convenient. Totally worth the money.
 We got this for our 6 year old Granddaughter and she loves it.  The case is awesome.  Her 7 year old brother loves it as well and now it is on our Christmas list for him so that each one of them will have one.  No more fights and arguments to use the fire.  After Christmas, their household will have two Fires, one pink and one blue.  GREAT product for our little "computer whiz" Grand Children!!!  This is one very happy Grandma!!!
 This case is awesome. We have a blue and pink one. My kids have dropped their tablets so many times and the case protects the tablet every time. It sort of bounces off the floor. It has held up well and holds the tablet snug and secure. Would definitely recommend for all kids.
 It's the perfect replacement for my stolen Nook. The tablet is easy to use for adults and the kids section can easily be set up for any child of any age with easy and speed. No fuss no hassle.
 I bought this kindle only 2 months ago &amp; it started charging really slow &amp; then just losing whatever charge it did have until it just shut down.  I am now having to send it back to have it repaired.  From what I've read online it seems it has been a common problem for quite a while with Kindles to have charging issues either with the port or the battery.  I would advise against getting one.  I have an Ipad &amp; my daughter has a Samsung that we've both had for over 2 years without problems!
 I like the case my grandson enjoy playing all the uploaded games it comes with it I also have my other three grandchildren the same type of of Kindle and they also enjoy theirs and I recommend it to anyone else and it also has a two year warranty in case anything happens no questions asked it's been a good investment for my grandchildren
 This worked well as an entertainment option for several hours of travel. I wish I could figure out a way to lock the top tool bar so the user does not accidentally tap on things like settings, screen brightness, or switch accounts. This is frustrating with younger children who do not understand that drawing down on the toolbar will take them out of their app.
 It's great for reading, my kid loves the case it came with, I don't like that it doesn't have Google Play on there because my son wants to play his games and he can't. It shouldn't take a freaking computer tech to put Google Apps on a kindle tablet. We'll see how the performance lasts. Honestly, I wish we would've gotten him a regular tablet because it seems that it probably is better suited for what a kid wants a tablet for.
 It's not even audible or audio books for my 3 year old. I would've paid less by getting the adult version and putting a case on it! My daughter cannot stand that limited screen with very little to watch! Not worth the money wait until it go down or get the adult one!
 I don't expect much from a cheap tablet but these really are below expectations. The case is fantastic and the kids love their devices when they work, but they are underpowered by any measure. Twice we've had a device refuse to start local FreeTime content until they're brought online...while on extended road trips without connectivity. No errors or anything, just failure to load any FreeTime app. Once able to call home everything just works.
 It's definitely not like an android tablet and I'm a bit disappointed. My daughter has somewhat of a hard time navigating the kids YouTube app. I also didn't realize I would have to agree to a free trial in order to set everything up. It will suffice, but I won't be buying again.
 This is an excellent tablet for kids with a great replacement policy. Of course, you are paying extra for that policy. It cost more than my "adult" tablet. However, I do think it's worth it.
 I bought this for my 2 year old, and I love it so much I want one.  It is very easy to use, and the glare-screen works.  It does not hurt my eyes the way other computers do.  I think I might get one for myself and use it to read.  Right now, I print everything I need to read because it hurts my eyes.  Thank you Amazon!
 I have 2 tablets, one for each daughter. When they work, they’re awesome! But seriously it freezes all the time. Things take FOREVER to download. And then there’s the storage problem. I got an SD card, but it’s such a hassle to get things downloaded onto it.<br/><br/>These tablets are absolutely the most disappointing things I’ve ever bought on Amazon.
 This tablet is very sturdy. It's held up nicely to my autistic kiddo and his meltdowns. My only gripe, which for us is a big one, is that I can't select some of the purchased games from my side for him to play on his. It just doesn't show up to select them.
 I bought this for my 2 year old, had alot of pre-installed kid friendly apps. It took me awhile to get the setup for his account setup because it seem like it kept blocking me, but once I did have it setup. He loves watching movies on it, and games.
 My kids love but a sd card is need for sure. If you have multiple kindles set up under a family library (where apps can be shared) you will constantly be managing the storage.<br/>Very durable and a good device to "grow" with as it has age specific apps.
 Good value for the money but I wish it was a little faster in loading the apps since the target audience was a toddler and they do not have a lot of patience.
 The device itself is great, however be careful with when setting it up especially if another Fire tablet is owned. If an Amazon account is already had it sort of links the tablet to the same account instead of treating it as a separate account. Once the set up was complete it was under my name instead of the grandchild whom I bought it for. It did allow met add him but that's a hassle if I'm not around and he's too young to understand how to switch to his account. Down loading was a bit hard but once down it's great.
 I love it and most importantly my kids love it. It has a lot of parental settings including setting a screen time amount. My daughter is 2.5 and her favorite is all the interactive books. My favorite is the 2 year worry free warranty.
 The performance of this tablet is horrendous. Luckily it’s just for my kids (obviously, it’s a kids edition) - but it’s only been unboxed for a little over a month and it often runs like a 10 year old computer stuck on Windows Vista.<br/><br/>It really is durable and for what the kids do - I will admit it gets the job done. Do not expect to be dazzled by the appearance or performance tho. In reality this tablet falls somewhere between lackluster and mediocre.
 Update: after my review Amazon contacted me and resolved our battery life!<br/><br/>I would give this product a 5 if the battery lasted longer than 30 minutes. Ever since we bought this a year ago the battery life is less than an hour with a full charge and takes a full day to get a full charge. I would rather spend the money on an Apple iPad, at least my child would be able to use it.
 So far I've purchased 4 kindle fires and have had problems with 2 of them. One will not charge (7) and the other keeps rebooting (8). I wouldn't advise anyone to buy a Kindle fire. Sure, they're cheap, but you honestly get ehat you pay for. Thankfully, they I purchased one year replacement warranties.
 Had some issues with it to begin with like I had to set it up from scratch about 3 times before it stuck. Also sad that it won't download Netflix. Needs more variety. Other than that it runs well and I like how simple the layout is for kids.
 I bought these 3 weeks ago for my kids as a Xmas gift. They work great. The only problem we had was one of the tablets was behaving really slow with the kid messenger app at first. I thought it was the app at first, but restarted it and it continued to do the same thing. Took a few restarts to fix it. It hasn't had any problems since then.
 Love the tablet, but super irritated by the charge to my debit card for the first month of my “one year FREE free time unlimited”. Free? Then why the charge?
 I am so disappointed with this tablet. It is so incredibly slow and half the time it doesn’t even work. I bought this for my daughter and she doesn’t even really like to use it because the apps freeze or won’t open. I also bought an SD card that was recommended by amazon to buy with it and there are several times it tells me the SD card cannot be found even though it is in the tablet. This has been a huge waste of money!
 Cute tablet the kids love it I bought 2 and love the free time for the kids perfect for on the go and traveling sometimes it glitches and takes a bit to load but other than that it’s great
 My 9 year old son loves it! He plays it all time and loaded games so he play during rides without wifi.  I love it because I can monitor what he is watching.
 CRAP, CRAP, CRAP... be careful with this thing. It REQUIRES a credit card for activation, and it won't even allow you to continue to setup without it. That is BS.  Also, it does NOT include the Google Play Store to download all millions of Android apps because instead only offers the STUPID AMAZON STORE for apps... THAT IS NOT THE SAME PEOPLE!... it is a stupid idea from Bezos or some other idiot. YES, YOU CAN BE A LITTLE IDIOTIC AND BECOME A BILLIONAIRE AT THE SAME TIME... LOOK AT TRUMP!.
 I bought it for my disabled sister.  She dropped and broke the previous tablet I bought her.  This one is studier.  She loves it.  She doesn't have Wi-Fi in her apartment so her great grand-daughter downloads her games at her house.
 Compared to the Apple iPad. This thing is a pain in the ass. If you can afford it, just get and iPad. It is similar to Android tablets, but find those even easier. I have to keep helping my twin 3 1/2 year old girls with these things. But when they never need help with our iPads.
 My kids are obsessed with these tablets. I absolutely love the timed feature where it shuts off after they have been on it for the set amount of time. No more saying “5 more minutes” and hearing the kid cry. They know when it’s off, it doesn’t come back until tomorrow :)
 Purchased the device knowing there was an app to be able to lock the buttons from being pressed when handing the device to a toddler.  This app has been removed but the supporting apps have not.  This makes the device utterly worthless for a child who doesn't know what the buttons do, as you can't keep a media file playing with the touchscreen active.
 I absolutely love this product. I can have a sigh of relief now and don't have to worry that my toddler spends so much of time watching mindless videos on YouTube. She now uses this tablet instead where she gets the option to play games which challenge her brain and at the same time she learns new things everyday.
 Yes! Love this thing! For long car rides and airplane rides... life saver and very adjustable for ages. Has books, apps and videos. You can access for 48 without Internet if you download. I bought a removable storage for cheap a Micro chip to hold videos.
 Love this item!!!<br/>Purchased this for my granddaughter 17 months old..This is it...Does the trick...<br/>Her own personal tablet...She has thrown it to the floor...Safe!!!!
 This is a great functioning tablet. Lots of features. The display is less than desirable. And, it’s advertised as having 16GB of space. But, when you check your space in the settings tab, it’s says 12GB. If it weren’t for being able to add a card to expand the space, I would’ve sent this back.
 Kids really like these.<br/>I really like 2 yr worry free replacement, as for some reason, the charging connection seems to wear out about then and I was able to get the replacement.
 My Grandson Broke The Tablet After Using It For Over A Year . I Sent It In For Warranty And I Received A New Tablet No Charge. The New Tablet Works Great.  Thanks
 This is a very durable product. Purchased for a 6 year old. It is tecky enough for a big girl but the pink durable perimeter is just right for a little girl.
 I purchased this for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas.  She loves it.  I am having some problems with it running ABC Mouse but I'm hoping I can get it worked out.  For now she is able to play games and watch youtube videos so it is working well.
 These tablets are well worth their price. Buying the kids edition gives you  a no questions asked replacement policy and access to hundreds of ebooks, videos, and apps that are age appropriate for kids.
 It's a nice little tablet. There could be some improvements on it. We can only use all the apps we download if we're in Wifi. And my son keeps accidentally hitting the back button because the bottom bar stays on the screen when hes playing a game so I have to keep opening up the game app (hes two so it's not a problem other people might have) it's very sturdy, hes thrown it out if the crib so many times and no scratches or dings.
 My 3 year old loved this tablet but as time went on it started having gliches and battery life kept getting worse and worse until about 4 months after purchasing, the whole tablet refused to charge at all . Waste of money
 Purchased for my soon to be 5 year old grandson. He loves it, as do his parents. It is easy to negotiate and the parental controls are great. The amount of time spent, the sites visited and how late at night he can use it can all be regulated by his parents. The age appropriate free apps, shows and books are an added bonus. Parents can change to their profile with a password and this becomes the perfect adult tablet. If you are looking for a well made, reasonably priced tablet that will grow with your child, this is perfect.
 I have had this tablet for less than a year now and my son loves it. But The storage on it is not good. I couldn’t even download that much stuff and even after getting an SD card it still said it couldn’t download anything because the SD card is full even though it says it has enough storage. Also it has now completely stopped charging it’s not broke or anything it just won’t charge. I have bought so many different cords and it won’t do anything. Was really hoping this would be better quality. My son loves the shows and everything but it lags and boots him off of it before it stopped working :/
 Bought two of these for my grandsons, they absolutely Love them, very easy to operate, battery lasts pretty long, and charge pretty fast, tons of games available online through the free subscription, great value!! Very pleased!!
 Had many issues with it. Ended up having to make an Appointment with Geek Squad at Best buy to fix the issues. It wouldn't power on. Stayed stuck on the Fire screen. And difficult to download other app stores like Google Play. But it does come with a lot of games preloaded &amp; nice case. After a year of free membership you have to pay for Amazon account to access the apps.
 We bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter after her iPad broke. I like that the fire has parental controls and that it has a wide variety of children’s apps. What I don’t like is that the battery life is not very long, and it’s slow to respond to touch. It takes some getting used to the new software since we were used to iOS. Overall I think it’s a great tablet for the price.
 I have purchased Kindle Fire previously for my grandson &amp; occasionally found purchases I didn’t authorize. Xmas I purchased two for grandchildren &amp; cannot disengage the purchases. Everytime I set parental controls a “tap to turn off parental controls” appears on the screen for the children to tap. They can’t read &amp; are tapping all the time.
 we get unlimited free time free for a year which is great but I dislike that it takes up the entire internal storage and pops up critically low storage within a week. If I had know this I would have not excepted the free year!!!
 I was hesitant to buy my child a tablet. However, with the ability to limit their time on the device and other options that are on the tablet allow me to adjust as necessary their usage of the tablet. And surprisingly he understands it doesn’t fight the time restraint. Good product for the price and capabilities.
 I purchased this for my 2 year old son because I desperately wanted my tv back. He loves it, he can watch tons of things, which I love. However the only reason I wanted to get a tablet for him is for YouTube, because that's all he watches, I was saddened to learn I couldn't get his favorite YouTube shows and songs. But other then that I love it! My son loves it, and it is extremely durable, my son seems to think it's a ball he can throw around lol. I would definitely recommend this tablet for anyone with kids :)
 Perfect tablet for my little guy! I bought this tablet for my 7 year old son. He had an iPad mini, but I got rid of it because I wanted to have more control over his screen time and apps that he downloaded. I bought a leap pad epic but it completely broke after 3 months!! So I bought this kindle and I love it! Perfect tablet for kids and the free time unlimited is awesome!!! So. Many. Books!! Very happy with this purchase.
 Found that it glitches and the newer kindles charging ports seem to go bad quickly. Maybe because I purchased it during Black Friday I got a bad batch.  Also got a Fire HD 8 during the same black friday sale and it is also glitchy.
 I love these they are great for kids because you can control the settings for what they view. You can also set it up for them to do learning goals before they can have fun. Unfortunately the first one stopped working but Amazon has amazing service. They were right on it and sent another quickly. I am extremely satisfied with Amazon and how quick they were to resolve the issue. My kids love them and it often helps me as a single mother soI can get things done around the house. 5 stars all the way I will be a continued customer of Amazon.
 Love these!! Bought 3 for my kids ages 3, 6, and 9, and they love them. I love that I can set it to achieve daily reading goals before they can play games. I love that they are not restricted to certain apps so I can put their favorite apps on it even if it's not age appropriate. Also love that they can access approved websites from their school with just a few setting changes. Great for all kids.
 Had the unit for 30 days and the charging port did not accept a charge.<br/>Be careful, the 2 year warranty states will replace, no questions asked.<br/>After 2 hours on the phone going through troubleshooting, they wanted me to return for repair.<br/>I quoted the written warranty numerous times, finally they agreed to replace.<br/>Just a big hassle.
 Got these tablets for our 4 and 8 year olds and they have been so worth it. Very reasonably priced for the quality and the amount of games, etc you can download. Would recommend to any parent that needs a little peace now and then😉
 So far so good. Didn’t realize it had my personal profile available as well! Like having another kindle! All I have to do is go into kindle free time. Has both my girls profiles on each tablet. Nice having access to everything! And the parental controls are legit!
 Won’t hold a charge!!! It was barely a year when I started noticing the problem. If you don’t have the original charger (which is next to impossible to keep up with) any other charger will be trash. Way to go Amazon...
 My six year daugther loves it; however, I have replaced two of these over a two year period; it seems as they only last about a year. The tablet decides not to charge anymore (the same applies to both replacements).
 It is not much different than the last version, that my daughter had.  She is 8 and loves her kindle.  We paid the monthly subscription in the past for freetime unlimtied that the deal with this model cut the cost by more than half. However, I wish I could get the kids on Amazon music and videos under the normal freetime without having to use unlimited.
 My daughter purchased this tablet with her birthday money and was super excited when it arrived. The item worked well for a while, but sion was unable to be charged.<br/>Customer Service provided an easy work-around, however after a while the tablet could not be charged again and it was sent in for repair.<br/>Luckily, Amazon honored the two year warranty and sent a beand new tablet. My daughter is happy again, but does not think the product will last.
 It's fine, works well for what it's meant to be, but could be set up better.  Screen is very dark and hard to read.  Might just be because I'm old, I dunno.
 The product and case itself are good quality. However, most of the apps require wifi and it is difficult to do any kind of troubleshooting without wifi. Once setup, which is not very user friendly, the product is great.
 Do recommend for toddlers. My two year old drops it and it literally bounces. Do recommend this product to entertain your toddlers when they need to behave.
 This review is on behalf of my father. I am 8 years old. This is a great tablet. It has lot of features. It is kid friendly. It is Great for my baby brother. He loves watching videos on this kids tablet.
 Tablet feels very outdated and slow right out of the box. Navigating and opening apps is really sluggish.<br/><br/>I also realize amazon and Google don't play will together but the lack of any Google apps or features is really frustrating.
 My 5 year old was content to sit through a very long car trip (10+ hours), he was that amused with this tablet. And he didn't even have access to the videos! This is great for his age and he ends up learning a lot from the educational apps available as well.
 This tablet will not charge anymore. Actually, all of the Fire tablets that I purchase as gifts for my family do not charge after having them for less than a year.<br/><br/>Where do I find the warranty information to get this fixed?
 My daughter is a bit young to have one of these, but we use it with her to look at pictures of baby animals and let her color and listen to music and early development apps. She loves to copy her big brother and be just as big as he is when she can.
 Love that my 6 year old son has books and educational games with just a click. I like that I have parental controls. He had to read first for so long before he is allowed anything else. Plus I can put a time to start and end and he can’t get on before or after.
 We bought this as a tablet for my 3 year old son to use ABC Mouse and other reading/educational apps. Sadly, the moment we opened the thing, it has been a nightmare. The charging cord doesn't fit properly so was broken within 2 days, the tablet itself was not user friendly at all for adults or kids. The programs and apps that I researched and made sure worked would never load. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER KINDLE PRODUCT AGAIN. This has wiped out all trust that amazon has built.
 Best one I ever bought! I bought this for my nephew for his birthday and he in love with it and all the games. I love how it is kid friendly as well, just in case he drops it, it doesn't break right away. He is so attached to this, he explores and find new games and love how educational and fun as well.
 Ordered this for my daughter she has had it for 1 week and it has completely frozen. I can not turn it off, lock it, nor even use the volume buttons. Very disappointed to the point of wondering if it's even worth replacing!
 Got this for my son for the learning games and he loves it.<br/>The only thing I really wish I could change, is the apps it shows. It doesn’t just show apps you have downloaded and available, it also shows apps you CAN download which confuses my son because he sees a game he wants to play that isn’t already downloaded and tries to play it but it’s not connected to WiFi if we’re out.<br/>I wish it would only show what he has downloaded already and then when a parent approves another game, THEN it would show on the screen.
 We picked this up on Black Friday for our 2 year old. I know a lot of people will probably think 2 is too young for a tablet, but it’s been a wonderful addition. Helps keep him occupied, instead of getting into everything around the house, and he’s learning a lot from all of the content on it. There’s so much content included on the device, perfect for kids of any age.
 I got this for my 10 yo...she loves it. My 13 yo now wants one. I can monitor EVERYTHING &amp; set times &amp; limits anywhere I feel necessary. And the case is amazing. Best tablet I have ever gotten, hands-down!
 My 7-yr old daughter loves this. It comes w/ 1 free year of Amazon stuff which makes it even sweeter. I love that I can set up her profile and it will only give her age appropriate content. Also you can set how many hours they can use it and if you want them to read you can set that up to be done first before it will let them watch videos or play games. I feel like I am in control instead of her!
 SOOO useful, my daughter is 1 year and 2 months. I was given to her for Christmas. She loves it, has dropped it several times and got it wet with her little hands. It is like brand new even after being thrown around. Really recommend.
 Bought it for my 2 year old (after returning the leapfrog, which  I thought was age appropriate). There is absolutely no comparison between the 2 products. The fire 7 is very user friendly and I like the fact that I can set up different profiles for different ages. This one is a winner!. I had previously bought 3 other ones for my nieces and nephews. Very pleased!
 Value for money but returned the tab. couldn't play youtube or other videos. I think this tab would be perfect with 2Gb RAM at least.<br/><br/>I am giving 5 star because I got my 100% money back.
 Unfortunately my device was defective and it was more of a headache than it was worth!  However I did purchase a pink one for my daughter and so far hers seems to be just fine but the fighting over the lack of one device has been miserable.  I don’t know if it’s possible to purchase these in store but that would probably be the route to go just to make sure it’s set up and working properly before you have to talk to a few people package it and re-ship it back and wait for the new one.
 I originally bout a regular Kindle for my oldest and this tablet for my youngest. Oldest is going to be 9 and the youngest is 7. The 7 year old has autism and loves the kids tablet. While going through the apps I noticed there were alot a apps that my oldest one would like too! So I bought a second one and kept the one I got for him originally for myself. The only thing I wish is that there was a easier way of going through the apps that you could download.
 at start up the screen blinks for 30 seconds or reboot is needed for apps to appear. This model also takes longer to charge then the one we received as a gift over a year ago.
 This tablet is wonderful for kids, put oh my the problems we’ve had. The first tablet bought for Christmas had lines going through the screen that the support team couldn’t even fix. So we sent it back and received a “new” one. The second tablet will not hold a charge! We even tried using a new charger thinking the problem was with the cord or something. But it definitely is not. This tablet has so many wonderful features which make it great for kids, but all of the problems make it not worth buying. I’m very disappointed.
 While I can see this being an excellent product a few years ago, it is having trouble running many apps, and unable to run some at all, simply because the hardware is outdated. If you're looking at this, I recommend purchasing a newer model.
 I bought this for my son for Christmas. I love the Amazon Free time subscription because I can control exactly what my son is able to see on the tablet. It is a good size and the cover seems to protect it well. The only down side is the subscription expires after a year and the cost to renew is almost as much as I paid for the tablet.
 I bought this for my kindergartener and he loves it. It comes loaded with apps and fun things to do. It has great features that are kid friendly, including lots of parental limits. You can create several accounts, so I can use it, too! I highly recommend this product!
 Great! My 2-year old loves it. We limit her time on it. Only issue I have is I struggle with adding more things (downloads) to her profile. I already lost one digital download copy of a disney movie and I can't find it anywhere on the tablet (my profile or hers) yet my download is now used and I can't download it again.
 I will give this item a good review. Its a great unit for the price. However Amazon does not honor the waranty easily. This one star review is for the poor customer support. I got double charged then not given a refund. 4 weeks of multiple phone calls and no progress.

My son loves it (he’s 3) &amp;&amp; it is helping him learn but I am having the same problem with my charger.. I mentioned the problem &amp;&amp; that I thought it was covered by warranty &amp;&amp; they offered me a credit to my account to purchase the charger..<br/><br/>In the video the letters wasn’t moving like he wanted b/c the screen was dirty from him eating..
 Our kindles worked well for our kids for about 6 months, when the charging port completely died on one. The wifi-reception quit working on the other. We called in multiple, multiple times to talk to an Amazon representative, but the problems were never resolved. They wasted hours of our lives talking back and forth, but absolutely refused to replace the tablets in any way. It's dishonest, frankly. Disappointed in broken promises.
 This was my 5 year old daughter's favorite xmas gift (and it hadn't even been on her list) The 2 year subscription is awesome and there are so many games, videos, movies and books to access.
 I am impressed with this product especially because amazon is very understanding when it comes to kids devices. My daughters charger port was broke and they sent me out a new one and I sent back the broken one without any hassle. This was after a year of owning it. I like that I am able to control her internet use as well. Does not offer a ton of storage though.
 Love this tablet. It took a little getting used to. We are used to the Android platform. You can unlock and get all their spooks took though. Also the warranty is unreal. We dropped it in the bath and they replaced it for free.
 Perfect gift for siblings. Not easy to set up if you are giving to someone not living with you and if you do not want your amazon account charged for their purchases.
 I bought 3 of these for Christmas for my boys and they love them. The battery lasts a long time but at the same time they take a long time to fully charge. I signed in with my Amazon account and made the kids profiles with that but since all 3 of them are technically using my account the memory space filled up fast. Will have to figure out if I can make a individual Amazon account for them. Overall I'm satisfied with them.
 I got this for my son when we were moving across country. It really helped to keep him entertained on our 4 day journey. It's very kid friendly
 I'm really impressed! I purchased this for my 3yo for Christmas and she has fallen in love with it. Super simple to setup for your kid, with great learning apps, videos, books and more... The Fire 7 Kids was a really easy and great choice. The Kid proof casing is unique and has a good grip to it, and also is very comfortable to hold for a long periods of time. The Year of Amazon FreeTime Unlimited is absolutely a bonus! It has so much to choose from and so much to offer your child. I feel that I've made the right choice in picking this tablet for my child!
 We bought this for our 5 year old son for Christmas and he loves it!  It is super kid friendly and I love that I can set the terms of his use on it.
 We love our amazon kids tablets. There is a bit of a learning curve for my husband and I since we are Apple users, but the tablet itself is durable and works great!!
 Received as gift. Kris child occupied and tho item is geared for children with children's programs you can set it up where adults can explore on the internet and use as a regular tablet but block it from child going on internet.
 Has not been used enough to really know if it will be what we needed. The idea was to have a devie other than parents phone to view youtube. It is great that it has parental controls.Now to get my kid to use it instead of our phones.
 I'm a huge fan of Kindle Fires. We now have 9 between my children, grandchildren and myself. The kids package is perfect for allowing the children to see videos and play games without the worry of them being on the web.
 Perfect tablet for my toddler. Lots of available contact with prime. Plenty of room so far. Teaches my toddler how to hold the tablet correctly and it durable with then added foam on the outside. The foam is also high quality and doesnt easily deteriorate.
 This was a gift for our 9 year old daughter.  It works great.  We love the parental controls we have.  We are able to limit her time on it and manage the content she can access.  It is quick and easy to use.  I thought I might be a bit too small but it is the perfect size for her.
 I love everything about this tablet. I got one of my daughter (7 years old) and I love it so much I got one for my 3 year old son. When my kids are on it I have a piece of mind that they are not going to watch anything I do not want them to watch. My daughter loves reading on the tablet too. I recommend it for everyone.
 This is the second one we have purchased (one for our daughter and now one for our son). It is great. We love the parental control features and it is very user friendly. We had a different brand of tablet before that doesn't compare to this one.
 This tablet is the perfect choice for kids!! The games cover all age ranges. My son is soon to be 6 years old and adores it! The bumper case is awesome. I did put a screen protector on it, well, because he's 6. It has a large variety of games, entertaining and educational. The only recommendation I would have is to order an sd card with a ton of storage that is compatible. He quickly ran out of storage and did not want to uninstall any games so we did get an sd card. It also has great parental control options. I wish I had ordered one sooner.
 Ordered 3 of these for my kids back in June of this year, it’s Now October and none of the tablets will charge anymore. I have tried to go through their steps to reset the tablets, but their batteries are completely dead and won’t charge at all, so resetting doesn’t work. I have been searching for an answer on how to use the “2 year worry free guaranty” but keep getting sent in circles.
 Battery life is terrible. Will not keep a charge for even a day. Product is extremely slow and does not want to learn things quickly. It seems like there are 50 things running when there is actually nothing running. I have only placed one video on the tablet since I got it. Not happy at all.
 Bought this for my grandson for his birthday.  Only had it 8 months and the charging port has already gone bad.  Not really impressed with the fire tablet.
 These stop charging,sontired after almost exactly a year I have to keep replacing for my kids.It is slightly over a year so warranty expired.I see there's tons of comments of same issue.Everything is made like crap these days and from China!
 My daughter is 3 and is rough on her devices. We have had the Fire for about a month now and it is really holding up well. I like that I can have an account on the tablet without sharing apps. Freetime is great!!! I love it,  I didn't think I would like having all the preloaded apps but this is great.
 I ordered 4 of these about a year ago and they have held up to my kids dropping them and leaving them sit around. The only main issue I had was I felt like the charger port was too loose. But Amazon has definitely held up their end on the replacement warranty. I plan on buying another 1 for my younger daughter.
 Love the features that allow a parent to limit play time. Being careful of charging, because every tablet we’ve owned so far has had the charging socket go bad which ruins the tablet.
 Love this kids edition. Had previously been buying the regular kindles for him. The case and easy use of this is perfect for a 6 year old.
 We bought it Nov 2017. Its 5 months later and the charging port is shot. It will not charge unless the charging cord is wrapped around the kindle a certain way.
 This is my daughter second tablet having same problem , the charging not working well , get stop suddenly , we repair it twice and keep having same problem . It’s waste of money
 Didn't realize the tablet works only with prime membership.  Not comfortable with that.
 Bought for a bright 7 yr old.  Family members bought Osmo drawing products to go with it.  Was a great gift, amazing what it can do!  Very happy with it.
 Worked well to keep my grandson entertained and busy, but the charging unit stopped working on the tablet and we can't get it to charge up any more.
 this tablet is perfect for my 5 year old. it came with an amazing amazon app for kids. the games are all there at one touch and my little one can log right into her profile and play with no worries on my side if the games and content are age appropriate. i would gladly buy again.
 Screen cracked easily I will wait to return if it gets worse I bought a screen protector to make it last a little longer.. Christmas gift to soon to be with out
 So cute LOVE IT my 2 year old is gonna love it..is EXACTLY like the picture it looks so extremely durable though i advise buy a screen protector! Thats the ONLY thing it doesnt have...intereface is magical for him. A MUST buy!
 My three year old LOVES his tablet and Freetime Unlimited. The case is sturdy and provides great protection. The ONLY negative things I can say is that it takes a long time to charge and it didn’t come with a screen protector and so I had to purchase that separately (kind of important with kids!). It was a great price, I’d buy it again.
 Daughter loves it. Still learning how to use. As she is two but getting the hang of it. Just need to figure out how to limit her screen time on it
 Purchased 2 as Christmas presents and we’ve had issues with both of them. The first one quit charging after a week. The second tablet takes 5x as long to update or download anything  than the other did before it decided to stop working. So far I’m on my 4th amazon customer service representative who’ve all asked the exact same questions every time and then transfer me to someone else. Can’t say I’d recommend this device or amazon’s customer service department.
 I am so very disappointed. I should have listen to the bad reviews that I had read before I bought it. When we 1st recived it was cracked in the box. Amazon sent another vet quickly to replace . Now this one freezes up all the time , the battery doesn’t last long at all maybe 2hrs. My 2 yr old gets so upset because of it freezing up on him and he can’t do anything with it. So sad I was excpecting a better product from Amazon.
 I love this tablet! It is great for my kids. I love that it comes with a case already on it and that with the freetime unlimited subscription my kids can download 1500 games, aps, videos, n books for free. I especially love that it has a parental control that limits time on the device and you can setup a time for them to do reading n educational games or aps.
 Was a Christmas gift for my oldest and he loves it so much. Even with his slight developmental delay he has no trouble navigating to what he wants and then some. and when he is at school we let his little brother play with it (shhhhh)
 Durable And kid proof. My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves it. She is learning a lot from the books and activities they have available on it. Definitely a must buy when you have a toddler.
 I love this tablet. My child is a year and a half. Its perfect for in the car and when out and about and she needs a little entertainment. Easy to navigate and I like all the options for nursery rhymes and child friendly videos to watch.
 I got this for my daughter for Christmas really excited for her to learn and play with it. I really love it but the only downside is the terrible battery life. I thought maybe I just got one with a bad battery but I see a lot of reviews with the same problem. It's a bit crappy considering some children can get really attached to their tablet and stopping to let it charge more than 4 times in one day causes quite a bit of a hassle for a parent.
 I got this for my 6 year old son for Christmas, he loves it!! It has actually surpassed my expectations because he was not a reader and now that he can pick and download his own books he’s truly enjoying reading. Of course he plays the games but I am most pleased about the reading. I am also impressed with the battery life. Overall love the product and would highly recommend it to anyone.
 This tablet works wonderfully, my toddler loves watching all kinds of shows on it. I can also set it to allow access to Netflix so she can watch movies in the car (using my cell phone as a hotspot). Battery life is decent. The pink case allows this thing to take all kinds of bumps with no problems.
 This tablet is perfect to occupy your kids with learning games and videos. Yet it allows the parents to still have control of the amount of time the child can be on the tablet. I used this to help my kids with their sight words, simply math, and hand writing. Only con I have is the storage memory is 16gb. I would recommend this to anyone with young kids.
 my son is really exited with all that he can do with this tablet, hes is 6 and curious about the world, loves movies, books and all that it contains.
 I purchased this in April 2018 for my daughter with the "worry free" 2 year warranty.  Now less than a year later the battery won't hold a charge and the charging port is extremely lose.  I've been trying for over an hour to find a contact phone number or email to request my warranty be fulfilled.  NO LUCK.  Amazon only provides a mailing address as contact information to get the warranty fulfilled.  That is straight CRAP.
 These are horrible with the amount of ads that pop up all over the place. They are not kid friendly. My 3 &amp; 5 year olds get super frustrated. They have gone back to my ipad!
 not what i expected. Tablet can be used without internet connection which is good. Apps took a LONG time to download. I inserted a 64 gb memory card to be able to download a lot more content but it turns out that tablet does not let you download/store items on the memory card. Also, tablet states you can download videos but that is not true.
 Like:<br/>-Fast, free shipping<br/>-durable case<br/>-quality screen<br/>Dislike:<br/>-difficultly in switching users<br/>-parent controls are not intuitive to set up<br/>-downloaded apps aren’t working well offline<br/>Enjoy Amazon products and services but this tablet could use an easier interface. That said the warranty and affordable price can’t be matched.
 Horrible, you'd think that the worry free warranty would be a deal breaker but absolutely not. I'm on the 3rd tablet and there has been no damage whatsoever. The first one just stopped charging. The second one restarts every 30 seconds. Only God knows what the third one will do. It hasn't even been a year yet from the first purchase. Horrible, just horrible. If you buy this tablet, be prepared to have it replaced several times within the first year.
 much slower than an iPad and ther eis a learning curve to learn the User Interface, after that its a pretty decent tablet for the price.  It is slow on loading and switching applications.
 It’s a nice size and I like the protective case that it comes with ... however it freezes up a lot.. which is very inconvenient another thing is my kids love the YouTube kids app and while It has like its own version it’s not the normal app so my kids have barely played with the tablets since Christmas because the apps are so different... huge disappointment as I thought this would be great for my kids while we traveled and for quite time during the day ... would not recommend .
 It’s fine to hold my kid over until we can afford an iPad. Apps we use aren’t available, battery is awful. Super slow response time. Parental controls are good but there’s more cons than pros. Save your money and buy an iPad.
 Very good deal, kid proof case is excellent, well thought-out. Battery life is excellent while playing videos. Bought it to keep a toddler occupied on a road trip and it did its job. In my opinion it paid for itself within the first use.
 We bought this tablet for our 7 year old daughter as a birthday gift! Everything was great, it worked just fine for a week. We have since then been experiencing some problems! Some times it lags and freezes so bad that I have to force it to turn off! Recently it stopped playing games/videos after they are downloaded for the road. Traveling was a big reason we bought this product, it gave our kiddo something to do on long trips. Very disappointed in this tablet!
 Horrible product! If I could choose zero stars, I would. Do not buy this product. I bought 2, one for each of my children. Within a month both of the charging ports were broken and I had to return them. So far I have only gotten one back and get a different story every time I call and ask when I will be receiving the second tablet. So frustrated. I wish I had never bought them in the first place. Everyone I know who has gotten this same tablet has had a problem with the charging port going out.
 My daughter absolutely loves her kindle. It has so many books and games she can load. The only down side is the camera is horrible. Every time she takes pictures or video chats on it the image is extremely blurry.
 The tablet was delivered very fast. I like the squishy case in comes in. The screen size is perfect for my little guy to hold. He sound isn’t super loud but it doesn’t need to be so that’s okay. All in all it was easier to navigate than I originally thought it’d be. There are still some quirks I’m figuring out but I can’t wait to give to my 3 year old for his birthday!
 My daughter loves it!! And thanks to no ads for YouTube!
 I was disappointed that this only lasted for a year before it just stopped turning on despite being well taken care of and charged when needed.
 Bought this for a 4 year-old's birthday and not only is she pleased with it, but I am as well. She already dropped it once and it's fine. She loves the children's games she has to choose from and I think every game she's downloaded is perfect for her age. I am very pleased with this tablet!
 crappy product. It's not made well. I guess that's why it's cheaper than other similar products. I'm not happy with the battery life specially. In less than 6 months, full charge doesn't hold a few hours. waste of money
 I like that you can now have an sd card to expand the memory of the tablet. The rubber bumper case keeps the tablet safe from drops, throws and falls from children. One thing I would keep in mind is making sure you monitor what the kids but in the app store. There needs to be a parental control in the app store to prevent kids from buying games without permission. At least add a step that you have to put in the pin, a scramble code or something to confirm the purchase. The charge can last the whole day from 100%. I would recommend this product.
 Only thing I'd change is parental control over the volume. Make it so they can't raise it louder than what I set it to. Also you can set the adult profile to use the blue shade nighttime screen setting but it doesn't extend to the child's profile. Free time content is very good and VERY extensive. If you can spring for it then get more memory. Gets used up quickly.
 This is a great kindle and is perfect for children. It’s features are exactly as described and my 3 year old loves it. It is educational and entertaining,  What more could you want?
 I bought two of these for my two boys. They love them. The only complaint I have is that some of the games on free time, if you close them and then want to open them again they won't load unless the tablet is turned off and turned back on again. But other than that they are great.
 This product suffered the same issues that are rampant with the batteries in the kids fire tablets.  After one year of careful use it will no longer charge and is now useless.  I tried all of Amazon's recommendations to revive the battery with no success.  If you want a tablet for you child that will last you will want to shell out for an iPad.  We also found the content of apps lacking.  Again, you will be much better off with an iPad for product and content.
 This tablet is great for my 2 year old son. it has Parental control which i love and It was easy enough for him to download new apps and figure out how to play the games. The unlimited books and movies are AMAZING! we paid only $20 more for this tablet versus another one we bought that didn't have the TV shows/Movies which we ended up returning. I even use it to get on the internet as i have my own separate account as I'm a Prime member and EVERYTHING if free for the year! I highly recommend this for your Child!
 Terrible device. Slow. Constantly freezes. The OS sucks. And the whole device is buggy. Second fire tBlet I have purchased and both were junk.
 This item that was purchased for a  Christmas gift for my 3 year old great niece has not met with my expectations. It freezes between 2-5 times a day.  It am extremely disappointed. Is the common or is this a bad product that I purchased.  My 3 year old gets so frustrated.
 My kids both have one and they love them. They have been dropped, tossed and one rained on for thirty minutes in a downpour. They have been tried and tested.  The only con is that they are a little slow.
 Love this tablet! My little one uses it daily. There a such a wide availability of apps to choose from that help with various levels of learning. Keeps him entertained and in a good way. Also, the 2 year no questions asked warranty is a HUGE plus, too
 It has survived essentially a hurricane of toilet water, mysterious sticky hand-goop of a 4 year old, and snot/tears of children being told they "have to go to bed". I know, I'm the devil. And it still plugs in. Kind of difficult to navigate at first.
 So far I'm very happy with this tablet. Love the Freetime and being able to set timers for the amount of time it can be used, etc. I am a bit leary of the No Questions Asked warranty, based on all the trouble described in previous reviews. Hopefully, I won't have to deal with it.
 My 2 year old loves her tablet! Many times I've watched it bounce of the floor, concrete and tiles. Still not a since crack or scratch after 2 months of daily use and abuse! Wish the battery lasted longer but still amazing
 Bought this for my 7 and 2 year old and they’re ok. I mean it keeps them occupied but it freezes often, loses charge quick, and takes forever to charge.
 Got this for my Grandson's 2nd Birthday.  He loves it.  It is great as a traveling companion.
 My two year old loves watching his favorite shows, and he has even found some he hadn't see before that he now loves. This has a great assortment of included apps which are fun to watch him figure out and play. Great product, great warranty, highly recommend for a little one.
 I would love to love the kids kindle however I've now purchased two in the last 3 years.  They only last long enough to be outside the warranty. Very disappointing.
 Fantastic for the car. Love the free time and that it’s preloaded so we don’t have to search as much for appropriate apps and shows for our kid.
 Worst tablet ever. Slow. Glitchy. Turns off and on by itself. Definitely don’t recommend for small kids. It just frustrates them. Have since reset it and yup still awful. Won’t even download an app
 Had a 5th generation that had charging port problems. Finally received a replacement 7th generation. Battery life is even worse. Want you to turn off Wi-Fi. Kind of hard to get the full benefits of Amazon free time when you have to constantly turn on and off Wi-Fi to download something else. Didn't have that issue with older model. Barely last 1.5 hrs.  Customer service did not have any answers this time. Disappointed.
 Very dissappointed with this tablet.  It has crash dumped twice while in kids mode.  You cannot run any kids movies.  My daughter loves the games, however she wants to watch the movies but can't on this tablet.
 This tablet has been great so far for our 2 year old! The only thing is it seems to be a bit slow in loading apps. Other than that, it has been wonderful for keeping our toddler busy during travel.
 Really happy with this tablet. I like that the profiles set and lock so only you can change it from theirs to another one. Full parent's control on this kids tablet.
 We got this trailer for my grandson for Christmas he's 4 years old and he really loves his tablet lots of educational games hopefully this will put my head in school. I however would recommend getting the case that has the handle for the tablet the case that comes with his good with the handles much better.
 The tablet works just fine, if I was to do it all over I would buy the 32gb instead though.  My girl's both have one and they love them but they are always "full".  Spend the extra money and save yourself arguements with your children.  A lot of apps won't go on SD cards.
 My daughter is 6, and my son is 1. I got these as a last minute black Friday deal for a long road trip (lots of elmo for the toddler! ) since our Google nexus broke almost a year ago.  They are definitely worth what I paid. The only downside I have come across is the loading time. When we switch tabs, the apps and icons take quite some time to pop up and it's a little frustrating for the kiddos, but that's such a minor set back. Overall they are great.
 These tablets are SLOW and have very little internal memory. Additionally, we are now having problems with 3 of the 4 we own charging. We've had them all less than a year.
 I bought this for my grand baby who is incredibly tech savvy at age2. She LOVES it and can absolutely navigate it properly. It saves my phone the added baby use and potential drops and no worries about accidental searches etc.
 It is very entertaining for my 3 year old grand son  he  like it very much and the free subscriptions for 2 years is free wowwwww awesome
 My 9 year daughter really enjoys having this tablet. She loves to read and this gives her so many options of books to choose. Her tablets charger connection became very loose and then one day it would not charge. This was only  after 9 months of use. We will see how this new one holds up.
 Really nice for the kids to keep them busy.  And tons of free games you just need wifi to watch Netflix unless you download movies before you leave the house
 Bought this for my 2yr old and he loves watching his videos on it.....It is very clear and Durable which with a tantrum throwing 2yr old that likes to throw things, is a BIG plus.....the only thing is that I wish it came with a kick stand or something so that he didn't have to hold it the entire time he's watching it.
 Worked great for the most part, but right at about a year after the purchase the battery started draining quickly and wouldn't turn on at all sometimes. Surprise, the replacement window has closed and at this point it doesn't last for more than an hour when it does turn on. Certainly not due to overuse because my children have very limited time with it and it isn't even used on a daily basis. First kids edition tablet and very disappointed in the longevity.
 Just really slow!<br/><br/>Maybe I've gotten so use to Apple products but it's just really lagging all the time. My toddler is always whining when he's on it because its not loading and or takes forever. I have to turn it off a lot to get the internet or Netflix back up running. We end up just using our broken screen iPad because we don't want to sit there the full time.
 I purchased this for my 2 year old granddaughter. It is the perfect size for her. She has been using my iPad to play games and watch Disney movies when she visits. Now she has her own, and she loves it.
 My child loves this Fire 7 tablet, its easy to navigate for her and has tons of games, shows, movies and random things for her to do. They also have learning games which I really like about it, also the case is super nice my daughter has dropped this so many times and that case saves it everytime.
 Very sad we have only had this tablet for about a year it was okay at first but now it  doesnt stay charged for more then two hours, i keep having to get extra memory for it, and you cant really play with it offline which is when my son most the timeuses it.it also doesnt charge when it goes dead it has to be turned on or it wont be charged. Which doesnt make since !  (When we travel). I will not be ordering another but now looking for a new tablet !
 These are pretty awful devices. Difficult user interface and basically unusable charger connection now after just 3 months of use
 We bought this for our 4 year old when the tablet we had through our cell phone carrier broke. She hadn't had the other tablet even a full month when the charger port went bad. We should have went with this Fire 7 first. It has the parental controls that allow me to choose and limit how much she's on it so I can make sure she does her learning games before playing or watching videos. Smartest choice we made!
 I have two of these for my grandchildren ages 2and 4. They figured out quickly how to use them. These tablets are inexpensive, have great picture quality, can stream movies and the Kindle Free Time is amazing for the kids! Love these Kindles!
 Mine had constant problems. It would constantly need to reload games I'd already downloaded, super slow, I just couldn't stand it. I had to send it back.
 I purchased this for my toddler. Over all it’s a good tablet but sometimes it moves slow when trying to open apps and it’s somewhat difficult to add new apps and games to the kids profile but over all a good product
 Ordered this for our daughter for christmas (2017). And she loves it. I love the parental controls. The case is sturdy and is on there very snug. I bought the screen protector sheets, they recommended, but the case is so snug it just messed up the sheet. :( but it's worth the money, in my opinion. Came with LOADS of apps and books (she loves all the books more). Battery lasts a while, depending on what she's playing/watching. Youtube does drain the battery though.<br/>Would recommend for other children.
 It works, very slow, my daughter enjoys playing ABC mouse which takes forever to load, forever to charge, and to go back from an ap it takes forever as well.
 Very happy with this product. We loved the first one so much (2015 version) that we bought a second one (2017 version) so they each have one. Definitely recommend purchasing an SD card to free up space.
 We've had this for 1 and 1/2 days and it stopped. All was good, daughter plugged it in and now it won't. I am so livid I can't see straight!
 If you haven’t bought a tablet for your child yet, look no further! This is the one. So affordable, and worth every nickel. She loves Amazon FreeTime... and I trust that all the content and apps are perfectly appropriate. Every day that I see her on it, I’m amazed by how much more she is capable of things I would have never expected. Such a great product!!
 they were great about replacing but they couldnt figure out how to give me a blue cover replacement instead i got a pink and my grandson wants blue
 My kids love it. It’s necessary to turn it off to clear its memory every few days or video issues occur, but it keeps my 2 year old from trying to use my phone and my 10 year old loves to use it to read or play games.
 This is a nice little tablet for my toddler! I bought it for her for Christmas. It came with the pink foam cover, which is really nice!! It also came with the free 1 yr. subscription to the Freetime. She really enjoys the games and being able to watch some of her favorite shows on it as well.
 The Fire tablet keeps my grandson very busy.  He learned his alphabets, counts and writes his name. A lot from his fire tablet.  He really know more bout apps than I do.
 My kid loves the tablet. I was very unhappy because it was 9999 when I bought it and then the following week it dropped a 6999 and they would not adjust it. Very poor customer service.. they were $50 on Black Friday and when I called to see if they would just credit my account $30 for an additional Amazon purchase they refused and we're willing to let me return it
 This is the second Amazon fire tablet we have bought for our kids.  They never disappoint!  Our older daughters is going on 3 years and still holding strong!  Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a tablet for their little ones
 This is our second Fire Kids edition. Its slightly different than the one we bought in 2016, but still very similar. Overall it seems to work well for my 7 and 9 year old kids though we don't really use the kid's software features. We bought it  mostly for the included case and warranty.
 Bought it for my 3 year old son and he loves all the apps it offers for his age. With the bumper and a glass screen protector (bought separately) it stands up to alot of abuse. Also it's not as heavy and bulky as the nabi. And at a lower price so that's a plus.
 Very lightweight and did a great job keeping the kids' attention, but it's a little messy going back and forth between my profile and the kids' profiles. Using a regular browser, for example, to just watch videos, requires a logout/login, as the kids are restricted to their apps and downloads only.  Still, for the money, the battery is all-day, and the cover has already saved it from at least a few death-drops in just a week's vacation.
 Terrible product. Save up for an ipad. Leave this junk behind. Volume at it's highest level is still too quiet to listen to music or have a decent conversation with anyone. It's very slow, and crashes often. Can't express enough how awful this thing is.
 Love this Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet w/ kid proof case! My 2 year old grandson got one for his birthday and it is very durable and educational for him to use. He knows how to scroll and go to his favorite videos, games, and e-books already. My three year old grandson had one first since he was two and he helped show his younger cousin how to work it. Great to have when going to appointments and on road trips. I recommend this to everyone who has little ones.
 Love the year of freetime! It's full of great books, apps, movies and more. The kindle is durable and my daughter loves the color! So worth it for little kids!
 This was a lifesaver on our family vacation to Maui. A 6-hour flight felt like much less after having our own customized entertainment set for our 13 month old son. The device is lightweight and well-protected by the case. We liked that it was quality and affordable. A couple of other parents happened to have one of their own on the flight which reassured us we made a good buy!
 This product is horrible in so many ways! 1st there is absolutely NO volume 2nd can not download anything from kids app it's a waist of money.
 I have been very happy with this product except for the fact even with the parental controls, somehow my four year old was able to purchase a game. I had it setup to not allow it and it let him anyway.
 This has been a great gift for my grandkids.  They come in a case that has held up well since Christmas.  Overall the product is excellent.
 My husband and I got these for our granddaughters as a Christmas gift.  They really enjoy using them to learn with the apps that they picked. Easy for them to navigate &amp; Mommy &amp; Daddy are happy to have their tablets back. Good price for a great product.
 The tablet was very very very good. I have two children who have a tablet each. They have dropped it and and it has fell. No damages so far lol. I like the settings for the kids, in which you control their time and what content they are playing and watching.
 Bought for my 4 yo son for Christmas.  He absolutely loved it.  We use it with free time and I love that he has a safe place to play.  I also love the option to set how much time he can use it for... and he has yet to figure out away around it.  Very sturdy he has dropped on concrete multiple times and it still runs great.
 These things are great!! Use when I travel for my toddler and when eating out and the boy starts to get bored.
 Awesome! Purchased for my 2 year old granddaughter and now everyone can have their phones back. Works perfect for her to watch her favorite characters videos. The case works really well. She’s dropped it a few times and there has been no damage. We own 4 Fire tablets already. Great tablet for the money!
 Kid loves it, easy parental controls. Still fully functioning tablet. Kid broke screen 5 weeks in, Amazon didn't hesitate to help us replace it. All I had to pay for was the box and packing materials at home. Very, very pleased about that.
 This product is just okay.. I wish the case had a stand because it’s for children after all and the battery life is absolutely terrible. It barely makes it through one movie without it almost dying.
 Exactly what my seven-year-old needed. Let him place games for a while, read for a while, maybe watch a video. It locks itself up when he's used up his time. Two-year replacement in case of breakage? Any parent who can't stop their child from running with fragile objects will appreciate this one. But when the foam case, it stays pretty safe. The best part? Login with your own Amazon account and use it like any other Fire. With a giant foam case.
 The tablet is functional &amp; the kids case is a great addition. I'm a little disappointed that the disney videos I downloaded are not readily accessible from the children's account. This feature would make traveling much easier. The layout could be streamlined  a little better, but all around, it's a useful kids tablet.
 very poor quality screen, horrible photos.  Does not hold a charge for the described 12 hours.  It might get 2 hours of actual viewing time before getting to 0%.  I'm returning it, maybe mine was defective.  who knows.  I will not buy another one.
 My 3 year old loves it. She plays the games on there it keeps her entertained while we run errands. Also I like that it comes with the case shes tossed it and it's still working.
 I really like how durable and that I can set it up and customize for each child. I do like that I can lock my child into a specific program but wish I could lock them into each game as well. My children are so young and it would be more convenient.
 Bought two of these for our kids for Christmas. By the end of Feb we gave up trying to figure out how to get them to work properly. The kids could open any amount of apps at the same time slowing down the system and then making me and the kids upset. Going back to the Apple products where you can lock the screen and keep the kids on one activity at a time. To me with that amount of frustration it’s definitly worth the extra money for an Apple product.
 The kindle kids addition isn't what I expected. I expected something much more for kids. It freezes a lot during games and or watching Netflix. The battery also dies fast and gets hot while charging.
 The fire 7 kids edition is a addition to my kids toys. Obviously use screen time wisely, other than that the blue rubber protector around the tablet is a nice feature to have if your child likes to throw things 😁.
 After a year the tablet wouldn’t hold a charge.<br/>The tablet I bought the year before in 2016 also stopped holding a charge.
 My daughter loves it. Plenty of free things to download but Amazon still wants a credit card for billing a free app or download, that just don't make sense.
 This says it comes with a 2 year worry free guarantee, but I've had the item 14 months and was told the replacement window closed at one year. My daughter just cracked the screen so I guess I will be cancelling the Amazon freetime subscription.
 second one weve had! I have twin boys but the NEW replacement came w/the pink cases no biggie right super durable they love their tablets!
 I bought this for my 2 year old son. He loves it. I love it. The parental controls are awesome!  I have the option to focus on education before entertainment. Daily educational goals, time limits. Very easy to block videos you don’t want your child to see. And there will be videos you don’t want your child to see no matter the age content you set. The bumper is super thick and the tablet is durable. Not cheaply made. Great product!
 This product is so awesome. The feee year of amazon free time is great! There are ao many books, shows and games for little ones! The case is durable and has been through some crap with my toddler! I love the deal on this kindle
 My 2 year old grandson lives this, I love that it is very sturdy, he has stood on it!  Would recommend highly awesome product it really is kid proof. The range of apps will satisfy
 disappointed in the amount of content available when offline, pretty much none, wanted it for trips for a 2 1/2 year old. The content when connected is good but many things require additional purchases to do much.
 They seem to be awesome. For the price! The case is a heavy like foam case. But yet feels plastic. I think it will with hold a 3-4 year old no problems
 once we got an SD card and figured out how to move around the device, its pretty awesome. i use it when my son is sleep. speakers could be better, but that's why we have headphones.
 This are just crap, its great they are cheap but the amazon store is complete garbage compared to anything itunes or the google store has.  I know ipads are expensive but after 6 months go by you will have bought enough replacement ones of these to just buy an ipad.
 The battery died. And I tried to recharge it, and nothing happens. Won't charge or turn on.  A little frustrating because this is the 3rd one that has broke on me. And they wont just let you email them about it they want us to call or online chat! Very frustrating!
 This is the 2nd kindle we bought for our son. The first one ran great. This one has ran slow from day one. Programs and apps take a long time to load. We have downloaded very few games on it and it ran slowly before we ever added any games. I am very disappointed.  For all of the money we spend monthly on amazon prime I would love to be contacted and even given a replacement.
 It's was great I got it for my two year old and he loved it so much. Sadly it was stolen not long after getting it and I feel horrible for him. But it's a great device. They have it to where you can fix the time of which the kids can play and monitor what they do. You can fix it to the age range of what you want them to be able to download and you can add their apps as well. This is just a great product all around I loved it for him.
 It's great and the kids have options. The only issue so far I have found is if you have two the kids do not have their own set ups and they each have the same apps and books. Also they have access to eachothers 'accounts' as well.
 Good first tablet for preschooler. However, it broke 13 months after receipt. Still trying to get replacement/repair of item via “no worry warranty”. Caveat emptor... there was no direct way to obtain warranty service! Still attempting now. We’ll see...😳
 I love this tablet. I am a 1st grade teacher and I was introduced to this tablet by one of my students. I immediately purchased one for Easter last year for my than 2 year old daughter. She loves it &amp; works well with it. I just recently purchased another one for my other daughter who is now 2 yrs old. The parental restrictions are the best. My babies are restricted from the horrible content that YouTube contain &amp; I am always aware of what activities they are playing. Great Job Amazon!!!
 Great product for kids. My niece uses the adults phones, and ends up on you tube and all sorts of things. This does not let her. It is a little confusing at first setting it up, realizing that you have to download all the apps,but well worth it.
 I would love to give this tablet 5 stars but the charging port is terrible and keeps becoming loose and then won’t charge. We are on our 3rd tablet and luckily amazon has been so good about replacing them.  I really like the content and my 3yo daughter learns so much from it, wish amazon could fix the charging issue. Hopefully this one I just received doesn’t stop charging after a few months.
 not a fan so far! Already have had to deal with customer service over not having my 1 year unlimited free time, issue was fixed! But not off to a good start, tablets are slow and freeze.
 Kids love them.  I love the parental controls.  The first night my son had it he stayed up way too late playing his games.  The next morning I found the timer control and made sure that his tablet shut down at 8:00, problem solved.
 I fricken love this! This case has saved my daughter's kindle countless times. It is soft, easy to grip and best of PINK! All of my daughter's favorite things.
 I would give this no stars if it were possible. just get a real tablet for an extra 30. I wanted to use them for educational purposes but they arent really made for that. Just a bunch of games.
 Very impressed with the tablet so far.  I bought a pink one for my 6 year old daughter and a blue one for 2.5 year old son.  They knew their way around my iPad so it was a bit of an adjustment, but they've caught on very nicely.  Lot of educational and kid appropriate content.  Only gave four stars because we haven't had them long enough to really make a review.
 Very kid frendly tablet for my 4 year old son.child proof.loves playing games and watching videos.very easy to use.games and some apps have to be downloaded before u can play or watch. the only downside the tablet has to be connected to the internet to be able to play games or watch videos and if u have to do a factory reset u lose all apps downloaded so u have to download eveything all over again.needs sd card for memory.overall good tablet for the price.
 I ordered two of these for my kids. So far, they love them.  The kids find them easy to use and have figured out how to go between watching a film or using an app. I love that the “games” are almost always educational in some manner and fun. So far so good.  The charging port looks very cheap so I’m hoping they last
 The only bad thing that if you do not reside inside the US, the video options in children's mode is useless and says they can not be reproduced because they are outside the US they should improve that globally either free or paid.<br/><br/>Lo único mal que si no resides dentro de  EEUU  la opciones de video en modo niños es inútil  ya dice no se pueden reproducir por estar fuera de EEUU deberían mejorar eso hacerlo global ya sea gratis o de paga.
 I really really the outside case that you put on.  I'm thinking about getting another one for myself!!!  My grandson keeps on dropping mine.  That way it's protected.  I really like that it's so easy to set a timer.  I'm SO happy with this purchase.  I really don't have to worry as much.
 I bought this for my 3yo he is pretty advanced for his age but he had absolutely no problem figuring out how to use it. The foam case is super durable I even told my wife "I just wanna throw this thing to test it out" when I opened it and the best part it has a parents section where you can control exactly what your kid can do with it.
 Love this tablet for my kids. They are 8, 7 and 3. We bought the magnetic charger cord so we don't  have to worry about the charger port breaking, I would highly recommend that! I love that you get a year of free games and two year warranty!
 My daughter really like her tablet, but it won't charge up good after a good 4 months the charging is failing on us. The charger cord is wiggly when you try to plug up. You have to play with it try to prop it up with stuff in order to get a charge. And then sometimes it works and sometimes it don't.  And guess what I have to deal with an upset child that love her tablet but can't play with it cause it's not charging. I have a friend dealing with the same problems.
 My kids have used iPads before. I love how this has a way to control the time they are on it. Each of my kids (9,6, 4) have their own log in and time limits.<br/>I did add extra memory, and it was worth it. The kids love the apps and books.
 I really like everything about it except the fact that the videos aren't accessible outside of the United States so we still have to resort to YouTube
 I wish I loved it.  I wish it was useful.  It's just not intuitive.  I feel like I'm constantly jumping through hoops to get anything accomplished.  I didn't buy it and I wouldn't buy it.
 Bought it for my 4 year old daughter. I like the feel and overall features of the tablet but it is very slow sometimes. It takes forever to start and if you navigate through games and apps it takes a long time to load.
 The speakers went out a day after setup. Don't bother trying to get a replacement you'll just be shuffled between five different customer service reps who keep rehashing the same useless steps
 Purchased two a week ago. One battery drained very quickly. Always dead over night after a full charge. Called to replace but had to deal with unknowledgeable representatives for over an hour. Will now have to wait who knows how long for a replacement while my kids have to share a single one. I guess buy the two bundle deal and one should work. Or get four of you need two.
 I love this tablet! It keeps my three year old entertained, while he's learning.  I love the fact that I don't have to worry what app he's using, since they're all children apps!
 I love this for the girls' reading especially for their grade levels. Its a little slow and hard to navigate but well worth the purchase.
 
 My son used it maybe for a month and had to get it replaced.  I think that kids are tough on the charging ports. We got a replacement in Jan and now its July and the same thing happened. Won't charge anymore. I'm not getting it replaced. They obviously won't last long. It's just a bummer. I also got a kids kindle fore 8 and have had zero issues with it.
 my son is 2 and a half and it's absolutely perfect. every now and then it gets really slow but I just exit the running apps and then it works fine again ! the screen quality is really good I was worried about it not being hd but it's perfect ! I love how I can switch from kids mode back and forth my son loves all the games it comes with and then if he gets bored of it some days I put it in normal mode and let him watch his cars YouTube videos. im very happy with this tablet and I would order one again!
 My preschooler loves this tablet. My favorite feature is being able to manage multiple profiles with age settings.
 the slower tablet i ever owned. i gave one star because i can gave 0 and i can return it because was a christmas present. my little one do not want to use it because is really slow
 I bought 3 of these tablets through hsn and two worked great right away two days after use the 2nd one stopped working it froze and couldnt get it un frozen, the other one wouldnt even let me set it up the keyboard had a mind of its own the 3rd one is still currently working but fear its going to stop so far nothing but issues thankfully hsn customer service is amazing and is sending two news one so we will give it another try
 Loved the price but it broke just after one year of use. Called technical support and was transferred to three different people that all had me doing the same thing. Turn it off, turn it on, hold this button for 15 seconds, now hold this button for 40 seconds......Total waste of an hour of my life!<br/>Finally they told me to send it in and they would repair it.....! I'm like uh No....when I bought it I was told if anything happened to it, it would be replaced.<br/>Finally after sending it in, they sent me a new one!
 Great for the price but battery doesn’t last more then a day even when not in use. It’s pretty slow. Sometimes the apps won’t open and I have to restart only about a month old!<br/>I like that the kids are locked into their area but freetime needs some updating they mostly just use it to watch videos we have purchased
 I wanted to let our kids watch some of the digital movies we have offline. The movies can be downloaded to the tablet, but you cannot view them from the kids profile. I complained to Amazon about that, as I see it as a must feature for kids tablet. What good is watching movies on it if you can only do it from the unlocked adults account. Seems half baked. Amazon did send me some things to try, but really, they did not read my problem, and/or did not try their solution, as it was not addressing the issue.
 This has been great for my three year old grandson. He loves watching tumble leaf, paw patrol and pjmask on this over watching them on tv. Lots of learning games on this device. Nice bright screen to watch even outside.
 I like that it came with the case, it is protected from breaking or screen cracking.... My grandkids have used it well. I wish I could have it connected to my account without all my audiobooks being on the kids also. It's not easy to block my stuff from them.
 This tablet is very slow and not responsive. thought  buying a tablet for our toddler would be helpful however when it’s very slow response time along with parental guides. Have had less than a month and almost have to restart every day due to slow response time and freezing
 I bought this tablet for my 2 year old who constantly wants to watch movies on the go. I figured for the price it was an awesome deal! I am not too impressed with the battery life of the tablet, she uses it for a full movie and her tablet will go down to about 30%. Her brightness is half way and its the only app running.<br/><br/>Overall, I say its a great deal just keep a charger handy.
 No directions on accessing features!  Accent on spending money. Disappointed in quality from Amazon. Bought in October and can't return.
 This was purchased as a birthday present for my 4 yr old grandson. This is his second tablet. He used the first one so much he wore it out! He loves it and plays with it all the time.
 I couldn’t possibly say enough good things about our Kindle Fires. They’ve saved us on many occasions. Our twin boys love them. And one somehow cracked his screen before the warranty was up and amazon sent us a brand spanking new one. Love Amazon!
 This is the sixth kindle I have bought. I buy them for my grandkids. The last one I brought I had to send back because it wouldn’t charge. I have had no problems with the other ones. They are easy for children to work and have several learning apps.
 We just got ours today and it’s unbelievably slow... wondering if somethings wrong with it... but I like the  guarantee that comes with it
 2 year worry free guarantee, was replaced completely after the touch screen stopped working after a spill on the tablet.  No issues getting it warranted, I have no idea why others are claiming it’s such a hassle.  I went through the chat, and 5 mins later I had a prepaid ups label in my email.<br/><br/>Good features for kids, kid content and fun games.
 My two sons love this product. For the same of peace, I bought two, one for each boy. They previously had Samsung tablets, but very quickly adapted to the Kindle.<br/>Because this is a kids tablet, I wish it would have been possible to make them automatically open in the kids app, instead of the general user interface that shows all the apps
 After only a week after purchasing,  the tablet will no longer charge. Now I have a very unhappy toddler and I have to go through the process which will take a couple weeks to get a new one. I have Prime and have to wait a week for a charger that "might or might not" fix my problem or get the device replaced. Very disappointed in Amazon at the moment!!
 I have a 4 year old and 2.5 year old. Both children let me set it up...easy...anyone can follow the directions. Then the kids took over. The 2 year old works it like a pro, rarely asks for help. She knows her letters, numbers, fruits, veggies, and can follow oral diections on the tablet. She can type her name using the keyboard. The tablets are so easy to use. And....chores get finished bf using...so it's a great motivator. I'm a teacher so I know the value of using and not using technology. Highly recommend. While you're at it, save yourself  a future task by purchasing the 32G, 64, or 128 G Ultra storage SD card ..  when you purchase the tablets, you'll need them.
 This surpassed anything I could have ever imagined.  The case is so thick but so very light. We bought one for our three year old and our 5 year old.
 It not what I thought it would be, I didn't realize that you had to purchase prime in order to down load something for my grand daughter to watch in the car. so it is no better than buying anything else, everything works as long as you have wi fi. so I think I spent too much for this. our other one does the same thing, and it didn't cost as much
 I own two of these and it’s a decent product considering the price point. It does have some fatal flaws tho lack of memory and the charging port is complete crap. Don’t like your child plug it in under any circumstances.
 Very disappointed. I purchased this as my sons first tablet. But I can't istall any apps.  You tube,ABCmouse. Nothing that my kid needs or wants can be added. I see there are ways around it to add apps but really any tablet should be available . defiantly not impressed. I would not recommend.
 After using less than a month,tablet will not charge. Tried multiple chargers. Also, after talking to support most of the day, I finally received an email to return the tablet. It’s sad my 5 year old grandson can’t use his Christmas gift.
 Perfect for my toddler
 This was a disappointing experience. After multiple hours on the phone with support they told me the software was corrupted and I would need to return the tablet. It was a gift purchased at a retail location. So instead of allowing me to return it directly I was told to take it back to the retail location. Long story short we returned it for a better working Samsung tablet. Don't waste your time or money.
 I love it! My daughter loves it! She won it as a gift and she plays this tablet more than her other ones she has. I like it because she can read stories on there.
 We've went through a couple tablets with our 4 year old. This one has by far been the best. I can put a password on it and she can only play on the freetime app and I don't have to worry about her watching anything bad or buying anything. She loves it, too.
 It took me a while to get on board with my young child having a tablet, but with tight restrictions, I finally agreed. It's a cute little device, I love the 1 year trial of FreeTime, my daughter is LOVING it. As a parent trying to keep my child away from all of these new electronics, I believe this is a good device for your child to have, in moderation.
 I bought this as a bundle package, one yellow and one blue, for my boys for Christmas. They love them. We had to turn off the kids portion of them due to the lack of apps we could download for them. The 4 star rating is due to the battery life, the battery seems to die rather quick. We have them charged to 100%, and a couple hours later, with them not being used, they both can drop 20% of the battery.
 I like the fire! It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I thought that the kids profile would make it a little easier for my child to use. My daughter is only two so that my have something to do with it! Great product for the price!
 Wonderful! We love the options to control how long the children can play on the device. You can also set goals for education and books! The battery lasts a long while, and they seem to be very durable. We love them, as well as our children.
 Hardware is fine. But these are just a Trojan horse for Amazon sales vehicle. Need a credit card just to get into the device - huh?<br/><br/>The tablet is so horribly locked down that it's impossible for the child to do anything truly useful other than play pointless games (though there are a few good educational resources). My daughter can't event access valuable websites such as ixl, raz-kids and xtrammath (all sites that her school recommends for extra practice for foundational learning).<br/><br/>But it gets worse...<br/><br/>Why is Amazon downloading videos onto the device without my daughter or I requesting them? I'm guessing there is a setting to turn this off but unless we ask for it we don't want the content installed. It's our device and Amazon should not be "controlling" it in this way.<br/><br/>Some apps that my daughter really liked on her old tablet are not available.<br/><br/>Parental controls not as granular as the app I'd bought on her old tablet. Spend a little more on a real Android tablet and download one of the many excellent parental control apps.
 This is not made for kids some apps take so long to load the kids mode is so slow you can't download YouTube so yea I'm my opinion I will not buy this for a kid I will not buy this for nobody is my opinion.
 I bought three for my three grandchildren. All different ages and with different likes, so I could personalize each one. Sometimes they don't even know they are learning .My  grandkids are 3, 6, and 7 and they can all operate them by themselves.
 I got my three year old on this for Christmas because he likes to listen to audiobooks. The product shipped quickly, was everything described, and is just very convenient. I will probably get some kind of extra screen protector for the front, but that's because I like to be cautious. Great product! Thank you!
 I like how the tablets work but I have had to bring 4 out of the 6 that I got back because the charger ports stopped charging the tables
 My sons love it! I also like the parental controls, so I can monitor and limit their usage. One feature I really enjoy is that I can add things from my video library to their devices.
 Sloooooowwww! It took maybe a month to be slow and the free time is terrible! I wish I would have just bought an I pad and put parental controls on it
 great purchase because it was inexpensive, the kids thought it was awesome, and when they break the warranty is pretty good. They will break...
 great tablet for my 3 year old, comes pre loaded with all sorts of games and shows for her age group! Fast running and so far I'm super happy with it! Great buy!
 May daughter is 4. I bought her this for Christmas and it has been a big hit! She loves watching YouTube videos on my phone so I figured this would help. It was better! She loves all the games and videos in her kid profile! I was shocked the Little amount  she wanted you watch YouTube anymore. Great learning tool and confident she can’t click on something inappropriate
 I give 3 stars cause I can't download YouTube kids or alot of Android apps. Also it so very slow loading anything! Second type of kid tablet I have bought. My kids will just get a Samsung or just Android based. To many great apps and educational ones that I can't download on here. And again sooooo slow!!!
 This thing is fantastic. It is perfect for my daughter. It has all her favorites. And there are games that she can play and actually have fun playing. I love the free subscription to freestyle. My daughter is one. And I feel safe with just handing it to her because there is no way for her to buy anything or see something not appropriate for her age. Long battery life, kid proof and super nice overall.
 Bought 2 tablets. 1 stopped 3 days after kids opened it. After Online Tech Support with supervisors and phone tech support with multiple supervisors. I had to return it and buy it again at a much higher price... the tech support was kind enough to credit my account the difference. Do not believe the 2 year warranty.
 Definitely as pictured. Would recommend for toddler and up. The case is foamy and bouncy. It also encases the screen so the screen won't hit the floor first.
 Took my son an entire year to crack the screen- it had survived tantrums and being stomped on, I read there was an issue with the charging port getting loose over time- which explains why recently I would leave it charging for hours, only to find that it wasn't making contact and didn't charge- this was the catalyst to the screen breaking from frustration.
 This tablet is perfect for my 5 year old. The videos look HD even though they are not. There are so many movies and series that we get free with Amazon Prime, so I download everything I can so she can view it without internet connection. I added an SD card to expand storage. You get a year free of Free Time, which includes a gazillion games and videos. Once the free year is up, there is a discount for Prime members.
 I like that this is a kid-friendly tablet. All of the apps that are suggested are wonderful. I also love how the case comes with the tablet. However, I would have liked for the games and books to already have been installed instead of me taking up more space on the tablet to do so. Also, if I want to install various apps, I need an SD card to put more space on there for me to do that. There needs to be more space for the kids to play the variety of games that they like to play.
 Light weight! I have the 2nd generation myself and this one is tons lighter than mine! Perfect for kids! I love the option for Parents to have their own profile.
 It seems to be a little more complicated for my 3 year old grandson compared to the leap pad. being he has to go find his icon to get on his games. To go back to the home screen is difficult for a kid to figure out.
 Hard to manage. Even with parental controls set if you have YouTube kids add pop up, one day it was for porn and my toddler cane out because his show wasn’t working and freaked out! I have all sorts of age settings and controls set and still had this happen! Yuck!!!
 We received two of these tablets. The blue one has been fine. My youngest son cracked his the second week. I thought it was child proof. The kids aren’t hard on their tablets either. My youngest accidentally dropped it on the floor and it cracked from the inside .
 The Fire 7 Kids Edition is OK for my boy, but what worry the most is my personal experience with one of the advertisements for this device "2-year worry-free guarantee: if they break it, return it and we'll replace it for free. No questions asked." This is false since customer service DO ask questions about what happened to the Fire 7 Kids Edition and ...the process to return the equipment is a pain!!
 Received this as a gift for my youngest child. Older child has an 8. Now that we have a 7 and an 8, I can definitely see improvements they made in the 8-bigger screeen, better speaker, and faster.<br/>That said the 7 seems like a good value and has survived being dropped twice already thanks to the protective case.<br/>In summary, good for a young child to watch videos and read books.
 I love it and my 2yr soon to be 3 loves it and uses it for his amazon movies and also learning games best part it has parent control love it
 I love the tablet but I would like for it to not have all my apps and just have setup for my grand daughter. I don’t like that I need to put a pin on it to which she can’t start it up herself.
 After kid broke two IPads, I went and brought Kids Fire. I’m absolutely pleased with the product and it is more then I expected. Very easy for kid to use and at the same time fast switch for parent controls. Also time limit set up is fantastic and can be done through the tablet or online.
 While this tablet worked great for the first few weeks, we experienced the issue of a loose charging port. We are unable to charge the device and my child can no longer use it less than a year from the date we purchased. I would not purchase this device again or recommend it anyone!
 Can't download YouTube kids which is my kids top pick so they are still trying to use my phone/tablet.You will definitely need to buy a memory card because it barely holds anything with all the pre-installed apps etc. Don't know what the kids "apps" are until you download them so it's like trial and error. Not a big deal though because they download fast and can be easily deleted. I really like that I can switch to my own account and use it without kid content.
 Grandson played with it everyday for about 6 months before it stopped charging. Great return policy though.
 Perfect for small hands. Easy to use. Lots<br/>Of titles of books and games to choose from.  Soft case really helps.<br/><br/>Get the replacement policy. It’s worth it.
 My only issue with this product is that there is no way to disable the touch screen when watching videos. Doesn't seem like a big issue until your kid keeps exiting the video you put on for them to watch. There should be a simple update that enables this feature.
 My son is two and a half and he just loves this tablet.  He has only been using it for about two weeks now and I already see improvement in his learning.  The games and books are just right for him and he enjoys being a "big boy" and playing games and reading books all by himself.  This is a great product and FreeTime is just awesome!
 A Christmas gift for my granddaughter - mainly to encourage reading.  After booting it up, she was quiet for a half an hour and announced she'd read 4 books! (she's 8)  Her mom is using the games/videos on available when my granddaughter exhibits good behavior.  Great buy!
 Gave this as a Christmas gift to our 6-year old granddaughter.  She was delighted, and after a short period of battery charging she began intuitively using it with ease.  A greatly appreciated treasure... even used on a limited basis by her 1-year old sister.
 The tablet is good but it comes with a one year free free time where it over 13000 apps games etc so we thought that like abc mouse Disney jr was free right not the case they still want you to pay for it when you click on it. So I'll have to call amazon about it to get a better understanding of it otherwise we like it. Just wish that part is a little better to understand because we were like great we don't have to pay for these. Thank you
 Absolutely love it and all the preloaded content perfect for my 3 yr old and the foam case is way better then any other kid proof case ive ever had its a very thick foam super light weight and better then the rubberized cases you can buy very happy with my purchase. Also come with a 2 year no matter what happens warranty which im very pleased with.
 I am so disappointed in Amazon with this device. We have only had our kindle on since Christmas. It broke and I called to have it replaced. The warrant states "replace with  no questions asked". I sat on the phone for 30 minutes with two kiddos under 3 trying to trouble shoot the thing even though I told her that I already did, only to be switched to another person and then convienetly disconnected and called back when i am not available naturally! This kindle and the customer service is a joke.
 I love the parental control feature on this table. I have purchased other tablets for my son in the past and nothing compares to this. The controls allow you to set a timer for reading and if the time is not met then the user is unable to access other apps like Youtube and Netflix. Also the fact that you can select the age of the user its a great option since the content is age appropriate. The missing star is for the lack of internal memory as now we have to purchase an external SD card for additional memory.
 I've bought one for each of my grandsons and these are amazing.  Great learning games and videos.  Durable, my 2 1/2 y/o grandson got his over a year ago and it still holds a long charge, never broken the screen!
 Seems rugged. Good warranty. Great-grand-kids 6 &amp; 9 were less impressed than I was at 1st glance. Quite a bit of thoughtful setup required. I have several other Kindles all the way from keyboard to Voyage.
 I ordered this for my 2 yr old granddaughter,  she absolutely loves it.  I LOVE that you set the age group of apps, books , videos. And I don't have to worry about her getting into or clicking on anything she shouldn't! I recommend every child have one !!!
 Can not download applications and videos outside of the Amazon app. This limits its functionality. In addition, the battery needs to be charged almost every time we need to use it (the kids are not using it on a day to day base).
 Excited for a kids tablet with more choices but sadly disappointed in the selection of truly educational apps. Also there is no way of locking into educational apps and not junk when setting time limits, would be nice to have more choices than videos, books and apps to set time limits for.<br/>16GB fills up much quicker than anticipated.
 The customer service from Amazon is the best! My niece accidentally dropped her kindle on the front. Even though it was well after a year. Customer service replaced the kindle. I can't thank you enough for saving the day!!
 Does what its supposed to do. My 4 year old loves it. Only thing is I wish there were more apps to get. I would love to see Youtube Kids on this and it would be almost perfect then. All around good little tablet though.
 Bought this tablet at the end of march 2018. It got delivered just in time for my sons bday. It stopped working at the end of may 2018 right when we were in the middle of moving. Finally found it and went to look for information on how to request for assistance on how to get it fixed and there is NO INFO on the app. Insane that the thing broke before it was even paid off (I did the payment plan option) the thing wasnt even 3 months old.
 Randomly freezes or shuts off.
 Ok, when you are buying this tablet for a child, you are kind of buying two aspects of it. The physical tablet, and the Freetime Unlimited access.<br/><br/>The physical tablet:<br/>5 stars<br/>This is an entry level tablet, very inexpensive as far as tablets go and a good value for the price. It runs a bit slow, but it's what I expected and is perfectly appropriate for a young child. I bought it for a 3 year old who is thrilled to get it and wants to spend every waking moment on it and has already cried when I said it was time to put it away. So, that's fun. The case is soft and squishy and it feels like it protects the tablet well. My particular 3 year old is generally well behaved and treats the tablet very well, but I feel like she could get away with being much rougher with it and it could handle it.<br/><br/>The FreeTime app:<br/>1 star.<br/>When I ordered the tablet, I figured I would probably keep subscribing to this service after my free year expired. I no longer think that. The biggest complaint I have is that it's not easy enough to block content. There should be a way to block ALL content except what you choose to unblock. Instead, I'm going through having to block everything manually, and let me tell you, it's a LOT to block. Why block so much? Because 99 percent of the content is pure crap. If you have any standards whatsoever, you're not going to like most of what's available for free on the app. I just looked through the video section. Nothing that I wanted my kid to watch. There are good kid movies and shows out there, but none of them are on the app. And I have it limited to 2-4 year olds, but Star Trek is on there?? There are amazing children's literature out there, but we have a bunch of Dora and Barney books. Seriously?? And not all educational apps are created equal. Some are very lame, or confusing, or actually give your child the wrong information. I'm of the opinion that children are smart people whose time is valuable and they deserve quality entertainment and educational materials. And I don't think FreeTime has enough quality materials on there to be worth $3 a month. Heck, I'm not sure it's worth the nothing that I've paid so far with how annoying it is to deal with. And I don't want a 3 year old to have to dig through thousands and thousands of apps, books, videos, to get to it. WHY is there not a way to block everything except what parents unblock? This is a no brainer.<br/><br/>So why talk about FreeTime when it's just one app on this tablet? Because you are buying this for a child right? (Or because you like a squishy bright yellow case, not judging.) You are wanting to hand the tablet to the child and drink your coffee in peace for ten minutes without having to look over the child's shoulder to make sure they aren't purchasing 400 digital lives in their favorite app. So your options are FreeTime Unlimited, with all it's limitations, or the built in parental controls which are a bit lacking. Not enough options, not enough control. But that's what I'm going to end up having to do I think till FreeTime becomes less of a nightmare. You can set up a child profile (it has to be a "teen" one, apparently) and block the FreeTime app, and then you can ADD the content that you pay for. It's unclear and confusing and inadequate, but it's better that tapping on 8000 Calliou books/apps/videos.<br/><br/>UPDATE 10/8/17<br/>Knocking this from three to one star. My ability to block content from the Freetime app has gone away. A couple hours with tech support hasn't resolved this issue. I wish I could return this thing at this point. I've spent entirely too many hours trying to get it to work and being baffled that basic functionality either isn't available or isn't working. This is too frustrating to be worth it.
 Got this for my 2 year old. She loves it. I have seen her throw it, and no issues.  She can easily navigate the apps. Its a solid buy.
 Bought for my son for Christmas and he loves it. The games are fun and just right for his age. And his behavior has improved at school since he can't have kindle time if he hasn't been good. Love it.
 LOVE that is tablet! My 3 yr old is always taking my tablet. I bought this one for Christmas and it is great! ALL kid appropriate apps, movies, books, etc. Engaging and no way for him to get into any junk or inappropriate stuff. Or buy any thing. Also I love the timer, allowing him only certain amount of time on it:)
 La tableta de mi hija no le quiere prender. La carga pero no quiere cargar. He probado con el cargador de mi otra hija que tiene la misma tableta y no carga. No le prende.  En noviembre de cumple un año de mi pedido y se que puedo cambiarla porque está en garantía. ¿ Cuál es el proceso?
 after one  year it will not charge.  This is the second one I have purchased.  The first one has trouble charging but does eventually charge.  I will contact Amazon as the product is supposed to have a two year warranty - NO QUESTIONS ASKED!
 Its not all that.  Lightweight, sound quality is horrible,  for a toddler to use the screen its very difficult,  even for an adult how to swipe it back and forth.  Dont waste your money.  Just buy an Ipad, quality of apps suck.  Wish I can return this thing.  Its morel like a tablet that needs to be sold in a 99cent store only store.  :( :( :( :(
 I bought the Tablet for my grandchildren for Christmas. I am not the most “computer savvy” person around, and have great difficulty maneuvering apps from one profile to the next. I feel there should have been more clear and concise directions on how to set it up. I’m sure I will eventually figure it out but I shouldn’t have to do that!!!<br/><br/>I changed my rating to 4 stars because I received a quick response from customer service that helped me tremendously! 🙂
 Works great so far! My friends have these for her kids as well, they have held up for a year and a half for her kids. I just got mine and everything was very easy to set up and works great!
 Bought this for our 18 mo granddaughter and all I can say is WOW, She loves it and now her mom has her phone back. It has proven to be indestructible and with the two year no fault guarantee you cant go wrong.
 My kids really enjoyed their Google apps and it's really hard to find the ones they had on their other tablets on the kindle.
 This was a good investment for such a long trip. You do need to download games, learning lessons first while online. But made it easy to play the games while driving.
 My child who is 11 yrs. old and has downsyndrome.<br/>This one is her 3rd tablet the first one she got it 8yrs ago and it lasted till now, the inlet to connect the charger got damaged by forcefully trying to plug it in.  That was a pretty good educational toy that she used every day, she has learned so much through this tablet. We decided to get the 3rd one. She also owns the blue larger tablet. There are so many apps to choose from.
 These Kindle Fire Kids Edition are excellent. I previously purchased (2) DragonTouch Tablets and they both stopped working about the 2nd or 3rd attempt to turn them on. DragtonTouch proudcts are absolute garbage. In fact, it would be an insult to garbage to call them that.<br/><br/>Kindle Fire's are great. I have 4.
 Great battery life!, easy to charge.  Easy to remove and replace in the case when the screen needs a good wipe-down from fingerprints.
 The tablet works great for about 3 months and then it wont take charge anymore or only charges 20 percent in 24 hours. I've had to exchange mine 3 times now and my current one wont even turn on.
 I love how lightweight the tablet with the protective case is! It’s perfect for my daughter who just turned 5. I have so much control over the apps she uses and how long she can use then for on freetime. Plus, when she isn’t using it, it’s great for the rest of the family!
 When I purchased this tablet, the warranty disclosures stated: "We will replace the tablet within the two years warranty, no questions asked". I called customer service for a replacement. I was asked a tone of questions, I had to troubleshoot the device, to make it worse I had to send the tablet to them for possible repairs which might take up to five days. Terrible experience.
 Kids love the tablet.  I like being able to set curfews and amount of game time.  My only complaint is in the FreeTime app, it lets kids download everything, which means they download everything.  It also means I had to go back in and remove some apps they were not using because of space.
 Love the cover. It works very well. My 18 month even tried chewing on it and nothing happened. Tablet so far is working as it should. I do wish there was a child lock for the tablet on Netflix and other apps not just the Free Time app which is great
 I have purchased 2 of these tablets for my kids, ages 4&amp;5, for Easter and within a few months one of theirs and mine needed replaced because they quit charging. Now, my 4 year old's quit charging. The first two that were replaced had the same issue within a few months. So, with that being said, i've had 5 of the same tablets in this house and in less than a year they have all quit charging. Absolute garbage. I will never purchase another tablet from Amazon again.
 Battery life is awful. Takes 5 times as long to charge as the battery lasts. My little one gets an hour out play time and 8 hours waiting to fully charge.
 I love it. This is a great tablet for my toddler. I can control exactly what she can do and see, and put all her favorite videos games and movies on one device. She takes it all around the house with her and the kid proof case is a lifesaver! I love the content that come with the kids freetime membership, and she does too! Also, its not a bad tablet in adultmode either! The only thing I really dont like is that it freezes up occasionally. But luckily if that gets any worse it came with a 2 year warranty!
 We've been using the Kids Kindle since it came out and are becoming more and more disappointed as time goes on. It's ok for the price. When it's time to purchase a new tablet for my 8 year old, I'll probably fork up the cash for another Samsung though.
 This product was awesome when we could use it, loved the parental control features which was the selling point for us. It never held a charge, but because we didn’t allow our daughter to use it very often we didn’t worry about it. At 4 months old it finally stopped working, wouldn’t charge or turn on. Soo, it was nice for a minute. But never ever would have purchased if we had known it was only going to last for 4 months. Maybe we just had a faulty one but disappointed with the purchase.
 This is the best money I’ve ever spent! My LO loves watching his shows on long car rides. It is a miracle device for a kid who hates his car seat. It buys us more tearless miles!
 I’m so happy I bought this for my son! He’s not super interested in tv or screens in general but he likes playing with his tablet for short periods at a time and it’s so adorable watching his little finger pop balloons and play the piano. Also, when he bursts with energy and chucks it across the room this case comes in handy. It literally bounces!
 Love these tablets!  This is the 3rd one I bought.  Now my daughter, god daughter, and grand daughter all have them!!!  They are ages 5,4,&amp; 3!  They play tons of learning games and watch Netflix.  The freetime unlimited is great as well!  Amazon rocks!
 I love this tablet I ordered one for my 8 yr old Grandaughter for her birthday and ordered 4 more for my other grandkids ages 1, 2,3,7 I loved the apps and games it came with and the parental control it has and time limits on it.
 Got this gift for my 18 month old daughter. It is a bit difficult for me to understand how to use it it moves quite slow I can only put about 20 apps on it anything over that it tends to freeze up.
 These products are worthless. I have purchased 4 of them. The second two were by accident not realizing they were the same ones I had i bought. They do not charge well, battery life is minimal. Very disappointed in this product.
 This product exploded then caught on fire, burned the carpet.<br/><br/>My 4yr old nephew could have been seriously hurt.<br/><br/>I do not recommend this product for anyone at all.
 I absolutely love it! My kid has dropped it several times (literally like once a day) and it has not broken yet. The parental controls and privacy options allow me to comfortably let him watch his fire all on his own without having to check it every second.
 Charging port keeps giving out causing needed repairs so can’t give it 5 stars however the warranty allows me to give it 4
 It’s really cool. Nice case to absorb impacts. Wish it had a stand built in and a strap connector. Packed full of kid stuff. Good deal for the money. Lets see how long it lasts. 6/18
 Love how lightweight and protected it is in the provided case. It did not come with a user manual or any helpful advice for someone who knows nothing about electronics. Any questions, have to look them up online. Bought it for our almost 2yr old and she loves it!
 So far so good.  A little advanced for my 20 month old, but he still likes it.  Biggest complaint is battery life.  It must not go to sleep well on its own because unless it just came off the charger it always seems to be dead.
 I needed something to keep my 2 year old busy. This did the trick. Also like that you can set different profiles. He never puts it down.
 My toddler absolutely loves this.  This is absolutely a great fun way to learn, watch movies and play games and is kid friendly.  Highly recommend.
 I can't seem to get them to last for longer than a year. Thus, I keep having to replace it. It may he a good idea to get a warranty.
 This did not come with a charger. So I would  suggest purchasing one if you plan on ordering this item. Got it for my 2 year old grandson for him to learn on. Over all the value is good for the item.
 Love these tablets. At a great price point and warranty I don't have to worry about my kids on them. They are easy to set up and use. Which is great since I'm not a electronic person. I was worried about the cases being to babyish for my 9 and 8 yr old. The case has a nice texture and grips nicely. They are not as bulky as I initially thought. Over all love them!
 my daugter can use apple and youtube better then this junk, it locks up constantly, the freetime pay service is junk and you have no real control over what apps they use.
 The OS is slow, the touch screen is obviously not built for kids without excellent coordination and most of the apps crash.<br/><br/>The case is about the best thing this has going for it. Will probably just use it for videos as the games crash every time we open them. It’s just not built for kids under 10 despite all the apps.<br/><br/>I would change the user interface to be easily navigated by kids.
 Love how controlling you can be with this tablet. Cant wait for the kids to try it out on Christmas!
 Well worth the extra expense as my 3 year old grandson is hard on electronics and has destroyed 2 Fire's, he has tried with this one with no luck!
 Kids love their tablets (bought 2). Very durable! Lots of apps and shows to choose from including YouTube. Downside you have to constantly charge it. One you have to wiggle to wire to get it to accept the charge after less than a month! Apps take forever to download. Glitches when storage is full.
 My children love the books and apps that are on the fire.  I like that I don't have to worry that they will get to websites that are not appropriate for their age.  It is very durable with the case that comes on it and is easy for the kids to hold it.
 I’m glad I got this for my son, he’s 4 almost 5 and he loves playing the games, reading the books and watching the shows that are provided on it. With that being said it isn’t high quality by any means and it takes forever to charge. But for the price, so far, it’s definitely worth it.
 My grandsons love them!  An autistic nephew is more tolerable on car rides while using his.  3 nieces had the regular version &amp; each was able to enjoy it in her own way.  The hyperactive one was better able to tolerate car rides while streaming her music on hers.
 Well worth the money as my four year old son opened his big Christmas gift (tablet) and within a matter of minutes dropped it on our  hardwood floors without incident.<br/>We have been pleased with the durability of our other case and anticipate this one will last a long time too.
 Wouldn’t stay connected to WiFi.  Hours of support calls revealed that this version will joy stay connected to some of the newer WiFi networks.
 The case is very sturdy. My two and four year olds are in love with the different apps and episodes! I even allowed Netflix for my eldest. Parental controls are very easy to use.
 Battery life is crap. I’ve had to send it in for a warranty replacement about 5 times due to the same internal issues: freezing, won’t charge, won’t turn on. All have had the same issues. It’ll work fine for a few months then you’ll have to send it in for a replacement.  Save your money for a better product.
 Very happy with the Fire 7. I purchased a Contixco for my daughter and she dropped it and cracked the screen on the second day that she had it. There was no warrantee to replace it and I had a difficult time trying to find a place to repair the screen. I purchased the Fire 7 on Amazon and a screen protector and so far everything is great. I love the warrantee on this product and all of the extra special things that come with it.
 Purchased new for Christmas and after first charge the battery didn't even last 16hr when NOT in use. The apps are good and the case is good, but the battery life is a serious issue that Amazon needs to address.
 My kids love this tablet. Set up is pretty easy. I did have issues with getting it off kids mode to be able to download any game I wanted. I called customer service and was HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED in the service I received. I ended up figuring out my own problem.
 The 2 year worry free is a joke. my daughter shattered her screen after a good 5 months. when we received a "new" one it was REFURBISHED. Now 3 months later the charger port is not working and they will either send a new one, or fix that one. Mind you it will NEVER BE NEW just another one another child broke getting swap out for yours. Its a shame its miss leading. I would have never spent more to have to keep sending them back.
 I like all the different things you can do with it I dislike  that it doesn’t come with any instructions and you have to figure out how to do the various things.
 I sent the tablet back for repair and they sent it back, and it is still broken.  I would prefer to have it replaced if they cannot repair it correctly.
 Bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday. She is now 3 and it's still working!. She did jump on it and broke the screen so Amazon sent us a return label so they can fix it.
 Charging port doesn't stand up to normal use, much less kids use.  Bought a 2nd one and the battery won't stay charged, discharges extremely fast.<br/><br/>I can't return it without speaking with someone? Weird.
 Love the new interface.  Much improvements over the first Fire interface. The kid modes are great as well.
 This tablet is horrible.  I don’t know if we got a defective one.  But we had gotten it as a gift for our son.  If freezes two seconds into every game, it’s to late to return it.  Unless this is just a faulty one, I do not recommend it.
 Great, but I don't like that I can't download apps such as youtube. The preloaded stuff from Amazon is good, but it would be better if there was an app store.
 This Tablet is amazing! Thank you Amazon, bought this for my 3 yr old and he throws this thing all the time. I never get nervous wondering if he broke it this time, really solid and the protection absorbs every bounce.
 My kids love them. I bought one pink and one blue. Battery life is good, they seem indestructible, I recommend you buy them for your kids. Do not buy a no name brand. We tried that... total waste of money.
 Mine stopped working after the first month it went black and never turned back on. My son was never rough with it at all.<br/>Unfortunately I never got it replaced being so busy it slipped my mind
 This did not meet my expectations because everything is monopolized for amazon. The kids section cannot even get YouTube even if I allow it. However, the case is excellent.
 When it works it's great, but it only works 50% of the time and we have only had it 5 days!  I have had to redownload apps, the battery is not lasting long,  and there is a lag.  Sometimes it will show apps are downloaded with the check mark but the app icon won't even appear, just a blank box with a little check.  You don't even know what app your pulling up.
 I bought this for my grandson who already broke it. well the cord connection. Amazon was awesome and replaced it no questions asked. worth the money and would recommend!
 Product did not even last 3 months!!!! Could not return even though I bought it in November and it stopped working in the beginning of February!! Don’t buy this!!!
 Cool concept and idea but in reality this tablet sucks for kids I have a 4 year old and I have a 3 year old but without my help there on able to operate the tablet because there is no way to store the apps and games that are available through free time to the tablet itself so the children cannot click through their favorite games an adult has to manually scroll through and search for the games there should be a way where you can pain a recently played or favorite app to the home screen but you can't
 Awesome product! Great price! Perfect learning environment for kids 4-10 for sure. You can even add games many that are free. My grand kids just love them. Protective case is thick and great color choices. Wish all my kindergartner students could get them for our classroom.
 Bought it for my great great granddaughter. She loves it. Not 1 years old yet but loves to watch the animations on it. Her mother locks in her favorite Cartier and she watches it and laughs at it. Very smart.
 My son really enjoys the interactive games.  Even at age 2 my son is able to play some of the games on this device.  He enjoys the Daniel Tiger- Mr Roger's Neighborhood games, cooking games, hair cutting games and more.  It is amazing to see how good he is at navigating the screens.  Downside a few of the games are really boring even for a 2 year old.
 Let me just say, I am incredibly impressed with Amazon. The warrenty and customer service have exceeded my expectations. My daughter dropped her tablet down the stairs and broke the screen, and Amazon sent us a brand new one within a couple of days. This tablet has loads of educational, fun games and my daughter especially likes the camera.  I will be purchasing another one for my son in the future.
 Bought for my granddaughter, it is very well protected with the case. Since she is 3 she drops it often and no damage. She loves all the kids apps on Amazon and is constantly bugging me to add more !!
 Great tablet for kids , takes a little tech savvy to add Netflix and other things to it but not that hard all in all great for kids
 my kids love this tablet. Knocked one star off cause it does have issues with charger port or system issues where tablet needed replaced. Weve replaced our tablet 4x. No problems. No questions asked. Took 20-30 min on thenphone and bam! Replaced !
 This is a great tablet for my kiddo. A little on the slow side. Maybe it’s just mine? She tosses this thing like crazy and it’s very well protected.
 My 3 year old LOVES the tablet. Aweome parental control feature. Great games/apps to choose from which is from the 1 year Amazon Free Time Unlimited Subscription. The only issues with the tablet is the fact that by the subscription that is included and you can download many games/apps/videos, you will have you buy a memory card. The other issue is battery life: not too long of a battery life. Other than that, the tablet is worth the purchase. 👍
 I absolutely love the new Fire 7. I can visibly see the changes. It's lighter and smaller. So much easier to carry around. My daughter loves it. Thanks Amazon! You rock!
 It's convenient and I love the parental controls. It also comes with a ton of apps, movies, and books. You definitely get what you pay for because the tablet is extremely slow, cheap feeling, and cheap looking. It's worth the buy only if this is their first tablet (my case) or you think they'll break a more expensive one.
 Within a year of purchase, it will no longer charge. This product is supposed to have a two year gaurantee. After multiple attempts to contact customer service, I am unable to return it and do not have an answer as to why they will no honor the 2 year warantee. All of the reference pages pertaining to 2 year warantee do not give instruction for returns.
 My 4 year old son receieved this tablet for christmas and we all love it. Its very kid friendly and easy to use. I like that he has to have me put in a password before he can just go browsing stuff and that it has a parent account. It has been very peaceful in my house since we purchased this item 👍 The biggest thing I love is that it has a 2 year warranty no matter what your kid does to it.
 We bought our boys these tablets for their birthdays, our oldest had a birthday in January and we had to send his back the beginning of March for charging probkems, then our second son got one for his birthday March 8th and we sent his back for charging issues on March 28th. Both were charging issues. They did replace them with no problems and we loved when they worked good. But we are hoping we do t have this issue again. Other than that we love them.
 I wouldve gave it 5 stars had my son not turned on the accessibility feature by accident and it was literally impossible to turn off. I dont see how it makes things easier for anyone when you cant even scroll and I was livid I had to delete his entire profile and create a new one because it just was no longer functional so all his downloads are gone. They need to make it possible for parents to turn this feature off through their profile for kids in case of situations like this.
 This tablet is awesome and the apps have actually inspired my 2 year old to go potty on her own and learn new words! I will purchase another one for my unborn baby to use when he turns a year old.
 Horrible. It takes FOREVER to start up and shut down, the apps are incredibly buggy, and the whole process of downloading apps and managing content is clear as mud. Maybe I shouldn't have cheaped out and should have bought the 8, but after this experience, I won't be buying any more Kindles. Unless you really enjoy having a frustrated, upset child, buy some other tablet instead.
 We bought this for our toddler daughter and it has been nothing but wonderful! with the FreeTime she doesn't see or hear anything we don't want her to and even YouTube is wonderful for her. She is learning her favorite songs in different languages and is now starting to do the puzzles and such
 You cant pin the screen. So if the kid touches the edges the menu comes up and there off into settings. This is a feature on the android os, but appears to be nowhere on this tablet.
 Great size and works for learning and entertainment for young children. Gift enjoyed by granddaughter. Great for Airplane, or car use.
 Item worked fine for almost a year then would not charge.with the 2 year hassle free warranty I thought it would be simple to return and get a new one as advertised WRONG.After 2 hours on line trying to get in touch with customer service I gave up.Unit works fine just don't count on any help.
 Tablet is awesome for kids or toddlers. My son loves to throw tablets so this tablet coming with a case was great, it is thick enough to not need a glass protector. Hold charge very well. Definitely would recommend!!!
 Decent tablet, however the battery life, even when not in use, absolutely sucks! It dies so quickly that by the time I need it it's dead and I have to recharge it again...
 Hate hate hate this tablet! I bought two and have had to return them both more than twice! Same issues. The charging port stops charging. And now my warranty is expired and one stopped working yet again. Do not buy this tablet it’s not worth it
 Bought a 2 pack for my sons for Christmas.  They are so slow that they get easily frustrated for the 2 minutes it takes to open any application.  And forget downloading any new apps, takes 5 minutes or more to download (200 mbps internet connection).  They are severely underpowered and very slow.  I WOULDNT RECCOMEND!!!
 So we love this tablet - I have control over everything my kid does etc. BUT - suddenly it's not charging, or turning on and I CAN NOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME  figure out how to exchange it so if that process could be a little easier that would be GREEEAAATTT.
 Bought as a gift. Absolutely loved it and uses it often. Educational games keep her entertained and learning. Especially helpful when out in restaurants and toddlers get bored easily.
 So I bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas. I wanted to set it all up beforehand so I took it out. This is getting two stars ONLY because I can also use this, it is not JUST a kids tablet. For the actual thing itself for free time and child use, this product is AWFUL. Half the games and books don't open. Most don't come with the tablet downloaded and if you want to download it, one book takes hours to download. The downloaded books don't open. It's very glitchy. Games are NOT targeting the child's age group, which was In the description, which is very frustrating. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this. I would much rather purchase another tablet for my son and Download the games and movies I want to download. This isn't worth the money in my opinion. I love Amazon but this isn't a product I can speak highly about.
 Nothing but problems with the tablets I bought. Doesn’t hold a charge and one of them won’t stay charged for more the 2 hours. It dies without even using it. I’ve called CS several times and they refuse to acknowledge it and tell me it’s nornal. It is also very slow
 Battery dies quickly and it takes a while to boot up.  The apps aren't as good as the Google Play Store.  Haven't found games to keep my 3yr old entertained and the Netflix app doesn't have as many movies to download as the Google Netflix app.  I found my old phone is actually better for my 3yr old.  Maybe it is geared for older kids.
 My 3 year old loves this!  Just make sure you put a password so your child can’t buy anything.  We didn’t realize he had bought almost 30 games but when we called amazon they made it right and put a lock on it to where he can’t buy anything anymore!  We love Amazon!
 This device is a life saver!!! My family and I just went on a road trip with our toddler. It would have been a very long trip if we didn't have the kids Kindle. I strongly recommend families to get this. Plus I love that I get to set the limits of usage for my kid.
 My 3yr old daughter loves this tablet. Very easy to use and full of games, books and videos to keep her busy. Love free time but i think it should be included with your prime membership if u pay monthly. Something to be considered...
 I bought three of these for my great-grandsons.  We were thrilled at first because the order seemed to include unlimited apps for the kids to use on their tablets.  But the tablets are less than a year old and they will not hold a charge any more.  It is such a disappointment for the little guys, and I really don't want to buy three more if they're not going to last.
 I like this overall, but wish there was a faster way to delete apps I don't want or need for my kids. 15,000 choices seems appealing but it slows down the tablet so terribly. I spent over an hour one day trying to block unnecessary items, but I gave up.<br/><br/>Also, in Spanish, Amazon doesn't recognize items that are educational, so I've needed to remove the educational goals so my kids can access the Spanish apps we want them to use.
 It's a great tablet, but it does NOT hold a charge. I have to charge it every night for her to use it the next day. She is almost 3 years old. She is only allowed 30 minutes "screen time" a day.
 This tablet is an excellent value. They’re durable and the parental controls are so easy to set up and use. We love it!
 It has great battery life. Proctection case is fantastic. Amazon prime videos and music at your fingertips.  Great for a little distraction for our kids on a long car ride.  Great price!
 Love this product. It's the perfect baby step to technology for my son that I actually feel good about him using! The apps and books are educational, and have all of his favorite characters! He especially loves the PJ Masks "appisodes," an interactive story game. The case os very protective, and though the 2 year no questions asked warranty is amazing- I don't think we will be needing it.<br/>the parent controls are also a genious feature, love it. Well done Amazon!
 Returned to get an iPad mini - sorry Amazon
 My son had one when he was 4 so we bought another for his 7th birthday. He loves it and it’s easy for him to use. The case makes it very durable.
 This didn’t even last six months. It stopped holding a charge after only having it about two months, and when we could get it to charge it dies quickly and/or needs to be constantly plugged in. We hadn’t downloaded any apps or anything that would cause it to be so slow, either, however it takes a good five minutes to power on and is sluggish. Don’t waste your money.
 works as promised, my 18 mo old grandson loves his mickey mouse shows . we pre loaded it with mickey mouse videos for long trips and even bed time . it helps settle him down so he'll go to sleep. can't wait for preloaded  activities to challenge his mind.
 We bought this tablet for our 3 year old. It is a great product. She enjoys the content included in the purchase.  I like the parental control that this tablet offers. Our only problem thus far has been the charger stopped working. We have other chargers around the house so it is not a big problem for us.
 Bought this because the grandkids used my kindle for playing Thomas the train races. But they were tapping so hard on my kindle I was afraid they were going to break it. I am glad it has wide sides for little hands. They love this thing and picked out more games to play.
 Back in Novemeber 2017 I had purchased two of these tablets one pink and one blue for my children for Christmas and when they came in the pink one worked great for my 3 year old little girl, but the blue one worked for about a week and then for some reason it wont let us in and allow us to do anything to the product. I have tried contacting to get a new one several times but haven't been able to do so.
 I brought this for my 4 year old grandson and he loves it. You can put I’ll kinds of neat learning apps on it in games it’s just an awesome product
 The tablet is rugged and well-made.  It's still a little too complicated for use by 3 or 4 year olds but I think it would be ok for older children.
 So many options/apps/games/videos/characters/etc for my 2 year to pick.  With having the child and parent pages separate, I'm not worried about my daughter buying games or messing with settings.
 My grandchildren, 2 and 4 years, cannot put them down.  The 2 year has learned more quickly with the apps you can download.  All for the age group you pick.
 Nice tablet but too complicated for small children to understand the navigation and downloading process.  Battery takes forever to recharge. Maybe it’s just my tablet.
 I have a 3 year old and she loves this so much. It's easy to use and the perfect size for her. The case gives me comfort that if she drops it, it'll be fine!
 My daughter loves it. Wish it had come with better directions but we figured it out. Very happy. Great case
 I like that you can go between different profiles however it only works with wifi and I'd like for it to work on road trips or while in the car. Great price and seems durable but ultimately bought for the warranty. It's a little slow but gets the job done.
 Touch screen stopped working at the 1 year mark.  Amazon tech support replaced it after verifying a factory reset would not fix it
 We have purchased quite a few of these for our grandchildren as well as some developmentaly challenged older children. It gives us the scalable parental control along with the necessary safeguards. I Love the year of free time. This allows the children that explore a wide variety of books and games of all levels. Highly recommended.
 The product is great except we can't get the app we bought it for.  Our son likes dave &amp;ava from YouTube and we got the kid kindle so that we could down load the dave and ava app so that he wouldn't need our phones anymore.  The app is not compatible with the kindle.  Wish I had know before hand
 My children love these. And I love how customizable they are and the parental settings are the best of any product I’ve seen. Definitely get the expansion storage card because they run terribly slow when packed with data.
 This was such a great gift idea for my oldest granddaughter and it worked well for a short time, but it now doesn't hold a charge for any real length of time and it takes an exceptionally long time to charge even a little bit. I am having a hard time finding the necessary information in order to try to send this item back for service or replacement per the 2 year worry-free warranty.
 Great product with one serious design fail. You cannot access the media content unless you are connected to the internet. There is also no option to download any of the content from the free children’s media. That means you are left with downloaded content from your amazon account in the parenting profile. We got these for traveling on the airplane. This is a major let down for us. Otherwise they work great! On the next version I hope they include some kind of “airplane mode” media options for the kiddos.
 My daughter loves her tablet. It took me a moment to learn the controls (thanks to YouTube) and we use it for the kid friendly app and to watch our favorite episodes online.
 This is such bad product too slow bit complicated my daughter din like it.not at all worth .. I wish I could return it
 I couldn't wait to give this to my 6 year old for Christmas! Once he opened it and started to explore all the new things, he was just as excited! For the money, it is the best kids tablet we have found. Being able to download pretty much anything you want to take anywhere is great. I like how easy the parental controls are to use.
 Bought this tablet for my nephew who destroys everything he touches. He gave this thing a bath in a sink full of water and it still works perfectly so it has well earned its 5 stars since it’s been with Syd for Toy Story’s more awful little brother,lmao.
 Truly awful. It’s so slow. The battery dies extremely fast. There isn’t much content and is confusing to younger users. You also cannot download the YouTube kids app. We’re sticking with an iPad.
 Definitely not a fan of the unit. Nothing but problems with the charging port and when you deal with customer service they just send a new one. We have been through three of these already and we are getting ready to send the third one back.
 It is very specific to which apps you can get. And you have to have amazon videos to watch videos. What is most frustrating is I can't see what apps and books my kids have unless I have Internet (they can play them but I can't see which one tonpick until I click on it).<br/>However I do love the time limits
 My daughter loves it. I love all the different options of activities from reading books to playing app games to watch a movies on my Amazon Prime account I love the fact that the parents can control and make it age appropriate for your child you can limit the activity and activity times
 Nice quality case. Good battery life. I couldn't figure out the free trial of games/movies/books. my 4 year old can maneuver thru the tablet with ease and little help.
 I love how simple it is for my 1yr old grandson &amp; also my 3 &amp; 4yr olds to use. I have a sense of security knowing that I can set up all kinds of parental control &amp; can chose what I don't want them to have access too as well. the case is also a great asset. My only issue is that I wish there were a protective cover over the charging port &amp; buttons. Other then that, we're about 2 weeks in &amp; we love this kids tablet.
 My son loves his tablet! The design is great and holds up well against drops! Can't beat the warranty on this tablet either! It is a WiFi tablet so keep that in mind, but most restaurants offer free WiFi and it's always connected at home! Definitely worth the money.
 This was a Christmas gift for my special needs child that only worked for a few months. I was told I would receive an exchange because of the 2 year warranty,  I received a refund of $4.80, the tax for the $79.99 purchase.
 I got this for my 3 yr old and it is really an awesome product. Works geat i her little hands and so easy to switch to the standard fire 7 version with Alexa voice command. Comes pre loaded with tons of games, videos and apps.....Love IT!!!!!!
 Breaks easy then if you want a refund cause it's trash, they don't give you the full amount back. What a crock?
 My daughters are 3 and these are perfect for them to use as learnings tools. I took stars off because 1 of them randomly exits out of the apps while in use and it's really annoying. It happens almost on a daily basis
 Thank God It has a 2 year no worries.<br/>It won't charge anymore. I will be sending it back.
 For the price and a year of Freetime included, this is a steal. The actual tablet drives me crazy -- space is quickly filled by downloaded apps in the kidstore, it charges at a snail's pace, and my kids needing me to unlock it every time they accidentally drag the bar down gets old quickly -- but for the price, the protective case, and the replacement policy I can't complain in good conscience. I have one for both my 3 and 5 year old and they love them.
 Purchased for a friend as a gift for her granddaughter
 I would recommend this product so many times it so worth it. thia is the best thing Amazon has came up with for parents that have lil ones.
 This was an awesome gift for my 4-year-old step son for Christmas. I love how it has control settings to limit total time spent on the entire device, as well as controls to require them to spend time learning in the apps before allowing access to Netflix.
 I &lt;3 Kindle, I purchased this for my grandson and he is loving it so far!
 The Fire 7 met my expectations. I bought them as a gift for my nieces and they enjoyed them and even downloaded books for reading and that is what I was hoping for.  My one complaint is more of a personal issue, I didn't know that the tablets were tied to my Kindle account so, when we were setting them up, all of my books appeared in the library. Once I figured out how to switch users, everything was okay.
 Got this so my kids could play abc mouse. That app is not supported on the kids profile. Also the kids can download any app they want on there profile, as long as it’s in the amazon kids store. Really wish there was a way to prevent from downloading other apps.
 My little one didn’t find it user friendly. We are use to Apple products, and just went with the newest iPad. Apps were subpar.
 These were fine for ALMOST a year, then they just stopped charging without a lot of cord wiggling and positioning the Kindle at just the perfect angle.
 Bought this for my daughter- at first it was great. After a month of having it it started to not hold a charge. It is now to the point where we have to constantly keep it plugged in in order for her to use it. If you unplug it you can see it drain by the second and then it dies. Waste of money, very disappointed.
 Love love this! My son enjoys all the apps, games and movies. Also like the warranty on it. This is his replacement after the first one went black. I’d continue to get this still
 Got my 3 year old this for Christmas and he loves it! Great product, durable, and will last a long time! I also like the warranty that comes with it, Amazon offers more than any other store I found as it comes to replacing this! I honestly don’t think I’ll need to though!
 Bought two for my twin grandchildren. They love them but so very disappointed that the charging port is junk. After only 3 months one of them is loose and won’t charge. Saw all the other reviews with same problem and got angry that they would keep selling these knowing of the defect. Have yet to contact them so will see how the service is. But this isn’t right. Fix the damn problem don’t just keep selling it as is.
 My 3- and 4-year old grandsons both adore this tablet!! Thank goodness for the 2-year kids warranty!  Gotta say this one sure took a beating, being fought over so much!  While they were inconsolable for the few days it took for the new replacement to arrive, they are loving it even more now (after having to make due with the “eww, boring” tablets their other grandma got them. ;-D  ... 2 points for Mimi!
 Bought these for my grand daughters for Christmas and love them.  It only allows them to see what is age appropriate for them.  They enjoy this device for entertainment and reading.  Would recommend to all children.
 My 4.5 year old is still learning the tablet (as well as myself). He had a LeapPad before this Fire Tablet. We switched over due to the constant app crashes. Now we rarely have any issues on the Fire Tablet. I uploaded very similar apps as the LeapPad bc we basically use it for educational purposes and Minion movies. Highly recommended!
 Our four-year-old grandson loves it has no problem running and lots of educational games really happy with it
 Battery life leaves something to be desired.  It also seems to take a long time to boot up.  Other than that this works great for my kids and the Kids Zone is amazing allowing my daughters to play risk free.
 A little confused, received refund totaling $3.23. 2nd tablet purchased when the 1st one would no longer  keep a charge.
 I bought this for my four year old grandson. He has not played with it yet. However I have tried several different children's apps, which came pre-loaded and I know he is going to love it. I also bought screen protectors since the child-proof casing came with it and a carry case. Looks like it's going to be exactly what I needed to enhance learning and fun for my grandson.
 All 4 of my kids love their new tablets! I am getting frustrated though because only 2 of them have the audible book section on them and the other 2 I cannot figure out why they don't show up. I have tried everything.
 It is limited to Amazon content only, will not allow YouTube or other streaming content. Not worth it.
 This is the third kindle I’ve bought. I love everything except the charging port wears out and the charger will not stay in. It has happened to all three that I bought. The most recent one was just purchased for Christmas 2017. It has already worn out. I’m really disappointed. If it wasn’t for the charging port malfunction I would’ve given 5 stars.
 My daughter enjoyed this until it turned off, stopped working, and physically swelled up. I believe it might be something to do with the battery, and I'm afraid it might catch fire or something. I tried contacting support, i got passed around and they "submitted the form to the developers".
 I have never put a review on any products I have purchased. But I'm so disappointed that this is already the second tablet im on due to the tablet stopped charging AGAIN!! so many complaints with the same issue why haven't they fixed it.. . Tablet has great games and perfect for a child. But u cant play them if the darn thing cant be charged.
 perfect easy-to-handle tablet for kids
 My son enjoys it and it pretty much works for what he needs it for. However i was unaware that it would just revert to a normal kindle state after being asleep for a few mins, locking my son out, and giving access to non kid safe content once opened. I would prefer a device that is simply the kid version only. Also it is laggy And have already had an issue with the charger. All around for a hundred bucks its not a bad purchase but i expected more out of amazon.
 This is a great tablet and is easy to set up if you know a little bit about computers. The freetime is great as is the ability to control what apps and videos.
 Bought these for the kids for Christmas.  Not sure how many times they have been dropped, but the tablets don't seem to have noticed any.  They work well and pretty fast.<br/>If there is a limitation to the tablets, it is with the parental control and free time software.
 This is the biggest waist of money I have ever spent on a piece of electronics! I’ve had it for 3 days and it stopped downloading apps under my kids profile. A full storage message keeps popping up when my storage is only 1/4 full. I’m beyond disappointed with this thing!
 Tablet works great until the charging port stops working.  We have purchased four of these tablets for our boys and the same thing happened with all of them.  So tired of wasting money.  Amazon wants us to call for "trouble shooting".  I don't have time for that, especially when it's not going to work because it's the same problem!
 Great toy to keep kids quiet
 Im use to my iPad and sharing it with my son. I was excited when i saw this. I personally think its ok for a kid. Its not 5 stars but its good .<br/>If your looking for something basic to keep your kid busy. Its easy to use and will likely survive anything with that cover. I would recommend
 The tablet was a bit different than the non kids one but my kids rather have the non kids version. I'll be returning the two tablets I've purchased.
 My granddaughter cannot put this down. She loves it so much! It keeps her occupied on long trips and in the grocery!
 The apps in the FreeTime unlimited are awesome for kids of all ages. But this software runs way too slow.  A lot of waiting to load up apps and sometimes freezes.
 Item was returned on the 9th of jan, daughter used it about 5 times item didn't want to turn on....still waiting on refund
 It doesnt its job for now. I would say the capabilities of this piece of technology is slower for 2018-2019.
 I just couldn’t get use to the Fire vs our IPad. I wish I would have gotten another iPad for our daughter u stead since that it what she was used to navigating. Just can’t get use to the set up
 Works great! My kids love it and the onboard app to manage profiles and apps is nice. The Charging cables that come with it suck and do not stay seated well. I ended up purchasing another set from a different seller that work fine.Battery life is fair. Could be a lot better.
 This tablet is perfect for kids. My daughter is going on 2 years of having this and being a pre-schooler, it has seen a lot of abuse. Amazon has replaced it with no hassles and it has been quickly. Best services ever.
 I would not get these tablets for kids 8-10 they are a little more childish that I had hoped. I just canceled the child package
 completely kid friendly and the outer case is perfect since kids are clumsy! My only complaint is you can't download the official YouTube Kids app that restricts unwanted videos and it only casts to the Fire Stick and not the Chromecast, just fyi. Other than those two things, this tablet is awesome!!!!
 Got this for my 11th month old son for Christmas we play learning games and watch Daniel Tigers neighborhood I love the fact that I can lock it from regular sites and it has different settings for different age groups
 Bought these for the black Friday price of $65 each.  Great product for the price. They so far work great. The thick, shock proof cases are awesome; I purchased additional screen protectors because this case doesn't protect the screen, but they vwere $5 for two at Walmart.  I do not like that a password has to be entered everytime the tablet is turned off and then back on.
 My son loves it and I do too ! I like the way I can switch profiles and read my kindle books on it then switch the account back for my son to enjoy. I would recommend this tablet to parents
 Ok tablet , it works for my toddler , but i could never use it on a regular basis . It’s too slow loading apps even when connected with WiFi . I find it hard to navigate too . Not easy to customize settings/ home screen either.
 You get what you pay for.....when you have a child who has worked on a IPad or Android tablet this little tablet is slow and disappointing!
 Not enough memory for sure. I added an SD card with plenty of memory to handle everything my kids wanted. But the tablet stopped recognizing the apps that had been downloaded previous to the SD card. I ended up having to pull the SD card, delete all apps, install the SD card and download the apps again.
 Excellent tablet for your little ones. My toddler loves his tablet, very effective and inexpensive with lot of great educational videos and books.
 This is a great tablet for my three year old. He navigates it easily for the most part- but he can't open it unless I do first, due to the password lock. The Case is extremely sturdy and I don't see it coming out of the case at all, which is perfect for rough toddlers. He has access to tons of educational material, which I like. Plus he can watch movies and episodes of shows. It's a great tablet overall.
 Waste of money. I bought this for my daughter to play with. It works fine. It is difficult to connect to different WIFI’s, having to sign out of her profile and into mine to connect. The worst part is the battery. If she plays with it and I turn it off, the battery runs out. It has to be plugged in at all times. I would have never bought this knowing that.
 I like that it is inexpensive and that there is the free time function that times the use of the tablet. The things I don’t like is that some of the apps take multiple tries to run. The touch sceeen is not that great. Overall I think it’s a good buy for a child
 Received these tablets yesterday and my kids havent put them down yet........ Love that I can monitor what they are doing and that all are profiles can be played on our fire tablets....
 This tablet is exactly what I needed for my 4 grandchildren.  They are durable and I love how the parental restrictions are easy to manage
 Tablet works good, but not crazy about the child account screen as it is difficult to determine what apps I already have downloaded and whats available to download. It gives off the appearance of always being in the app store to search which can be challenging for users.
 Really loved this but quit charging n battery runs out n 20 mins or less
 Great tablet for my 6 year old! Has tons of apps and lots of parental controls. I read that YouTube didnt work- but it does!
 Sanity saver. Allows my husband and I to go out to dinner and not fend off a toddler meltdown the whole time; we can play her favorite video and actually eat our meal! Perfect for in the car too. When their sweet little heads start spinning and they spew pea soup: just hit play and toss it at them! No worries, the foam casing will protect the tablet, and their skull, if your aim is off!
 Definitely seems like it'll be drop proof. So far, my main concern/issue is that some of the games/apps freeze. I'm thinking it's due to the low amount of memory.
 These are great for the kids. great warranty policy and the cases are pretty much indestructible. The freetime games are appropriate and the kids love these. Will definitely be upgrading soon :)
 I love the tablet. It's great for my child. The case does great at protecting it as he has dropped it several times. They love reading and playing the games on it. And I love the control that I have over when and what they can do so they can play. They love everything about it I've even had to buy a memory card because of all the things they like to have on it. Soon I'll be looking into getting headphones so they can listen to it themselves.
 After 4 months stopped working... Do not charge and still plugged to the electrical outlet maybe one decides to work
 My 2 year old daughter absolutely loves this. Of course she has tossed it around quite a few times but the thick foam case is amazing and gives her an easy grip.
 I love these..  however, I don't like that in the kids mode there can't be additional apps. But if they want something different I can unlock it on parent mode and they can use parent mode.
 Tablet is slow and cumbersome, just bought 2 of these for my twin toddler boys and the 2nd didn't even last a month before battery refused to charge. I'm very disappointed, big Amazon fan expected much more. In warranty process with Amazon now, so far so good, will follow up with warranty experience once complete.
 I bought these for my little granddaughter had them shipped to her house she absolutely loves them and excellent value considering I thought she could have or they could keep one in the car and have one in the house
 My one year old love his new tablet. Has all kinds of learning games and videos for him. It's also very durable and can handle the drops.
 While these tablets are phenomenal and have so many pros, hence the four stars. The con is that the charge ports are poorly soldered and become loose rather quickly. The upside is that they have a 2yr return with purchase. Just frustrating!
 It dies so incredibly fast and takes so lomg to charge my son hardly ever gets to actually play with it. Its also super slow at processing.
 I have 3 samsung Galaxy tablets and this one is by far the best. I also had the Nabi i had purchased for one of my middle children and didnt find it as user friendly as this one. Not to mention the guarentee you get. This one was for my 18month old! Yes 18 month old and with some guidance he does very well navigating himself. For the money its a great buy. I highly recommend it.
 My 4 year old loves this tablet compared to Apple/ Android.
 Complex to operate for children, even for adults. Operating system not compatible with many apps, movies or even books downloaded from kindle. Doesn’t make sense as to why?
 Like the kids interface don't like that the app store does not have many of the apps kids like to play on my Android tablet found in the google play store.For that it doesn't get 5 stars.
 This thing is perfect for little ones! My daughter absolutely loves it and I love having the option to have her complete educational tasks before being able to access entertainment. A great buy for sure!
 Bought for my son for Christmas in 2016 and randomly a few months the sound stopped working. With no apparent issues I called Amazon &amp; they promptly emailed me a return label &amp; within 5 days I had his new one with all the accessories. We were advised to only send his tablet without the kids case &amp; charger so I was pleasantly surprised when we got a whole brand new tablet at no charge with a new case and charger !
 Got this for my almost 2 yr old and Love it!! Durable and easy to set up with your existing Amazon account. EASY AND DURABLE!!
 My 3 year old loves her tablet! We were able to download her fun as well as educational apps and it keeps her busy. The battery life is awesome which is definitely a plus! When dealing with younger kids I’d definitely recommend this tablet with the protector case.
 This tablet is cheaply constructed the micro usb port dies out way too easily.  The anemic storage is eaten up by just the bloated hacked up FireOS.  The tablet is an overall disappointment.  Save your money instead and buy an Ipad or other android tablet.
 My 2 year received this for Christmas and she loves it! Easy for her to use and the case makes it so durable.
 Love the settings for parental control. It was a great gift for my daughter she loves it!
 Thing thing I love most about this is the parental control is so way to set up. It also has a curfew you can set where it can’t be used during certain hours.
 YouTube content, especially, is extremely unsatisfying, repetitive, and annoying.  More details about these failures, and other things, can be gained by providing me a monetary incentive to give it to you (Amazon).  Meanwhile, I'll just take our business elsewhere.
 easy to set parental controls, nice to use. really don't like that you can't use audible (amazon product) on kids settings. i don't want access to the internet, but access to audiobooks. ugh.
 Our two boys rather play with our phones- didn’t like these- we got both blue n yellow both hardly used if we were able to.
 Sent this back to Amazon per instructions, it was received last Tuesday. Batterie not charging after just two moths. Have not heard anything about the "two year replacement" guarantee as yet and my grandson is miserable without it!
 My 6 year old LOVES this tablet! Seemingly endless amounts of content. It’s so kid friendly and the warranty is amazing. I highly recommend this tablet!
 I love the protective case as I purchased it for a two year old. However the ease of making the videos books and apps we use accessible to her without my input which she does not want being so independent is not my favorite feature. I seem to spend more time when she is in bed attempting to make it easier for her to use on her own than she does actually using it. However she may still be too young and impatient when it comes to finding and opening each item in the carousel.
 Disappointed but expected for the price. Very slow and low quality. Doesn't work for am impatient child.
 5 year old granddaughter loves her 2nd tablet. She had one of the old fire 6 with which we had storage problems. This newer edition is better. I only wish my profile would not show up on her tablet.
 Wish it was easier to understand the storage on this thing. I put in a memory card but hive of the apps can be moved so the Talley constantly says its out of storage.
 Slow to load. There are to many apps already preinstalled that loading one takes to long to open.Best option is to buy an adult one and then get a child protective case! Great Concept badly executed !
 Bought this for our 4 year old for road trips and when I need to take my daughter to my appointments. She absolutely loves it. The case has done its job protecting it from drops as well
 This product SUCKS!!! Won’t charge after only having 3 months and Amazon refuses to replace it. Shopping for an iPad now.
 once set up it is easy to use.  You have to help little kids find the right stuff because there is so much there that is not downloaded, or available.  I wish there was a way to eliminate the stuff you dont use.
 The only thing I hate about this device is that in-app purchase is on by default. This feature should be turned on by default.
 We got tablets for our kids to help entertain on our long flight itinerary (22 hours+) and this did not disappoint. It isn't perfect and you need to figure out what apps etc. are downloadable on the Amazon Freetime. But once we figured all of that out, we were no longer completely dependent on Wifi.
 I am very disappointed in this tablet. Not only do you have to press really hard to navigate, but even with a strong WiFi signal it has taken well over an hour to download ONE app. This tablet hasn’t been out of the box for more than three hours and i already feel as if I’ve flushed $100 down the toilet. Has ANYONE else had this problem or do i just have a defective tablet?? If so then i do believe it needs to be replaced.
 Probably the greatest thing I have ever bought for my kids. I highly recommend getting them. Its so amazing. So much on these tablets.
 My daughter loves her new Kindle Fire with the pink rubber cover. She already broke the charging port once but the warranty replacement was so hassle free that we got it completely replaced while she slept and she had no idea I replaced it for her when she woke up!
 My 2 year old loves this tablet it is toddler friendly and so durable, my older daughter somehow shattered her screen and Amazon took such great care of us getting us a new one I have nothing but amazing things to say about Amazon and their products
 My niece liked this product very much, she's always entertained and I even liked better the fact that I can limit the play time per day, the content is child-friendly and no access to internet without me having to authorize it.
 What a perfect tablet for kids. I bought this for my 4 year old boy for Christmas. Easy to setup, and even easier to give to a 4 year old without worry that he would be inundated with ads, and popups that takes him away from his games or experience. I love that the tablet has parental mode, but we hardly ever use it but for the initial setup. I highly recommend this tablet. Sturdy, fast, all around great!
 Super! Great quality, durable and lots of useful apps, games, etc. We use it with my non-verbal child with a couple of apps for communicating with images.
 I researched and researched trying to find a tablet for our kids who are about 5 years apart ages 4 and 9. I didnt want something super easy to break, but also couldn't really hand a "babyish" tablet to an almost 10 y/o. Well I could but we both know the outcome of that. I also did not want to give them something so drastically different that my youngest wanted to play with the oldest bc he likes playing with our cell phones. Anyway I came across these. I waited, read more reviews, did more research.<br/>Finally I just made the decision and Christmas of 2016 I bought them each one. It was an instant hit in our house. I get to set up profiles for both of them which ask their ages, and offers games, shows, movies accordingly. The options where just endless. I love that I can set up the tablet so that my kids needs to play or read educational based stuff for a certain time period before they can watch mindless TV or gaming. We have had them for over a year and I am happy to say they are still being used on a very regular basis. We had to have them both serviced recently, my daughters screen was cracked and my sons wouldnt turn on and the screen was also broken. The 2 year worry free guarantee, is a beautiful thing no company offers anything close to that. I was a bit concerned when it came time to call though, I wondered would there be a lot of questions, would i have to trouble shoot for 20 minutes on devices that wouldnt even turn on? You know how it works with broken devices under warranty, please plug it in, unplug it, take the battery in and out, is it working yet? Its the WORST!!! But I am happy to report there was none of that. They asked me what happened I told them and they said ok, sent me a shipping label to my email. I sent the tablets back on a Wednesday and the following Monday (five days later) I had both tablets back. Two brand new tablets, apparently mine were not repairable (not a surprise to me.)<br/>The bottom line is this, if you are unsure about whether or not this is a good deal bc yes, you can get a tablet for $50 why would you pay twice that especially for a kid. I would buy these tablets over and over again. Just the services, features, programs and case it comes with is beyond worth the extra money, not to mention that it will be repaired or replaced for the next two years. That piece of mind (to me) is well worth the extra $50.
 My toddler loves this and there are soooo many fun apps and games for him. Additionally, it's a GREAT leaning tool. It is EVERYTHING promised.
 Battery drained rapidly. Downloaded YouTube kids and couldn't move it over from my profile that was pre-created, over to my son's profile.
 First, the fire 7 has saved the life of my phone fr ok m my baby boy.  He now has his own play nate that keeps busy. He is loving it and I do too
 Do not recommend, port goes bad on them in 6 months or less. 4th one we've had, all same problem. I bought 2 new ones for our road trip July 2018, they completely stopped charging December 2018. Haven't gotten around to calling and using the warranty..<br/><br/>Pros, parental controls are nice, battery life is OK (depending on how much it is used) good games. Kids loved them when they actually worked.
 These worked well for about 2 months. Now, everything gets deleted and you also cannot take it in the car which is pointless
 Got this for my 5 year old he absolutely loves it great for entertainment learning and reading. I love the parental control. And hes learning a lot thanks guys
 Excellent I bought my first tablet from Best Buy and it stop working and with no hesitation Amazon returned it within a few days once I returned it
 Great tablet. The price is worth it definitely. If you’re looking for a tablet for your child I highly recommend this tablet. My children both had leapster epic tablets and those crashed and sucked and battery eventually doesn’t stay charged. So yes I highly recommend this tablet. You can purchase them at Best Buy it you don’t want to wait for amazon to ship it. Again I highly recommend this tablet.
 The price is very affordable, especially because, I purchased it on sale during the holidays! It included the case, which is very sturdy. The charger was included, which is awesome. Thank you, Amazon. I love you!
 I have bought 3 of these for my children, they all have worked well until this one. It stopped taking a charge about 5 days ago for no apparent reason.
 I absolutely love this kids version. I did a ton of research and this version definitely did not let me down. I would recommend it to anyone with a toddler that eats devices like a baby eats crunchies.
 Love the product, but I am a little disappointed in amazon. When I first looked at the product the price was around 69.00. A few days later when I could afford to make the purchase it had gone up to approx. 99.00. Within a month of the purchase the price dropped back down to the 69 dollar price. My husband wants to purchase another one for our granddaughter to have at home, I guess I just feel cheated.
 I bought for my 5 year old son for Christmas. He loves it &amp; can operate it easily. Haven't had any issues with it. I bought a SD card to add more memory. I use it to help him with reading &amp; he loves all the games. I love that it's password protected so he can't just get on it whenever he wants. I haven't used it as a regular tablet but have no issues when having to download new apps.
 These tablets are awesome! I bought two for my grandchildren and they absolutely love them! I love the control I have over their reading and learning.
 Didn’t really care for it I thought it was an Android and he could not even watch kids YouTube but tablet itself was nice and clear just wasn’t what we wanted!
 My kid doesn't really like this tablet he's just turned 3 years old I got it for his birthday but he is not a fan. I hate that I cannot download YouTube kids which is kids favorite. He has a lot of games good thing he can use it without internet. So main reason I don't give it a four or five star is because I can download the YouTube kids other than that it's okay.
 I'm not impressed with the Kindle 7... We also have a Kindle 8 HD and I should have got another... The Kindle 7 doesn't have a very good picture when playing movies... EXTREMELY distorted... Very slow loading... Take what seems to be for ever....over all I'm not impressed at all...I gave two stars for the fact it is child proof... And could also be used for a adult... But I haven't checked it out on the adult side... Not impressed with video quality...
 This was bout as a gift for my 5 year old son he's had it over a month now and not 1 issue or cracked screen I liked it so much I purchased another for my daughter's birthday a week later
 **** updated 1/28/19*****<br/><br/>Requested a refund sending it back. Go buy a regular tablet and save the headache<br/><br/>*********<br/><br/>The idea of all the activities for my 2 year is great but the tablet keeps freezing and we have only had it for 2 months so we are just going to buy him an iPad and will download the same games.
 This is so perfect. My daughter loves it and I know she’s safe because of the way it is set up. I love Amazon Free Time and I’ve put in on all my tablets now. I will probably buy another soon!
 This is my 3rd kids fire tablet the tablets were never miss used or thrown around but yet the charging port stops working after a few months it happened on all 3 tablets and my children dont plug them into the charger I do and I was even being careful with the 2nd and 3rd tablet but still same issue.
 My 5 year old is loving it. It gives us full control over how he spends his time on the tablet. We enforce quality time like reading books or educational videos prior to spending time on game and other viewing. There is control on when he can start and end the day on the tablet including total time spent.<br/>My elder son spend time in the admin mode where he has access to all things but have restricted certain content in his account.
 Brand new out-of-the-box and it’s immediately stuck in a recovery loop. Did some research and found this is a longstanding issue with the Kindle Fire that people have been having for years, and I’m appalled that Amazon continues to sell a product that bricks itself out of th box as often as it does. Bought for my kids to take on a transatlantic flight and don’t have the time before we leave to get a replacement, so thanks for the expensive paperweight, Amazon!
 Love this tablet. My daughter was used to watching YouTube with no interaction but this tablet changed her view of fun with a capital F! I love the time limits for each category and the curfew setting is amazing! I really recommend this for kids and parents too!
 I'm dissapointed with the speed of these tablets. There's definitely a lag time between clicking on anything to get to anywhere. It's just not practical when kids have had experience with fast phones, iPads and computers. I feel like we're on dial up on these. Have contemplate d returning since I can't find a good answer on the internet on how to speed these tablets up!?!?
 They don't enough memory and not goo for traveling which is what I needed them for
 This device was replaced in January because of a cracked screen.  I don't understand how 5 months later, conveniently after the warranty expired, it will not charge or function whatsoever.  This could not have been a new battery.  Shame on you Amazon!!
 Bought two and they change beyond slow about 30% a hour!!! One was left on the charger charged 100% and completely died before my kid could even use it had to have a replacement sent and now the other tablet is having the same issue battery problems I got the 7 bc my kids and 3 and 5 I didn’t feel they needed the newest model had I known how bad these tablets were I would have gotten a newer version
 I bought this from a third party.  It has been very helpful for keeping my kid occupied while in the car as we drive a lot.  I wish it were a little easier to download videos into a kid profile.  One reason I bought it was the 2 year guarantee.  After about 9 months, my kid did crack the screen even with the bumper case on it.  I called Amazon and getting a replacement was quick and easy.  I was really happy.  No hassle, and new device in only a few days.
 I like most of the controls, however I am not a fan of the fact that he can save things to his tablet from the home screen that causes it to use memory. As my child is only 5 he is constantly clicking on things to download them not knowing what they are. Daily I have to go through his tablet and archive things and remove them because they're not things he utilizes. If it weren't for that I'd give it 5 stars
 Extremely intense setting up  for use. Too intense! And I'm a computer expert with 30+ years experience.<br/>I was able to set up all the features that I wanted for my child, but Wow did it take quite a bit of time.
 Everything in this thing is for sale!  The books the games everything is designed so you or your kid inadvertently clicks on something to buy.  Not happy with it at all.
 Had it for a month - my12-month old loves it. She only uses it in the car. It's very light weight and easy to use... apps are same as kindle.
 This is the fourth one I buy.  My 7, 5, 3, &amp; now 2 yr old grandchild has one.  The tablet is designed for children &amp; built to last.  I listen to the 2yr old singing the alphabet or counting her toys.  It’s been a great investment
 2 stars - After only three months, it stopped holding a charge. Then it wouldn't charge at all. I checked to make sure there wasn't anything in the charging port - there's not. What good is a "kid proof" tablet if it doesn't work? I'll update this depending on what kind of support I get from customer service.<br/><br/>Updated to 5 stars - Amazon made it super easy to return the defective one and get a replacement. Who knows what happened, but they really do stand by the warranty.
 I liked that it came preloaded with a lot. It is harder to play when no wifi connected though. Also, it is not super easy to add content to the kids mode. Great value though and battery lasts a long time!!
 It so happens that Amazon FreeTime videos do not work outside the US.
 Great product but really it’s pretty small for kids. If your kids plan on using this for reading you might find it’s difficult. It’s be ideal if there was the option to get the kids kindle in a bigger size.
 I love his tablet for my daughter. She is one and this really helps keep her occupied in her car seat when I am driving. I let her watch the laugh and learn app and she absolutely loves it.
 My granddaughter loves her new tablet. We are very pleased. Very sturdy and colorful hot pink case. Easy set up, basically ready to go straight out of the box, battery was also already charged too! Highly recommend this for children of all ages.
 My tablet is only 1 year old and no longer holds a charge. This edition is much worse quality than the fire tablet we had years ago- that one lasted us 5 years! Don't waste your money, buy something else.
 The tablet broke within months and my son did nothing to it.  Also they start charging you monthly for no reason.  The tablet was broken when the monthly charges started so we did nothing to initiate them.  Better yet there is NO WAY to find the source of the monthly charges on your amazon account.  I have looked everywhere and the stupid tablet will not even turn on.  DO NOT BUY
 Bought this for my four year old daughter and she really likes it. Nice baby duty car on it too. Performes well and battery seems to last.
 There are all kinds of down right stupid design flaws in the FreeTime front end. Some of the major ones that make it almost more worth while to buy an iOS device, even though the major cost difference, to avoid headaches are:<br/>IAP’s that are supposed to be only need to purchase once to unlock across all devices don’t properly work with FreeTime. They will only unlock on the profile they were purchased on. This means if you have more than one child you have to buy the same IAP for every child that uses the app.<br/>Next it’s impossible to change the device title that shows up in the top left of the screen on FreeTime profiles. It automatically sets the profile title to “&lt;CHILDSNAME&gt; &lt;ORDINALNUMBER&gt; Fire”. Anytime you load the profile on a new device it counts up the ORDINALNUMBER and it’s permanently set to that device ID. If you get one device then something happens to it or you upgrade or whatever, every one after the first will have a new number, even if previous devices no longer exist. If you started off putting a nickname in instead, even if you change the name in the profile it will always show the nickname. The only way to change it is completely delete the profile then recreate it, which leads to the above problem and you’d lose all your IAP unlocks permanently.<br/>The programmers don’t realize Sunday is a school night, but not Friday night. If you set the Daily Time limits on weekends to lock out at a later time than weekdays it doesn’t lock out until that later time on Sunday nights, but locks out at the earlier time on Fridays. On top of that the end of the lockout timer ends Monday at the weekend Time, and at the weekday time on Saturday. So if you set it to unlock very late in the morning on weekdays so kids don’t play before school but unlock early on the weekends you’ll find your kids playing on Monday morning when they’re supposed to be getting ready for school. Then on Saturday when you might like to sleep in, they’re going to wake you up to unlock it for them. It makes the timers pointless.
 Had ordered  this for my grand daughter which has Autism , it has alot of apps that i thought would help her etc. Only had it a month and wouldn't  hold a charge!!!<br/>Of course she was upset  so was i!!!<br/>So waiting on Amazon to send a new one, looks like as much money you pay for it, this wouldn't  happen!! Not happy, wonder if the new one will do the same  hope not or i will go somewhere  else.
 My son really likes watching Netflix on it and playing games. But sometimes it glitches and is slow. Hopefully that will stop. But overall a good durable tablet for a two year old
 Very great and really designed for kids, parental control, goal seeting for kids usage is a great functionality. With the case, doesn't get damaged after being dropped on the floor several times
 Great tablet for kids!  Daughter already broke screen, was sent back and fixed at no charge in about a week.  Highly recommend!
 I bought this tablet for my 2 year old because we were going to Disney and he needed something for the plane ride. I wish it was a little easier to use. I made a profile for him and me. I was able to download some videos for the plane ride. All he watch is Sesame Street videos. The tablet was ok for 2 weeks. It freezes. And he has to constantly give it to me to fix it. It’s annoying.
 Great product!<br/>Got the tablet since august 206 and this year the screen got some cracks (my daughter uses it every day). Contacted Amazon and they replaced the tablet with a brand new one less than one week.<br/>Great service, great products, best quality- price match. Warranty service fantastic!!!!!<br/>Thanks AMAZON!<br/>HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT!
 On my kids profile I couldn't get ABC mouse but in normal on mine I could. Doesn't make any sense.
 My granddaughter loves it.  It is one of her favorite toys.  Keeps her occupied while waiting waiting for appointments, etc.
 This tablet is very durable for my toddler. She just loves it!!  I was surprised to learn that it came with a year Subscription to FreeTime!! Great Deal!! We love it
 Hello I bought this for my son last year. It has the two year warranty. I need to know what I need to do to get a replacement. The one  we have is broken  as my son dropped it in water. I've emailed you in the past but I haven't seen a response yet. Please contact me back as soon as possible.  Thank you<br/> Krity Roper<br/>My email is kristyroper44@gmail.com
 Bought two of these for my kids. They work great. Not a lot of storage, but they are 5 and 7 years old and they don't need a lot. They just delete some games and download new ones when storage is full.
 This tablet does not allow syncing content to SD card when the Kid's account is being used. Makes this tablet completley useless for kids media while traveling and on the road.
 It’s great for my three year old. My five year old loves his too. When I created their profile though I didn’t realize if you want you tube you have to switch out of their profile and go into mine which I don’t prefer but it’s an option
 We are used to apple products. This is difficult for my daughter to navigate, the swiping is more sensitive as are the puzzle games so she quits after only a few minutes.  The games are more expensive than apple games of similar nature.  A better product for an older toddler unfortunately.
 The touch screen is not easy to use and it is very cheap quality. Does not hold charge after less than a year of use. Will not be purchasing another or returning this one as all of my friends with the same tablet have the same issues.
 Bought for our little granddaughter , cant seem to download anything she likes to watch . Hard to download anything even on the parent page and transfer it to hers.
 This tablet was not what I expected. I bought it from best buy with the impression that there are games for kids already on the tablet. You have to enter your personal credit card to register this device, which I thought was crazy. The display has to much on the screen, so navigation is complicated.
 Love being able to monitor the screen time for the kids. They don't get mad at me when I tell them it isn't working. Ha!
 Got it fo my 3 years old and it's perfect, he can safely watch shows that is only for his age group and I don't have to worry about it showing something I don't approve of.
 I really was enjoying this product. It provided full on entertainment for my two year old daughter. Unfortunately today the tablet froze and then cut off. It has not come back on since then.
 Great size, my child loves it and I love the parental controls. My only issue is I've had to reset it twice because the app displays would not load. Customer service couldn't resolve the issue.
 Worked great till it stopped charging. Chatted with Amazon. Replacement send. Great till it stopped charging once again two months later. Chatted with Amazon. Was told replacement was going to be sent.  None received. Called Amazon. I hung up on overseas customer service rep after an hour of them “trying to make it ok and verify the info...”.
 I love this thing...so does the kid.<br/><br/>Easy to program, easy to use...I bought an 8 for myself after seeing hers.
 I do not reccoment this tablet due to it being slowed than life. Just not worth the frusteration honestly.
 This kindle take a very long time to come on, whenever you turned it on.<br/>Always freezing, once it loses the orignal color, had to take it to a phone company, and they fix it. I regret buying it. I called the technician when it loss it color it seems as if he did know what he was saying that's when i took it to the phone company
 Can’t give it 5 stars— nothing is perfect , but for what it’s used for it gets the job done. My 3 year old uses it to learn on it through the kids free time app!! And she enjoys the apps from counting , letters and the dress up/ make over ones. Hell I even play it, only to help her figure it out. It is very kids friendly. From being a Mac guy—— this was a bargain as a tool to help her learn more vs paying close to 4 x that for the competition brand!
 kids interface confusing, hard to figure out what apps are downloaded and not downloaded.  Apps take FOREVER to download, if they ever in fact do download.  Overall super frustrating for both child and parent, lots of tears!
 best little device, my preschooler is finally able to be on a safe device that allows him to continue learning what he already learns in preschool. He loves the apps and the books he can read on it. It is great on battery life also. I love the fact that I can put a timer and if I need to have him complete certain programs before he can play his games. So happy with this.
 I have had it about a week now and haven't had or seen any of the problems mentioned in the other reviews, my daughter loves this and she knows that the downloaded stuff are the ones with the tick on it, she's 3. She doesn't just tap everything so that's one less thing to worry about.
 We ordered 2 for our girls for Christmas. Excited about the kids unlimited apps and the parental controls. However it runs slow when on WiFi and when out in public it is not easy or sometimes possible to connect to WiFi - without WiFi the tablet doesn’t work. Very disappointing. I wanted this to be utilized inside the home as well as outside the Home. I will be calling tomorrow for help if not able to help with WiFi I will be returning these tablets.
 The kindle glitches all the time and we tried restarting it several times and charging it and checking WiFi connection and it still glitches
 My son is tough on his tablets, and this is the only tablet that is able to handle him for a long time. Yes they do break, but get the insurance! It was super easy to get it replaced. I also like when you buy apps on this tablet, (most) will just let you verify the purchase and re-download it after.
 This tablet is really good for kids. They can learn a lot things without going to school. For instance, my three year-old daughter almost knows the alphabet and counts beyond 10. Moreover, I can control her screen time, what she can watch and learn from my phone on the Freetime app. But, the battery is the big issue. When it's completely dead, it takes too much time to start getting charge.
 This Product is a life saver when you have a active  7 year old who is special  needs  who is autistic  that has meltdowns<br/>The many activities  on this one little  tablet<br/>And you can put a time limit  of how much you want your child to spend on the internet<br/>Still trying to figure  out how to connect  to my hotspot  on my phone when some places doesn't have wifi
 I wasn't sure if i would like this tablet or not, and to be honest i was not even sure if a child should have one. Well I will recomend to every parent i now know to get one for their child. My grandson loves this tablet and so do i. He has dropped it so many times i have lost count and it still works as it did when we bought it. He puts together  puzzles, plays games, watchs cartoons and so much more,. This tablet is wonderful.
 If I could get away with not giving a star I would. I bought the Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet for my daughter for Christmas and the long flight home. A few days into the new year it stopped charging. I have tried an amazon charger cord with an amazon box, I have tried everything I can think of and it’s still not charging. Waist of money, don’t bother with it.
 For the money they are a good buy to start the kids off with a tablet.
 This product DOES NOT allow you to access abcmouse.com and that's one of the main reasons I bought it. I wouldn't recommend this for a 2 year old like people made me believe it would be good for. Waste of money.
 Love that my young child can only access safe items, and can have it set up so that they have to meet educational goals before free time, as well as overall time limits. Still trying to figure it out, but so far I don't like that I can't get specific apps for her to watch her Disney shows on.
 Great tablet for my three year old... battery life on it is terrible and charging takes a long time with amazon charger. Otherwise really great .. had some great preloaded app/games on it for kids too!
 This was their Father Christmas present and they were over the moon.  I personally love the fact that as soon as we turn them on I received a notification from my Amazon account.  The games are fun, fun videos, the books... they are now more interested in reading books!!!... the kid-proof case works like a charm.. as my twins are called the Hurricane Twins and their Tablets are still intact :)
 The product has freezing issues and must be restarted. It drops wifi connections out of nowhere and refuses to reconnect. It will boot-up empty, though it has a memory card and saved information. Once restarted, multiple times, it will run fine, for a little while.
 Love the tablet for the kids - main selling point was the "no worries, no questions asked, your kid breaks we replace option".  Most 2 year olds are pretty destructive and no surprise we end up with one that gets broken. 1 hour, 3 people later, numerous questions.. some repetitive it is finally able to be shipped out to get replaced. There was nothing easy about this.
 So far so good. My 3 year old loves it. I like all of th content on there. My only dislike is that she likes to click on stuff which then downloads it on to the device. She is already running low on storage because she downloaded a bunch of games and books she really didn't want to have. I will have to go in and clean it up so she can download new games.
 Our kids love these! Awesome that they are so affordable, are backed by a no-questions-asked damage policy (which we've used), and that they accept microSD cards so you can inexpensively add a ton of data (a night and day difference from iPads). Big fans!
 This is great! Works really well for my 5 yro and 2 yro. Pre downloaded games and movies play fine without wifi.
 If you don’t mind a very slow, cheap tablet then this one is for you! It does have 2 years of hassle free replacement if it is broken for any reason. It is perfect for kids, however, it is extremely slow to load.
 Our first tablet broke very quickly, this model is so much better. It is durable and has lots of fun apps for kids. You can easily switch between the adult and child’s profile and can change which apps are available to them. Similar to an adults tablet but in child view it’s easier to navigate for kids and is more exciting to look at.
 I was all excited for my daughter when we got the table, but we been having terrible experience with it. The tablet doesn’t stay connected to the WiFi. My daughter has to literally bring it to me every 2-3 minutes to reconnect it to the internet, which takes like forever to reconnect. She gets frustrated and throws the tablet. Please will appreciate if I can get any solutions to this problem.
 I bought this for my 5 year olds birthday. It has worked great with no issues. It is easy for her to navigate. I like that I can set time limits on certain types of apps and only allow her to use the tablet so many hours out of the day
 This was my very first purchase from Amazon... We bought 4 of these! Loved the money you saved when buying 2 in the same bundle! They came on time, pre-loaded with tons of games, apps, everything a kids could want ;) easy to use for kids, and parental controls for me. I'm like a wizard!!  Kids ages 3-12, there is  kid or teen set-up options. Most apps you don't even need wifi, so they are awesome in the car :) Also, Amazon sends user tips via email. Very helpful!
 Love this tablet fir the grandkids. I bought 4 of them. Good quality, lots of storage, down loaded the grandkids a collection of games their favorite. Between amazon and netflix they always entertained. I u kno what they watching.
 I love it. I am very pleased with my purchase. It was so easy everything was already installed just had to turn it on and it was ready. My my son loves to watch his shows on it. I love it keeps him entertained on long car rides.
 I like the parental controls the most. What doesn't seem to be working out as expected is the amazon freetime. Everything on there you have to pay for it seems but I thought the features were all free for one year.
 The thing that I do not like about this product is, is my daughter will download a game and then has a hard time finding the game to play. It just is not very user friendly for a child even though that is what they advertise it for.
 Bought this to replace my son's iPad he broke. Great for the value. Wish you could download apps but still a cheap alternative to buying an iPad while still providing safe content to younger kids.
 With all the PADs out there, this is really hard to beat. Great quality and the first year you have access to 100s of apps for free, kids learning, video n movies. AND if by chance the grandkid breaks it with in the first year, AMAZON WILL REPLACE IT FREE, no questions asked. It’s an all around good deal, hard to beat!!
 Painfully slow. 1/3rd of the memory is devoted to Amazon's apps, which you can't delete. We returned it less than 6 hours after receiving it. There's better for the same price point.
 Durable, but 'kid' system pushes lots of videos and things without adult authorization. We've decided to put it in storage and make the kids go outside and play.
 Not very good. Trying to figure out how this 2 year warranty works. After a year it just stopped charging
 Being able to set up different profiles is wonderful. Getting it all set up was a nightmare. I had no experience with these and the store (Best Buy) did nothing to help. I had to call multiple times and ended up having to drive back in. I asked when I purchased it if I could have help setting it up and I was told I could do it all at home and call if I needed help. I am disappointed there is only a year of free and unlimited apps and that's all.
 The warranty is amazing. Used it several times without an issue. Great for young children. Buy extra storage cards, they fill up fast.
 Has Everything that I wanted my grandkids to have on thier tablet and more. The mist important factor I really like about this tablet is the parental control that I have over it at all times to see what they are doing on it. So I can block material that I don't want them seeing. also I can put curfews on it for the tablet to shut off at a decent time at night. I absolutely love this tablet!!
 My daughter is 5 and she loves it. The Freetime is subscription is the best part. Kid appropriate games. I also like that it doesn't give her ready access to youtube. Its easy to tear her away from the games but its a little bit more difficult to tear her away from the youtube vids once she gets going. Its a nice distraction for when she's bored and I have things around the house to do or if we're taking a trip.. No wifi needed for the games.
 BE CAREFUL AMAZON WILL LOAD ALL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ON A KIDS TABLET
 I love these kindled but they only seem to last maybe two years. Then they won't charge and have other problems.
 Best gift I have purchased for the great grandchildren.  The learning experience is beyond measure and also gives them quite time or time to settle down.
 I have 2 nephews and a niece who all have these tablets. They throw them and beat them up and they stay well protected. I’m not a huge advocate for kids on tablets but I understand that today more then ever children are obsessed with them. Highly recommend to any parent looking to buy a tablet.
 Having all kinds of problems with this tablet.  Very disappointed in its performance. Won't even work anymore.
 The tablet is super cute and isn’t to heavy. My 16 month daughter loves it. If you aren’t connected to the internet any videos you downloaded will work for 48 hours which is awesome. Perfect portable tablet to take on the go to distract your littles while grocery shopping, dining out, or having a long drive. I definitely would get the screen protector to help keep the screen safe and clean.
 This was a christmas present for one of the grand kids. It is still working fine without any problems, it gets used a lot for games and watching TV programs.
 Excellent quality. Shipping is fast. amazon free time is included. We do not let our kids on this very often, but it is nice to have to get them associated with technology.
 This tablet worked out great for my 9 year old. It has great security features. She is not able to get into those inappropriate websites. The case is nice and thick to protect against falls.
 Love this tablet for my littles. They can easily navigate the apps,games, books etc, themselves. The parental controls allow you set time limits and limit there ability to access anything not appropriate for the age and controls you have chosen. The worry free garantee is amazing. Super easy if something happens to it you get it fixed or replaced quickly! Couldn’t be happier. We have two, we liked it so much we got a second.
 This is one tough kids tablet! My 3 year old has dropped it, stepped on it, and thrown it once or twice, and it still works and has no cracks or defects. I highly recommend this for your younger children.
 Needs more controls... Don't want a 2 year old watching silly stuff, want to limit to learning songs, numbers and letters for now and i can't pick and choose what she sees even with freetime
 This is a very good tablet for the price. I love the parental controls and set up of children's profiles. I have had some issues with the device not recognizing the added storage card, but this is normally fixed by power cycling the device. This is a good tablet for children or casual use.
 Seems like my daughter can't use any apps unless they've downloaded, which is a slow process but fine except some of them won't download at all. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but if I can't figure it out it's a little too much for my impatient 6 year old. It was a good deal but next time we'll go with a more familiar android tablet.
 My 3 year old loves it so much. I'm able to set daily limits on it, so he's not playing on it all day. It's easy for him to use and the content is great!
 Great buy!
 Perfect tablet for my grandson who is 3 years old,, the case is sturdy ,, thankfully his parents limit him to a a half hour 3 times a day,,  he can play educational games and he can watch some of his tv shows
 Bought this item for my 8 and 5 year old. This is the best thing we ever bought them. Easy to set-up and download items. Great protective frame. Does not include a case enclosing the tablet. Just wish they can test apps and play them, instead of it automatically downloading. There may be a way, but the kids did not easily see another option. Still would highly recommend!
 My daughter got this for Christmas in 2018 and loves it. There are many games for a two-three-year-old to enjoy.
 Great when you can get it to work. Have had to return one and do a total reset multiple times on the replacement
 My daughter loves it! It has great features and also has a load of settings to protect her from things I don’t want her seeing either!
 We just received this tablet last week and my 2 year old son loves it sooo much! He is very excited about games at his level and ALL the amazing books!
 Excellent. My son adores this tablet. apps are easy to find and download. It is also easy to manage from the parent control.
 Absolutely love it. Got it for my 2 year old son. He love the choices of programs and I love the durability.  He has thrown the tablet across the room and dropped it from the top bunk with no damages. He can take it in the morning and the charge lasts until dinner time. It charges very quickly. The only down side is that not all android programs will load on it, but I don't think that is important at this age. The parental controls are robust and easy to navigate.
 The product was great until a couple of weeks ago. It stopped charging and now my son doesn't have it to play with anymore. It wasn't even a year old.
 I bought this for my grandson's 4th birthday. So far no problems with it and it makes a good babysitter, keeping him occupied so I can leave the room for a few minutes without having to worry about what he's getting into next.
 I give this tablet low ratings as our 3 kids each got one for Christmas. The charging port stopped charging on my youngest after 1 month. Called and got a exchange. A new one sent. That charge port broke after 2 weeks! Now on a 3rd. And yesterday, my daughters has stopped charging correctly and not holding a charge. I'm very unhappy with this tablet. I wouldn't waste your money buying it.
 It does do well for a 3 year old, she absolutely loves it and can spend hours on it with no complaint if I let her. I’ve noticed they lag BAD if you do not have WiFi and constantly freeze. I called support for this issue and they stated she had to many apps on the device, and not enough room available. She has 6 apps on there out of 12gb she has on there 9 is open. Would I buy another one? Yes as long as I had WiFi available 24/7 so it would work correctly.
 my kids love these tablets. The only thing I don't like about them is having to take apps off that they have downloaded when they don't have enough storage. i haven't figured out how turn this feature off yet but I will! lol Just haven't had the time. I also would like to see more mature apps for their ages that also included a kids bible app for learning.
 I bought two of these tablets in July 2017. In December the first stopped working out of nowhere, in January 2018 the other stopped working also out of nowhere. I live in Brazil, I believed in his advertising being resistant. He really is. It does not have any scratches since my children are 4 years old and took good care of them, which surprised me even. However, they still stopped working. Frustrating...As you said, you have to give me another two, ins'n it?
 So far so good. My daughter likes it. I didnt know I needed a subscription for child free play time. It will charge you after 12 months.  That is the whole purpose of the pad is for a child but you are contracted into a subscription for the kid zone. That's unfair. The product is nice dont like the terms
 Love this product. Has an adult side and a kids side. Love the case that comes with it too
 My sister bought this for my son for Christmas, &amp; a pink one for her daughter  (they're 5 years old &amp; 19 months old). It's so easy to use for both of them and really neat! They mostly just use it for games but it has tons of features we haven't even tried out yet. I would definitely recommend it!
 My God Daughter uses this daily (time restricted). It's perfect for backseat entertainment and even while you are trying to shop. The apps and games are perfect for different ages. Also, I am able to switch users when I need to.
 Bought two of these for my grandkids for our trip to Legoland/Disneyland.  Age appropriate content and kept them occupied on the plane ride.  I downloaded a couple of movies and games and they were great. The kids had other tablets but the tablets they always go back to are these Fire Tablets.  No regrets what so ever.
 Love These! My 3 year old daughter and my 2 year old twins are always fighting over my phone or my tablet, but they have no kid modes. I bought this for my older daughter and when I realized how it worked kid wise I ordered 2 more for the twins. They love them, I love them, you can set settings and goals. You know your kid only can access what you give permission to so not having to worry about "what is my child doibg" is a big plus!
 I got this for my son and he loves it. I had seen some reviews that it's slow and really it's not slow at all. He has had no problems with it and can download and play at the same time. If your looking for a table for your little one this one is perfect.
 Great device for my 9yo daughter. She loves to write stories, which is great because it comes with a little word processor... and oh, the games,  books, and videos!
 What can I say.<br/>Amazon asked me to rate something I never owned.<br/>It even shows it on my list of devices but has no purchase record.<br/>Renamed it on my amazon device page as "does not exist".
 My niece loves her kindle.  Thank goodness we can put time limits on it, otherwise she would be on it every minute of the day.
 The kids love these! Tons of games, apps, books at their age levels. Easy to use Parental controls. Love that I can set a curfew, limit actress, set daily limits and make them read for 30 minutes before thery can access the other functions. Screen time limits made easy. Well done Amazon!
 Super s***** quality. Stopped allowing us to charge it after about a year, JUST past the “replacement window” time. So disappointed. Every now and then my son brings it to me and asks me if we can try to charge it again. I wish it would, buddy, is all I can say. I hope no one else wastes their money on this. It’s clearly not for kids.
 I have purchased 3 tablets .  2 of them for  my girls about 1 1/2 years ago which have are now having problems open apps.  The initially worked well with some minor struggles of being able download games.  What I am most disappointed about is that I purchased a new for my son on august 24, 2018 and the tablet is now no longer charging.  I starting wonder if I should have gone with an IPAD?  Currently disappointed.
 I love all of the kids games that come on it. So many options my kids love! It does come with so many that the battery dies quickly. But it's great entertainment for the kids!
 Our 6 and 7 year old love these. They each have their own profiles that can be accessed from either device. They are tailored to their ages and likes. This can also be used as a regular tablet by switching to that profile. Very easy to use, good quality. Needs WiFi to use or on children’s accounts you can download videos or shows in the video tab to be watched without WiFi. That is great for car rides. Highly recommend very happy!
 My kids really love the Fire Kindle. The only problem is my son's own was a gift from my boss and it came already set up under her Amazon profile so she had to log in with her password in order to change any settings. I hope that's changed so parents can set that up themselves before usage.
 Awesome table. Does everything. All sites are assesible, books are available for reading, you can watch movies and play games. My 7 years and 2 year old loves it..
 Why just why is there no you tube kids on this thing. That is all my kids watch. Updating this from Amazon support was able to get YouTube on the device. Still the video selection inside the device us quite limited.
 Works great, the material is kind of soft, meaning it has some give.  It's not pillow-y or anything, it's just enough.
 My granddaughter carries this everywhere. She loves to choose what she wants to watch and play. She has learned colors, shapes and numbers. She is 3 and already recognizing sight words.
 Product was age appropriate and very handy on the plane!
 This is an amazing tablet! Got it as a gift for my 1 year old but it’s more suitable for an older child. My 5 year old plays with it more. It has really nice features and switch from the child’s profile to the adult profile, with parent password. The only drawback is that you can’t play YouTube. When my 5 year old gets tired of paying the games and wants to watch YouTube, he dumps this one for his iPad.
 This tablet is moving extremely slow. I can’t figure out if it’s defective or if this is how they all work. I have been trying to play around with it for the last week but nothing is working. I have uninstalled many apps to make sure there is enough storage space, I have let it completely charge, reset it etc etc. I’m afraid my son won’t enjoy it on Christmas morning!
 I bought these for a road trip and both refused to charge after only a few days. Made my trip rough!
 These tablets are far superior to other tablets when it comes to quality. i have seen these dropped, thrown, and have even caught kids standing on them. Never have seen one broken.
 Great tablet. Very kids proof and offers a lot as far as books, videos and games go. I have a 2 year old and its perfect for her.
 I didn't like that I couldn't download different education apps on the tablet. My Grandson need Lexia Core 5 for school and it wouldn't allow me to download it...nor any of the other apps he needed for school.<br/><br/>I am very disappointed and he's still using my IPad for his school work.<br/><br/>Bummer :{
 My kids love it and there's a ton of fun games on it. Only negative is that a lot of times the tablet freezes or something won't load and you have to restart it to fix the problem.
 Excellent product, but the battery does not last too long, the apps are excellent my kid loves it.  Longer battery life would get you 5 stars.
 I'm glad that I have gotten the tablet as a Christmas gift. I am enjoying it before wrapping it for the tree!
 Rating this device base on their sale purpose, great content in free time but their layout for content makes kids very confusing.<br/><br/>work more on the user interaction for free time and kids.<br/><br/>make it simple and easy to use for kids 3-10 yo depends of their profile.
 I unfortunately bought my second Fire 7 Kids tablet for my youngest daughter's birthday since my oldest has one as well. The systems run incredibly slow. The newest one I purchased keeps saying the memory is full even though I bought a SD card for more memory. I knew what I was buying so I'm not mad about the price just annoyed that this memory issue keeps happening.
 Worked pretty well for about a year then the battery started going bad. Completely dead within 15 months
 The only thing I don't like about this kids tablet is the inability to add kids you tube as an approved app considering it's one of the most used apps by children these days. I bought this for my daughter so I didn't have to share my phone anymore and it didn't really do the job as she still asks for my phone because it has youtube.
 I love the bumper! It does make for a good kids tablet, but I don't like that there is only wifi capability or they have to be tethered to my mobile data to get the most out of it.
 Already had one tablet like this one for 5 year old grandson.  This one for 3 year old grandson.  Kept them very busy on long Spring Break road trip.  Would highly recommend!!!
 Works well, several apps available and my kids love them. I was very disappointed with the battery life though. If you plan a big road trip and want to keep kids occupied, bring ENOUGH charger adaters. They have proven themselves to be very durable.
 It has been great for my 5 year old, I put abc mouse on it, and it works great with the freetime features, as well as the seemingly unlimited other options for educational apps and books.
 Tablet seems to be very durable and my toddler does well with it. The only issue I have found is that it is very slow. The interface is sluggish and just overall not very responsive. It takes an extra long time to install app updates and do just about anything. However, this is good for teaching my toddler patience.
 Soooooo slooooooowwww. Even the stuff we downloaded to the tablet or memory card was choppy or took forever to load. Most of the time the apps wouldn't even load. It was beyond frustrating for us adults but it just made our 3 year old cry cause it wouldn't work when he wanted to play Daniel Tiger or watch Umi Zoomi.
 My son likes the videos after we forgives it out and read stories thru it sometimes we use it for potty time it’s great and it has a parental control on how much access time the child gets which is nice .
 Need a new on got a defective tablet who do I speak to about this ?
 After struggling for 2 years with another type of tablet, this thing has been a breath of fresh air! Why oh why did I not do this sooner!?!
 We got this device for the sole purpose of entertaining our children on a long drive to the airport and then long flight. Well it worked on the way there and completely malfunctioned on the way back. My wife is an IT techs and said, “it’s a goner.”
 Second tablet I purchased and both have charging problems.<br/>A few minutes after leaving a 1 star rating I was contacted by Amazon advising my tablets were still under warranty.  1 star is now at 3 and rising. They seriously saw I wasn't happy and they called me.  I'm not making this up and I don't work for Amazon
 Meet all my expections. A gift for my 3yoa granddaughter. I loved that I could chose parental control for her age.full of wonderful apps for entertainment,educational,mad interactive built in free apps .
 Good case/stand for kids.<br/>Easy to clean (pen, food, etc) and pretty durable. Wish it had come with a screen protector, but good deal for the $$ paid.
 my 6 year old girl loves this tablet, just wish the battery lasted longer but sometimes it a way to make her put it down and go outside and play
 DAUGHTER LOVES IT. IT KEEPS THE KIDS OFF ANYTHING BAD OR HARMFUL TO THERE LITTLE MINDS
 It's very durable. I bought it for my two year old and he loves it. You can set timers to monitor usage. I was able to download PBS kids and he loves watching the shows. It is even something I can use to read or just look up something on the go. (Must be able to link it to phone data or wifi) I definitely recommend
 I'm pretty sure there are a lot of ratings on this. Just wanted to say all games require active connection to play once downloading which my parents didn't like for my nephew this was purchased for.
 I liked the tablet cause my granddaughter could go on the learning website and play games.<br/>What I dont like is that the tablet died and will not turn on anymore and she only had for 2months since her birthday.
 Very different from the android tablets that we are used to I wish we could get the same apps. This is the only reason it's not getting 5 stars
 Well we have three grands here with us.  I purchased 3 tablets but one was stolen. UGH  Christmas time is worse for thieves
 We bought 4 of them for our children for Christmas and by January 9th, 3 of the 4 will not charge and the 4th takes almost 3 days to charge to 100%. Absolute garbage. Bought them from the Best Buy here in Riverdale, UT with my buddy and his daughters tablet is acting up as well.
 I like that they are durable.<br/>I wish there were more apps available, and that the FreeTime controls were more flexible.<br/>I also am disappointed that the FreeTime parental controls require a subscription after the one-year trial period.<br/>I will likely be selling all of them if they are useless without the subscription.
 I charged it to 100 percent and took it off the charger and it wasn't used for about 24 hours and when I looked it was at 6 percent battery. I shut it off so the battery will stay full.
 My son cracked his screen after having it for almost 2 years and Amazon made the process of replacing it with a new one very easy! I had it back in 1 week
 Great value and our 3 year old grandson loves playing puzzles on it.  Have to limit his time on it to get him outside as much as possible.
 I brought this for my granddaughter. She loves it. I don't have to worry about her going onto a sight that she doesn't belong on
 Cannot get youtubekids and amazon is NO help
 I love this tablet and so does my son. When he comes home from daycare he immediately asks if he can do his homework. I like that he can learn, play games, and watch his favorite shows on it. I also like that I can put a time limit on the games and the shows and that there is a completely separate account parents can have to control things without the little one getting back into it and messing with it unless they have your pin number.
 Bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter. She loves it and it is very child friendly. Well worth the price and highly recommend it!
 This has made car rides so much more bearable 3/5 though because it’s not the most intuitive operating system, iPads are much simpler to use but for the cost difference it is well worth it
 This us my 2nd fire buy. Previous one display gone dark and Amazon could not repair. I am giving 3 star because its longivity is questionable, the amazon case needs a kickstand really. Its too big for toddlers to hold, so kickstand is a needed feature.
 My 3 yr old granddaughter loves it. I like the parental control so I don't have to be over her all the time and k ow she can't purchase anything or get on anything she is not supposed to be on.
 Battery won't recharge after only one year of use.  Possibly cord or connector or all of the above.  My old Kindle's battery still works and that one is 10 years old.<br/><br/>Update:  Amazing when you give a one star review, how fast Amazon responds and provides customer service!<br/><br/>Let's see if the problem gets fixed.
 It's quick and easy to set up. Parental controls are great. It's an awesome kids tablet.
 Often receive message that SD cards have been removed when they haven't. Therefore can not save to any SD card.
 Grandson loved this for Xmas
 Kids tablet. Case is nice for a kid playing with it. Could do better with a more child friendly software
 bought this for my son for long road trips, he loves it and i love the child feature!
 My son got this for Christmas from some neighbors bought for my 7 year old. He did like it but about a month ago it wouldn't charge I tried many chargers &amp; it wouldn't work! I have been wanting to call not that I ever did it before so I have been procrastinating but he really wants it! They gave me receipts but it was ordered through Amazon I wished it was a store then I could go there much easier!
 Don’t waste your money. The battery dies within an hour. No matter if you charged it all night or not.
 Daughter loves it but keeps running out of storage and won't let me transfer anything to the external memory.
 The only problem I’m having is trying to figure out how to get apps on the kid account, I think my husband has figured it out hopefully but it did take a little bit to do. Other than that my son LOVES it and he’s just 1 but you can get little videos they can watch and things, or movies, or like we did and download Netflix and watch his cartoons off there!
 I like the Prime video options but the caveat is it's without YouTube. Error screens are common and the wifi is hit or miss. The case is strong and it can take a beating. Unfortunately after only a year the pins on the charging port have worn out. It no longer will take a charge. I've looked around town and it costs as much as a new one to fix.
 Yes very nice it’s a Xmas present so haven’t given it to them yet but have download some games on it works well
 My son LOVES this tablet and so do I. I just feel a little restricted with the apps. There are alot but not as many as Google Play.
 This is the 3rd or 4th tablet that I am needing to return within the warranty for the reason that the charging port quit working. It would be nice if the kids fire edition was upgraded to be an easier, more "kid proof" charging port. Other than that, it's a great tool.
 This is a great tablet very kid friendly.  Only thing is I bought the screen protector that was recommended and placed it perfectly on the screen with absolutely no bubbles.  I unfortunately had to remove it right away, because it made the touch keyboard not work at all.  Other than that so far no other complaints.  I would suggest this product to other parents and their children.
 Grandson loves this. I installed educational apps and he has picked up everything quickly.
 its was a present for 3 year family member and she loves it  keep her entertainment. And she doesn't use my cell phone anymore to play games winning lol
 April 2017 I bought my son this tablet but from best buy. About 6 months later the charger stopped working . No chargers would work so I took it to best buy and they said I would have to make a return through Amazon. So I did and it's barley been 4 months since I've had the new tablet and it's starting to do the same thing as the last. 😔 one year exactly and I've already been through two tablets.
 We've been very pleased with these. The Freetime service is great, and they are good little devices. The no hassle guarantee really was that. My son bent the charging port 18 months after we got it, and a week later we had a new one.
 Excellent product. This is the second tablet I have purchased (2 grandchildren!) and they both love the independence and variety. Their parents really appreciate the supervision options. All together one of the best gifts we have given.
 My 3.5 year old is not exactly careful and has dropped this several times. The case holds up great and the worry free guarentee  gives me peace of mind.
 We bought three of these tablets for our kids for Christmas. I only wish there were an easier way to restrict the 15 THOUSAND (or more!) books, videos, and apps at the start when using the Freetime Unlimited Subscription. Personally, I have a hard time choosing what to watch on Netflix or even what to eat for breakfast! I can only imagine how overwhelming it would be for a kid to have so much free content to choose from. How does your kid know what content is quality or not? They don't, and it ends up not mattering as they proceed to tap and download everything possible from the app catalog until the fire runs out of space, and YOU have to become a drive space manager. I would prefer to limit my children's choices to something sane like 20-50 options, with my own ability to rotate out content if it becomes old, boring, or lacks quality. Luckily, I found a workaround.<br/><br/>You can restrict content from FreeTime unlimited. However, it has the limitation of only being able to search for specific content to block, or by choosing each thumbnail one by one. When you have 15k thumbnails, we're talking about several days of work to restrict all of the content. Here is my process for restricting all of the content to allow for a clean slate in FreeTime . For three kindle fires, my wife and I were able to block all of the content during the time it took us to watch a cat documentary on Netflix. Your choice of the documentary may vary.<br/><br/>1. First, use smart filters to limit content to the age range for your child.<br/>2. Navigate to the search screen for blocking content from FreeTime unlimited.<br/>3. Search and block using something similar to the following sequence<br/>  - aa, Tap "Block" button<br/>  - ab, Tap "Block" button<br/>  - ac, Tap "Block" button<br/>  - Continue for remainder of alphabet<br/>  - ba, Tap "Block" button<br/>  - bb, Tap "Block" button<br/>  - bc, Tap "Block" button<br/>  - Continue doing this through the c's. You can also search for aa, bb, cc, dd, ee, ff, hh, ?, !, . , etc....<br/>4. After you have blocked enough apps, you'll notice that when you type a single letter like a or b, or c, it will finally display the block button. When you can search through the entire alphabet one letter at a time and have it only display the option to "Unblock" content then you know you are done.<br/>5. Search for the content you actually want your kids to have access to and unblock it.<br/>6. Give the Kindle to your child and enjoy the relief that comes from knowing that your kid has quality content and that they won't run out of storage space.<br/><br/>Hopefully, the devs will allow some way of restricting all content in the future. All we need is a button to do this. It would be so simple.
 Great deal my son loves the games
 Works great. My kid loves it. Its got lots for her to do. I've already had to use the warranty. Oops. Kids are rough. This was worth the money.
 I love the case it has been so helpful and very protective to drops. Children’s mode is great! My children love the apps and how easy it is to download them. The only thing I don’t like has been storage filled up so fast! They had them three days and ran out of memory. They seem to die faster then normal I’m assuming because they keep downloading things and hoping it gets better when they are not adding more stuff all the time.
 Great product, love being able to set time limits and monitor what our son does. Only downside is camera quality, not very good. His old leaf frog took better photos. Otherwise we recommend it.
 My daughter loves it. And I love all the parental controls to keep her from getting on the internet minus educational websites. Awesome for parents to keep an eye on kids!!
 It's a great tablet for kids. It comes with Amazon free time which allows the user to play with a whole lot of apps that would generally cost money on other tablets. It's very loud though and didn't take my toddler two seconds to figure out how to turn it up louder. All in all, amazing product and I plan to stick to this brand of tablets in the future. highly recommend for kids!!
 Easy for the the child whom this was purchased for. and the blue cover makes it easier for him NOT to drop it but does protect the tablet when he has dropped it.
 My daughter loves it . It’s easy for me to set up for her and holds a charge a very long time even with streaming Netflix. For the price it’s above expectations.
 Very happy with these. I bought 2 of them for my 6 and 4 year old. Long battery life, easy to use, and durable. I love that they are linked up to my Prime Account. It makes it so easy to watch movies and things.
 Wonderful tablet. Bought for my 3 yr old granddaughter and she loves it. Preprogrammed with so many fun and educational choices. Very Durable. Highly recommended
 My son has. Had it for just a month and already it was freezing up . Not impressed
 We’ve had this for a year now. It’s not perfect, but it does work really well and comes with a great warranty (which we haven’t needed to use). We use it mostly for reading, but being able to download videos for long flights and long car rides for my 3yo and 4yo have been a sanity saver.
 I bought this for my 5 year old so I could get my iPad back. It works great, very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend. It works just as good as my iPad if not better! Only downside is the one game he loves can't be downloaded onto it but it's not a big deal.<br/><br/>We also bought the HD 8 for my daughter and have had nothing but problems with hers. Goes back to factory setting everytime we turn it bsck on so we have to do the set up process over and over again.
 My sister purchased two tablets for my two sons for Christmas this year and now neither will hold a charge. The tablet that is worse than the other in this problem was barely used. I had really been looking forward to my boys being able to enjoy these while on a long trip, but obviously was not the case. Due to this issue I would not recommend purchasing.
 This tablet didn'tr last very long when the battery wouldn't charge anymore. Very disappointed.
 Yes I am very satisfied !!  My granddaughter loves the tablet and uses it everyday !!  Had a problem with the unit recharging and warranty was honored and unit replaced !!
 I should have listened to other reviewers. After only a couple months the charging port no longer worked. After spending hours on the phone with customer service, they finally authorized sending it in for repair.  It worked again for about a week after getting it back, before once again it would no longer charge or even turn on while plugged in.  Do not waste your time or money.
 My kids LOVE it. The downside, however, is that it dies in less than two days without being used. When it is used, it lasts less than that.
 It has a great protective case, and great screen quality. The things I dont like; it's a little hard to use, not 100% kid friendly. It's hard to delete pre-programmed apps that you don't want, and there's no way to delete the adult profile and make it strictly a child's.<br/><br/>I like the design and look of the device, the durability of the case, and the quickness for charging.
 Ordered as a replacement for an older version we had.  My 10 year old daughter loves this and uses it constantly.  After about a year, I'm expecting the charging port to go bad.  This seems to be our experience with this tablet, but I just keep replacing it because it keeps my daughter entertained.
 Only kid stuff should be on this but it loaded everything on here that was on my tablet having a hard time getting it off so they will stop running out of storage space
 Works great! I love the parental controls. Still trying to figure out how to manage the space. Our kid is addicted to it!
 Bought two less then a year ago. Both of them you can't charge anymore. The port is messed up. Do not buy.
 Cute design, however it is not kid friendly at all. I understand the concept, just needs to be simplified in regards to having to put in a code every time to unlock it or even having to help my son with the power button or volume control...
 I purchased 2of these for my grandchildren for Christmas, and they absolutely love them, and best of all, they're still working.
 This tablet is the best thing for my 2 year old grandson. He plays with it every day. It is very sturdy and he has thrown it several times. Very good buy!
 My son only has educational games shows and disney movies on this tablet. It seems to support them all very well and easy for him to manage it. (I mean me with limiting his screen time)
 This device can seriously take some punches. Got Netflix and loaded it with bunch of cartoons it kept my toddler entertained during travel.<br/>Would love to see more made with bigger internal memory.<br/>Cons: Some advance gestures to be included to bring up the options menu to prevent toddlers accessing it.
 My daughter loves her tablet. It takes a while to xharge but other than that its WONDERFUL.
 My granddaughter loves her kids kindle and she’s very careful with it! I do wish for kids it would<br/>Come with the tempered glass shield for extra protection!
 Giving it 5 stars because I love that I'm able to use it too! My son loves biting the case lol gets a lot of use from my nephew when he visits.
 Great battery life, decent picture, the storage is so so and we will have to expand but that's expected with only 16gb. Easy to navigate freetime for my three year old. My only serious complaint is that my little needs to be on my profile for Netflix or Minecraft.
 I love it, to an extent. It is great and easy for her to use. I don't like how it shows them all the apps then they have to download them, wish it didn't show the kids what isn't downloaded. Then it deleted EVERYTHING off of my child's profile! I fixed it but still. A toddlers teacher calling you because it's play time and she can't work the tablet!
 Not to say it's bad. But I bought this so my toddler could watch YouTube kids. Unfortunately that app isn't available on Amazon's app store. Now it's just collecting dust on my nightstand. I think older children able to navigate it on their own would probably enjoy it more.
 Shouldn't be broken after 4 months. Won't charge anymore. Use known good cords. Will update rating with service.  Other than durability, a great safe device for my youngyin
 The biggest issue with Kindle devices is with charging. I've owned approx 8 different Kindles and they've all eventually has issues with holding a charge or charging at all. Luckily, this tablet came with a 2 year warranty so it's being replaced. My children love their Kindle Tablets especially when we travel!
 My handicap daughter loves this tablet. However now the touch screen doesnt work and I dont know how to return it for a replacement.
 Kids edition? No. It is a tablet with a kid proof case. There is not enough download security to give this to a child. They can easily download any app free or for a cost. There is no separate window specific to kids which has always been helpful in the past with other tablets. Got this about an hour ago and returning it after this review...
 I like how you can put a lock screen password so my kids cannot go into the Internet and try to purchase any apps that I don't approve off. Get tablet for kids they really enjoy their tablets when it's play time. I love how I get emails from the apps my kids are downloading into their tablets.
 My son love it. N me too as i have  better control of what n when my son plays with it
 Why one star?  Because a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.  A shame, because so many of the links are wonderful.
 Battery dies fast, a bit glitchy, don’t like it much. Should have bought a iPad for my kid.
 This was a gift for my grandson and he LOVES IT !!!  So many educational things for him to learn, and his favorite characters are all right at his finger tips. Super fast service
 Gave it to my daughter (4)  yesterday for Christmas, we love it so far. I love that you can download video to use when not connected. Only thing I really dislike it there is no way to organize the home screen. Downloaded apps/books/videos are all mixed in with recommendations which I don’t like. Other than that, it’s great!
 I bought this for my nephew for Christmas and it is a hit! As long as you have general computer skills, you can configure profiles and parental controls with ease. Comes with a trial of unlimited games and shows, and is capable of adding any apps from the app store like a regular tablet. My nephew loves the educational games and read along ebooks. Highly recommend!
 The quality of these devises is pretty dismal. The are slow and usability is not good when dealing with multiple devices in the same household
 The battery dies really fast and takes a long time to charge. You can download some kid apps on another device and be just fine
 So far so good with my 2-1/2 yr old grandson.  Hope we don’t have the issue with the charging port as many other buyers did
 Worked well and less than a year old it no longer charges.  Not sure how to turn in for warranty.
 When the battery is low, functions start acting up and freezing.
 The kids love these which is why we bought 2 more!
 I have a hard time navigating this product and I am an adult. The kids you tube is terrible compared to you tube on the iPad. iPad is much more kid friendly. This kindle is super confusing and I have to constanly help my kids with it. Even my oldest who is 7 has a hard time with it.
 I took advantage of the promotion and bought the yellow and pink combination for my two daughters. There were no technical issues and setup was very easy.
 Bought for my 2 year old son as a way to keep him happy in the car during road trips.  Works great!!  He loves all the apps choices, I love that I can limit his time on it.  I also love that I was able to add all digital movies we have to his tablet.  I suggest buying a fairly good size micro sd card to go with it because 16 GB fills up fast!
 I honestly hate these tablets I bought.  They do not compare to the Samsung Galaxy Tab e Lite that I purchased for my twin grandsons last year. The constant codes that I have to enter is very confusing I've contacted Amazon already about the charges on my debit card Unfortunately they was supposed to be blocked where only I had access to it. As of Monday there was another charge on my card from Amazon that I DID NOT PURCHASE.
 Kids love them and saves us on trips. One died but they shipped is another one.
 Affordable fun for the kids. I love the parental controls. Kids range from 0-12
 Great tablet for kids! Bought for my toddler to watch movies on and it makes car rides so much easier! Fairly long battery life and tons of apps to entertain for hours. Only down side is the storage space. Not sure if it's compatible with an SD card, but if so, I'd highly recommend it!
 My son loves his tablet. Hes used it daily for the past 6 months. No real issues to report. I do have to go into the settings every once in a while to clear the data cache but other than that its very durable and very easy to use.
 Good product, but don't expect iPad quality for this price. It has glitches and issues, but for our three year old, it's totally fine.
 This is my daughter's 3rd Fire Tablet. The first 2 were not the Kid's Edition one, which I regret because the warranty is shorter on the regular ones. Therefore, I had to keep buying new ones each time we had a problem. This time, I was smart...AND it comes in the box with the case! No problems so far!
 My daughter is in love with this and it has taught her so many things, the games are so much fun ONLY problem is she wants to play nonstop lol great learning games THANKS
 This tablet was the greatest gift we ever bought our daughter. She calls it her own iPad :) Many many great games for her to play and lots of books for her to look at also. If your looking for a cheaper alternative to an iPad,  this is it. And the case that came with it is super sturdy, for any age child.
 This might have been a bad purchase because my son won’t put the tablet down since he got it.  It is a great tablet for games and a good value for kids especially since he broke two other devices in a matter of a month.  Love the protection plan is included for the kids.  I actually don’t find the interface very user friendly.  It doesn’t navigate as well as an android or iPhone.
 Great but missing one thing. I really needs you tube for kids app. I know its a google product but Amazon you should be more concerned about the experience not google on this one. Got the best tablet , can’t install the best kids app, I just don’t get it.
 Ordered these for Christmas for my grand babies and they love them. Now their parents can keep theirs safe.
 My daughter got this for Christmas and loves it. She is able to play games, read books, watch videos and listen to music. I love the Free Time that allows her to have access to age appropriate content without the worry of her getting into inappropriate things. She discovers new things every time she uses it. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable tablet.
 broke after three months of use.  Can't figure out how to contact Amazon. Where is the 1-800 number?! SO ANNOYED! GARBAGE!
 My toddler loves her new "book"! I love that she can't access the Internet without approval and I don't have to stress over her trying to download unknown apps that aren't even close to child appropriate.
 I bought this for three little boys for Christmas, one is a one year old and the others are two. They absolutely love it as do their parents. The parental controls and the age appropriate games and videos are perfect! The soft sides on the tablet are perfect for little hands. No more dead phone batteries while keeping the little ones entertained.
 It's kind of slow compared to other budget tablets we've had. We live outside USA, so the area restrictions make the video selection very small. I wish they did more to solve that problem. Also, the headphones jack is not very good - sometimes it works, sometimes not.
 Second time i have purchased this tablet. Already having issues with the charging. Love the tablet and the free year subscription they give you but the charging port keeps loosening. Other than that it is a great tablet!
 this tablet is very slow and does not hold much its okay for my 5 and 2 yr old but sometimes they get a lil upset at how slow it gets
 I have a 18 month old. So, far it has held up quite nice. As when he gets bored he gives it a toss. Only thing I don't like is his access on YouTube. He watches certain kids videos that don't seem to show up on his profile. Nor can you search for them on his profile.
 Ordered two of these for my girls. (5 and 8). They love them.. and I love the freetime app that gives them there own profiles and let's me decide what apps and movies they can watch. This is the best "kids tablet" I have found.
 Glitches. Used Amazon support with no help. Our 2 year old can easily get out of apps, and then gets frustrated because he can no longer play. Unable to download movies or apps without internet access. Waste of money, just collecting dust now.
 Purchased this for my son. It is extremely light and easy for him to use. He loves it!!
 It took more than 5 hours to set up user profile. Payment information is mandatory. Not able to child profile. I had a call with customer care than one hour to solve issues. Please do not purchase this product
 Bought for 2 year old grandson who constantly tried to take 4 year old sister's away!  Now they fight over his, lol!
 Got my daughters tablet both tablet blue and pink
 Bought for my granddaughter! It works well. I like the protection of the case
 Don't forget to purchase a SD card for additional storage. Bought this for my kids it's fast and dose not glitch. Happy with my purchase.
 Purchased in Dec 2017. Tablet stopped charging in February 2018. My baby barely got any use from his biggest Xmas gift before it stopped working. Extremely disappointed.
 Wasnt sure about it at first, bought for my 2 yo. He loves it, so far it has held up to my destructive monster. Alot of age appropriate games and apps.
 Got this for my grand daughters games and books and they love it.  Plenty of storage and easy to use plus sturdy enough to handle the abuse from kids in a hurry.
 I guess I should have looked a little harder at it before buying, but I bought it to use with specific apps/uses in mind and the apps aren't available without jailbreaking and voiding all of the warranties.  Until you have it in your hands, there's no indication that would be the case.  I'm stuck with an expensive paperweight now.
 This product is unreliable and they aren't able to return it due to their return policy ending after a month of purchase. Both that I got have not worked for months. Say they are full and no storage is available even though I put a memory cards in both. They won't connect to WiFi. Do your self a favor spend more money and go with a Samsung from Best buy.
 I love that this has just kid friendly apps.  Does get tricky if auto signs off daughters log in snd into mine.  Over sll great purchase for littles.
 Just like most of the comments, my son’s tablet has broken. The charging port is faulty. It lasted about a year. My son is 5, always super careful with it. He only uses it with my supervision. Now I’m having to try and contact them to get it replaced and deal with a very sad little boy. I would look for a different tablet if your looking at getting this one.
 This poor thing pooped out three days into use.  First it turned itself off and wouldn’t turn back on.  When we finally got it working again, it froze in the middle of a game app and we couldn’t do anything with it.  I put it aside and I think it finally just shut off when the battery ran out.  A shame, because I didn’t purchase any kind of warranty with it :(
 Very low storage space and constant connectivity problems however my biggest issue is that after about 6 months maybe less they stopped working and trying to return them for the "worry free replacement guarantee" has been like running through a maze, no one can seem to help me but I think they're just trying to run out the warranty timeframe so they're no longer liable...
 Dont buy.  Worked fine for about 4 months and started to turn off by itself.  Called the tech support and I was asked many many questions.  Wasted 2 hours over the phone trying a fix.  Not to mention that when you buy on line it says exchange with "No Questions Asked".<br/>Finally obtained an authorization for an exchange after 2 hours over the phone.  Misleading advertisement.  Do not buy!!
 So far my kids like it. At first as a parent it can get a little frustrated to set the settings the way you want it for your kids, but you just have to play with it.
 I bought this product for my three year old. We have to drive 3hrs every Monday And the whole trip used to be screaming. Now I can give her this and she can play her downloaded games and has a great time. This product has helped me to reclaim some of my sanity.
 I bought this for my 2 year old granddaughter. It is loaded with appropriate applications.  She loves it.
 This tablet is amazing! My 3 year old LOVES it. And it's virtually indestructible with the case. After a little over a year, he finally managed to cracked the screen and we contacted Amazon Customer Service and they were fantastic! Immediately sent us a new one, no questions, to arrive the next day! Definitely love this product and the 2-year worry free warrantee!
 Great way to control your kids access and content. The rubber like case with the large bumper edges are very good at protecting the tablet. I only wish it had a stand of some sort. There is as lot you can learn about the process of content adding to what comes loaded. If you are on off line use a lot, you can down load to the tablet. But you will need the sd card. We didn't get it and we are purging content to add something they want.
 We purchased this for our 4 year old.  It is one of his favorite gifts.  It makes car rides much more enjoyable.  It came packed with games, movies, and books.  I have not had to make additional purchases and many of the features work without wifi.  We've been very pleased with this product.
 This is a very good tablet for the price. The screen isn't hd but it doesn't look bad. The included kids content and no questions asked warranty are worth it in my eyes. Our older daughter has had an original model for over 2 years and we have had no issues with it even after abuse by a 5 and 2 year old. If this model is as good I will be very happy.
 Works great for our 3 year old.  There are a lot of game options and learning apps
 4 month after i got it didnt want to turn on. I called amazon, they didnt help. It had guaranty for a year but it was useless becauae they didn't  take it to fix it.
 2nd one. 1st stopped taking a charge after 1 week of use. 2nd one stopped taking taking a charge 4 months later. Return policy states it cannot be replaced.
 As always love the kids fire tablet. This is the second one I've bought, one for my daughter and one for my son, and they're great. Love them. And love the 2 year guarantee.
 The tablet was working great then one day it would not connect to the wi-fi. After doing extensive research this seems to be an on going problem with some and all having a different resolution. My fix was to turn on the guest on my router connected and the problem resolved.
 My 6 year old loves this tablet! It’s great that she can’t get into anything I do not authorize. I ordered a tablet for myself and for and found out that I could sync her account to my tablet. So if hers is ever forgotten when we are out, she has access to all of her apps (on her account) on my tablet! That was an awesome plus from buying 2 tablets.
 Perfect for my Grandson. I love that it came with a rubber case to keep his kindle from breaking if he drop it. I love it.
 I purchased 4 in Dec 2018 as gifts. One never worked from inception and this 2nd one has a screen that turned orange today like it’s going out. The yellow one keeps disconnecting from the internet and is freezing up. The blue one is still functional but probably because that grandchild only uses it every other weekend instead of daily.
 I like it for the price. It's fot a lot of setting to adjust to your kid but you need to be connected to the internet for a lot of things.
 I bought this during prime day for my 2 year old. I guess the price was good for what i purchased but, I would rather spend a little more for a better product.  I felt like it ran slowly, was difficult for my child to operate and, I couldn't download apps that I wanted for him beacuse they were not afilliated with Amazon. I will be returning.
 It will be two months since the tablet was returned for a replacement . Still haven't got a repaired or replacement back. I'm very disappointed . This is not what Amazon promised in their pitch for this product. Would not recommend . My grandson would have enjoyed having his tablet back during the summer and is still asking where it is. Shame on you for your false advertisement.
 My son is only 2 and he absolutely loved this.  His profile allows him to watch and play games that are fitting for his age. Amazon freetime is awesome!  The protective case is great also, great product,  highly recommended<br/> I did however buy screen protectors that were suggested and they didn't fit properly,  just read more carefully to ensure you purchase the correct ones.
 Would like to have had more apps that don't require a wifi connection or have the ability to connect to a cellphone carrier.
 My grandson loves loves loves this tablet. It occupies him for hours. Money well spent
 Tablet was fine other than the mix up with YouTube. My daughter watches her gymnastics videos on that app and not having it was defeating the purpose of my purchase so for that reason I had to send it back.
 I liked the durability of the kids Kindle the most .<br/>And I love that it has accessories I can add to later down the road .
 We got the bundle of 2 for the granddaughters and my daughter loved them so much after setting up, she wants one for herself "so much stuff on there."
 Overall great. Works as anticipated. I however don’t understand why they make them will so little memory that they can’t handle a dozen kids programs.
 It’s just ok. Hard to figure out. Still havent really used it because of this.
 My grandson can bypass the pin code and get on to the Kindle. He is only five.  Trying to figure what he does to bypass it to go to my name.
 Has great content for a 5 year old, with two modes that allows full use of the tablet for an adult, and lots of easy to navigate content for a 5 yr old. Including videos,movies, and games. The case is easy for little hands to hold and protects it from falls.  The only issue is the battery life, if your watching videos don't stray far from the charger.
 Absolute trash. Forced to use only amazon stuff. Can’t use YouTube kids or Netflix kids. Misleading and deceptive. Disappointed in amazon. Don’t buy.
 This tablet is fun for my grandson, the problem is that it won't activate without my Amazon account information. He bought several thing before I got the restrictions on it. I am still getting charges though.
 Christmas present for my 4 year old great granddaughter.. Needless to say I'm a hero!
 While it is an excellent product, an improvement would be to manufacture it with a larger battery.  That being said it is still an excellent product at an excellent Price.
 Amazon messes up AGAIN My sons tablet was BLUE BUT THEY RETURN ME A PINK ONE! I’m so pissed and it’s his birthday 😞
 We love this tablet. So easy for my 4 year old to use and strong enough to hold up to her!
 This tablet is nothing but amazing! Can handle anything my daughter throws at it. She throws it sometimes. Pours milk or whatever else on it and it doesn't even phase it. The kids case really helps that is on it.
 Stopped working right after the return period closed. It will not charge. Was good when it did work. Had lots of apps for kids. Was a bit slow with reaction time when selecting apps to open.
 Love this tablet! Our daughter had one for over a year and then we got this newer one and both were great! She learns so much on her own from the apps!!!
 We purchased this for our 2yr old grandson and he loves it. The tablet is well built and easy for him to use plus comes with a replacement warranty if broken. This is a nice product..
 My daughter loved it and the customer service team when the usb port stopped charging due to i think the cord being pushed to far i was very quick to replace since we had the no questions asked warrenty.
 I've had this since Christmas. My mom bought it for my 3 year old son. I love that there is a parental lock. He mostly watches kids videos and every once in awhile he will play a game. He loves his tablet. There are 2 profiles. Yours and your child's. I'm not sure if you can set up more than that. I personally haven't tried it out on my profile yet. Our biggest concern was to find a kid friendly tablet and so far he loves this one.
 Works great, my son loves it and it helps me to be able to do other things while hes distracted and watching his show! Recommend to parents!!!
 My son loves his tablet. It's easy for him to navigate and tough enough to take a lot of falls with out breaking.
 My 3 year old loves this, has a lot of great learning games for him to choose from. Only thing I don't like is it seems to freeze up quite a bit and if I uninstall a game, he's able to turn around and install it right back. Other than that cheap enough for a small child to have and not worry about breaking. Have had it about 6 months or so now and not a scratch on it.
 My two year old is obsessed with her tablet! We purchased it for the holidays, and it has been nothing short of amazing. It has such a wide selection of games, videos, and books, so she could watch it for hours if I allowed her to. It is very straight-forward and simple to use and also has the same “adult” features as the regular amazon fire when it is on the administrative profile.
 My Granddaughters are able to enjoy the freedom<br/>Of this user friendly tablet with awesome graphics and so many options. The problem is it was a year old 2/19/2019 and now will not take a charge and the return window is now closed . So the tablet cannot be used
 While I think we may have gotten it too early for our 1 year old son, I love the apps and shows on there available to him. He loves listening to the iHeart Radio and dancing to the kid friendly tunes and watching Baby Shark. I'm sure in the coming months he will get more use out of it.
 Loved it at first now it’s been almost a month and it will not hold a charge
 Dont by this tablet. After the first year it locks you out off all the kidds content even free stuff previously downloaded unless you buy the subscription to free time. No downloading of free games like on ipads or other tablet app stores. Biggest pain. Call amazon and they literally said it’s pretty much worthless without the subscription.
 After less then 10 months of us the unit refuses to charge. otherwise was a good tablet , for the price.
 Brought for my son's 1st brithday. It came super fast. It is definitely durable! It is easy to theater off my wifi from my phone. Came as described.  I did buy a memory card for it as well.
 The tablet is great for my son (except I don't like giving it to him often as I find his mood changes for the worse after being on it) but the battery doesn't even last a day. Even if I have it turned off, the battery will be dead when I turn it back on. Very frustrating
 I would not recommend at this point. I bought two in their black Friday deal, my boys received at Christmas time.  Lasted a month and now neither of them will charge. The ONLY good thing about it, is that they replace. Just an inconvience
 Daughter loves it. Pretty amazing product! We love it and it has lots of features that she enjoys to play with.
 This tablet is just phenomenal. The yellow case is so bright and Beautiful good for a neutral color. The tablet itself works so fast as long as you don't download a ton of games but even then it stores plenty. Thank you Amazon and thank you for making it so easy to use the warranty I paid for. Amazon really is a great place to order from !
 I am exceedingly happy with it and so is my son. I also got the blue for his brother and the pink for his sister. I find it very simply to use, the parent controls are elaborate enabling me to control just about everything they do. (They are 4, 4, and 5) My only complaint is simple and frivolous, I wish they had a wider selection of colors for the protective case. So I could have gotten all three their favorite colors. But that aside we love them.
 I gave it to my granddaughter for Christmas, it has a lot of things for children to enjoy!!
 Won't hold a charger AGAIN!  This is the second one of these I got because I like the software on it and so does my child but it's just JUNK.  I put something over the hole were the charging port is this time when it wasnt charging (because they said sometimes kids shove stuff in them" and the same thing happen and it can't be replaces.  We're both sooo disappointed.
 Very frustrating!!!! I bought 2 kids tablets for my kids. Worst product I ever bought! Would be really interested who the heck in the R&amp;D Department decided that downloaded kids video content from the Amazon Prime Membership is only accessible in the parent mode and not in the kids mode! So stupid! Not even worth 1 star!
 I bought three of these for my kids and we LOVE them! The parent dashboard amazon offers is completely worth it.
 disappointed that it ties to your amazon acct and allows children to purchase apps, yes there is the password setting but then it needs to be entered for different changes like switch to kids mode. Also had to reset 3 times since receiving it a month ago due to freezing and acting wonky
 My son loved his tablet (it was recently stolen). The sound on it is great, long batter life, he can play his games or watch youtube. He can read books on there as well as watch movies. The only downside is the storage space. It fills up very fast and you have to go in and delete things they arent using/dont need. Other than that its a great tablet for kids. Adults can even use it as well.
 This tablet has been perfect for our 5-year-old son.  It's so versatile and durable too.  On one occasion we were travelling and my husband absent-mindedly shut the lid for the trunk of our car on the kindle and it was completely undamaged!  The two year warranty is definitely a big bonus too.
 Bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. I am very happy that it has a great battery life and recharges quickly. Very easy to set up and use.
 Bought this for my one year old. He loves it. Keeps him entertained plus love the free time it comes with for a year. Nice touch!
 This is much better than the fire a few years ago. The case is the best part. Its thick and foamy.  The game has been great also. I bought two on prime day And very pleased. My 12 year old son plays his and my 6 year old daughter.
 My son got this for christmas. He LOVES it. I wish it had a screen protector. But over all very happy!
 Absolutely love it. I have 2 of them for my son now. One for my house and one for my parents house for him to use when he stays there.
 Purchased this for my daughters fourth birthday. She loves it. It has so many books and learning games.
 This is 3rd of Amazon tablet. It's still same as like previous products like frozen screen and slow.<br/>My girls are so frustrated  it.<br/>They are still young so, I dont want to buy expensive one, so bought these but, I did bad decision.
 GREAT PRODUCT! My kids loved their Fire Tablets -- so many apps, and games! No issues at all -- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED :)
 We received this as a christmas gift for our six year old ...it has helped tremendously with his reading and math practice.
 They aren't that bad. The screen sensitivity isn't that well for certain games. But most importantly i wish i would've known you cant download youtube or youtube kids.
 I ordered this for my 5 year old grandson. He was using my Fire and proved that he was ready for one of his own. He previously had a $30 tablet that broke very quickly - should have expected it to fail and it did. Very happy with the quality of the product. Very happy with the case. Game selection is wonderful.
 My son had inherited one that was several years old. He switched to my Kindle because it could do more. Not child friendly. I got it on Prime Day. New features and ease of use are worth it. He's not even 2 yet. So worth it and glad I got it. Kid tablets get updated every year like cellphones. I noticed a huge difference.
 My soon-to-be-two-year-old grandson loves this and has stopped changing all the settings on my phone or writing on my tablet screen! I love how I can see it grow with him for years to come, and how it bounces when he drops it on the floor.
 I have 2 kids and ordered one for each. One works amazing havent had an issue and the other keep crashing and takes for ever to download anything. Plus it dont want to charge half the time. Im qorking with IT to try to replace it
 My son loves his tablet and the case that it came with. I like the warranty that it comes with to give you peace of mind because kids are rough on things!!
 This thing does toooo fast. My son would watch a 1 hour movie from a full battery by the end of the movie the battery is at 3%. Possibly gone return it’s no point.  This thing lives on the charger
 Do not buy these tablets!!! Don't waste your money or time! I bought four of them for my granddaughters for Christmas.Two of them have already quit working. When the quit working you have to spend hours on the phone trying to get a replacement. The worry free,no questions asked warranty is a complete joke!!!! Nothing but problems! I will never buy this crap from Amazon again. You are warned!!
 I'm very disappointed. I bought this for my son and within an hr its dying after being at 100%. My other children's fire's last a couple days. And now it won't charge orr turn on.
 I bought this product last year Christmas for my grand daughter, becuase shes always on her aunt fone playing games an stuff, so when i saw this product i taught it woud be nice for her to use, unfortunately i taught wrong, the product stop working the second month in this year, i was very disappoint so i would not recommen anyone to even take the risk of buying this product.
 My almost 2  year old daughter got this as a gift for Christmas so it hasn't been used long but it has already met our expectations! It's case is proven to do it's job lol! And the apps are perfect for her! She's already learned so many new things! I also love the parental controls it has on it! The battery holds up well also! Very satisfied!
 Both my children love these for last 18 months. They have washed and ruined and dropped and cracked screen numerous times. When amazon says 2 year no ?s asked warranty they mean it. Have replaced at least 6 times and fast
 bought this as a gift for my granddaughter. she really isnt using it yet. she is only one
 I bought two of these for gifts, extremely difficult to set up, and it continuously turns off and changes screens, very disappointed!
 I gave this away as a gift , and Amazon shipped the tablet with all my info loaded and link to my amazon account. That means its was link to my Payment option. I never  authorize this !
 This Kindle is perfect for my 3yr old. I love that I have control over content and time allowed on the device. The case is light and perfect for little hands.
 Could be better, should really play without WiFi since is for kids. Really slow response when swapping between apps. But was cheap and is only for a 2yr old.
 So far no problems with it. I love how it’s set up for the kids to play. Love all the free apps and I also love how it gives our kids a time to be on it.
 After a year the charging port stopped working completely. After reading multiple reviews, it's sad to see I'm not the only one with this issue
 3 year old grand daughter loves it. He parents pick her games that are instructional. Has really made learning fun for her.
 No worry guarantee is great.  You get a new one sent within 5 days of them getting the damaged one.
 If you're used to having a snappy device, do not purchase this.  It takes about 5-10 seconds each time you touch something for the device to even respond.  This is the difference between a $350 ipad and a $75 tablet.<br/><br/>It's better to just save your money and purchase something that will save your time!!!
 This is a good tablet when it works, however the quality is extremely low. We bought 2 of these for our grandchildren and have had to repair them twice due to failure to charge.  Amazon was good about repairing them, but twice in 2 years is very poor quality.
 My kids love these tablets! So much to do on them. The "kid proof case" has protected them so far 5 months, that says a lot, they have been through 2 other tablets each lasting about 1-2 months. So we are impressed with these and would definitely recommend to family and friends!
 I bought this for my 7 year old for Christmas and really wanted to love it.....but it is so slow!! If I’m frustrated just stetting it up there is no way she will have the patience to use this tablet.  It looks like it would have a lot of fun content on it but it took forever to get anything to load and open! Really disappointed!
 Received 2 days early and my daughter loves it. Perfect for car rides and to keep her busy while for a little while. The color is a nice, bright pink. The image is very clear. The speaker is loud enough for my daughter. Easy to install the apps and I think she will get the hang of it pretty soon.
 We bought this for our sons 3rd birthday and he absolutely loves it! It has tons of books, games, movies, TV shows and apps. We downloaded Netflix for when we’re home and added books and games to his device for when we’re in the car without WiFi. He’s in love with playing sonic :)  Great gift for our little guy!
 Not a good purchase. Doesn’t hold a charge. Will not buy again. Very disappointed.
 Painfully slow. Kids attention span lost interest before things could load up. Returned.
 The tablet starts up pretty slow but has alot of options. Amazon should provide a data service for us so we can manage our purchase in one place.
 kids loved their tablets - great quality, nice packaging. Good delivery service.
 Was a gift and she loved it. Kind of sllw.but good enoigh.for a 4yr olx
 Should've read the reviews. Can't get the thing to charge and it's not registered to my account so I can't even do the warranty process to get replacement..... irritating. Should've stuck with a Samsung tablet at this rate. I have only owned this one year and my daughter used it for Netflix that was it. More wear and tear I would understand the issue but this had
 Honestly, they were kind of hard to set up and figure out. I'm 23 years old. Technology is not new to me, but this was making me pretty frustrated.  The case does seem to be pretty sturdy though.
 Broke in 9 months.  It just randomly disconnects from internet and won't run any apps except videos but ONLY during the times it stays connected to wifi.
 My two kids received this for Christmas from their grandma. It was the best thing ever. It's so kid friendly and there is so much they can do on it, but with your limits to it. Totally worth the $$ and the subscription. They are also very heavy dutty so they take the abuse from the kids dropping them and all that, the protective cases are also wonderful. Would recommend to anyone thinking about purchasing.
 This product is amazing! I have a 3 year old and the only thing I need to do for her is turn it on. Everything came pre-loaded and it is easy enough for her to navigate herself! I love the extra protection of the case and warranty the Kindle comes with! Wonderful product and I would recommend to anyone with children ages 2 and older!!!
 We bought this for our son quite a while ago but only gave it to him a few months ago for Christmas. In just a few months it won't hold a charge. The battery will only last a couple hours at best. Then we struggle to get it charged because even though we have used countless different chargers, we have a hard time getting one to stay plugged in.
 Got this for my 4 year old son.  He loves it.  Works great, entertains him on long car trips, and has held up remarkably well to the abuse a 4 year old can dole out on an electronic device.
 This product is fine for home WiFi usage. But freetime is not available offline and any movies you download, only work for 24hrs then have to be downloaded again. Definitely not worth it for Car or plane rides for younger kids.
 Although these products seem very good for toddlers, any child that likes Netflix or YouTube will not enjoy these. The parental controls are impossible to work around to add desired websites. We returned ours.
 The set up was simple, I still haven't figured out how to change some things on it but my son doesn't seem to mind. I bought this for a 2 1/2 year old so far its been durable!
 I bought this for my almost 3 year old to play educational games and watch Netflix, we love everything about it EXCEPT that there’s no way to lock out the touch option on th screen like on an iPad. She hasn’t quite grasped the concept of not touching the screen randomly and often pauses or otherwise disturbes what she’s watching/playing.
 Great durability, but most importantly holds a good battery life
 My baby loves her kindle! I wish the battery lasted for longer though and the case stains very easily.
 Bought this for my elderly father. Very good. A little complex but am figuring out. Charging is a little touchy. Like the cover making it easy for him to hold.
 I love the no hassle warranty and the case they provided, I shouldn't need to use the warranty.  it is made very well and works as described, however it is pretty slow and they need to make more kids show episodes more easily available.  it is has been very entertaining to my daughter.  She loves her Goldie and Bear cartoons!!
 If i could give it 0 stars I would. Piece of junk do not purchase. Cheap quality and the 2 year warranty is fake advertising. I purchased the tablet 11/10/2017 and it's been broken for MONTHS now. I attempted to contact amazon customer service and was given horrible service. Its literally a piece of junk in my drawer. Save your money.
 I should have read the reviews before buying. It takes forever for anything to load on this, the battery drops tremendously after barely using, and freezes constantly. Do not buy this- get an iPad instead!!
 This tablet has been amazing! I love that they cant go to the internet on their own, and that they have all their apps and videos in their own profile. I also love that the tablet can have multiple profiles. My girls love this tablet!
 My kids love them. The number one thing is that they stop charger after about a year. I have 3 of then and each one is a pain in the ass to charge. You have to wrap the cord around it and get it just right to try to charge it. It sucks! I hope the warranty will cover this cause it hasn't even been 2 years yet.
 My daughter (8) loves this. Only complaint is the lame charger port. This is tablet # 2 so far and I fear this one will die for the same reason. It has a tight port and plugging it in is a bit of a finagle. If they made it more child friendly to plug in (I currently charge it to try to elongate it's lifespan) I'd give it more stars.
 Now I can keep my iPhone out of the little ones hands. Well almost, if they haven’t left the tablet at home.  And I don’t have to wonder how did this or that game get on my phone...
 My 6 year old daughter loves this thing! She can read, watch netflix, play learning games, youtube, take pictures and so much more, all with limitations and restrictions i can set on it such as times and time limits being on it. Recommend
 Almost a year old and the case has protected this awesome tablet from constant abuse. Parental controls are great. Buy an SD card for more storage.
 We got this as a gift for my son. Less than a year later we had issues and thankfully it was still under the warranty. Customer service,after getting to the correct person, was helpful. We ended up needed a new kindle. This new one so far has been working just fine. My son loves the games and activities on it. I like that you can set a parental timing control so that it shuts off after whatever hours/minutes you set it to.
 Seems sturdy, case comes in handy, kid friendly and safe as far as what your child has access to. However, unable to use outside of home without being connected to WiFi. I purchased it for travel and it’s useless for that purpose. Can’t download movies onto the device. Also no instructions. Its all online. But if you’re not connected, useless.
 Purchased this tablet for our 3 1/2 yr old Grandson to watch his Elmo, Paw Patrol and Pete the Cat on instead of asking for our expensive phones. Lol<br/>It's perfect and he loves it. The case included in my purchase is awesome for a young child if they should drop it. Protects the tablet very well.<br/>And the bonus is he can grow with this tablet. Very good purchase!
 Received this product with plenty of time to spare. My niece is going to love it!
 I got this for my son's 3rd birthday and he has literally learned almost all his colors and numbers in 2 weeks. He's on the autistic spectrum and so far this is the only thing that's been able to handle this attention long enough to learn anything.
 This is a great Tablet for children ....my 4 year old son loves. It can take a beating to, I HIGHLY recommend buying it with the foam case.
 My grand kids loved the new tablets. Maybe a little too much. We had to set time limits because they have so many apps to use.
 big hit with my 3 year old, easy to use, good parent controls
 My 4 year old son loves this thing. We took a long drive across the country and this kept him busy in the car.
 I bought this for my 4 year old grandson and he is totally loving it he plays his games and keeps him occupied and sometimes I have to make him get off of it to do some activities outside but other than that he loves it it is amazing for the young kids and even my 8 year old has one of these and he loves his too I am very satisfied
 Works Great! Had an issue with charging port and returned the original. No problems! Amazon returns was great and my daughter is happy.  Win, wun!
 Very slow. I was okay with it initially because it was replacing my toddlers asus tablet. I figured it would be fine with it. However, she soon became frustrated with it as the lag time was not what she was use to. I’ve now replaced it with the Samsung E.
 Bought this for my 2 year old she loves it watches Netflix on it everyday the only thing is I wish it would keep charges after 5 hrs it’s dead
 That the tablet continues to have issues charging. Amazon replaced the first one and we continue to have the same problem. Either it is a common thing for these tablets which customers should know before purchasing or it is a sub-standard product which should be removed. Not certain if I can get Mymoney back but please choose another product.
 Problem is after a year you have to pay 4.99 a month for the subscriptions. When you add $60 a year to the price tablet costs about $1,000<br/>No thanks
 Exactly what I was looking for in a kid friendly tablet. The setup is easy to use and laid out so simply a child could use it.
 Has so many great apps, videos and books to choose from both my girls have one and are in totally different age groups and they both LOVE it!  There is such an array for every age group! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it takes FOREVER TO CHARGE
 Multiple kids in the family now have kindle fires and they each have caught on very quickly. It's surprising what toddlers know these days!
 My 2 yr old grandson loves his tablet.  He broke the screen on the first one, however, Amazon replaced it without question.  The Apps on the tablet are very good learning Apps for all kids ages.  Great purchase !!!  Definitely recommend it.
 Great buy!  bought one in pink and 1 in blue for grandkids.  Love that I am able to set up time limits for educational, reading, apps, movies, etc.
 Good tablet option for our 3 year old. It keeps updating which I'm wondering if that's normal... but hoping this one lasts longer than our previous one.
 Tablet is very very slow,  also you are going to need to buy a memory card because you won’t be able to load any games with out running out of space and when I say games I mean 1 game .  Just feels like it’s out dated technology.  I bought it for my 5yr old and it’s not that easy to use.  Very very slow processor.  Buy an IPad,  trust me.
 My son loves this, it should have better battery though but as a primeday deal it was worth it
 Love this tablet for my 4 year old Amazon free time and the warranty is a plus and it's pretty fast.. she loves it we love it..
 Bought for my grandson a year ago. Purchased another one for my granddaughter and she is quite happy as am I!
 Super slow and  had a hard time keeping a wifi connection. Overall it's an OK tablet to watch videos and play certain games
 Both of my Nieces love the Kindle and there are alot of free apps for them to download, this unit also takes pics and video so they love that feature.I have one for my 2 year old son and he loves it.
 The free time subscription is only thing worth while. The tablet doesn’t hold a charge no matter what I do. Your better off buying a Samsung tablet or an iPad. Really disappointed.
 This was the slowest crappieat piece of technology I’ve ever used in my LIFE! Couldn’t send it back fast enough. If u have ever used an IOS devise then don’t even bother with this. Not user friendly and slow as an elephant rising on a turtle. Android aka AndDont
 My 3 year old son has not put this tablet down since he opened his birthday present tonight and keeps saying thank you and love you mommy .He loves it!!! I'm so glad I payed the extra money for the fire kids edition. Worth every penny.
 Only charged 1st time and that was it. Now battery stays at 4% even if you leave it on the charger for 24hours. Very disappointed
 great tablet, amazing features and tons of apps on it. I would recommend this to anyone with littles in their house.
 This tablet is perfect! Durable and backed by an excellent warrantee. My 8 year old son no longer wants to use the family, laptop he is very content on his personal tablet. Good job Amazon!
 Just bought a pair of new Fire kids edition tablets. Has been an extremely frustrating experience trying to set it up.<br/> Have been completely unable to add access to websites to my kids profiles despite following the instructions.<br/>After spending an unsuccessful half an hour on the phone with customer support, the customer support guy finally just told me that this was a "known issue" without any outlook on a fix or any recourse ..
 The case is tough and stood up to my son's rough play but the Kindle stopped charging and can't get the screen to function
 Bought for my 2 year old grandson for Christmas and to this day he carries it everywhere. Keeps him busy at home and on long trips!! If it can withstand a 2 year old, it’s definitely worth it!
 We bought this tablet for our 18 month old worried it would be too much since she’s so young but it’s perfect! It saves us because she hates car rides! 5 stars all around!
 Birthday gift for my daughter. She loves it and all the built in games/ apps are great.
 It's a great tablet and my child enjoys it.  My only complaint is that the battery takes forever to charge.
 👍This is a nice reasonable priced. Works well and nice loves it
 Over the moon with this product.<br/>My 1 and 4 year old daughter love their new tablet! It hasnt been set down once since it arrived. It came with Amazon free time which has an abundance of games, book, and shows to choose from! Lets not forget to mention the case  was very durable and this has already been dropped plenty so its a must.
 My daughter loves it. She is 2 and i don't have to worry about her getting on sites she fires not belong in. I highly suggest to any parent
 Being a name brand product I had higher expectations. It is a little glitchy and the kids apps fail pretty frequently. My daughter still loves it and I use it occasionally as well.
 This is a GREAT tablet for children! My daughter has dropped it on the floor a few times (she’s two), no cracks on the screen. There’s tons of free apps you can download to educate the little ones or to just keep them occupied in the car
 My son hasn't put this down since he received it for Christmas. Very durable (it has already been dropped a couple of times) and easy to manage parental controls and content.
 Excellent product with great preloaded content. I just wish you had the option to lock the screen to keep toddler’s curious fingers from changing videos when you don’t want them to (i.e. long drives)
 I bought this for my son. It's ok it's a little  Difficult to navigate through the apps in profiles and adding apps to the child's profile is a little difficult  Adding common  Apps doesn't really allow you to add like VUDU
 Thankfully this comes with a two-year warranty otherwise It would be garbage as much as it cost, I have returned at least 10 of these all of it having to do with charging, amazon has never given me a problem with returning it but keep in mind you buy a new one but you get a refurbished one.
 This thing is amazingggg. Got it for my daughter for Christmas. INDISTRUCTABLE AND EASY TO CLEAN. Battery isn't THAT long lasting for road trips so make sure to have a car charger.
 my grandson loves this - I loaded a couple games - puzzles...reading materials - I recommend this for your small child - he is 4 and loves it
 Incredibly slow. This tablet is seriously horrible so far only 2 stars because it has a very kid friendly case
 My sister and I purchased two of these for our sons.. These are perfect! Love how they cannot get out of the kid zone and it has so many cool games, books and videos.<br/>My son loves to watch videos, before this he would get on youtube and even with it being blocked for inappropriate content I still didn't trust it.<br/>Also comes with a great case for 4/3 year olds.
 Nice screen and great idea for kids however it is very slow on everything.
 works great. all the features keep my kid busy. Very happy about the warranty.
 Good tablets. Our kids use them everyday and are pretty rough on them. I love the parent dashboard, so useful.
 My 3 year old has had her for 2years.  It been dropped, stepped on thrown and it still works.  She really loves her tablet.  If she in the car keeps her busy for at least an hour.
 Like every Kindle my family has ever purchased, this one quit taking a charge. However this one petered out on us in 3 short months. Beware, the product replacement is not a true product replacement. It's a "we will try to repair it, then if it isn't repairable we will replace". Otherwise you get your same wonky device back. Gee, thanks Amazon. Stop making cheap parts already.
 We had Kids Fire 7s for our daughters and got one for our 3 year old. He does great with it.
 Brought this Kindle for my granddaughters in sept.. It quit charging after 3.5 months, called customer service told them the problem and within 5 minutes I had a shipping label.. My Granddaughters love it so much I'm thinking about ordering another one so they each will have their own.. I'm very satisfied with the Kindle and the  great Customer Service..
 I would recommend this product to anyone who has children! It is very user friendly and the apps are all safe for kids. There is so much educational content on this tablet! For new parents who don't really know what is out there for the kids in learning apps this is a great tool to find the things your child likes and excels at. Also very durable... like thrown down a flight of stairs with no damage done... durable! 😄
 Great buy! My daughter is two and we got her the Fire 7 Kids Edition Tablet for Christmas... She is very destructive and when she throws this tablet around, it just bounces instead of shattering like other ones. It has everything that she needs and it has great apps for kids. I would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone looking to purchase one for a child.
 I dont like that it works mainly only in wifi but my kid likes it
 It works great!!! my daughter loves it she haven't put it down since she got it
 You need to put a credit card on the tablet to do anything, even for free stuff. Also, the price for this kids tablet was more than a regular Fire 7 tablet. Also I thought being a Kids edition, it would have plenty of pre-loaded game and stuff on it. It's just a regular tablet with a rubber case on it, that's it.
 Sturdy but the screen format is not that easy to use.
 Ordered this for my 4 year old grandson for Christmas. The only time he puts it down is when he is sleep or at school.
 Absolutely love this product for my toddler! It’s super kid friendly and easy for him to navigate on his own! LOVE the warranty that if it breaks it can be replaced right away. Hands down best purchase I’ve made.
 I like the size of the this tablet,  Quality is good, haven't had any issues so far, What i didn't like is that the case that it comes with does not have a stand, other than that its a great tablet, seems durable, my girl has dropped it many times and have not have any issues with it yet.
 This is the 2nd fire tablet I bought for my son and while its durable physically, and can withstand falling and being knocked around, it's not that dependable.  Just like the first tablet, this second one that I purchased in August of this year, just wont charge using the original charger or a phone charger. I dont get it! It hasn't even been 4 months yet!!!!!!!
 My 5 year olds love it! We don't have wifi but we update when we get to a wifi spot and they can care less with all the games they have!
 Love this tablet! Indestructible! Great for kids of any age. My son LOVES it!
 Bought 2 of these. They work well but the battery does not last that long. Seems like it's always drained.
 My grand children love these! I like the fact that you set up their profile and only age appropriate apps so show up! I do not like the fact that they have each other’s profile on both kindles because they’re on my account, and they can switch profiles but can not play their apps.
 Works great, protects them from annoying risks associated with playing on my phone or tablet.
 This has gotten so much use! I love it! The case is durable too
 My daughter loves this tablet, we’ve had it for about 8 months now and have had no issues yet. My favorite feature is having the ability to set a time limit per day that my daughter can use the tablet. I have also set the tablet up to make her read on the e-reader for 30 mins everyday before she is able to access and games or videos.
 Good for kids as in setting limits and the stuff they can see and play with. However it's extremely slow and you absolutely need to buy a micro SD card. Its really just an OK kind of tablet. The best part about it is the restrictions you can set.
 Bought the magenta and the yellow colors. My girls love them! Keeps my girls occupied.
 The battery/charging port has now died the second time with the second device. The warranty doesn't carry over so when 2 years is up from the first one they won't replace it. I wouldn't recommend when the same issue has happened twice and customer service doesn't do anything about it but offer 15% off.
 Great tablet , had for almost 1.5 years and has worked great. However it is no longer charging. It was supossed to come with a 2 year warranty so trying to find out how to return?
 The warranty service was great!  I sent my daughter’s broken kindle fire and got a new one within a week.
 The Kindle is great and my 2 year old son likes it, but now all the sudden it won't connect to my wifi in the house so we can use the books or any app that requires internet. Not sure how to fix it.
 This is great as long as your kid isn’t used to apple products already. This takes longer to load. Great for kids and love the fact that it can be dropped. My son loves it but if an apple product is in reach he will reach for it first.
 Can't wait to give it to my grandson for Christmas. He really loves mine and I will be happy to get it back.
 This is the best tablet for a kid and I will be buying again. This is Great
 Great product.  I purchased it in order to have access to the one year unlimited freetime for my child. Unfortunately, I am unable to access what was advertise due to where I live.  So purchase a regular kids tablet if you live outside of the United States.
 Love, love, love this tablet! I wanted something with parental controls to help limit my 5 year olds screen time. This tablet allows me to set daily limits for movie time, reading time, app time...even has a wake up and bed time for general timer.<br/>It's very easy for him to navigate and figure out without needing too much help.
 Bought for my two year old son, he's had it for a couple months and it's still going strong. Love the case and it holds a charge great.
 We own 4 of these tablets for our kids. They work great and the warranty is fabulous. The kids programming on it is great! I couldn't ask for more on a kids tablet
 Going to be Christmas presents. Opened them up and set them up but kids won’t get them for a while. Great quality and easy to set up.
 my 1.5 year old loves it. appreciate it amazon.
 Excellent for children perfect for them to focus on what is necessary to learn and grow
 I love this for my three year old she has so many games and video that keeps her busy for hours. I also love that it is educational for her. This is her second on the first one she broke. I am so happy it came with two year worry free.
 Not easy to use for kids. Unable to download google play to kids profile. OK for adult use though.
 This was a donation for a Christmas charity that for foster children; since this was a requested item, I am sure it was greatly appreciated.
 Must buy! Got two of these, one in blue and one in yellow, for both of my sons 5 &amp; 3. Great buy for these guys.
 These serve the purpose for my two- and five-year-old, but I am disappointed in the hoops I have to jump through to access the Google Play store to get apps that I have already paid for.
 Love this!  This is our second one.  The case is amazing.  Customer support was very nice and easy to work with when we had a problem.
 this tablet worked well, while it worked. it was purchased in February and stopped working/unable to charge  in April.<br/>In order to have warranty service you have to call Amazon and go thru several people until you reach the tech warranty dept. They asked that we mail back the tablet for them to examine and once they have finished they will contact us to let us know if its fixable.
 Terribly slow garbage. UI and workflow are so bad.  Nothing makes any logical sense. Just go with Android or iPad.
 This tablet didn't last 3 months. It just stopped charging. That's the third time I bought this type of tablet but this one just wasn't good.
 First one dies on standby in less than a day. It's 3 weeks old and honestly, hardly gets used. I tried to replace it under the no questions asked warranty and got asked a BUNCH of questions and transferred 3 times in the process. If it were older than 3 weeks or my kid threw it in the toilet, I might be willing to trouble shoot, but based on time of ownership and amount of use, I don't have the patience to deal with this nonsense. This isn't rocket science, send return label, replace product, end of story. Amazon is failing on so many levels and it starts with the faulty product followed by the TERRIBLE customer service. Save your money and buy the non-kids Kindle. The warranty means nothing.
 Omg I love this little tablet for my son.
 My kids throw, stand on them, get them filthy and they always make it to the other side. Battery life and charging speed are the only things that keep this from 5 stars. And the free time app for the younger ones is great. Both of my kids at 1 could work it almost flawlessly.
 Kids love have 2, only issue is one dosent charge correctly as my kid crams the charger plug in wrong .
 love that this one is set up for kids only. my older son has more freedom with his kids tablet, but this works for my younger one with the kid setting. so very happy he now can watch movies etc when driving around and at the doc. i did add a SD memory card to both my kids tablets so they could download movies etc
 I bought my son and my neice this tablet. They both loved it. My sons 1st one stopped charging I sent it back and it was replaced. Then my neices stopped charging and a few days after that my sons 2nd tablet stopped charging. Obviously this is a huge issue. I'm currently requesting a refund on both and will purchase something else.
 This was a gift for our 7 year old granddaughter. She loves it. Her parents do put limits on its usage, which is fine with me.
 2 year old twins love these keeps them occupied for hours and leaves Mother's phone alone
 This is our third brand of child-friendly tablet. We've had it about a month or two. After a couple weeks it ran out of memory. We bought a sd card and with a couple weeks it's low on memory again. Other than that, I'd say it works about average compared to other tablets.
 The apps are great and easily accessible. My 3 year old is very happy with it and I see growth potential as he learns with the apps. The gripper case is excellent and very durable. My son has dropped it off his bunk bed and it didn't even phase it. The battery life is a little less than I thought it would be, but he runs a lot of games and movies on it, so it seems understandable.
 My grandson LOVED this Fire 7 ... for about 4 weeks, then it stopped charging.  We tried EVERYTHING.  We wiggled the cords and placed the cords ... ended up buying new cords ... still wouldn't work.  So ... 2 stars!
 It's not a worry free warranty. Was on the phone with people for over 45 min to tell them it wouldn't charge anymore and they kept transfering me to another person in which that person tried doing the same trouble shooting as the last. They said if they can fix it they will and send it back to us. Well the first person said the warranty states we would get a new one.
 My son loves his tablet. And thankful for the rubber case.
 Our 3 year old granddaughter loves this tablet.  Very sturdy - which is a must with rowdy toddlers :)
 Absolutely terrible. We used it for 2 days and the charger port in the tablet was broken wouldn’t charge I spent 30 dollars on new chargers to try and see if it would work and nothing.
 I love this tablet. I purchased it for my 18 month old and he loves it. I even catch my older kids using it when he is not looking. Definitely a great buy. I think I am going to buy another one for my teenager that loves the games already installed in the tablet.
 It’s good quality. I’m used to the iPad and I find it slower then the iPad but it’s great for my 3 year old who broke my iPad even in a protective “kids” case
 This is the second Fire tablet I've purchased for my grandson.  He and I love it and Amazon.
 It’s perfect. I had free time already from another fire tablet and with this one i received a year of free time for free with purchase (the action was automatic). It survives falls and sticky kids hands 😁
 Work as advertised. Very durable and has survived my son's drooling and even standing on it. I found myself playing some of the kiddie games.
 This is an excellent tablet for young kids, very durable. They stand by the commitment of replacing if you have a problem. Highly recommend this product. Love the different colored cases.
 Like the setup. Kids like it. My son loves to use the camera but on this fire it’s not so great. If you use the camera a lot don’t get. Getting a year of free play is very cool!
 I couldn't be happier with this tablet, that I purchased for my grandsons.
 It's great my eight year old grandson Loves it
 Great tablet for small children. Has ability to be used for adults also. Great apps available.
 Within three months of owning this, the battery stopped charging and we could not turn it on. We sent it in since it was under warrantee and we had it repaired, and it stopped working again within a week. We are sending it an again, but we are not very hopeful. This was very frustrating, and certainly disappointing for our son.
 Bought it for my 4 year old granddaughter.  She loves it.  Lots of learning apps.  Also love that it already had the protective yellow case on it.
 Arrived early. It was very easy and quick to set up. My kids are very happy.
 I bought this for my grandson. I have owned several Fire tablets and loved them all.
 Got this for my son for his 3rd birthday and after almost a year we have never had a problem with it. I did buy an extra SD card for more storage. The screen got broken and amazon was quick to replace the device with no issues!
 Fantastic for my kids! I feel that they are safe on this kid friendly device and I love that I control the settings.
 Perfect for my 2 year old! Purschased as a Christmas gift and he uses it everyday. I love the parental control features. I notice the battery dies rather quickly and it does take a while to charge but overall it’s an excellent purchase especially for the price.
 It was a Christmas gift but by early February the. Charger would no longer charge. Had to send it back. Daughter is heart broken.
 The battery is HORRIBLE. It lasts less than a day and takes forever to charge. I'm disappointed because I am such an Amazon product fan. Huge disappointment!
 Super kid friendly, only had it a week so far but my 18 month old has slammed it to the group a couple times and it's holding up fine! Expensive!
 Like always, worked perfectly, already had everything set up, and I love the warranty!
 I only had this tablet for 4 days and now it has completely stopped working. I have turned it off and turned it back on numerous of times and I am only getting a blank stream.  And on top of that it does not have YouTube kids one of the main reasons for me purchasing this.. sorry but I would not recommend this tablet to anyone.
 After a while u will have to get another game or another fire seven. It acts weird after a few months
 Anyone willing to provide a two year no fault warranty on something my two-year old uses is okay in my book.
 It is just good, it is difficult to manage the tablet for kids, I have delete some games that I don't want my kids to continue playing but they still appear ,i have try deleting them from the cloud ,from the device, it seems it is a bug in the software
 My three year old daughter loves this tablet! Plenty of kid friendly apps preloaded on it. The kid proof case is great too! I don't worry so much about her dropping it with the case on it. Happy with the purchase and good price!
 So far so good loving it my son will be 2 in feb and he loves. its been dropped a few times and still kicking
 Bought it 3 years for my daughter. Still works great. Lasts a very long time and kid friendly.
 Not what I expected .... the tablet doesn’t last a day the battery drains way faster than my iPads do. As far as what’s on it and FreeTime it’s awesome!
 My son loves this tablet &amp; the 2yr worry free replacement is the best!!
 Came on time, Perfect condition, no complaints... especially from my 8yr old, daughter. She loves it, does the educational apps and assignments, plays her games, watches movies and YouTube. All in all very happy buy for us, and at a little over $100... you can't beat that... Oh and it comes connected to you amazon acct, but your kids can't order anything, so they get all the benefits of your amazon prime, movie and tv acct. Hope this helps y'all.
 My baby is 18 months old, and she loves her freetime apps so much!!! She’s learning sight words, counting and even engages in the appisode games! Awesome for kids!
 Why would you not have a way to put music on the child profile?  Tablet keeps dropping WiFi.
 I am certainly pleased. Yes there are more powerful tablets but the price for the tablet, apps and case is unbeatable. I have a 5 and 6 year old and each have a tablet.  It is very kid friendly right out of the box and I would recommend it again and again. Additionally, my parent account is accessible from both tablets easily.
 I love that I can put a curfew on these makes it prefect for my toddler that lays down to videos
 I bought two tablets and I have to tell you they are Lifesavers! They keep my grandsons entertained which means less havoc on my nerves! LOL!
 I bought 3 of these kids fire tablets. One each for my 9,7, and 2 year old kids. My kids love them. They're easy to use and when you enter the sex and age of each kid, it suggests different age appropriate apps, making it easier on you! My 2 yr old has dropped his tablet and thrown it down and it's still going strong. Parental controls are easy to use. I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase!
 The product works well. Easy to download games, puzzles, etc. The shell is great protection against drops and occasionally throws by our 2 year old. I highly recommend this product.
 Kindles are still crap. They must put 128mb of the cheapest ram they can find in these. Even my kids get frustrated waiting for these to respond to any type of user input. I bought 2, and just like all the kindles prior, they are best used for a portable clock. One of the 2 I purchased no longer charges or turns on
 I am very disappointed in this product. While it’s great to be able to set a parent control, the apps do not work. The apps do not open, even after going through the troubleshooting tips. My child has barely gotten to use this product. It’s not worth buying and I wish I would have not gotten it.
 My kids love them! I love that I can set how long they can play and what they can play! Great for my 4 &amp; 3 year old
 I got this for my Daughter for Christmas and she loves it! The parental settings are great and very personalized. Plus it comes with a year of Free Amazon kid Prime so it makes setting up and downloading really easy! Definitely recommend
 Slow, hard to navigate as pages take minutes to load, awful to set up, and currently still loading a page so my child can use anything, at this point he can't as everything is blank/blue, and won't load. I currently own a $100 paperweight.
 I love this; my boy's love it. I'm sad bc I sat on it and broke in 😣. But it has been dropped so many times and been fine.
 My daughter loves it.  But I had to update it many times for it to work.  It's inexplicably reset itself to factory defaults twice (requiring me to re-do the updates again - prob a 35+ min procedure).  Now it's very finicky about getting recharged.  So the pain factor on this product is pretty high.
 I like the sturdiness as my grandson is only 5. What we aren't as thrilled with is that some of the things/learning games don't have good instructions of how to play the game. We are adjusting. My grandson really likes the painting/marker section as we practice his printing of his name with different colors
 I love that it has a lot of storage but I definitely Don't want to pay a monthly fee for something that is already Supposed to be for kids. I'm not paying the monthly fee so its too hard for my son to run himself, too many pages and too many things for him to click on. The only reason we kept it was because of the amount of storage so we could download movies and it comes with a kids case on it.
 2 weeks after the one year warranty is up and my son's kindle will no longer charge.  We tried four different chargers on different outlets, nothing works. Now I have a very upset child that his Kindle doesn't work. I'm not willing to spend that much money again on a product that only lasts a year.
 My oldest children have the original kindle for children and this one is a lot better in terms of extra memory and ease of use. I deducted one star because when I registered this kindle to my account Amazon erased my other children's free time accounts.
 My granddaughters are thrilled with them. I purchased two.
 kids can use this to play online games and learning their school work
 I love it..I bought it for my grandkids. When they come to see granny they have something to play
 Our 5 yo picked up easily on how to use it. My only complaint is that he can't read and there is no audiobook option for the children's profile.
 My grand daughter who is 3 seems to like it very much.  It's easy to Navigate in general although it's hard for her to choose her account when turning it on.<br/>The only thing it could have used is a stand so it is helpful to view the shows instead of holding it up.
 It's very light and flexible...i really like that.  The open spaces for toggle buttons are perfect.  My Grandson is 4 years old and he took to the tablet and case like butter on hot toast.  Happy..and Thank You for Asking.
 Purchased for my Autistic daughter and with all the app choices shes in heaven! I only wished it had more memory to begin with. A lot of apps given but have to purchase more memory to really enjoy to its fullest capability.
 Loved it for a while. Fills up quckly. The charging port is unreliable and when you call to have it fixed they have you on the phone for an hour and hang up without calling back.
 Tablet will not work with earbud for some tablet a key board is hard to use
 Seems to be a great little tablet.  Love how sturdy it is.
 Ordered 2 love them... my grand daughter is going to be so happy on Christmas day.
 My girls love their new tablets. I love them because I didn't have to go download a bunch of apps for them to use, it was already preloaded with age appropriate apps.  The only thing I can't figure out is how to default to their login and not my login??
 Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. She plays her games all day long. This tablet is better then the last one I bought her.
 Its not too bad but I wish I would have just bought an ipad for my child.  Not enough storage for the items required to even rug the tablet and it lags a lot.  I do love the amount of books it has but what is the point if you can’t download them because of the storage.  Camera is not that great either.
 Very slow!! Samsung Kids lite tablet is better!!
 I have several tablets, and multiple people using them at my home. I purchased this one to get the children off the iPads. We found this tablets software difficult to use. After 3 days it stopped working. Reuurned it and was charged a restocking fee after their product was defective. Did not order another one!
 Perfect for my son, he has a little bit of issues of breaking his tablet so the blue bumper is perfect for those the bumps. It has everything he needs to enjoy using it
 third one  three grandsons  so I have three different colors which is great  they just love them
 Great for my daughter still learning how to use it but it’s nice
 These are very cool and kid friendly but it takes so long to download anything. I was on the phone with product support (amazingly helpful and thorough) for an hour and they kept re-setting stuff and it’s still quite slow even if I free up all the storage. Just keeps circling even with strong WiFi connection.
 I have purchased 4 tablets thus far, they are perfect for my little nieces and nephews!
 I enjoy this because of the cover to protect it as well as how I can control it as an adult and view what they get on and put a time limit on it daily.
 Cant wait to give to my daughter. Pricing was awesome and it came super quick!!
 My 16mo old granddaughter is giving it a complete test. It's already been on the floor several times. So far, so good! Love the guarantee!
 I love this thing. Its easy to use and set up for my three year old. Only thing is i cant seem to find youtube kids so she is stuck using the regular YouTube app and i dont think its very safe. But other than that, this thing is great!
 My daughter loves her tablet and already has a ton of spelling/word apps (she loves word games) that help make learning more fun. battery life is fair
 This is very difficult for a four year old I mean it’s complicated it’s a device that a parent would still have to be hands on with and I want my child to work it independently with very little monitoring
 What I like most is that my 4 yr old granddaughter's can easily understand how to work most of the apps. I also like that adults also have to entered act with the child.  Only thing I didn't like that the main screen was first. I wish that free time was the main screen
 Love that I can download games and shows for them to play when were in the car and don't have Wi-Fi, however i have 2 complaints. Storage size and battery life. Invest in an sd card if they want to play or download more than 15 games. Also battery life isnt the best. Dies around lunch if I've charged it all day. Maybe my boys just play too much. Lol other than that great tablet for kids. Easy to navigate.
 After using avid reviewing the product, I've found that a quite a few complaints deal with charging problems, seem to be caused by user misuse, tugging and pulling, pushing wiggling the power cord when plugging and unplugging the cord and not doing it properly, doing this breaks the wire in the cord or the solderinside the tablet at the connection
 Got it as a Christmas gift for my son. Loves it! The kids mode is awesome and the case it comes is perfect for a toddler. Thanks amazon
 My issue is a complaint about the parental features. I really like the user friendly format for my child on his kids profile and I really like that I can have a separate profile for myself to go into and set up all the parental controls and restrictions. The thing that is pushing me to hate this kids Kindle is that when I try to add content to my sons profile, I'm not allowed to. No matter what I as the parent decides to be appropriate for my child, amazon has decided to do ALL of the parenting for me. Biggest issue for this is that in order for me to allow my son to use the netflix app on his own child profile within netflix, I had to open up his age from 6 to 14 just to allow that app. Why do I have to bombard him with free time content that is more appropriate for a pre-teen just so he can watch Lego Ninjago after chores? My son absolutely loves music and dancing. I decided to add certain videos to his web access from youtube so he can listen to songs and learn the dance moves. I understand that the youtube app is restricted because amazon app store does not have the kids youtube app as an option to download and youtube itself is known for its repeated adult content in unwanted areas. But why can't I choose whatever video I decide to be appropriate? I have the option of allowing specific videos except it seems that instead of me being the parent, amazon has decided that THEY are ultimately the parent because even I am not allowed to make that parenting choice. Just about every single video I try to add is already pre blocked and not allowed to be added. We're not talking about risque Nicky Minaj music videos here, were talking about kids bop. Yeah, thats right, kids bop music videos from the official kids bop youtube page are ALL restricted. My sons age is opened up as far as it can be for content. I have removed any and all restrictions for everything I can in thr parental control oftions and yet I STILL can't add kids bop for him???! What gives amazon! This kindle seemed like a great purchase for my son but now I think it was a waste of money. I should have just gotten him an ipad and kept an eye on him the old school way. Smh.
 Hands down best tablet for kids ... so many parental controls that I feel safe they won't get into something I don't want them in.
 Love it and so does my daughter. You can time the time they spend and it’s easy to use and navigate. The cover is the best because it’s very thick and resistant to falls. It come with lots of free games and activities for kids.
 Never worked right. Tried to return when it completely stopped working. But it was a week after the close date so they won’t take it.
 My daughter loves it! For parents,you can set a timer for kids and it works great because my daughter gets to watch/play on it an hour a day so not on it all the time 😁
 Kids love it.  Very easy to use.  Cover is very light.  Kids are 4 and 7
 Serves its purpose. Only issue is the storage is rather small stock - my kids have maxed it out and do not even have that much on it. It is not an Ipad as far as streamlined performance, but more than enough to keep the kids entertained for hours. Some of the kids applications are a little questionable, but that is not the device's fault.
 This is perfect if you are traveling with your kids and don't have Internet. You can download things and it will keep them busy.  The battery last long time.
 It is great for our son he's hard on things but so far so good! Battery doesn't last a really long time but it's a kids tablet I didn't expect much mostly got for bed time and in the car/dr. Appointments. We love it! Love the case as well really a life saver been dropped a few times already.
 My daughter absolutely loves her Kindle fire.  She's five.  It's password protected from downloading apps and she even has a screen lock password, that makes her feel pretty special.
 very easy and the Free time ap is loaded with things to do.
 I bought the tablets for my grand daughter's Christmas gift, and they were a big hit. They are 4 yrs old and 18 months.  The learning games, books, and camera are great for the 4 year old.  The 18 month old loves the videos and a few games. The fleece headband earphones were a great add-on to the purchase.
 My daughter loves her tablet. It’s easy for her to work.
 My kids love it! My daughter 3 and son Is 2 so I bought the bundle deal to save an extra $50 ... love how it comes with a case alrdy
 This was a great Christmas gift for my toddler. It’s a perfect size and she can check out what she wants with my parental control settings.
 Does not function properly freezes and acting up
 My son loved his fire and was always using it but after only 2 months the charging port stopped working. Any charger even a brand new one didn’t work. Wiggling it didn’t work, it didn’t even recognize there was a charger in the port.
 Was bought as a gift for my granddaughter and she loved it and we have trouble getting her to part with it.
 Maybe a defective tablet but it stopped working after only 2 weeks of use. Also had a much shorter battery charge time compared to two other fire tablets that I have.
 My granddaughter was absolutely thrilled with this tablet.  She immediately started using it.  She is 8 years old and loves to read.
 It’s not the best tablet ours have shut off for two days and then finally turn back on it takes forever to load and it freezes a lot
 So entertaining and great for road trips! My little guy is 3 and figured it out quickly.
 Just wish it had Bluetooth. Other than that it's a great device for my 3 year old!
 I purchased this Tablet as a Christmas present for my grandson. I haven't even opened the package..I will just give it to him on Christmas. Now I see my last return date is November 16, 2018!!! I wouldn't have ordered this had I not known I could return or exchange after Christmas.
 I bought this for my son for Christmas and we LOVE it. The only thing I wish it had is a way to lock the screen while a video is playing because he likes to touch the screen too much and is constantly causing it to stop playing which is a pain for him and I. The case is also awesome. He is a toddler so it has already been chunked across the room a time or two and it is still perfectly fine!
 I've made quite a few purchases though out the Christmas season.  All went well. Except some how I got charged for amazon prime without trying to purchase it. They were nice and said they would refund my money.  That was friday.  Now it's Wednesday.  Still no refund. I'm a single mother of three.  I need that $104 to feed my kids. I didn't sign up for amazon prime and now I can't feed my kids... not ok!
 Wonderful parental controls, and an easy software set up for parents and kids. My only conplaint is that I can't seem to get the kids profiles to work without wifi, which is inconvenient during long car rides. Overall a great purchase.
 This tablet had saved our sanity! It’s perfect we love the kid proof case seems super durable for our 1 1/2 old son who is constantly chewing on it due to teething and throwing it. It’s perfect for him and money well spent. The only reason why I’m giving it 4 stars is because it’s a tad slow.. but everything else is great!
 Can’t go wrong with this tablet!!! Great value and can take a beating!! Very user friendly, my 3 year old has no issues!
 Christmas gifts for my twin grand children.  They love them and my daughter has to limit their time with them.  A win-win!!
 My 3 year old loves the tablet.  I was originally disappointed that she couldn't use YT kids, but there are so many options that she doesn't mind.  The charging cord was done after a month and would no longer work.  It had never been bent or touched by a kid, so include that in your budget.
 Best gift I have ever given. The following year we bought one for my BF's grandson.
 I love all the child friendly features like the parental controls, guided access, and shock absorbant cover. I gave it 2-stars because it is extremely slow at loading anything. My 3-year-old is constantly frustrated with waiting over a minute for apps to start.
 My two year daughter LOVES this.  She needs help with getting to her page but can get in the apps and does, at times, need help navigating to a different app.
 So far so good! My 3 year old loves all the games and he has no problems using it. The case has kept it protected when he has dropped it. And it is worth the money to know that if he does break it they will replace it!
 Had this tablet about 1.5 yrs. Love it. However it stopped charging was not turning on. Amazon customer service was fantastic. Spent time trying to trouble shoot and now working. For such a big company the customer service is fantastic. Have 3 of these tablets in our family.
 Amazing curated content.  The hardware works fine, but the real great thing is the age-appropriate curated content.  Fantastic availability of books, games, and videos.  And it comes with parental controls that govern the amount of screen time, bed time turn-off, etc.
 Easy setup, easy to use! My two yo granddaughter found it easy to use and it kept her engaged for a 15 hour road trip.
 I don’t know if I’ll buy another one of these. It lags a lot. Very slow. Always has been right out of the box.
 It arrived quickly and was actually impressed with all the features it has available how you can set restrictions and requirements as to what must be done first before the child can proceed to other apps and videos.  Love the case too just wish there were more color options.
 I bought one of these for both of my kids for Christmas in 2017. They were amazing. But within in a year they died. They cannot use their tablets without them being plugged in. They die within minutes of use and take almost a full 24 hours to charge. I expected more. This is absolutely unacceptable. I’m very disappointed.
 Purchased for my 4 year old to help him sit quieter in church when he started to fidget.  Works well and as intended.
 Great kids tablet. Very durable for drops. A bonus is that it's also another tablet for us adults if we want it to be. Came with alot of great stuff for the kids, both learning and gaming. We will definitely get another one when our youngest is older.
 I got this for my 2 year old, we dont do screen time very often but when she does she always played with my phone. After loosing my apps a few times i got her this so she could do her own things. So greatful, she caught on fast with it being so user friendly.
 Zero complaints!!! It's perfect for my four year old and she adores it. I love that it had time limits
 My kids love these.<br/>My only problem is they have to download every game they click on and storage space is limited without a memory card/sd card, so they are always getting a message about low storage. I then have to go in and delete everything. Other than that, it's great. Love the time limit, and that they only have access to websites i approve, and their own profile with just the kid stuff!!
 My son loves the tablet and all the apps. However we had to get a replacement because the tablet stopped charging and we are now having the same issue again. Apparently a common issue with the charging port coming loose. Exchange is hassle because they just want to send you the same version kindle but, not preprogrammed to be a kids version.
 Well first of all I paid 99.99 for this 2.5 weeks ago and now 2 weeks later it's 49.99 so not impressed. Second of all, it is SO SLOW!!! I mean we have a couple of baby games downloaded and it takes forever for them to load. Not very happy with this. Contacted the seller last week and NEVER got a response
 So far so good! My daughter loves it and jas learned such in just 1 month! &lt;3
 This is essentially an adult fire w/ a kids case. What makes it a kids tablet is the subscription to Free time, which has excellent parental controlls and currated content by age group.
 Best kids tablet ever. This thing can take a beating I'll tell you. And I love the parental controls it's the perfect fit. And the deal 130$ for 2!!!! Unbeatable I love to keep one on hand incase they crack one BEST PART they send u another one free if it cracks or breaks!!
 This tablet is trash. Literally. I bought this for my 5 yr old for Christmas last year (2017) and after about 6 months it was so slow it’s unusable. I’ve reset, delete apps, etc. - Don’t buy this. It’s a good idea in theory but Amazon can not execute it properly. Much easier and efficient to buy an iPad and put parental restrictions on.
 My son loves his tablet! I love the protective case. He drops it sometimes, and if it weren't for that case it would probably be broken by now. I love the parental controls on it. I can limit the amount of time he gets to be on it, and it automatically will not allow him to play or view anything else. Very good product. Highly recommended.
 My daughters love this tablet. Features I Love are:<br/>parental controls, ability to add multiple profiles, and the drop resistant case. I like that it comes with free downloads on the kids profile. The case is great and really helps with drops. It’s a great alternative to more expensive tablets.
 My daughter loves her tablet! Perfect for someone of her age! Very easy for her to operate! Great first tablet for any kid in the one to four year range!
 We got this tablet for our 3 year old to use for ABC Mouse. It works great for this! The pink protective case is perfect and the tablet itself works excellent.
 OMG it was perfect. Everything about it was exactly as it was. Would definitely buy again for other grandchild when he gets older.
 My oldest loves to play on her tablet when we are somewhere having to wait (like a doctor's office). The games are really easy to load and the case is really good. It's been dropped a ton and looks brand new.
 Purchased for our daughter,  she loves it!  Tons to do right out of the box.
 Very slow comparing to any apple tablets. The shipment took forever as well
 6 year old nephew loves it. I was expecting more low and kid tablet but this is more than I expected.
 Perfect for my toddler. Loaded with great books, already familiar to her from the hard copies owned. Lots of great age-appropriate games and videos.
 Great case for small kids who may drop it. Comes with a free year subscription to download any app, books, games. Can be customized for age and great parental controls. You can even manage the amount of time the child can spend on the device.
 I wish I could get youtube kids and play movies from my iTunes. Otherwise it is great and only freezes up minimally. It is a little difficult for my 3 year old to turn on and to sleep.
 It has legs. My daughter will be able to use this for a long time for learning and recreation. Some apps freeze. Like the protective case. Wifey wishes she could put regular YouTube app on child’s page.
 My daughter has autism. She has been able to navigate through this tablet without help. It is helping learn things that she has had trouble learning as it is made fun for her. I would recommend to anyone with young children or children with a learning disability.
 I can't find a flaw! My daughter got this for her 2nd birthday. She got access to Freetime for a year,  and I already see that we will be renewing her subscription. The games, videos and books are just right for her. And the best part is that all we have to do is change a couple of settings as she grows. Plus, the parental controls are  a Gid-send!
 I bought this as a gift for my godson he loves it and has a lot to be entertained with and so does his mom because she can control what he can do on it.
 My son bought this with a gift card he got for Christmas.  I've been very impressed and pleased with this product.
 This tablet is super sloooowwww, takes fooorrreeeevvvvveeeerrrrr to loooad. Do not recommend, get the 8.
 Great gift for neice/nephew for Christmas. They love playing on it and price is reasonable.
 We had to replace our son's tablet twice because the usb port is horrible.  After a few months, it stops charging.  Even the newer ones have the crappy old usb charging port.  Until they switch to usb-c, I'll pass on having to explain to amazon every 6  months that the charging is not working.
 Honestly this tablet is horrible! My 4 yr old is used to watching educational videos and playing education games. This tablet does not allow you to block games nor will it let you download video. My daughter loves audio book do I figured this would be great because it had many boos to choose from but they are not audio. Now I have a very disappointed 4 yr old.
 My 2 yr old son luvs his tablet. He uses it everyday and everwhere. He plays videos and games. It's really amazing how hr has figured everything out so quickly. Free year of kindle unlimited and 2 yr hassle-free return are excellent bonuses.
 My 4 year old loves her fire tablet! We read stories and play games together on it! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<br/><br/>It does take a while for it to charge ! I thought it was maybe the charger but my sons blue fire tablet take forever too. Other than that it’s perffff!
 Read I could use the apps once downloaded with no wifi. Took it on the airplane for my 2 yr old and internet wasn’t working. Literally could do nothing on the tablet. Wasted my money.
 I recommend buying an SD card for these but other then that we have been very happy with our Kindle Fires! We have one for our 9 and 3 year old.
 Case was fantastic as far as keeping it from getting broken. Had to factory reset it twice, because none of the apps would work, and it stopped charging right after the 2 year mark.
 Wonderful!  Easy enough for a 3 year old to find and watch age appropriate videos.  Love the parental controls.  Tough case!
 Its a cool tablet, My 4 year loves it. I just bought it and the only downside is that when its 100% charged and I take it off the charger until my son gets home from school by this time its down to 86% and wasn't used once off the charger. I don't understand that part but everything else is cool. Thats the only thing that I don't like.
 Fantastic. I love the parental controls. My 11 year old son set these up for me. Lol. I put Netflix and YouTube on it. My 2 year old loves it!
 My daughter did not use it so often, maybe once in a month. 6 months after purchasing, the battery does not charge and took 1 day to be charged.<br/>How can I return it ?<br/>Thank you
 Grand daughter loves it.  Good choice.  Fires seem to be a bit sluggish compared to other Android tablets.
 Product exactly as described, this is the 4th tablet that has been bought between my children. My only complaint is they start off working really fast and well and over time they slow down a lot. They also run out of memory pretty quickly. Overall happy with the product.
 This is my third tablet. Each of my daughters have one and I love them. These cases are amazing. My middle girl threw one in the tub. It luckily landed on the rear side of the case and floated! They've been stepped on and dropped and my first 2 are 2 years old and still working perfectly.
 My daughter loves it. A lot to do so far with the free time that is included. Battery life is very long we don't remember to charge it often.
 This is an AWESOME kids tablet. It comes pre loaded with tons of cool apps that my 5 year old loves. It's very durable, he's dropped it several times and it hasn't slowed down at all. Battery lasts almost ALL day. Very happy with this purchase!!
 I purchased this for my 6yr old daughter and it's been such a huge hit. She loves having a tablet to play on and I love she can't get onto anything inappropriate on the internet. My only regret is not getting the higher storage. She does fill it up quickly with pictures and games.
 Keeps him busy when I'm on my own tablet! Awesome!
 My sons have been using the devices but one stopped charging two weeks back and has already powered off.<br/><br/>We have tried  other chargers to power it on but with no success.<br/><br/>Please advise if we can do a trade-in.<br/>regards Florence
 The charger port does not work...I send it off to get fixed only tobhet the same defective tablet back waste if my money. Sent if off 4 times. This time I'm getting a refund
 My son loves it...it’s everything we where looking for in a tablet for a 5 almost 6 year old and for it to grow with him so we don’t have to keep buying new ones every couple years
 Great tablet for the kids. The fact it comes already in a case is crucial!
 Great Deal, We love the warranty and the games. I tell my kids to only download five at a time and then delete one before downloading another.
 Very disappointed. It always freezes and doesn’t open up apps when you click on it, always a black screen. I would not recommend this tablet.
 Didn't like the proprietary software that came with the tablet.  My daughter loves YouTube kids but that app is not in there store.  I get trying to do your own thing but it should be easier to customize the tablet to my preference.
 I love this tablet. My child is learning, colors, name of shapes,  ABC's,  hygiene, 123's, and never ceases to amaze me. I just wish you guys had YouTube kids available for her that's why it's not 5 stars.
 We purchased this for our 2.5 year old as a present from Santa! He loved it, we loved it as it was a great learning tool! However, as of March 31st after 3 months of usage it will no longer charge! We tried replacement cords and power blocks and still will not charge! So now we are tasked with making the decision of purchasing a replacement one or looking into other options
 This was purchased for a 4 year old and has been a big hit! It has been fairly easy for him to use and the years subdcriptions that came with it give him safe, fun chouces abd give us peace of mind.
 We bought this for our three year old son for Christmas, he loves it.  The games are educational and fun. The protective case is great and has really done it's job as far as protecting the screen. Our only issue is... after three months,  the charging port is now loose, and the tablet won't charge. It would be great if the charging port were a little sturdier for the kids edition.
 I do have 2 of these tablets. The most recent one was purchased about 5 months ago. It had the same charger issue as mentioned in all the negative reviews. I called and spent 25 mins on the phone but the tablet was replaced. 2 day shipping. I’m happy. These are great tablets for kids, let’s be honest, you get what you pay for!
 Just ordered one for my son and it said it would be here in 2 days and now says over a week so goes from 2 days to 10 or more Days after I order it. Not a good buy so far.
 We purchased 2 of these for our daughters and they have been great for them!  I love how they can be set up to only allow them an allotted amount of time on the device and how they cannot access any content that hasn't been approved. I also love that they are able to be accessed by the parents as a regular kindle fire!! I would definitely purchase another if I need to!!
 Idk of its cause I’m an apple user but this table takes forever to load anything and we just barely got it!
 Ma daughter is gonna luv it needed to get her one of her own cause she always had Ma iPad she gonna b so happy is a gift frm her mama n dadddy for Xmas😁🎅🏻🎄....
 My kids love them!!! I don’t have to worry about what they are downloading or watching. I set the  parental control and it doesn’t have a lot of the naughty shows on there that some of the other programs do with parental control. I one thing I don’t like is the charges need to stronger or something. Ours keeps bending and then it’s hard to charge.
 This is a good product to teach your child responsibility and time management. I like the rubber cover. Good quality!
 I absolutely love it. Its sturdy so I’m not worried about it breaking. And programming is awesome
 My 4 year old Grandson loves this! The battery blew up in his old off the wall brand tablet and this replaced it.
 I thought it was for a child. Still trying to figure out to child proof for my grandson
 Easy to install free games for the kids.  Very durable
 This was a very well received Christmas gift! We limit the time allowed on it because the recipient would be on it forever if allowed!
 I ordered two we have only have had them for a about a week but so far we love them!
 Great graphics and sturdy.<br/>Perfect for young kids.
 The picture quality is very poor. And it lags terribly. I mean it is for my child but still. Not what i was expecting.
 Oh my! Grand kids and niece loves it! Great you can set parental controls and how long they are on it! Great Christmas gift!!
 It is ok.  There are too many pop ups for purchases.  The toddlers cannot play independently without interference.  I did put a password for purchases because my preschooler purchased a few apps.  The school age children work it fine though.  Good for the price I guess.
 I purchased 2 Fire 7 Edition tablet as Christmas present for my grandchildren. They love them. Both are enthusiastic readers and I loved the sturdiness of the frame and the protection of accidental breakage. What saddens me is the emphasis of games that is a strong attraction and a distraction from reading. If I realized this I would not have bought thus model
 We have barely used this thing. My son doesn’t play with it or anything. We just use it for road trips so he can watch video. It will not charge any more no matter what charger i use. Very disappointed.
 Exactly what my daughter wanted perfect screen size
 I got this for my daughter for Christmas. She is thrilled! So far no problems. It has a ton of free stuff to do. Great parental controls! So happy with this purchase!
 Parental controls and case are great, but it’s very slow. Takes a while to connect each time you press a button and it becomes so frustrating that my son gives up. Will be going back to the iPad.
 My two year old daughter loves it. She really only watches youtube on it. She does however watch some of the disney appisodes if we are not near wifi. I like the fact that the battery life isnt very long b/c that means i can take it away for a while. However, if you were needing for an older kid or adult, that might be frustrating.
 Love them. Can’t keep my kids off I’d them. Still trying to figure out how to now show my account profile on the kids fire tablets. I worry they may change something or see something or buy something.
 I purchase 2 of these for children to use., They worked ok in the beginning, but then slowed down and wasn't working ok. It was past 30  days so Amazon wouldn't take it back. They do not stand behind their devices.
 Not happy with this product at all. Charger port is loose already and constantly kicks the wifi off and needs resigned in. Very disappointed
 This tablet is great just make sure you do not run to many programs at once or it tends to get slow and laggy
 These tablets are amazing for my two year old twins. My twins are rough on things and the tablets have been up for the test. The tablets came with a two year warranty and a free year of Freetime which my boys love! Amazon Freetime comes with so many educational games which entertain my kids while they learn.
 they are Christmas gifts  for the grand kids, their geeky  dad  picked them out, as what he wanted for  his kids, I'd  consider  that a good  review.
 I GOT THE BLUE ONE LAST YEAR FOR MY 2 YEAR OLD GRANDSON FOR HIS BIRTHDAY AND HIS BROTHER WHO IS NOW 5 WILL NOT LEAVE IT ALONE HE HADS ONE BUT NOT LIKE THIS SO YOU GUESS IT GRANDMA GOT HIM THE YELLOW AND HE LOVES IT
 I bought this tablet for my grandson in January 2018 and it has stopped charging quite mysteriously. Reading all these horrible reviews is even more depressing, since I do not live in the U.S. and having to send it back for refurbished one will certainly not be worth it in the long run…I just wish i had read the reviews before I purchased it...
 It's a good device. The only thing I don't like is I always have clean the device storage frequently because my kids always try to download too much stuff. That is something you can't avoid with any device. You can add an SD card for more storage, but even with that, when you have little ones they will run out of that storage as well.
 three grandchildren now having three fires to serve their independence
 Great tablet, comes with a lot of great games and even my 3 year old's favorite show Daniel Tiger. Sturdy and easy to use.
 Overall my toddlers really enjoy them, durable and the kids apps are great.<br/>Battery life is pretty bad though, I wish we had gotten the nicer one in that regard
 Complete garbage!  Didn’t even last 10 months. Power jack is broke so it won’t charge.
 Quality was not on par with Amazon. Not HD.
 My Son absolutely loves his new Fire, and I especially loves that he can watch his movies and play all his apps without WIFI. Man am I grateful for that!
 Great tablet to have around the house because it can have multiple user profIles with different passwords. My only problem is that it is kind of slow loading the kids apps and the kids get bored and just loose interest.
 worth investment over aftermarket case, i think
 I love the fact of it coming with free time to have over 10,000 options of things for my child to do. I can adjust each profile according to age, shut off at a certain time or even make it to where they have to do "homework" before playing games.
 Compre este producto, por que ya tenia dos mas anteriormente. Me parecian bueno pero esta tablet solo tardo menos de un mes funcionando, y dejo de ensencer. La regrese y ya llevo 3 semanas o un poco mas y no he resivido un reembolso...Las otras dos tablets que tengo funcionan aun. Haci que no estoy setura de recomendarla.
 The case is great for kids! It is easy to navigate. I got a great deal when I bought two and would buy again.
 So far my child has thrown this down the stairs and dropped it mulitple times. None without punishment. But this has held up well. This is perfect for kids of all ages. Thanks.
 Dear seller,<br/>Thank you very much: it made such a nice gift for our daughter!<br/>Natalia.
 Great value for the price and fast delivery
 I got one for my daughter a few months before purchasing this one. I love that it has the Freetime included because that gives me some peace of mind that they are not watching anything bad. The rubber case around the outside of the tablet is a life saver! I will definitely purchase again when we need another one.
 We love the kid friendly content choices and that she gets her own login separate from ours. The parental controls are really easy to set up.
 Works awesome for Kids once you remove the disaster called Amazon Freetime. Beware when you purchase it comes with a 1 year subscription "free" and after 1 year it enrolls you on a monthly fee billed to your amazon account. Aside from this issue, the major problem is they idiotically decided to publish THOUSANDS of apps to the kid's profile. You have to in 1 by 1 through thousands of them to hide them. Otherwise the kid logs in and sees all of them and when they click to open it, it installs (SLOWLY) and requires a wifi connection to download. It also starts filling up the small storage. We installed 64 GB SD cards and un-enrolled from Freetime. now we can pick and choose apps (mostly free) from the amazon store to install and publish to their profile so they have a finite amount to choose from. We then install all of them ahead of time so they are available on or offline when they want them. Lastly we purchase occasional movie from Amazon store which can then be downloaded for offline viewing in their profile. Beware the Prime movies can be downloaded for offline only to the adult profile on the tablet, not the kid's profile. To publish a movie for offline consumption to their profile you must buy it and then it is available to publish to them.
 Christmas gift for 5 yo grandson who loves it
 This did not work out at all. Returned it right away. Certainly not worth 100.00. Better off to buy a tablet and use parental controls. I was so excited for this too.
 I bought this for my daughter for her birthday 🎂 She loves it. I like that it’s kid friendly you get free time for free for the year. The case looks pretty solid. I love the fact that this tablet has 2 year worry free if it breaks they replace it that gives me peace of mind knowing if it breaks it’s not the end of the world for my little girl Thank You Amazon for this great product.
 Lots to do with tablet. Great grandaughter loves it. Hel poo s with their learning.
 The best feature is the protective case. Next is the ease of use. My granddaughter loves it.
 This tablet is very kid friendly, the only down side I have found is my child does not have access to the Prime videos through my Amazon Prime account.  I have to use my adult login which is password protected to allow my child to view Prime.
 I ordered those and now they want hold a charge or let alone even come on. I called last Saturday and talk to someone and they walked me through on how to reset them one of they came on for about an hour but went out again but the other never came on. so now I have two tablets my children can't play with. someone please help me.
 It is a great tablet for a toddler.  My son is 5 and is almost past what it can do in kid mode.  You cannot put Netflix on it.
 We bought this for our almost 2 year old and he LOVES it!! Freetime play is Great and can download apps for him to Watch and play when not around wifi. Definitely recommend this!!
 LOVE!!!  This is a great purchase.  Our daughter loves it - works great in WiFi range and out.  One thing to note - with this deal it only comes with the memory on the device so you DEFINITELY need to get a memory card to go with it to use successfully away from WIFI.  Otherwise, #parentscore !!!!
 It stop charging before having a month with it. I lost my money.
 Can't say much as we are not allowed to have the experience promised as restrictions are placed on a lot of the videos and downloadable stuff. This is I assumed because we are not in the USA!  The child will not enjoy having it. It's the same amounts paid why the restrictions?
 Freezes often, have to restart to continue.
 These are perfect for kids, and I would say that the cushioned service from kindle is the best I've encountered. They are very durable and fun for the kids
 The tablet is over all good and has a lot of great games for the kids. However, what I didn't like is that I wasn't told that the tablet would need an extra memory card to have all of the things that they would like which wasn't many by the way, and then when I got the memory card it still is saying that it has low storage and I'm constantly having to move things onto the chip.
 I SENT THE YELLOW KIDS KINDLE BACK WITH THE PINK ONE-SAME BOX WITH BOTH RETURN LABELS. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOrWHEN I HAVE ALREADY RETURNED IT?
 I bought it for my 4 year old great grand daughter and she loves it there are so many programs and apps that she is just amazed by.
 Great these are full fledge tablets just with a indestructible case and a great warranty behind them. They can easily be used as an everyday tablet, or switch to kids mode, and great for the kids. The warranty on them is awesome.
 The parental controls are the best I've experienced. Even the unlimited stuff can be reviewed to block any item individually. The only thing I wish it would do is allow me to block those items from a computer. Right now you can only block items from the tablet you are using, which is tough because of the screen size and its hundreds of items.
 My granddaughter loves it.
 The tablet was ok. Bought it with a year of free prime. Prime was a pain. Then after purchasing movies they just disappeared from the tablet. Will never purchase  something of this nature with prime on it. Think after you pay for it it should still be available.  Pissed off. What a pain.
 I purchased these tablets for my daughters which were so perfect because they both had their favorite colors. I wasn't in agreements with them being able to make purchases without my consent and they are only 7 and 4 years old. It does not keep a good charge at times I'm not sure if it is the battery or the chargers.
 my granddaughter loves her tablet is easy to use
 I do not like at all it was supposed to have all kids stuff on it for one year and it doesn’t to complicated for my 6 year old he would rather use his iPad and it’s first generation do not recommend
 Can't beat this tablet for a 2 or 3 year old!
 I have 4 kids and they all have their own fire tablet. It is the best technology you can buy. Amazon lets you do monthly payments too. Buy it, dont hesitate.
 As much as my daughter loves her tablet I’m highly disappointed in it. We live in an area where we don’t get good internet access so we don’t have internet and all of the games require internet to play them even after downloading them. One would think with as advanced as amazon/kindle is it wouldn’t need constant WiFi to play children’s games.
 Great device, wish it was more kid ready with apps and special operating system that was more kid friendly.
 My 4 year old grandson really loves this tablet, it is very kid friendly.
 My son loved this tablet but it stopped charging 6 months after purchasing.
 Bought this for my 6 year old for Christmas. Worked great for about 4 months and now won’t turn on. Called customer service and was told to send it in to get repaired. 4 days later I got a refund of $5! Beyond frustrated and will never purchase again.
 Awesome product. Love the bumper cover (life saver for sure) warranty is awesome too
 My kids have owned several of these tablets over the past few years. The charging port WILL FAIL between 8 months and a year. They don't seem to care to resolve the issue so stay away unless you are looking to deal with warranty every 8-10 months if you're lucky. In some cases, they will last till just after the warranty expires.
 My grandson loves this tablet!! He has dropped it and so far so good. He’s only 3 and thinks he can treat it like other toys. Needless to say we are working on this.
 This is a gift for my daughter. . She's happy with it!
 This thing is great - only complaint is I cant figure out how to get the Disney Junior app on it - but that may be a Disney issue or a user issue lol so not affecting my rating
 Exactly what I wanted. I love the yellow “bumper” and the kid friendly Alexa. My grandson loves his tablet
 My grandson loves it and has thanked me every day since he got it. I love the case and the extras that came with it on prime day
 I bought a fire for my child I really liked it then I realized I had to click all the apps and books to load em all on and needed WiFi for that I was under the impression that when I made my sons account they would work right away and they didn't so he hasn't been able to even okay it yet. I do like tho that it's child locked only on his account so he can't get onto anything else.
 This kindle works extremely slow and has a very limited selection of free games for my child to play. It should have a bigger selection of free games and faster speed of functions for the price paid.
 Giving it 2 stars since my daughter enjoyed it the 7 months we had it. Pretty upset I spent $100 on something that didn’t even make it a full year. After about 5 months I had to sit the tablet a certain way to charge it and now it won’t even charge or recognize any charger..
 my doughter has never use that... I don't know the reason. but she like to watch movie on TV than this.
 Granddaughters love them. And the pads have been tested severely.
 I love my kindle. So I got this kindle for my granddaughter. It is great and the case really helps protect it from and drops that happen. The kids home page is great.
 The battery lasts less than a couple hours of playtime. Even when not in use the battery doesn't last 24 hours. It has to be plugged in almost constantly.
 Bought this for our toddler who loves it very much. The clarity, sound, picture and durability is good. The camera takes bad pictures and very Pixeley. The ads are absolutely irritating and games are slow to load. Otherwise is serving it's purpose.
 This is great keeps the kids busy for a long time and they learn while there busy
 Fantastic quality and loaded with hundreds of dollars of freebies.
 At first it was working very well. Now its not charging. I'm not happy that it isn't charging after only three months of using it.
 My granddaughter was trilled to have her own tablet.  Her big sister was too because little sis kept taking big sis's tablet.<br/>Everybody seems to be happy now.
 The grandkids love it! They can play games and watch videos without having to get permission or have to give it back as when mom's phone was all they had.
 My grandkids love the their kindles...….  They hate the charging ports... Thank you Amazon for the no questions 2 year return policy. We are on our 5th or 6th replacement due to charging port failures..  BUILD A BETTER CHARGING PORT INTO THE KIDS KINDLE FIRE, PLEASE.
 I love this tablet for both my 8 &amp; 4 year old. I control the allotted time to be on the device as a whole, require 30 minutes of reading prior to accessing any apps, no in-app purchases etc<br/><br/>It's amazing
 I got this for my daughter she loves it so far it's been working fantastic.
 It gets a little glitchy at times and you definitely want a memory card. I was slightly put off that it is actually a regular kindle fire and I have to log the baby into his profile every time, but now I'm kind of enjoying the grown up side when he isn't playing. It is super sturdy and my toddler is already learning lots of things from it.
 If the tablet breaks within the 2 year "warranty" they will try to repair it or send you a refurbished tablet. They do not extend the warranty, you only have the remaining warranty of your original tablet.<br/>The "worry free guarantee" isn't what you think. It is very misleading.
 My son loves his kindle and all the options he has with it.
 Sent it back. Unusably slow, clumsy software. Overall, very disappointed in this product.
 Great as a kid's tablet! Bought it for my 3 year old son and he loves it. Lots of videos, games and books available for download. The only con is that it is a little slow to open apps or load games sometimes but honestly not a big deal. Overall very happy with this purchase!!
 I returned the tab for factory repair as the battery was bad. It was returned back but without the Protector. Complained to amazon and they ordered a new protector.<br/><br/>my daughter has broken the screen before we got the rubber protector. Tab is useless with no visuals.
 My kids are hard on their toys but these things really have lived up to the durability. The only down side to these tablets is the charging ports are weak. They should really change from the USB
 I've been using this and I must say  enough though it says kids edition an adult can use this as well. So far I've only downloaded videos and books on here for my 7 month old seeing how he's not old enough to use any of the other features. This will be great to use for when I drive from NY to Florida when my son is 9 months old to keep him clam with watching cartoons.
 My daughter loves her “IPad”. I would recommend this to anyone! I love the protective cover that comes with it as well.
 2nd time buying these tablets and they are wonderful.  The case is seriously kidproof! I wish I knew that last year when I bought a set and both tablet screens were cracked shortly after the kids got them. This year I was smarter and paid a little extra for the tablets with the kidproof case and I'm so glad I did!
 I have purchased in the past!  My Granddaughter puts it through the test!
 Worked great until it stopped charging.
 This was a gift, my 6 year old grandson loves it. His parents set parental controls so he has learning time and play time on the table.
 This is a great distraction for my three year old when I need a moment (or a hundred) of peace. He is constantly finding new thing to watch and play. He's even learned a few new things! I love that I can block programming I don't want him to see.
 I'm about a year into owning this device.  Got it for my kid and the warranty.  The device now has difficulty charging.  I believe the charging port is damaged.<br/><br/>Daughter loves it!
 I love how i can manage what my daughter watches, and where or what she is learning from. She loves the apps when in reality she is learnjng but seems fun to her because she is interacting and engaged with all she is learning. Makes my heart so happy to know she understands when she does something right, she says "I did it Mommy" i am so pleased with this purchase.
 Daughter loves it. Nice, portable, sturdy, and most of all lightweight.  Good display for an 8 year old. Just have to maake sure that you set up an account that you can remember the password for. Also, make sure not to use your own email because reminders with pics will show up daily.
 I got these for an upgrade but my kids would complain regarding the slowness....worst than my 3 year old kindles.
 I like it, however it constantly changes back to the adult profile, and doesn’t stay on the child’s profile. Plus once the subscription runs out, there is nothing the child can do. I would like options. I wish I would have known that you have to have a subscription.
 This tablet was perfect for my granddaughter. She can do everything on it. The Alexa feature is cute but confusing. We are still working on how to use it correctly. We have purchased earphones today.
 I live in rural Oklahoma and dont always have internet connection. The tablets allow you to load games/books/apps with an internet connection, but they seem to disappear and require another download to get them back, when you are away from the internet; this could be within a few minutes or hours.
 Bought this for my 3 year old. She uses it constantly. The freetime app is all she needs! She’s had it for about 4 months and never runs out of games, videos and books to read. The case is great, very durable.
 Runs slow, glitchy and non-friendly user interface.
 Perfect. Came fast. My account already set up. Just had to turn it on and enjoy. Daughter loves it.
 Love the free time and warranty durable tablet protector
 Overall it works pretty well except it is not a very fast processor so it can take a minute for apps to work and for my toddler son that is too long. His main use is for the Disney now app and it takes forever to load on this thing. Not sure if that is the fires fault or the app but none of the apps load very fast. It also doesn’t stay charged for very long.
 I did not like the new change, I believe I was sent the wrong one.
 This tablet went above and beyond my expectations! I am and will be recommending this to anyone with children. It’s easy to navigate and the FreeTime unlimited is just great for my 3 yr old and i love that I can set goals for him and time limits. I also love that it’s a regular tablet for the adults too. Great job amazon!!!
 Good buy. Keeps her busy and learning. Keeps her from asking for our phones. Indestructable so far.
 After downloading games and videos and apps it doesn’t work. It worked fine for a week. Now it keeps saying “talk to your parents about downloading content” or “error”. Would never recommend this to anyone. Stay with an iPad.
 this was a gift and he loves it. My daughter says he stopped bugging her for her phone
 I bought 3 of these for my daughters they love the tablet and its safe foe them to surf the internet on the kids safe browser.
 Great product! I would recommend always having the case on.<br/>My kids love their tablets. There are great educational games, books, and more.<br/>Life saver on trips!
 I bought this for my 2 year old as a birthday gift, I love all the apps there are for kids and how easy it is for her to navigate. I also use it for myself a lot of the time she isn't using it. I like it much more than tablets I've purchased in the past and with the kids case on, it's incredibly durable. I would definitely purchase again in the future.
 connecting to public wifi that directs you to a login page in the browser was almost impossible to setup. download offline videos weren't easy to setup for kids.
 Loved the tablet..especially the protective cover. I ran into trouble when it uploaded and brought over apps and data from my personal Kindle. Now my 2 year old grand has two accounts on the tablet. I’m sure it is user error.
 This is the perfect gift for a child, for it has everything needed for a toddler to start learning.
 Bought this for my 4yr old, he loves the Kids unlimited Freetime, this also makes things much easier than trying to run a standard android tablet and find content on google play sifting through the rubbish to find the good stuff.  well worth the money.
 Really like this tablet. I like the fact that he has to read for 30 minutes before he can play on any of the apps. I've set it so that after 8pm he can no longer use it. He doesn't like that very much but I love it! I've bought my son the Leap Pad before and this one I feel is better.
 I was hoping that it would be like my nieces fire 7 but the battery dies in like 2.5 hours and then we have to give him our phone again. Don't understand how one can last for 2 days with the same apps and his only for a couple hours.
 It’s too slow battery life doesn’t last more then an hour. Just sucks... but whatever my baby is only 15 months old he’ll just keep using mommy’s  phones since he doesn’t even like watching/playing on electronics . I just really liked it for the car since that’s the only way he would ride .
 The free unlimited subscription was my reason for this purchase. My Daughter loves the available content and I love the rule she has to read as much as she plays games.
 Shipped fast, clean unboxing with everything accounted for and easy to find, install etc.. The Kindle Fire for kids is excellent for my 5&amp;9 year olds. The hard foam bumpers protected it all ready from at least two hard drops that would have certainly been damaging. Highly satisfied and definitely recommend.
 Was great till she ruined the charging port<br/>Need to return for replacement
 Quality product, shipped quickly, fair price.
 Great size and very sturdy tablet. Kids love it
 I give 5 stars very good shipment comes with everything and 2 year worry free warrantee even if they purposely break it and we all know kids do that and warranties don't cover it this one does
 This was supposed to be a replacement device. I turned in and I finally received another Kindle but took 3months. I had to buy another Kindle bc this took to long to receive. Very disappointed
 Pros: Light &amp; Airy; Small; Reasonable price; Protected from falls; Kid &amp; Adult Mode available; Firm; Quick Charge.<br/>Cons: No screen protector; Youtube kids is not available to download; videos do not automatically play the next video on kids mode.
 I liked how the tablet function when it function but that was not for long. I had two tablet in less than 3 months and both of them malfunction. They both would not charge after a week or two of use. Would not recommend or buy another one.
 This is my grandchild's 2nd Fire tablet. She luvs it (4yrs old). I luv that I can wrk it !!!!!
 I liked because my daugther can use and enjoy the game in the screen of fire 7.
 Excellent kindle.  Easy set up and basically ready out of the box.
 He is 2 and it keep him from grabbing cell phones.
 Perfect for our three year old granddaughter! She loves the preloaded games! Good screen size and plenty of gigabytes for her needs.
 Absolutely love this! Bought it for my 6 year old and after setting it up I loved the parental controls and curfew settings that are available! My daughter enjoys all of the games that comes with it under the prime account so we both are very happy!!
 Dislike the battery time it does not have a long-running battery.battery charging port seems to be looser than what it should be.
 3 year old Grandson loves this so much that his mom has to hide it for a few hours each day so that he will play with other things.
 Twin 3 year old boys loved it until it just stopped working. I believe it is the charger port that is not connected, it seems to be loose. Thankful for the warranty, but for as great as this product is I am disappointed that the tablet is having charging issues at just 3 months old.
 My grandson loves his tablet and it is easy to setup and use
 I bought this for my grandson so he could have something safe to play games and educational apps. He likes it and uses it often.
 My daughter loves this. So easy to use and adults can use it just as easily on parental controls and have their own profile.
 My son loves watching Youtube and it does not have access to download some the games he loves such as Boom Beach, Youtube Kids, and a few others.
 Great product. Kids used all the time.
 I have a 2 yr old daughter she loves this. We haven’t had any issues with this product.
 worked great My Daughter loved it but It's only been about a month an half and this tablet is frozen on loading screen when you turn the device on Ive tried the obvouis things tryed restarting shutting off i end up with the same problem. If I'm able to get a money refund that would be much better to buy a better quality Tablet for my Daughter I would not Recommend people to buy this.
 Not impressed. The first couple months are fine I guess but it eventually starts going really slow and never holds a charge! So annoying.
 The second tablet you replaced is also not change charging. Is there s problem with these?<br/>The older model is still working fine.<br/>We thought we would get the newer one but is does not  charge like the one you replaced.<br/>Ron Durheim
 Always a problem with this device. It is completely frustrating, storage is full fast. Access to settings is constantly blocked and have had problems with charging port. I wish I bought IPads. The extra money would have been better than constant frustration.
 Let me just say, I love that this comes preprogrammed with a ton of apps for the kids. And when they say this case is kid proof.... our tablet got ran over by a car.. not even a crack on the screen!!! Wow
 Bought this for my 2 year old grandson. He is flying thru his numbers, letters, colors and shapes! Wonderful learning tool.
 I got this for a trip, paid for and downloaded several movies and they kept freezing. I was really disappointed. Other than that this has been a lot of fun for my 2year old so far
 Best tablet for the money I've researched and could not find anything with these specs that was anywhere close to this price since getting the tablet I am equally as impressed with its performance The only complaint would be the lack of Google services on the device which can be overcome but we have become dependent on the conveniences that Google services offers us
 Best purchase I ever made from amazon. Monthly installments!
 Great tablet! My 2 year old loves it!
 Ordered for grandson for Christmas present -he loves it!
 Great for car trips with kids or drs office or anything of that sort to keep them focused &amp; quiet!!!!
 not at all happy with this item, It takes forever to download content. It is not user friendly.
 I love this kids tablet. The case in indestructible. My 2 and 5 year old each have one. They love them!
 Great tablet. This is our second one due to my nephew cracking his screen on his first one. It was already past the 2 year mark, so it was bo longer under warranty.
 Stopped charging no matter what cord I used after a month.
 I tried different ones to see if they would work for my son... this one is by far the best!
 Crap. Had it for less than two months and it already it doesn’t recognize touch and nothing loads appropriately. I can’t even shut it down and restart it. Total junk. I technically give this zero stars but your forced to rate something with at least a star.
 My son loves it it's so easy for him to use. Even my 1 year old uses it with no issues. I blocked the access to purchase apps. And it only shows kids contents.
 Great for younger kids. Easy parental controls. I bought one for my 5yr old and my 7yr old and both love it.
 Charging port quit working after 6 months
 Great entertainment for small children and the larning games you can download on this are endless.
 It was awesome don't like the fact that when one child is in there profile it won't let the other one go on there's and the battery died and it wouldn't turn back on after 2 months waiting for s resolution now.
 My 3 year old got this for his birthday and has had this for a couple months and when we first got it the screen already would black out and only play soundvthen after a few weeks it started working again and then started freaking out every time it turns on to where it cannot be used. It was so great to have this for car rides, WHEN IT WORKED!
 Works very slow and child is not enjoying the tablet
 nicely put together with great apps pre-installed. the parently controls are easy to use and my son loves it
 I bought this tablet for my 6 year old and hes has no problem navigating it. The foam case around the tablet is a plus. Its not to heavy and is easy to hold. The last tablet we had even with a case(not a foam case like this) did not stand a chance to the kids. Were taking it to Hawaii in a month so well see how it holds up to traveling.
 So far everything is working  great and my son really enjoys it.<br/><br/>Edit: Not even a year old and it won’t hold a charge anymore.
 Switched from iPad to this Christmas 2017. When it came it was pre synced to my amazon account idk why but all my credit cards were stored automatically, not cool. Battery drains quickly.
 My daughter got this for Christmas. She absolutely loves it! My son got a matching one with a blue cover. It has so many child appropriate learn and play activities, books and videos and I can control the content and screen time with my Amazon security features! Great gift, I love it and so do my kids!
 We bought this for our 3 year old granddaughter.  She mostly watches you tube children's videos - she is not really ready for games - attention span is not that long.  She loves learning the songs and the counting and alphabet videos.
 This was a Christmas gift for our 2 1/2 year old . She loves it . The case it super sturdy and has held up to her dropping it.
 My daughter loves her tablet.....she has dropped it a few times and it is perfect.  I am so happy with the protective case and although I find it challenging for a 3 yr old to navigate from apps to games, etc.....it is a fun and great learning tool. I reward her good behavior with 20-45 mins of tablet time each day.
 feel like a toy, after use does like a toy...
 I like the fact that u can set it let the kids play on apps that u download. But u have to have internet for them to play on it ANYTIME!!
 I like that it is easy for my almost 4y son to use and he can't see things I don't want him to see. I also like that there are a lot of educational games on there that I may not have found. I don't like that it shuts off for no reason even if the battery is almost fully charged and I can't just turn it back on, it basically turns on whenever it decides too.
 This tablet is well worth the money and the case is phenomenal! It’s perfect for kids as they learn to navigate a tablet and for older kids who are ready to have parental controls removed.
 Awesome, my 3 yr old son loved it, got it for him for Christmas, and he is a rough one but this tablet has stood up to his roughness.
 Kids love it, especially my 3 year old granddaughter<br/><br/>Tablet hasn't broke yet<br/><br/>What's not to like
 my great grand baby plays with hers all the time  she loves it and all the games
 Kid hasn't broke it yet so it must work good.
 They ‘work’ and are surrounded by a protective case, which while untested, appears to be adequate enough for our butter fingers. What is out of the box annoying, the processing power. If this was 1982, it would be the next gen.
 My son loves it... The only bad part is we cant dow load YouTube kids and thats really what he likes
 Great little tablet for on long trips or when the power goes out. Can download movies or games, which the kids love!
 This tablet is by far the best ever! I have a two and four year old, and they love them! We have the free time on both tablets and each child loves the fact that they can play and do their own thing thru their profile.
 Amazing!! My 6 year old loves reading his books on it and I especially love how easy the parental controls were for me to manage. Only thing I don't like about it is it automatically opens to the parent account not the child's account. Other than that we have zero complaints! Definitely recommend!
 Takes forever to load apps and netflix for my toddler. My old cheaper walmart rca tablet loads faster than this. Very dissapointed, only good thing about it is the case
 Love kid's kindle. AND love the guarentee
 It was for a 5 yr old to put on her tablet. She likes pink.
 My daughter thought my 22 month old grandson was too young for this...boy was she wrong!  He loves it and now she has to limit his time on it.
 Purchased for 2 1/2 year old grand daughter for Christmas.  She never puts it down.  You can't go wrong with the 2 year unlimited guarantee
 I purchased this for my granddaughter for Christmas and WOW did she absolutely love it.  We had 2 pull her away from it when it was time to eat so I can say it was the perfect gift.
 Tablet is easy to use &amp; fun for my 5 year old.
 It is by far the hardest to operate for me so I don't know how a child will ever be able to do so.  I just can't figure it out and nothing to help me with it.  Would not buy again.  If I had know this ahead of time would have just gotten a kindle fire tablet.  This thing really sucks!
 My 5 year old loves this. Lots of educational games and he was able to figure it out by himself. Love that's a two year warranty for exchanging of it breaks or has something spill on it. Worth the price.
 Awesome tablet for kids and very very durable
 A little bummed about storage size. The kids loved them though. It has been 3 months and they have yet to break.
 At first that tablet was a great buy &amp; had many apps my children loved. Within a month of my purchase though the tablet stopped charging. The returns process is ridiculous &amp; frustrating. I'm disappointed all around with Amazon's product &amp; replacement procedures.
 My daughter loves it! It's easy to administer, and she has her own account on it so she can only look at what she is supposed to be looking at.
 Everything is great😁 and my kids love it however Unlimited does not work so well 🤔
 Thousandsvof free games and children apps, built like an armored truck, indestructible drop it with no worries,  take advantage of free amazon games for 1 year for the kids, you have to download each
 not useable it dosnt hold a charge, holds barley anything cant get rid of what already comes installed for more space.
 Have only had it since Christmas but so far it works great. Battery lasts a long time, very sturdy.
 Daughter loved it! Hope the reviews are wrong about the charging port
 Bought 2 if these for Christmas for my 3 and 4 year olds. I was not sure if they would make the transition for Apple well ( they steal mine all the time) but they both love them and the transition has been super easy! They both love them and want to play constantly. Very happy with this purchase.
 This is the second one I purchased. Love it.
 Very happy with this item. Its perfect for our 4 year old to play his games and watch videos at his convenience. We appreciate the sleeve, cause it makes handling it easier on him and without it, it would of broke already.
 Unable download some child apps. But over all it's perfect
 We like this tablet a lot. You can make accounts for both adults and kids and change the settings for each. The cover is nice and takes bumps and drops well.
 This was purchase as a gift for my son. And he loves it. That he can browse the website for what he wants
 It’s a bit slow but has plenty of things to keep kids busy with videos and learning apps. Very cool. We can download movies and the kids can watch them in the car without WiFi. Love that.
 My daughters loved they’re tablets they couldn’t be happier with the games, the books, the vibrant color. We really scored when we got such a great deal on it
 Love it very durable my kids are autistic it was very simple for them to use defentily needed a sd card to add their movies love how i can monitor thier screen usage also love the fact that i can use it when they go to bed to watch my prime videos or hulu
 It's great to have the free time because there are so many choices for the kids to read and play. Wish it didn't always start uo on the adult profile though.
 Our grandson loved it and I hope to see more books then games on his Tablet.
 Purchase 2 tablets for Chirstmas last year, The first tablet stop holding a charge; second tablet just shut off and won’t turn back on. I would say not to waste your money on these tablets but I did love the concept and my kids pick up an interested in reading because of the tablets.
 Great tablet! Having a two year waranty for it is amazing. Only issue with these tablets is after a while the charging port starts to mess up. Other than that, my kids love it and spend hours on it.
 Suddenly stopped charging...good thing still under warranty and CS was very helpful.
 I got this for my 6 year old. I love the parental control features. Her previous tablet was a plain android tablet and I constantly worried about what she was downloading and watching. I love that you can set times so when tablet time is up I am no longer the bad guy the tablet shuts off.
 Great way to keep kid entertained while providing some education at the same time.
 I bought this for my 3 year old son and he loves it. He was able to figure out how to use it fast and the children’s apps are great. They’re interactive and he is learning with them.<br/>I would like to be able to add apps or games to his profile that I have approved for him. I don’t believe it’s possible or I just haven’t figured it out yet.
 My little girl loves it, better and faster camera than my phone, no flash though
 Good product and delivery was very good.
 Perfect device for a toddler.  Love that the kids software comes with this &amp; the fact that the foam case makes it virtually indestructible. Doesn't hurt that Amazon backs all that up with a 2 year "no questions, no problems" guarantee if somehow the kids still manage to break the thing.
 My kiddo and I read books on it at bedtime.
 Great for kids.  Awesome customer &amp; technical support.  Easy &amp; fast replacement.
 Fantastic Warranty.  Kids love it
 Perfect for kids. I love all of the free Amazon features and that there is a separate account for the parents where we can monitor what is downloaded and used on the kids profile. The only downfall is that the battery does not last as long as I expected so we have to charge it constantly. Otherwise a great product!
 Don't waste your money and get a samsung or Apple even an older model is better th a  the crap amazon is sell g at a discount rate. Super slow very non responsive and overall really fricken crappy. Don't waste your time or money.
 The thing is slow and unresponsive making it hard to interact with. Also, kids can browse through the library of apps and download any of it, any time. They have downloaded so much that all the space is gone. Given the description about parental controls one would imagine a parent would control which apps will be installed.
 I like that my grand daughter can surf and find kid friendly songs books movies and games without getting online and into something they shouldn’t watch. And the durability with the case
 They are good tablets, function as a normal tablet under an adult profile. HOWEVER , under the child profile and after an update Netflix, Hulu, vudu,Pandora and YouTube were no longer able to be added to the tablets not even through the specific setting for that, so that was a bummer but over all its good . My 2,3,&amp;4 year olds use them everyday.
 Got one for my 9 yr old niece &amp; she loves it!!! With all the great, age appropriate Amazon content available she's reading even more than playing games.<br/>Fabulous tablet/e-reader!
 Love the tablet for my 4 yr old. I like how you can set specific times for game play and the case is sturdy to hold up with how rough he is, but the battery never lasts more than 4 hours, he’s not on it that long and the volume is turned down so I’m not sure why.
 the “2 year worry-free guarantee” is a lie. Asked for a replacement through the amazon app due to the charging port not working, and they’re asking me for all kinds of info. The main reason I bought this is because I figured i’d be replacing it eventually and no questions asked seemed like a good selling point. Guess Amazon lies. AVOID.
 This product worked great. But a couple weeks ago it stopped holding a charge. I'm still paying off this product on the payment plan and the window for support is already closed?  If someone can get back to me for a resolution it would be greatly appreciated.
 In love this tablet has just all... no need to download any game or video it has it all is great my son can't stop singing with the videos lolzz
 its great she loves playing games and watching movies... perfect for long car rides
 The cover is great for little ones. Our 2.5 yr old was able to use this quite easily once we got it all set up
 We own three of these. They are pretty durable and easy to use. However,  the storage runs out constantly and on more than one occasion I’ve had to wipe them because of issues that couldn’t be fixed. Furthermore, one of them broke within only a couple months and Amazon did NOT make good on their one year warranty.
 Grandson doesn't want to put it down.  Stands up to punishment well.  Grandson hasn't learned to take it easy with it yet, likes to throw it into the air and slap it to get it to do things.  But it stands up to it hopefully until he learns to take care of it.
 My daughter loves it! The case is very durable. I also bought a screen protector! I like how you can have several profiles on it!
 My son loves this tablet, yea he has couple of issues but thats just cause his not old enough to understand some of the apps on there but other than that he loves the ABC Apps or the 123 Apps, so he just getting ready for Prekindergarten
 Excellent value and quality.  Grandkids love these but they'll need a higher GB micro chip to get the most out of these.
 Was fun while it lasted, but after 5-months it stopped holding the charge and no longer worked.
 We bought these for our 2&amp;3 year old granddaughters, they absolutely love them! Was a great purchase with controls for the parents too!
 I requested a return after using it for a while, very slow  and buggy tablet  not what you want to keep your kid busy on a long trip,  safe your money and buy something a little better
 This tablet seems to freeze often, games take forever to download even if connected to WiFi but I do like that it’s easy to navigate and it’s not just for kids since parents can make an account as well on this.
 Works really well for my 5 year old. I showed her the basics and she took off! Free time is a must, there are lots of great learning tools on there. She is now proudly naming all the planets and telling us about them.
 Item was durable. Produced good quality images. Able to perform in extended usages without overheating.
 Our 6 year old granddaughter received this for Christmas.  She absolutely loves it!  I wish it came with screen protector and stylus.
 It is very sturdy but I am already limited to storage so not very movies can be download.  I have twins and each received on for Christmas, it is great that I can change id on who is using the kindle because they just grab one not knowing whose is whose.  Each kindle has different games and movies download to them so that we have more a variety when there is no internet.
 we love our kindle but it won't charge anymore can you please assist how do we return
 Not easy to understand how to use. I’m still unsure why there’s a monthly fee after a year. The pros it’s 100 kid friendly.
 This is a great distraction for my kid while I make dinner
 Case is nice that comes on the kids fire tablets, as far as the tablet it’s self I am just not impressed. Hard for a kid to use the “kids edition” tablet quality just seems very low, no weight to the tablet and very slow response time. I returned my item because I was unhappy with it.
 A mi hija le encanta, gracias Amazon ya que la pude agarrar en pagos es perfecta
 I got this for my son for his birthday &amp; it had had problems from the time I got it. It has "updated" about four times since mid June &amp; it will turn off in the middle of playing on it, just showing the fire screen for up to an hour unless I hold the power button to manually restart it
 Charging port leaves much to be desired. The apps can be added until the user runs out of space and then the adult has to go in and manually delete a bunch of apps. It's a daily struggle. Wish there was a better way to structure the user interfaces.
 I would not suggest this to anyone.  It stopped working, it will not even turn on.  Apparently this is a common thing to happen with this tablet.
 This tablet was great up until one month after my warranty expired....then the tablet stopped working completely. I am unable to return or replace the item. We have been very careful with this tablet and it is not used very often..maybe 1-2 times per week. The tablet no longer charges. We have tried purchasing multiple cords with no luck.
 My boy just loves this. Almost 3 and has figured out almost everything but my pin code. Perfect distraction.  Set a time limit though!
 Littled kids can operate these with ease.
 The internet cuts of fall the time randomly and the picture quality is very poor. Spend the extra money on an iPad.
 Great little tablet that looks and feel very strong and durable.  Easy to use and easy to setup.
 Grammie did it again!  Gift for grandson 5th birthday!  He is already an expert!
 My son loves this and j love the ability to limit what he is exposed to
 Light weight, great features for kids, and age appropriate.
 She using Alexa when she is trying to spell really hard words for her age.  She is a very smart child and this helps her with alot of different things...I have purchased about 8 kindles.......For my parents, grandchildren and myself and my husband who is not a computer/tablet person at all can use this.
 Kids edition has free time and Free Time has educational games that can really augment any school/homeschool program!  Wow!  Really worth the money by giving parents free time while kids learn with fun games on Free Time!
 My son loves this and so do I but the battery doesn’t last long at all I feel. But I’ve used it on the adult setting and it works great for me. My son loves the games on the kids part. Over all it’s a great product for the price and does what it should and my two year old loves it! We use it multiple times a week in the car for the most part.
 Returned this Kids Tablet.  It would not hold a charge and sometimes would not charge.  Amazon was great with the ease of the return.  This was a gift for my grandson so I  spent a little more money and got the Kindle Fire for kids
 We bought this as a Christmas present for my 5 year old daughter and she loves it. There are tons of age appropriate apps. She is figuring out how to do things every day I didn’t even know where on there but she can’t get on anything I don’t want her on. The case makes it easier for her to hold.
 Thank you! Made a wonderful gift!
 Bought two tablets and both stopped charging within 30 days. Huge disappointment
 We haven’t had it long, but I can already attest to its durability. Somehow, it survived my son throwing it out of a school bus window onto the pavement. (Don’t ask...) Aside from the foam case being a bit scuffed, the tablet itself is still perfect!
 Brought 2 of these for my Grandkids as they love my Fire tablet...They take forever to charge..As in I plug it up overnight and the next morning it was only at 79%...And they go dead in about 2 hours of playing with them...Should have spent the extra money and bought them adult tablets...
 Worth it. I have 3, one for each kid ages 1 to 7. They all use it in their own way, even if its just to watch movies in the car to make car trips easier. The freetime is easy to use, and the case offers amazing protection.
 Very durable. Good battery life. I wish it had easier parental controls so he will stop downloading games though....
 This tablet is useless. The battery stays charged for less than 2 hours but takes 4+ hours to fully charge. It’s slow, it doesn’t connect to WIFI easily (it takes 6-8 tries), and it freezes up constantly! Frustrating to say the least.
 It’s alright can’t watch YouTube do she just uses tablet
 Great gift for my granddaughter
 This is my third Kindle, first for my grandson. He is just learning to play the games and loves the videos. Great Christmas gift. Came with some on it and love the warranty
 Bought it for my daughter. She loves it. Removable pink bumper will definitely protect it. I played with it. It works nicely. Has parental controls. If you are looking for something that will last and can transition to an older child, this is it.
 I bought these two tablets as gifts and I will be charged on my credit card once the free trial is up for things they download.  I can't really write a review since one is being kept for Fall birthday.  The other has been activated and so the year trial has started.
 It was very slow my son kept getting impatient because the games take at least 15 to 20 min to download. The first one I received burnt out the same day I had to call to have a new one sent to us. I regret purchasing this tablet.
 5th replacement for our sons fire for kids and they send us back a pink one and refuse to send back our blue case?!? Sorry but if your product is so defective we’ve went through a half dozen in a year you could at least send back the correct color!
 Great product! Great price!
 We got these for our three year old twins birthday. They LOVE them! It took some time to learn how to use but they have picked it up quickly. The only thing we dislike is how much time they want to spend on them. Thank goodness for the timer! Would recommend and would purchase again! Well worth the money
 I love this tablet. My daughter has had hers almost a year. She has learned so much just by playing games on. The two year no questions asked warranty is great too!
 I have a 10 and 8 so I know what to expect from the 7. It does not disappoint. The case has already been tested. Good job
 I like the quality of the way it was made. But I don't like how the icons for apps don't show pic unless you connect it to the internet constantly. Not very good for road trips. Can't tell what app is what. App will still work but it's luck of the draw to find one that your looking for.
 My autistic twins don't go anywhere without their Kindles.
 My 3 yr. has developmental delays and this is a great tablet for educational and downtime apps. Recommend for children that uses their parents phone for games.
 This tablet is extremely slow and finicky. We love all of the apps and things that it came with, but it freezes up far to often. It's very frustrating for us as parents and for our children. It feels like a waste of $100. Would not buy again. I'd rather spend $500 on something that works then $100 on something that freezes up.
 Grandson almost 3 loves it
 Horribly slow and buggy Os
 I have 4 grandkids that we watch. From 10 to less than 2. All 4 love their tablets. A great buy!
 I love that it’s easy for my lil one to manage so quickly! And the biggest PLUS is the Case to protect the tablet! Thank U Lord! It’s an amazing device!!!
 I thought it was preloaded with games but everytime the kids click on a game it has to be downloaded. It shows on the screen as available to play but it isn't until I down load it.
 I really love the tablet as well as the childproof case that it comes in. My daughter is only one but we got it to start her on ABC Mouse and it showed us apps that’s great for her age and we play them together as well. And the safety feature between the adult account and the child’s is great.
 This thing is great my daughter loves it and you can put it in adult mode which is nice
 Our Great Grandson wanted it and he loves it. We are happy
 My son loved this for his bday gift!
 Really don't like this tablet as much as the Samsung my daughter had before this. I do however love the kids mode.
 Love these tablets for the kids.  Do not have to worry about what they are watching. Everything is educational. You can set time limits, set age appropriate material for them. I can control everything from my own fire.
 I love the fact that everything is inclusive. It is user friendly however I would suggest that this be a starter tablet. I started the little one on an Ipad and this has been a frustrating adjustment for him but he is getting the hang of it. I really like all the free incentive for the kids and the parental controls.
 Already hate that you can't see the charging info... Just received it today... Am I charged or not
 I really like the two our kids got for Christmas the cases are excellent, the parental controls are really easy to use and they’ve had them for a month now and still working great no slowing down keeping a good charge..
 Great product but the fire 8 with double the gigabits and bigger screen is worth the extra $30. Children don't understand that the more they put on it the slower it goes. Even with an added 35 gb SD card added to this my son fire 8 runs better on its own than my daughters fire 7.
 This is great for young kids. This tablet is a lot of fun and durable. The case protects it well.
 Great tablet. Granddaughter loves it!
 Kids love them, keeps them busy while momma can get some things done :)
 My 6 year old daughter loves it! Love the parental controls. I have it set where she has to read for 30 minutes before she can go into any apps or play any games. You can beat to 2 year "If you break it, just return it and get a new one, no questions asked!" It also comes with a Great cover, I doubt it will break if<br/>dropped.
 We got this to download videos to go on a long trip, I think it is important to know that you need an SD card if you intend to download content to watch without internet, but it has been all that we hoped it would be and there are plenty games and videos available for download for free or inexpensive that are kid favorites and educational.
 Case is nice and sturdy great for kids but the tablet isn’t secure enough in my opinion they can buy  games off my card because it’s through amazon. Maybe there’s a way to change it but I can’t figure it out.
 As described. Exactly as described. Durable
 My son loves this tablet. The protector is awesome. On a trip there was damage to my son's tablet and we got a replacement one in no time under warranty. Highly recommend this product.
 I bought 2 kindle kids editions last year and stopped charging. Thought it was a fluke and got 2 more this year and with in a month same thing. They won’t charge or takes 10-15 hours to change. I tried not to get iPads but that’s where we are heading.  Please don’t get these! I’ve lost hundreds on them!!!!!!
 My kids loved it, although the only wanted it for youtube kids videos which I can't seem to be able to install.
 My 2 year son loves it! The only issue i have is that it runs kinda slow. Toddlers have 0 patients. Lol. Other than that it is perfect and very durable!
 This is exactly as described.
 I like free unlimited and all the apps. Great learning tools available. Battery life stinks.
 Memory goes so fast, and the password protections are not as flexible as I would like, but the kids like them 90% of the time.
 This has been amazing for my grandkids
 The grandson is 3 years old and loves it. Plays with it all the time. I love the parental guidance of it.
 My 6 Yr old granddaughter loves it. Easy to use she figured it out in no time. The parental control works great.
 Waste of hard earned money do not buy! Purchased this for my son December 2018 and the screen started sticking and moving extremely slow 2 months later. I tried to factory reset it to see if that would help and no luck at all! And from what I’m reading about the 2 year worry free warranty..it’s crap as well.
 This case is wonderful, let's see my daughter break this screen, she's gone through two other tablets without a protective case,so I am very pleased
 We love them.. have bought 3 for gifts!  Kids from 2 yrs old to 12 yrs old.. They love them as do their parents.. Age appropriate, and lots of interesting books. games and videos!
 This tablet didn't even last 3 months and now it won't charge so it's worthless and Amazon says its a 2 year warranty, so if you break it they will replace it with no questions asked but when you talk to them they ask you 1000 questions and still don't replace it. So i wouldn't buy one because they don't stand by their word..
 Amazing deal on this thank you
 Wonderful, Very durable. only complaint is that my daughter keeps switching the profile off hers. (I have the Parent profile password locked but some days we do that many times. :)
 I will be buying more. These things are a life saver for Moms!! Not only do they keep my kids occupied but they are educational!
 The best purchase decision for my one year old.<br/><br/>keeps him busy while learning.
 Bought this as a Christmas gift for my two-year-old daughter. It's easy to understand and the apps, videos, etc. are all kid-friendly. Would highly recommend for toddlers 2+.
 I bought this for my grandson.  He figured it out immediately and loves it!  It makes him happy, so therefore makes me happy.
 I had problem with this product , doesnt work for the program, i dont know what to do , i wanna my money back
 Christmas gift for my 6-year-old daughter!! I have already chosen the apps and set it up for her, and it seems like it will be perfect. I work in technology, and I am highly impressed with this tablet. It was super easy to set up, and very kid friendly. I know she will love it.
 Good quality love the warranty
 Kids love it.  So far so good. The free trial of free time unlimited works on my tab as well.
 The best table for kids.
 Good quality.. keep a charge. Kids love the free time app. Got a year free.
 My 4 and 6 year olds love them. My only complaint is I wish there where more “read to me” books available. As my children are still learning to read I can not set the function for them to read on their own because these books are not available.
 I can’t get it programmed to only show the games for my grandkids to see- age 3 and 5. For something that is suppose to be for kids, it takes a lot of knowledge to get it set up. Still haven’t figured it out and ready to give up. Please try to include some instructions with the package on how to program it.
 Memory is super low. Not as kid-friendly as I expected. They are figuring it out. They would much rather use my iPad or phone because it's user-friendly. But for the cost I would recommend it. But from memory and user-friendly it's iffy
 It's works fine it keeps my daughter entertained, she loves the games. It's just slow... takes a long time to power on, along time to log in and a long time to load an app. Freezes a little to often as well.<br/>Its a good deal and if the warranty is what they say it is, it'll be worth it.
 Toddlers love it, we got bigger version as well which is nicer
 It’s an ok product. The main reason for only two starts is because there is no way to lock the screen so that when your child touches it, it doesn’t stop the show they are watching. My son touches the screen a lot and I am constantly having to re-load the show. Since this is a child’s tablet, I was hoping for that feature.
 My one year old loves having her own device and I love that she can play with this without breaking it!
 I like to send books to the grandkids that I rarely see and this is just fun too!
 My 4-year old grandson loves this tablet.  He hasn’t touched any of his other Christmas gifts since he opened the fire tablet.  Very kid-friendly and only has apps for kids so we feel safe letting him use this device.
 Perfect when it works. I’m on my 2nd replacement. We had to replace it bc the charging port keeps wearing out. Very frustrating
 This was a replacement item.  My son's other tablet was not holding the charge and was still under warranty.  Amazon customer service was top notch on getting me a replacement tablet right away!  Haven't had any issues with this one. Thank you!
 Thought it was different... my granddaughter is 7 months and loves watching Elmo... it works for her!!!
 My three year old granddaughter loves it! She is learning so much and she can navigate it and watch/play what she wants with minimal help. We don't worry what she's watching bc the parental controls are age appropriate.
 Bought of a Christmas gift for granddaughter easily her favorite gift, she is 6 absolutely loves it, great for long car rides
 The parent’s profile was pretty easy to use. However, the child’s profile seemed too cluttered and had too many icons on the home screen. The gadget also had quite a slow response time and loading speed of apps took a while. For watching movies or Youtube shows, it does its job. For using apps, it’s so-so.
 The charging port broke after about a month of owning it. We are asking for a replacement. Overall its ok.
 It’s super slow. My kid doesn’t like it
 Had for 8 months (been sitting in drawer for 3) realised I had warranty and currently struggling to get replaced bought 2 neither holding a charge..dont buy
 My daughter loves this
 My oldest daughter received one for Christmas and she loved it. As a parent, I like the security options and the idea of limiting how much she is on the device. The device also has it where you can have them read for a certain time before using any apps or sites. The size is fine and the protector is reassuring if it was to be dropped.
 Cannot get youtube kids app on this tablet. I won't recommend or purchase agsin. My grandson hates tgat he can't watch the videos he wants to watch!!!!!
 Granddaughter loves it!  Easy to use!
 Good just as described
 Love this. Kids love this..<br/>Kids broke it and replaced with no issues.<br/>Highly recommend
 These tablets are junk. They work a few months then quit working. A hastle to own. Not worth it
 I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son and honestly I thought paying $80 for something you'll get something actually a little decent. In fact I got the complete opposite this tablet is so slow and always kicking me out of apps. I have only owned it for a week and want my money back!
 My grandson loves this. Very educational
 I love the number of apps available. I didn't have to download anything extra for my daugther 3 years old to play with the tablet.
 my daughter absolutely loves this she was promised one for her birthday but we had to wait due to life. glad we decided to remember she wanted one. she hasnt put it down and she is 3 years old.
 Bought two of these for the kids, worked great until the charging socket failed (one then the other). Very frustrating.
 Tough and durable. Kids time is great for educational activities and watching video
 I bought this for my daughter for christmas and she really enjoys it the only problem is after a few weeks somehow the front screen cracked and shes not rough with it but she somehow cracked it and I bought it from best buy but cant find my reciept so I cant return it but I thought it was suppse to be a little bit tougher than what it is
 We always buy these but they’re constant problems. Probably won’t get them again as we yet to have one last past a year.
 Grand daughter loves this. Very versatile. Educational and entertaining
 My 22 month old granddaughter steps on it and it keeps on working.. The only downside is the screen stays dirty but a little wet wipe cleans it right off
 My toddler gets frustrated when trying to load utube. It takes too long to load.
 This is a great product. I really love that it has so many parental options. You can set time limits, customize the apps for the appropriate age. And it goes off when their time is up, so I don't have to take it away from them.
 We have had our sons Kindle for only 5 months and it has currently quit charging. We have tired numerous kindle chargers... is there a way we can return it and get a new one? I thought there was at least a year warrenty
 Not as fast as I would like but great for the kids
 My granddaughter loves her new tablet. Parental controls let you set time limits and customizable for specific ages.
 Haven't played with this much yet, just set the parental controls. Seems to work as advertised.
 Absolutely loved it! Got it for my daughter. Very easy to use. Was expecting it to be slow and dragging but surprisingly runs fast for a kids tablet.
 Love the huge selection on books and educational apps and videos included with the membership. The tablet itself works great, but in retrospect, I would have purchased the Fire 8 for the bigger screen. Some of the children's books are hard to read on this screen.
 I love how it adapts to your child's age, I don't like that none if the games have instructions on how to play them and I don't like how the games take forever to download to play them and I don't like that you need WiFi to use it for mostly everything
 Whis it would have clearly stated this is a Wi-Fi only device. You can not add a SIM card!
 Incredible device for kids, amazingly durable. easy to navigate. The only downfall is the charging port wears out to easy
 My 2 yr old son loves it but I not so much! the battery doesn't last very long and now it barely charges I can have it on the charger for a n hour and at time it may only increase 5-10% I've been trying to figure how to return it for the 1 year warranty but seems like a hassle may just get a new tablet different brand lasted us a good 4 months top
 I cannot watch videos on it<br/>You cannot preview the books or the apps before downloading it.<br/>Battery life is not as good as the paper white.
 My baby girl loves this.
 The battery only lasted a bit over a year. I leave it on counter for an hour or two and the device drains to 0% after a full charge...very disappointing.
 I’m not really a computer wiz but I had a pretty easy time setting these tablets up. My daycare children really like them a lot. Very kid friendly and safe.
 Works great, and holds up well. I was holding my 2 year old who was having a fit when I tried to take away her "tablet". She threw it on our tile kitchen floor. It barley made a sound, and not even a scratch on it. It has held up well. We have had it for 2 months so far.<br/>Internet access, and parental settings work great!
 I love that all the kids apps are available in one space. I don’t like the decreased speed of the tablet. I gets frustrating when it says “you have to be connected to the internet” when we are connected and my tablet is working fine.
 worked great till we lost it...........
 Grandson loved this tablet. He is 2 1/2 yrs old. Easy to manuever and hold.
 Excellent product for the kids. Great package of kids stuff installed. Very sturdy for the kids who often throw their tablets.
 I bought this for my child since it's suppose to be the best for kids, and in my opinion it is not. It's slow as all get out and now her charger port doesn't wanna work and so now the tablet is useless. Thank goodness for the 2 year warranty. But sad to know it hasn't even been a year that she's had it.
 This product is excellent. No problems
 Early Christmas present because of the good price!
 The kids absolutely love this product.
 truly great a little small sometimes but good.
 This was perfect for my daughter. I love the option of being able to pick a color. Yellow is her favorite color, so that is what she got! Set up was super easy. It's really a great little device for anyone of any age.
 Great value &amp; durability....Works like it's big brother ...:)
 Good product kid loves it
 My 19 month old was super excited as I set up her new tablet. So far so good. The response time seems slow but other than that, no complaints.
 I bought these as Christmas  gifts for my great granddaughters. They absolutely love them. Constantly watching something on the tablet.
 My daughter loves it, feels like a big person, and the ability to set restrictions and goals is a huge plus!
 Unfortunately cannot tear my kid away from this thing 😉 definitely worth getting the bumper case as he has dropped it several times.
 grand daughter is 3 she loves it, pretty easy to use.  the battery does need charged often,
 I like that it has parental controls. I can control at what times they can play and for how long. I also know what my kids are downloading onto their tablets
 Got this on Prime Day for my almost 6-yo. It’s easy to use and she loves it.
 My great grandson absolutely loves this tablet and I do too. I find it extremly durable. I did buy the shatterproof screen saver also but I can't count how many times this tablet has been dropped or thrown and it still works great. It's very easy to use and child friendly. I highly recommend it.
 Love this tablet! Only wish it could access Kids YouTube. Which is the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.
 This was purchased to keep my son entertained during a long flight. Apps, videos and games were already downloaded to the kindle for him. He is 3 1/2 and was able to navigate the kindle with ease. Definitely a great purchase, would buy again and recommend to everyone! !
 On initial use it appears that it is very battery hungry. My grandson who is 5 can figure things out easier than I . First impression seems to be ok but I will wait til we have it for more than a week !!
 My son loves this and I love knowing that what he sees is more cold appropriate! The case is awesome.  Easy to hold and is great at keeping the 7 safe.
 Was hoping the menu would not be as complicated for kids.
 Works great for a few months, then starts to run extremely slow! Take a very very long time for anything to load. Would probably spend a little extra money next round and buy an Apple.
 Wonderful learning tool for the kids! Never buy paper (EXPENSIVE) kids books again!
 The price was great
 Great item
 Would be better off buying a Samsung and putting a childproof case on it.  I find it a lil aggravating to get around on.  But I’m use to my Apple products. That being said We bought two of these for our nieces that are 4 and 7 and they seem to like them.
 We purchased two, one for each grandson.. the verdict is in, both grandsons LOVE this tablet..
 I brought this for my six year old granddaughter for a Christmas present from her father my son  she loves it she loves it
 Worst purchase ever and customer service was horrible. I bought this device so my daughter could use my kindle unlimited books . It did not work and I was on the phone with customer service for 55 mins and they said they couldn't fix the issue. So disappointed
 My 2 year old broke her tablet..again and I had a new one in a week. As a single parent this helped me out a lot. Time and no money it was so easy to replace.
 My daughter loves her Fire. I love that I can pay a small monthly fee and she can download apps, books and games to her heart's content.
 My daughter loves her little tablet! It has its confusing features so I’m learning how to use it along with her, but it’s perfect for her to play with every now and then.
 Battery life is very poor and the platform is not user-friendly; definitely not when compared to iPad and other droid tablets. Big regrets with our purchase.
 Nice little gadget for kids. Easy to admin and control and parental control is great
 Muy práctica y funcional. La compré para mi hijo de 8 años y la función de parental control es muy práctico a la hora de poner filtros y control. La recomiendo.
 Bought this for our granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it! We love the ability to set time limits for the internet, games and videos.
 The charger connections are awful. The tablet has to lie just so for it to charge. The connection hole should be better for a children's product.
 Love these tablets. I got the yellow for myb4byear old and blue for my 10 yr old. It exceeds my expectation.  Love the parental controls. I choose what they can download and what they can't. What apps they can get on. Absolutely love it and recommend them.
 I like everything except the password I have to put on it cause my kids are 1 and 2 years old the can’t do it themselves .
 There seems to be an ongoing issue with the WiFi being connected but not having access to the internet. Super irritating because my daughter uses it to play apps when this happens she can’t play anything.
 I purchased this for my 3 year old nephew and he loves it!
 I bright this for my 6yr old I love it, great color and size.<br/>He loves the preloaded games and the battery life is good. I wish it came with some cool kid friendly earphones. Other then that is good for me
 Got it for my kids so they would be entertained during long car trips or plane rides. It's great and my twins love playing the games. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the charger for one of them stopped working within 24 hours.
 I didn't expect that this tablet to work so slowly. Also even when you don't use the tablet - the battery get discharged (if in the evening leave him on 100% - in the morning tablet is dead, so every evening i have to left him plugged in the charger).<br/> Otherwise the kids interface is very nice .
 My 1 year old loves!!!
 Really good buy, the kids will be so happy!
 A toy fell on it and it cracked the screen. No help from the manufacturer.
 Love the tablet, but the one thing that would be immensely helpful, was if the case came with a kickstand on the back.  My child tries to prop it up against things to watch videos, but he gets frustrated when it keeps falling down because of the slickness of the case.
 Highly Recommend this tablet. My Son loves it... Kid Friendly and very safe .. While traveling My son can be in the backseat of our car and is able to get into all is reading,games Etc with no WiFi needed it .
 It was good at first but this is my granddaughter's third one. They all got too hot and started melting. I think I should have gotten her a regular tablet.
 I love having the child locks on the Web where they can only get age appropriate content and the purchase block the bumper is awesome being a mother of a 4 year old son with autism it takes a lot of bangs and drops we went through 3 nabi tablets in year my daughter gave him a kindle so we got a couple more so we could use them to just love them
 Love so far. Haven't actually given to grandson since it is for Christmas but as Dr as setting up parental control seems easy.
 We got this for my daughter (5) for Christmas. She loves it and so do I. I love that I can set time limits and what kind of content she uses. I am having trouble figuring out what it figures is educational but that could just be because I’m not very tech savvy
 It does not have some apps I can find on Google play store
 Love the case and the 2 year warranty. Have had it for a year and my 4 year old loves his tablet. Had to have it replaced once sulfur to charging port issues, but my son is to blame for that. Making a claim was easy and replacement only took a few days
 Like the tablet. Protective shell is perfect for my Son. He’s thrown, slammed, even stood on the tablet and it’s very durable.the only downside is Sometimes it runs slow and updates at the weirdest times which takes really long and my toddler gets impatient. I wish it would give an option of when to update
 This tablet seems to be pretty good. It's durable The battery last pretty long. Before it runs out
 These are amazing
 The best tablet for kids
 It was perfect for my 3 and 4 year old children. They have been on them nonstop .They each have there own profile customized for there age and gender. You also can block sites that are not age appropriate. Storage was fair considering my child ages.My 6 year old wants one she sneaks on there tablets every chance she can.Great for my little ones.
 its lightweight and I love that my daughter loves it
 My nieces love it! And their mother loves it even more. They use them while mom is shopping, driving and while she cooks.
 I purchased an Amazon Freetime Tablet for my son.  While it was still under warranty, my son cracked the screen.  I sent it in for a replacement, and received one.  Shortly after, the tablet would not charge at all.  Now amazon will not answer emails in response to resolving this issue.  Very dissatisfied.
 Seems to work well
 Got this for my grandchild.  She loves it.  It's easy for her and has so much for her to do.
 Un regalo para mi Nieto que no se quería sentar en el Carro
 My daughter hated it. Nothing on there was usuful for her. She's boarderline autistic spectrum and she didnt want anything to do with it. Bought her a samsung kids tablet and she uses it every day
 Was a hit with the grandson he was 2 yrs old when he got it and loved watching shows on it. Loved that Amazon let me pay it out and still get it before I even finished paying for it.
 We buy first the HD 8" for my older kid, than we buy this one for the youngest. High quality product. Good parent control. The case does a great job protecting the tablet. Easy to use.
 Really keeps my baby entertained! Great product. Holds a nice charge. Also very durable!
 I would not get this.product if you want to use it for the learning  programs used in schools. The man reason I bought peas so that my son could use it with Lexia. It is not compatible with the kindle fire. I guess the lesson is to do your research and just buy the brand of tablets the school uses.
 So far very happy with this tablet. A bit slow but is for our granddaughter. Well built and protected case!
 Perfect for my toddlers
 I bought 2 of these and I like the parental controls and the foam case but one of the tablets is now unusable because the charging port has a loose fit. This started about 7 months after I bought it. I wish Fires had access to the Google Play store because the Amazon app store isn't near as extensive.
 I got this for my daughter and I was under the impression you can download cartoons and watch them while not connected to the wifi. So far I have not been able to do so. I'm still figuring this thing out though.
 Love the product. Surprised it came safely. Was in an envelope with two tablets. Envelope was torn in a few places from shipping.
 perfect tablet! we just love it. videos, books, parental control, plus we got alexa
 My son and I live this tablet. I have used it to this tablet to teach my son so much with this tablet since he turned a year old. I  had gotten an awesome case for it and we both live it. After all this time it just stopped chanrging I want to know How do I use the Warranty on this tablet? Thanks..
 I purchased this Kids edition Kindle Fire in November 2017. Here it is a year later and I've had to replace the charger and now the device's charging port will not keep the charger in king enough to charge the tablet. It's very loose. My grandson is very disappointed and I am very angry.
 This is the best tablet my kids have ever had. Love the sturdy case and the kid area.
 The case itself and the way it performs is great as expected. But after only 3 months the charging port is having issues charging.(this is why we replaced our old one, but after 2 years)<br/>I think this version is just made a bit more cheaply then some of the other kindle types. Works well though other then being annoying/hard to charge and the kids love it!
 Had these for two years! The warranty is amazing and my children love!
 Great tablet for younger kids
 Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It won't charge anymore unless you wiggle and wedge the cord.
 My two year old grandaughter lives it. Mom likes the ability to control it and what she sees on it.
 Perfect for grandson.
 Great for kids, if it breaks no issue getting a replacement. Defenitely worth it.
 When it works, it's great, but we've had charging problems the entire time we've had it. It's already been replaced once. Don't waste your money.
 Cant say enough good about this purchase... My child loves it, and I love all the parental controls lol. Practically indestructible.
 So incredibly slow
 I had this product for exactly a month before it wouldn't power up or charge...  Because I don't have the box, I'm stuck with product that no longer works.  My grandson loved it for the 29 days it worked.
 Fantastic product very happy with this purchase for my grandsons birthday. Delivery was timely.
 Bought 5 of the fire 7 tablets for our kids. They work great and the kids love them! Good buy!
 Didn't come with any games or apps like the description says!! Over all a good tablet. My son loves t but was disappointed that it came empty. Also the case is pretty cheap, will be ordering a new one
 This also was a gift for a friends daughter. Sh enjoys it.
 Would have been better off buying an android table that was twice as much.
 Grand loves it.
 The games that comes with the tablet takrs forever to download. My children opened their tablets in Christmas and it took 2 days for 1 game to work. I really don't like this at all. There's 1 game that's been downloading for 4 days. This is an outrage.
 When you buy something for a 3 y/o and they are still using it at 4..... It is WELL WORTH IT!!  :D
 Best kid's tablet ever. My son absolutely loves it. And i love how much control parent's have over it. The only thing i wish i could do was instead of a hot spot just be able to add it somehow to it's own data plan but other wise very pleased with this product.
 my granddaughter is in love with her tablet.
 With a 2 year old, we knew we were heading into trouble.  We downloaded Amazon prime available kid shows and it kept him relatively  content for 2 separate 2.5 hour flights.  A lifesaver!
 My son loves it. It came when it was suppose to and nothing is wrong with it! I definitely recommend and the parental controls are just what I was looking for!
 My daughter was so excited to get her fire 7!  But then the kids unlimited app didn't include all the things promised. And when I called Amazon they said " it's a known issue"  we are working on it.  Not helpful at all. I am very dissatisfied with the service I received.
 It’s great for my 3 year old but doesn’t hold a charge very long.
 My son was so excited about his new tablet and it lasted for about 5 months and the screen cracked. He cut his finger on the glass so I had to take it away. I loved the fact it had a lot of things for him to do with parental controls just didn't like the shattered glass cutting him.
 My oldest grandson loves it. Its easy to use and safe. It was shipped super fast.
 Fits like a glove, to bad the case is to small
 Most of the downloaded apps/games require internet after 48 hours of starting
 No stars.... I bought this for my 5 year old grandchild at Christmas 2017 it stopped working.... Not broken, just stopped working, and fireplace it you have have to go through way too much for yourself and a 5 year oldnto understand. Thanks Amazon for my gandbaby's disappointment. Guess i have to go to Walmart
 We love it!!
 I love this tablet. Bought for 3 year old. Very durable. I love that I can hand it to him and not worry about any content. Freetime is also great.
 We love this tablet, we got 4 for our age appropriate children, youngest just turned three and it is very easy for her to use. I used to be one of those moms against technology for children, but found my children learning so much with tech based activities I now advocate for it.
 amazing tablet. would highly recommend getting extended warranty.
 The charger plug does not go in snug. You have to lay it just right or it won’t charge.
 Works great I would recommend it came with the case and is very easy to navigate through everything my children absolutely love it.It comes with a year of free time unlimited.Great product.Thanks Amazon for making an affordable product that is fun and educational.
 Does more than I thought it would for a kids tablet. It took me a minute to figure out how it works but I love it and use it for more than entertainment for my toddler.
 I wish I would of had this sooner... very convenient and accessible.... definitely would recommend!
 My son LOVES this thing!!! He carries it around with him everywhere we go. Its super handy for small children and the case is super convenient because my son tends to drop it a lot.
 I've tried to find a way to get information on how to get this replaced as it is broken and well within it's replacement warranty timeframe.
 It sucks because you have to have Internet for everything, I got this for road trips and to download movies but it seems even extremely old movies are overpriced to buy and everything is difficult to use without Wi-Fi
 Hard to use
 Gift for my five year old great niece.
 the battery drains really fast, in fact after a year we need to charge every night regardless of using. the parental control is easy to hake by kids
 My toddler got this as a Christmas gift from his grandparents and he loves it! I love that I can set parental controls and timers for him so easily, but also be able to access my Amazon account if I need to. I also like how I can set goals for him as he gets older and for when he starts to read.
 the kid mode is slow it feels like a 5 year old android device.. very dissapointed
 My daughter loves her fire 7 kids edition tablet. Will follow up in future &amp; update. So far so good.
 First device purchased kept on freezing up and screen would turn off. Had for about 3 days and this started happening. New device seems ok so far actually own two of them. One of them for a couple years that has had no problems with.
 Very good product .... Reasonably priced, grand daughter loves it !
 My item was a warranty item. My to daughters Kindle Fire was replaced in a timely manner. Getting the agent to file the claim was a nightmare. I finally asked him if it wasn't a 'Trouble free Warranty'. He agreed that it was, put me on hold momentarily and sent me my shipping label.
 Kids like it the 8 is better
 You have to have a password on the tablet which I hate dealing with every time my lo wants to use it and to confusing to even use I just downloaded YouTube on it bc the rest is to difficult to be dealing with
 Wonderful learning tool for a 4 year old. Already loaded with lots of games and videos
 Why would you put ads on a kids tablet ? Stupid setup
 Great product.
 I loved that my great nephew enjoys all the games and movies. He plays a lot of educational games. I love that it's one year free of unlimited access. I actually bought 2 tablets for the home and car. He has another one bought for him for when he is at his great grandma's house.
 I Like that tablet was covered in warranty and kid proof. My daughter loves her tablet because of her favorite games,videos and apps. I like because she has variety of stuff to choose from. Also it converts to adult tablet and Also multiple profiles that's separate. Only down fall is battery runs down fast playing. Overall I'm very pleased with tablet.
 So far so good product arrived today. For my girls After chores and homework, tablets are good to have as a reward.
 Only works with internet. Not worth a dime while in the car.
 I love the kindle fire tablets easy to use gave all the grandkids one each has a different color plus I have one  so much fun
 My great granddaughter loves it! She watches it all the time.
 We bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. You have to link your amazon account to it and it will require a password. My daughter prefers her IPad to this. It seems to be easier for her to use.
 Works great but I would definitely say invest in a memory card! It malfunctions when storage is full
 This is the best tablet i have ever spend my money on.It has everything from games,shows,books.I love it.My kids don’t get tired of it and it’s for all ages too which i love.
 I just bought 2 tablets they came in the mail today I dont like it there very slow and the battery dies so fast and charging so slow I would have been better off buying my kids a Samsung tablet for the same price. Not something I would tell anyone to buy there kids at all dont waste your money.
 This product is the worst/most frustrating product ever. Weve already had to get a new charge cable because the port is garbage, and we have to constantly restart it because the kids free time is always freezing up. Absolutely the worst, and we will never be buying another Amazon product again.
 My two year old loves this! It’s better than TV because it’s interactive and she’s learning while<br/>Playing!
 For my granddaughter, she loves it
 I love knowing  what my young kiddos are doing is age appropriate. The case is awesome! Yes I tried it out. Definetly recommend.
 Bought for my 7 year old son!! Perfect!!!
 received it on time, the only issue with the tablet is that the battery dies very quick.
 i have had to replace 3 of these now because the port you plug the charger into quits working and it wont charge any more..
 Great for kids and easy to use
 This tablet is absolutely garbage. Free time freezes quite often requiring a reboot which takes minutes.  It's not worth the cheap price tag.
 I love the case protection on this device, I bought this item for my two year old so she can use her own electronic device instead of using mines &amp; burn my battery up to watch Elmo &amp; Minnie Mouse on YouTube. It keeps her absolutely occupied. She loves it, I love it as well.
 Love it! my 2 year old grandson plays on it everyay
 a little annoyed we didn't have a choice on whether it had Alexa on it or not.  But our daughter loves it.
 Sending back today. Stopped charging
 My son loves it better than his iPad. Great game selection, sturdy, and he takes it everywhere we go.
 Grandson loves it and with the bumper around it, his parents don't need to worry about him dropping it and breaking.
 It’s a big improvement from the previous generation. The kids love the speed and ease of use. Both my 5 yr old and 2 yr old enjoy playing with it. My husband and I even use it for our own personal use at times.
 Couldn't be more pleased. The parental control's are amazing
 Bought this for my 2 year old granddaughter. It Works great, perfect sized and easy for her to carry around. Would definitely recommend!
 Love the kidproof case. Wish it didn’t have so many apps built in  that aren’t necessary for kids. A simpler set of apps. Maybe internet, weather, movies, music, and App Store and that’s it.
 Perfect. I love it and my kids too
 Bought for Grandson, this is his first tablet ! He loves it wa very good price and fast free shipping.
 Best Buy for kids and great no hassle warranty for any oops moments
 They are really great tablets my kids love them
 My daughter(2yo) loves this pad. Its fully loaded and the games are really stimulating. Great to give to her when mommy and daddy are watching the news.
 I'm not a tablet expert, but this is a great tablet that my 3yo grandson is loving!
 I really wanted to love this item! I was looking for something for long car rides that my 1 year old can watch videos on, and I am an amazon prime member so I thought this would be ideal.  I purchased this thinking it would replace giving her my phone after she drooled all over my phone and ruined the speaker.  However, there is no app available for kindle that will serve as a touch lock for toddlers, so she constantly touches the screen, disrupting the video.  I can't continually assist her because she is in the back seat and I'm driving! The only one app I could find for amazon that sounds similar does not support Amazon videos, so it's worthless.<br/>For an older child (3, maybe 4 and up) I think this would work well enough, however, for a toddler it doesn't do the job.
 It was hard to get this thing to work. I actually thought about returning it because of how slow it was. Not sure..Its been about a month and the speed has only increased a little. However it does the job for my two year old. He loves his tablet.
 Junk. This is the third one we got. We only get this over and over again because its free through warranty. No matter how many we get they all stop working in a few months. And the customer service is horrendous.
 I love the product. Kid friendly! My son is 1 years old and can manage to work through the tablet. I only use Amazon FreeTime for him and he loves it. There is a lot of learning apps in there, so you don’t have to worry about unnecessary stuff. I bought another for his sister.
 Seems very durable and easy to handle. A little slow and so frustrated that Kids Kindle does NOT have the ability to lock touch screen. A toddler touches everything so the video or song changes, fast forwards, reverse with every touch. Called Amazon customer service to confirm
 Kid friendly and l like the separate account for parents as well. Has been very durable and the charge lasts pretty well.
 great product
 No problems
 Works well.
 Works great so far :)
 This is not easy to navigate or search for apps that are age appropriate
 Grandniece though enjoys this tablet
 So we bought this after we already had a fire on my account, and this one is for my 3 year old kid. Every time you power down the tablet resets itself to the parent account. Meaning if we are wanting to conserve battery and shut down, she can't just turn it back on and her stuff will be there. Super annoying!! Disappointed.
 My five year old loves her amazon tablet.<br/> Great apps and games. Oh and it’s true—it started giving us trouble and Amazon rapidly replaced it!
 I bought this for my 4 year old grandson for christmas...so far it has held up great. I love the warranty in case something happens.
 A really nice tablet. My 8 year old daughter loves it. we like that it can flip between regular tablet mode and the Kids' mode.
 Arrived on time for a birthday gift to my granddaughter and she loved it ! It is very durable with the case in it!
 It's very durable. The programs on there are some of the best I've seen. Very age appropriate. I love that I'm able to control the times she's able to play on it and set daily goals. The apps however aren't very organized. It's hard for her to find apps she's played on before. Other than that, this tablet is a great investment. Go get it.
 A gift for the grand daughter... Ans she loves it... it is educational as well as entertaining
 I bought this tablet for my grandson, because he has had about 2 different types of tablets in the past and broke them, this one very kid friendly. And the fact that we didn’t have to download apps, the apps were already on this tablet for his age. My grandson by far loves this tablet out of all the ones he’s had!!
 grand daughter loves it
 PROS:  I actually like this device for my 2 year old.  He has access to Netflix and YouTube!!! The device is very durable with the case.<br/><br/>CON:  On the otherhand, it does not stay charged long.  Very disappointing to a 2 year old.  Wish there was a replaceable battery pack. 🤔🤔🤔🤔
 I love the durability.  The tablet is easy to set up and easy to set controls. The only issue I have is that I can't set a separate control for using my bank card to purchase items.  If I set a password for purchasing items it also asks for a password to access precisely purchased downloads.
 I got this tablet for my 3 year old son however he already had the Samsung tablet and its absolutely better in so many ways. The Amazon tablet does not charge and when it does it takes all day or night to charges.. I haven't had this tablet 6 months. I will be looking into a complete refund.
 My grandson is 2 years old and he absolutely love this tablet.
 Pros: durable, nice screen size.<br/><br/>Cons: Very slow to start up, open anything, load anything. Can’t get half of the freetime stuff to work. No easy way to lock the screen.<br/><br/>Buy an old iPad instead. More versatile and intuitive to use.
 Gift for my granddaughter. She loves it and i love it too
 They are terribly slow, my kids can't use them properly because of their speed. I ordered two and they are both the same. Very disappointed.
 Kids loved it! Memory fills up fast but they do love to take pics! Good games n books for kids of all ages. Really liked how I hot to pick the age using the tablet!
 They're a bit slow, and require frequent rebooting. But the kids love all the apps and games, and they are sturdy/don't seem prone to breaking.
 MY 3 YEAR GRAND LIKE THE PHONE BETTER BUT BEGINNING TO LIKE TABLET
 My grandson is extremely pleased with his new tablet. I just gave it to him last night and it's his first electronic. He instantly fell in love. I'm very happy with the results!
 My 2yr loves this tablet it's her personal flatscreen TV! Lol great product and  very amusing and educational
 I bought 2 of these at Best Buy and they told me they had programs already downloaded and did not<br/>need the internet.<br/>That is not true. You need to have the internet to use them.<br/>My disappoint is really with Best Buy for not knowing the product.<br/>I would have been better off to buy an Ipad and will do so in the future.
 The tablet does not stay charge long. Also the charging port is already loose after 1 month.
 This serves its purpose for my son but it is a little slower than the last fire tablet we had . If I was to order a tablet again I probably wouldn’t order this one
 It's pretty awesome. My 4 year old loves it and it allows complete customization for age range, downloading, time, and academic lessons.
 Just the thing for a 9 year old who tends to treat electronic equipment like a basketball.
 I’ve had it less than a month but it has the four year olds approval. Squishy/hearty case.
 Great warranty.
 So easy for little fingers to use. My great granddaughter loves it.
 This is a great tablet! It is easy for my child to use, plus it has an adult mode in case I need, or want to use it.
 Like the soft case prevent damag
 Worked great initially but after about the sixth month the tablet stopped taking charge.
 It is easy and fun for g daughter
 Great product for the price
 The boys love them.  Getting them to put them down is the real problem :)
 All 4 of my kids love it. They're 2,4,5, and 7. It's great. You just put in their ages and it adds apps and videos and books automatically. And once it's downloaded it works without wifi. Making it great for road trips!!
 Very good for baby can be dropped without messing it up
 My 3 year ole great grandson loves it
 Best kids tablet ever. Bought this for our 2 1/2 year old grandson. It is now his favorite toy. And he loves the teeth brushing apps at bedtime
 Lightweight and easy to use! No lagging and it charges fast. I would recommend this to everyone.
 very very very slow, does not load. returned once and still same issue,  I asked to replace with a new one/ upgrade and they wouldn't. do not buy, my 2 old son could not watch any videos, would not run abc mouse or any Disney movies without buffering for a very long time and often
 I love this tablet for my son. Its parent safe and I can monitor the games my son is downloading by entering my amazon account. This tablet comes with a case, its affordable, and the screen is great.
 Kid loves it
 My 4 year old received his first tablet for Christmas. I am glad we went with this choice, the games are easy to download and find and play, and there are so many free ones to choose from. The Amazon Prime video is great on here and Netflix, and my son enjoys taking photos with the camera.
 Purchased for my daughter, perfect for letting her watch movies in the car, she is too young still to actually use/ play with this.
 I think it's great and worth the money. My grandson loves it.
 Great entertainment for my toddler, however I’m very annoyed and disappointed that videos are unavailable due to geographical location! Why sell this product outside the USA if you’re going to have such restrictions?!? Product gets 3 stars for that reason
 I got this for my almost 5 year old son two weeks ago and he is still telling me thank you for it every single day and how much he loves it. It’s a little bit slower running than I would like but for the price and age of my child it is just right. Very happy with our purchase.
 My son loves having his own fire.  Great product so far.  Thank you.
 Durable with my 2 year old, perfect for entertainment when we are on road trips.
 These work perfectly. My kids love them and never have issues at all. Definitely need to spring for more storage space but they're wonderful.
 I like that my son enjoys his own tablet!
 My grandson loves this tablet.  It has many great features and was described accurately.
 Product was left on porch which turned out fine but was not delivered to a person as the driver stated.  I'm sure my great granddaughter will love the Fire tablet. Can hardly wait to give it to her !
 Love this table it has thousands of apps, my son enjoys his table so much.
 My grandson is 18 months and can hold it by himself.  The case is very durable.
 Grandkids love these.
 We got this for my four-year-old son for Christmas so far everything is great he likes all the games and the Amazon freetime has a lot of stuff you can enjoyand I also like the part about the YouTube that he can't go on just anyting that it only lets him see certain videos
 I got this tablet mostly for my 7 year old to use to improve in school.  It is so far exceeding my expectations, I love it and thru the parent dashboard you can look up on your computer the last 3 apps your kid used so you can see what they are using the tablet for even if you are in a different room.
 would love to give it 5 starts... my daughter loves it however, the charger port goes bad so fast. I am constantly trying to wiggle it and find just the right spot to get it to charge.  Wish it was just a regular USB end to charge or even just a basic plug in with the option of the other port if needed.
 Battery dies within a couple hours even when not being used
 Good tablet until after a yr when charging port won’t charge the tablet
 I was highly disappointed with this. It’s so slow that it’s pretty much unusable and the apps crash almost instantly. It also takes forever to charge. 2 stars because the case was nice quality and because the return process was easy.
 My two-year-old got this for Christmas and absolutely loves it! I was worried it may be a little too advanced for a two-year-old however it is not it is perfect! And with Amazons freeze my poor kid he has access to all sorts of games perfect for his age.
 Bought this for grandkids ages 4 &amp; 8.
 This tablet is designed for kids, it should automatically locked while charging , my kids can’t wait till the tablet gets fully charged, many times I found my kids playing with there amazon fire tablet while charging  which’s Dangers
 Terrible tablet, save your money and get something else.
 Great value. Well protected. Grandkids love it. Our only complaint is the app selection is not all that great.
 Excited to receive my sons new tablet today. Amazon was great in helping me get my replacement :) since the first one the screen cracked. I would just recommend getting an SD card because the memory is low on these and kids get frustrated when they can’t play or download an app.
 Great product but I bought it at the local Best Buy thinking they would honor the two year replacement that Amazon stated on the box they did not. I should have bought it from Amazon not Best Buy. The screen only lasted 3 months before it was broken. Only buy direct products from Amazon.
 Really Really great. Got them for my nephews birthdays.They love them. Great gifts.
 My son hadn't even had this for a year when it quit charging. I sent it in to be replaced and they sent me back the same Tablet and it still doesn't work!!! Very disappointed!!
 My son loves his fire 7 kids tablet. I love knowing that I can let him play on it without worrying what he might be clicking on or accidentally buying something. Has been very durable so far.
 I’m not a fan of some of the interface options and the lack of ability to shut off kid mode for a older child.
 The tablet has withstand a couple throws lol it works fast and  is easy enough for my 2 year old to use.  It took him no time to figure out how to navigate it. Very happy with my purchase.
 Just a heads up that if something goes wrong with this, Amazon will put someone who can't speak English on the phone to make sure you never actually get through the warranty process.  Great trick Amazon.  Nice move.
 Bought as a gift for my grand daughter who still loves it.  Her mother appreciated the replacement guarantee.
 Do not purchase. Slow to load even on the fastest wifi. Too easy for kids to close out the window they are in and even get out of the kid profile into the adult mode.  Freetime only works in the US making this device basically a brick if you travel internationally with your child. Very dissatisfied.
 Great tablet. My son loves it. Worth every penny. I got it on sale for $69.99. perfect for long car rides and trips. I down loaded Netflix and down loaded movies and shows. Free time is great but my son likes to watch certain movies over and over. No complaints so far.
 I brought the fire 7 tablet from best buy. It worked for a few days and will not charge. I called best buy and was told to call amazon. Neither woyld take item back .. Iwill not go to either one again.
 Awesome
 Very slow, will not recommend this product. iPad mini is much better than this.
 My 2 1/2 year old loves this tablet, has all of the apps he likes, he carries it around all day.
 Bought it for my two year old. There's plenty of learning apps and games for him. The protector that comes with it is amazing!!!
 I am disappointed with having the tablet for a short while the port went bad and had to pay to get it repaired.<br/>The customer service at Amazon is not good because it is hassling to get the info to contact them.<br/>I purchased based on the warranty advertised and its not as it appears.
 I bought this for my great-granddaughter and definitely not disappointed!!  She loves it.  The quality is great!!!
 Replacement with squaretrade protection plan was fast and easy
 great for plane rides and entertainment when needed
 Bought this for my 4 year old and he loves it. Games, videos and books. It's a kids dream! And I love being able to put parental controls on it and limit his time per day. Super easy to use!
 It was a gift for my grandson, he loves it. Gramma is happy to see him enjoy the games.
 My son loves this tablet. The case is perfect because the screen can’t hit the floor.
 I bought this for my grandson to replace an old fire that he was using.  His brothers both have the kids fire Kindle and they’re holding up great .
 Good afternoon! Today we received 2 fires, one of them yellow and the other one is pink. The pink one isnt work correctly, it doesnt show any app, in comparisson with the yellow one. Both of them have the same configuration and I dont know why the pink one is not working. I’d like to know what would I do? Thank you so much!
 My 2 year old loves it, my 4 your old 5 year old and nine year old also have one and all of theirs as well
 Best investment!
 The worst thing I could have done is but this tablet for my son. It seems that amazon just lies and lies to sell. Customer service doesn’t isn’t helpful at all and done seem to care what you need to say. I’ve turned this table off and put it away. Don’t get fooled in buying this tablet.
 Hi could you please provide some help or suggestions...The tablets I purchased last December are no longer holding their charge. Is there common troubleshooting I can try?
 This was a Christmas present for my 4 year old and he loves it! Only down side is that the memory is already full because of all the games with kids play(or whatever it’s called) so now we have to get some games deleted without him knowing so that he can pick new games. Over all a good product
 Love it bought for my grandson came 75% charged already
 Excelent product My daughter is really happy with this
 Great value, easy to use, I recommend this to everyone I know.
 Bought for my 3 year old, he is a rough little boy and so far this tablet has withstood his beatings. Love the parental controls and amazon free time has everything he needs :)
 Our daughter loves it!
 Got this for my daughters birthday and she loves it so much! Best idea to get her one ever! Love the fact that rack kids kindle comes with a year of free games. Brilliant!
 Decent product but horrible battery life. The unit must be plugged in if not in use. After 1 day of no use the battery is dead. I have tried setting all the battery save modes and there was little to no change.
 Bought this for my daughter on her sixth birthday and she loves it. Works great. I little slow once the memory starts getting full bit other than that great tablet for kids.
 Worry free no questions asked is a joke after 6 months our tablet wont hold a charge and now is so dead it wont turn on even while its plugged in. Contacted customer service and they wont issue a replacement and they sent me a return label and said they would issue a refund but still no refund.
 Love it happy to have the membership so my son can watch all the shows available on it. But disappointed that it seems to run really slow
 Great tablet and cover. I love that there's a kids profile that limits use and apps. The foam cover is phenomenal. It doesn't make a sound when my son throws it on the floor lol. Good battery life and an overall great product.
 Sturdy case, easy for kids to use loads quickly
 From the moment we turned it on for Stella, she was fascinated and entertained.
 The charger ports on both are loose. Very common problem
 perfect
 Got this for my 2 year old niece. Very easy to use. Love the time limit setting and the durability of the tablet itself. Got it on special so we got two of them.
 So I was extremely happy with this product, but after having it for year it no longer takes a charge I even purchased new chargers in hopes that was the problem, but both of the tablets I have just won't take a charge and my kids are super bummed. I'm also disappointed.
 Super slow since we opened the box. By the time it  Takes to download an app or video or anything may sign has already lost interest and now it's frozen and we can't turn it off change volume or anything until factory reset shuts it off now it's just off
 Must have for my toddler - gives me the time I need to make dinner or just have 30 minutes for Mommy
 My kids love it and easy to use plus the no question ask  warranty  Is amazing !
 This is the sixth kid's edition, I have purchased. They are great devices. Excellent for education and entertainment. It's a safe bet to say, I will but more of them in the future.
 For grand kids
 This is a very well made product. My granddaughter toasted a Samsung kids tablet in less that a year. Very good picture and controls.
 Bueno
 I love that my toddler can easily navigate the system and I don't have to worry about him accessing inappropriate content because of the age filter. I set the tablet to shut off half an hour before his bedtime, which makes it really easy to wind him down! He loves all the tons of content Amazon provides with FreeTime, too!
 I am not very happy that we are not able to download youtubekids. Before I purchased these for my kids I researched and read that it was possible to do so. Well I have not been able to figure it out. If anyone can help me, that would be great. My kids are still asking for my phone so they can check out YouTube's and not touching the tablet much.
 Very nice. Preloaded and kid friendly
 My kids love their tablets. My 5 year old navigates it very well. My 3 year old has some trouble exiting the games and getting to the home page.
 this was war warrenty replacement fast and easy.
 My granddaughter loves it!
 Todo bien
 The kids love them, we had set time limits for them....
 My daughter has had this tablet for about two weeks now. I’m still learning how to work it. I just figured out how to download something new. I love how it comes with apps already downloaded. I have no complaints. My son has a tablet already and I want to get him this one.
 My daughter really loves her kindle lots educational and entertaining toddlers apps
 Not bad for a tablet for kids, I love how it asked the age and it suggest appropriate apps to download.
 Bought this for our 3yr old daughter as a “becoming a big sister” gift. She absolutely loves it. It’s so helpful on car trip, waiting in restaurants and during doctors visits. It also keeps her off my husband and my phones.
 Great. Works terrific
 Bought one of these for both of my kids, they work great and I love the piece of mind that I can control and see what they are watching/reading
 My granddaughter enjoys the Fire 7 Tablet.
 liked
 The product is great. However not happy with sign on problems and transferring the gifted year of kids subscription through prime member gifter to this tablet not working without having all her data on my sons tablet.
 great kids tablet durable and fast delivery
 This item is perfect for what we needed it for. It has an abundance of books,movies, puzzles etc. for the little one. Thank you.
 Goofd piece, i would advise for any interested paprent
 Battery draining very quickly when not in use.  Turned off Alexa and still having issues.
 Nice
 My grandkids have three, yellow, blue, &amp; pink. They love these, games, movies and entertainment for all. Perfect for any age!
 It's nice. I like how I can switch from kids profile to adult profile. We don't let our son use it too often so we enjoy using it ourselves 😊
 Bought these for a road trip. Took a little getting used to after using a iPad forever. Easy for the kids to use
 It is very slow. I love the tablet itself, but even on WIFI it runs slow.
 My Boy likes it
 These are quality tablets at an easy-on-the-wallet price. I love that you can set a time limit where it shuts off and the kids have to stop playing. I also love that all the games are free for a year. And the bumper case is fantastic. My kids have dropped their tablets and both have zero damage.
 I love
 Love the fire 7 but wish there was a way to make it a little faster once all the apps are downloaded and working... Even with the SD card inserted..
 My 3 years old son loved it. Perfect zise for him, now i dnt have to share my phone anymore :)
 My 2 year old son can't keep his hands off of it and I did download play store on it so I was able to download things on there that he likes
 I do love this tablet, both my boys have one, they love them!  It's easy to use for both kids and adults. Great parental controls. Wonderful warranty!! The amazon store has tons of underground free games! Not just busy time games but educational ones! Videos look great and sound great. Its also a tough tablet. Made extremely well!!
 Protects accidental falls or breakage
 Bought this tablet for my three year old. The case is a life saver. We love Free Time, and will probably keep it after the free trial expires. However, the update to Free Time makes it difficult to maneuver. We liked the carousel with just the apps already downloaded.
 Perfect for little hands and light enough for them to hold it. My only negative note would be I wish there was a way to lock the screen when they are watching something to prevent them for stopping the show they are watching. Other than that I love this!
 Granddaughter loves it.! She's a toddler and dropped it a few times -no worries.
 Died after 1 year
 Great item. For little kids
 My son likes the video games on this device. The only thing is games don't load on them as fast as his iPad.
 We bought this for my 2 year old. She loves it and it is perfect. Nice, durable case. It’s easy to navigate through and she can switch between the games on her own. Highly recommend
 We had problems with it not very happy it will not let us dow load videos and yes we tried everything
 My little one loves this tablet so fitting for kids the programs are very secure I feel this was a great purchase ! thank you
 Simple to set up and use.  Held charge for a long time.
 My son loves it and the 2 year warranty is a plus
 It sucks. If headphones are connected the sound stops working, the screen is randomly stopping and getting stuck for hours at a time, the home screen keeps screwing up.
 My kids love this! It’s easy to use! Even my 3 year old can use it with ease. My 5 year can play it by his self. I would recommend this to anyone with kids!
 I love this for my children. They have an endless amount of things to do. I love the apps, they cater to children's different interests and learning styles. One drawback is the storage. I am going to purchase an sd card and hopefully it will fix the problem. Other than that, there isn't anything I don't particularly like.
 When we were looking for a tablet for my son, the reviews for a majority of them was not good. This had the best reviews. The charging port is the only issue we seem to have with it. It still charges it’s just real touchy.
 Great for kids. Battery doesn’t last very long.
 Great product great price
 Too slowly
 These tablets are slow and over-complicated for small children to use. It seems to be lots of advertisements and not much function. We’re probably going to buy some different tablets that are more straightforward to use.
 Bought these for 2 of my grand children and they love them. A lot of educational games
 Got 2 7/23 as Christmas presents for grandchildren, gave one early, it has already quit working! Won't even turn on, won't charge! Very disappointed! Now worried about giving the other at Christmas!!!
 Bought 2 of these for my grandsons &amp; one of them won't charge anymore &amp; the other one isn't working right either. Was kind of a pain to get the one sent back because of being asked questions about the device that clearly couldn't be answered because it couldn't turn on because it wouldn't charge!!!
 Awesome durable tablet for kids! My 3 year old is rough and it lasted over a year before the chargers port broke from her shoving the cable in wrong and amazon honored their 2 year worry free and sent not only a brand new one in only 1 week but actually gave us a newer version! Will absolutely continue to purchase their products!
 We got the free time special for our daughter firt trip but surprise that the battery run out very fast, at the plane the table frost very often and the child switch apps to fast or quickly get frost to, disappointed for a Amazon lover
 Got this tablet for my disabled child , has durable case which really protect the tablet.If he feels frustrated will throw it hasn't malfunction or crack the screen at all.Love it.About the tablet will like to choose what goes in my front screen better than all their suggested apps.
 The kids love it. Its a little wonky to use at first. We bought 4 for the holidays and so far so good.
 Kids are loving this gift. Got one for my 3 year old and one for my 5 year old so they can get age appropriate games. It has been dropped several times and continues to look and function well. Best Christmas gift for the kids and me!
 I bought this for my 4 year old niece. She absolutely loves it and can’t put it down. The protective case is definitely a savior. Meets all expectations. Although setup can be a bit confusing at first, you get the hang of it pretty quickly. This will be beneficial for years to come as she grows.
 I am on my third one of these in a year. No matter how careful you are with them the charging port messes up and won't hold the charging cable snug enough to charge. It's literally the only reason I keep having to replace mine.
 So light weight, My niece loved it
 my four year old drops this regularly from counter height and it just bounces! love it!
 Does exactly what it said. My son loves it.
 My daughter loves the Kindle fire. The yellow case makes it easy to find. I love the parental controls. Books books books !!! Yeah!!!
 Perfect for my 3 year old!
 My daughter loves it. So glad she can take it everywhere
 Grandson loves it
 Great tablet for price
 Everything you want in a toddler tablet.
 Hours of fun
 Love everything about this Kindle for kids.  Hoping to reclaim my cell phone from my 2-year old grandson and be worry free with the two year replacement warranty that comes with this.
 We purchased 2 Tablets for our 4 year old twin Granddaughters. They both LOVE their Tablets!!<br/>I enjoy watching them learn while playing on their Tablets, very educational!!!! Also, it’s wonderful, they no longer fuss over using my IPad!! Very Happy with our purchase. Highly Recommend
 Excelente Gracias
 Screen cracked in a week. Tried the no questions asked 2 year warranty and was told it was not covered by amazon and had to contact the company that makes them for the 2 year warranty. Only reason it gets 2 stars is because my daughter did love playing with it when it wasnt broken.
 I got this for my oh so busy 2yr old...and oh what a day the quuetness was unbelievable. The features that it comes with is also a great addition.....
 It seems to be well protected. However, it's SUUUUUPER slow. Even brand new, even point to point with no need for Wi-Fi.
 I ordered two of these for my boys, and they are great! They are everything that I expected them to be and MORE! I love that you can access ALL profiles from either device, that will definitely keep them from fighting over who's is who's!<br/><br/>I definitely give these 5 stars!
 Not bad for a kid tablet. Has a tendency to freeze, requiring a hard shutdown. Other than that, easy to use and LOVE THE WARRANTY!!!!
 Our grandkids are very happy with this tablet!
 Nice
 I am an apple user so I was nervous getting something non apple as I wasn't sure if I would know how to operate it as well. Very easy to use and defiantly kid friendly for my toddler exactly as pictured!
 so far I don't have any problem with it my granddaughter loves it..
 Its okay. A little hard to figure out. Mine did not come with any instructions. Still trying to figure out how to load games and videos that my son can watch in the car or on the plane without wifi for our trip next week which was the purpose in buying this tablet.
 It’s not user friendly at all, especially for kids and it’s supposed to be a kids tablet. My 3 year old just throws it because he can’t get it to come on or work. My husband couldn’t figure it out either and said we’re buying another ipad instead . Waste of $100
 Amazon replaced the old tablet that wouldn't charge.  Thank You for you great service!
 The case is what makes it kids edition i think thay should include screen protectors to,.... My son has 2 of them and he's not easy on them and thay work every day...
 Awesome for my 3 1/2 year old! Loaded with tons of stuff for preschoolers, including Blippi my son's favorite YouTube show. Also has kid classics shows like Cailou, Dora, Sesame Street etc... Kid proof case is really toddler proof my son has thrown it across the room in a tantrum and did not hurt a thing. Amazing if you ask me.
 Don't waste your money. This device stopped working completely shortly after the replacement window closed. Very disappointing - won't buy one again. Kids were very disappointed.
 I bought fire kindle kids addition for my autistic son and it is amazing and perfect for him. Great apps for kids.
 My kids really enjoy their tablets the only thing they complain about is the marketplace amazon doesn’t have a lot of the games or apps that you can get on the play store on from google which sucks
 Great learning tool
 Son loves it
 Love this tablet!  Great for kids they even read books on it!
 I bought this a little over a year ago. I’m not sure what happened but it won’t turn on anymore. My daughter hasn’t even used it that much. It looks new still.  Wasn’t abused. It was great when it worked. Not so much anymore.
 It's nice enough but doesn't take many apps for it to lag, offline is annoying because some games and such don't work but the kids can still see the option
 Terrible. Overheats. Lags. Slowwwwwwww. Waiting on a rep to call me back!!!
 Purchased for my 3 &amp; 4 year olds. I love the Amazon free time. Like how I can block them from the internet. Tons of educational content plus age alpropiate games. The case seems sturdy.
 I have 4 y/o boys and this tablet is very durable and easy to navigate.  We love it!
 Horrible battery life
 I bought these for my children and they're just okay. Processor is slow, it's constantly telling us there is not enough room for my daughter to play certain games. It's hard to navigate. I still can't find where the pictures are stored. Just disappointing.
 So far so good my granddaughter love it and she is 5
 Great stuff
 This thing is awesome for the kids. Can do anything they want. Or at least what you allow them. Great educational games. Would buy again if I had to
 The idea of easy no question replacement is great, no way to lock out screen sucks. And let’s add that it runs super slow and crashes all the time. Likely because it’s android platform and sad to see Apple still has it when it comes to ease of use and reliability.
 Our granddaughter loves this!!  Perfect for a 5 year old!
 Both of my children got one for Christmas and they are perfect for them. We had problems with one but Amazon quickly replaced it with out any trouble. You can not beat the service from Amazon most places give you 15 days and you're out of luck, but Amazon gives you 2 years. I will not be buying electronics from anywhere else.
 It is what was expected. It's loaded with more than expected.
 Amazing tablet for kids. Love that my 2.5 year old can download any app he would like and when it's ready he can just play it. An absolute life saver at the doctors and restaurants. I love that the kids profile has no password so it's easy for my son to open it up and start playing, reading, books, and coloring pictures.
 Got this for my 4 years old princess, and she keeps crying because all her app install keep freezing making her to always reboot it.<br/>Have no choice than getting her another table(Dragon Touch K8 8 inch Kids Tablet, Kidoz..) which she love so much.
 Kids love this tablet.
 Excellent gift for three-year-old purchase one another two years ago and my youngest grandson loves it so purchase two more one for my grandson and my granddaughter best thing there is
 Battery life is poor..thats why I didnt give it 5 stars
 I bought this for my son less than a year ago. He used it sparingly for a few months until it started having issues. It wont hold a charge and has inter-mitten issues even when plugged in to the outlet. Very disappointed!
 Thanks to a support guy called Renuka, my issue was completely solved.  The product is good.  The problem was the support I received from Amazon when I first complained about the issue.
 Great basic tablet for kids
 Age appropriate. Least liked.....no written booklet to use as a guide to help navigate tablet. Although there is an on-line manual, a written one for starting to use it would be helpful. Some childre are more visual learers. All in all, a great product.
 It’s nice to have, love that the kids can only get to the kids stuff, and the case is wonderful but it’s just so slow
 This has been very durable and great for our toddlers use. Even better that we got our 2nd one recently on sale for about $69!  I only wish there were a way to hide all of the apps/advertisements that we are not using/interested in for a cleaner and simpler view.
 My kid loves it. The free time is great until it’s up. Wish you could pay yearly and not monthly. After 1 1/2 yrs it stopped charging. Called them up and in 2 days had brand new one with the case protector.  Well worth it
 Setting this thing up takes hours... it ask you for hella information. Wouldn’t buy again.
 Fits nice and tight so my 3 year old can't take it off or break it
 Had to buy my son a new one because his other one wasnt getting connection to charge it i think i should of got that 2 year worry free if something happened to it yall would replace it i only had is other one for 10 months and it already wouldnt charge other than that its a really good tablet and case!
 Purchased as a gift for my 4 year old grandson.  He LOVES it, and so do I, now I can have my phone back.
 Great device!!
 Great product!  Durable, dynamic and interactive.  It is a real tablet that keeps the granddaughters (ages 3 and 8) VERY busy!!
 My three year old grandson loves his tablet.  Now we dont have to worry about him breaking our Kindles!
 Great present for the grandchild.  She (or her parents) won't leave home without it.
 I so love is tablet it is small but it works for my 5 year old and my 12 year old. I get to monitor what they are doing and how long they are on their tablet. I will recommend this tablet to family and All my friends.
 excellent product. and if you break it they will return it no questions asked for 2 years. it has so many apps, books and videos that the kids can watch their stuff and i can watch mine. excellent product highly recommend
 If you have kids 4 years or younger, run far FAR away from this tablet! Here's my and my wife's story about the total garbage software on this device:<br/><br/>This tablet seemed like a great idea at first. We thought this would be a great way for us to help our child refine his motor skills, learn his ABC's, etc. But there is a major flaw with this table...<br/><br/>There is a shortcut to turn on accessibility mode / screen reader. Basically you hold down the power key with both your thumbs on the table for a few seconds. This is very easy to do if you're a small child who likes to press buttons. "So what? Just turn it back off," you're probably thinking. And for any other Android or Apple tablet you'd be right. However, turning off accessibility mode is an absolute nightmare on this thing! The shortcut doesn't work to turn the mode back off and once it's on everything requires a two-finger swipe, which wouldn't be a problem except that two-finger gestures barely work at all on this device. After multiple YouTube videos and the two of us taking turns for nearly an hour to pull down the settings menu, I finally figured out that you have to swipe while making a triangle with your fingers in order for the swipe-down gesture to work. "Great! I'm finally in the settings and can turn off this demon spawn mode," I'm thinking. But before you can turn off accessibility mode, the Kindle has one more surprise for you: scrolling through the menu and tapping on the item you want to change doesn't work! You have to make a single-finger swipe to slowly go through each letter of the menu (all while the kindle reads each letter to you) until you get to the accessibility option 3/4 of the way through the options. After finally getting into the correct menu you're then greeted with a poorly labeled two step process to finally disable this ridiculousness.<br/><br/>The amazing amount of incompetence it must have taken to only allow the shortcut to turn this mode ON, but not OFF, is totally mindblowing. I'll be telling all my friends with kids to buy anything other than this horribly designed product (and if you like your friends, you should tell them this too...this is a common problem, you can read all about it on the web). God help you if you have one of these and accessibility mode accidentally gets turned on.
 I loved it and it was great for the baby, but after a week the charger started to act up, and it would die after a couple hours. First I thought it was the plug, but then realized it was the port, and after reading the reviews I saw a trend.
 Great tablet for children! My son loves his and picks it up always over other electronics during computer time in our home. Great job!
 My 2 and 4 year olds love these things! I can finally clean the house!
 This was a replacement and was supposed to be green, but I saved the old cover, so it's not a big deal. These kids edition tablets are awesome, as is the 2 year replacement policy. Both of my grandchildren (ages 3 &amp; 5) love them. The included Freetime content has enough options to be interesting to both.
 I bought 7 of these and 4 last year. 2 of them them won’t recharge After a year and the new pink one the screen doesn’t work when you touch it
 The product is great my son loves it. I word prefer a better interface then free time. It’s a good idea but makes you download everything to use it and a child downloads everything so storage fills up very fast. Other then that great tablets
 Still havrnt figured out how to change the default settings. My 4 yr old granddaughter wont use it, she prefers her mommas phone which allows for screen swiping. So different fr phone i fear it wont get used the way its setup. Of course no instructions came w it
 My son loves this tablet! It's so easy and functional for a toddler. The case keeps it safe from all harm
 So far i hadn't had any problems with the case but i thought it came with screen protector but it didnt. Overall it is durable.
 my grand daughter loves it.  Last longer because of the case.
 Very nice.great extras with it. Disappointed that the day after I bought it it was 40% cheaper though
 Exactly as described
 I just received this brand new tablet a couple weeks ago for my six year old. The charge sucks it doesn't hold charge at all! The one my older son has one which he has had for about 2 years holds charge a lot LONGER!
 Great Product for the price. The 2-year no questions asked warranty is outstanding especially on children products. Big thumbs up
 Great
 My grandkids would fight for the one tablet I purchase (pink) first. I purchased the second tablet to make peace. We have to still master sharing but for now we're having fun.
 I love this tablet and the case is amazing. My 3 year old loves watching Daniel Tiger on it. He dropped it outside and the case protected it well. Will be purchasing another soon for my daughter.
 My daughter loves it.
 Great gift for my son...love the protective case!
 I bought two of them.<br/>A bit difficult to use for two five year old kids.<br/>Once they knew how to use it was a great product.<br/>Educational.<br/>Highly recommended.
 My son has actually learned a lot from the apps he plays and watches.  It can be very educational, with time limits.  He loves playing games and watching videos.  They are a life saver on trips.
 Well worth the money.
 Does not stay charged nearly as long as 8 hours as they claim. Does not go to the internet as easy as I wanted to. My older Fire tablet was better then this one. I had the first one for six months before I had to send it in for a new one because the whole tablet quit charging.
 My grandson loves his tablet.  I love the childproof cover!
 Grandson loves it
 Great tablet for my 3 year old, lets him choose and download the games he wants to play, with easy parental controls. Runs out of space pretty quickly tho, I have to go in once a week and delete the games he's not playing anymore.
 This tablet is terrible. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's really slow and the charger will stop working after a few weeks. It won't hold a charge at all, don't waste your money. Yeah it's nice to have unlimited TV shows but it runs so slow you won't be able to enjoy it.
 These are junk, bought two for my kids and they quit working/charging within 6 months.  Tried to get warranty service and have had no luck. Nothing but a hassle, "No Questions Warranty" is garbage.  You have to jump through hoops.
 Charging issues with these kindles, loose connection.
 little bit difficult to understand at the beginning but amazon staff got it covered
 This is the greatest! So many learning games and shows for my five year old! He figured it out in no time and as much as love to hold an actual book in my hand we do have fun picking out new ones to read together. There are soooo many to choose from! Completely worth it! Get the protective films. Those smudgy fingers ha ha!
 The product is fine but I am disappointed that it arrived loaded with my personal data as It was a gif.
 Battery life poor and slow speeds.
 Bought for the grandson as a Christmas gift.  He loves it!  Sturdy, made for kids.
 Works great and has so many games to choose to add for all ages.
 Would be a whole lot better if it worked with the Android play store instead of Amazon only apps.
 Perfect!!! This is the first tablet that my son hasn't dropped/broken within a week. I love the free time, there are do many pros to this buy, I would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone looking!
 Easy to use, and well loved by a small child. The fact it is guaranteed against breakage is wonderful
 Works great! It is going to be a birthday present for my son, who has been asking for a tablet over a year now. He will be 6 and will love it!
 Best tablet ever. The protector it’s amazing by itself.<br/>Thanks
 my daughter loves her new tablet
 Kids product, seems to be good!!
 I wanted a durable tablet for my 3 year old that he can play games on and watch videos on YouTube and I found one! Not only was I so happy with this but it comes with a 2 yr worry free warranty it does not get better than that 😊
 My grand son loves this tablet.  He's just turned three, and there are so many educational things to play, for free.  We have to literally take it away some times to do other things, and it's really helped with his counting, colors and numbers.  Great product!
 Its cheaply made , its like light plastic..... as soon as i bought it and turned it on 2 minutes in it froze - i had to turn it off .. for the price I’ll definitely put in 3 more dollar and biy a mini galaxy and put it in the kids mode .... returned it Quickly
 I have bought 3 of these for  5 yr old and 3 yr old grandchildren....they love them.
 My children use it to watch their learning videos to play their learning games but also for reading their books I love love love it!! I've owned one for a few years now and i use it for everything from watching movies to reading!
 The kids love it and with the ability to set time frames to use and time limits per day, you can't go wrong.
 I have had this device now for about three months and just a few days ago I noticed that the device wouldn't turn and will not charge. How do I go by returning and getting a new one under the two year warranty.
 Bought this tablet for my daughter 12/2017. Its only been 7 months and tablet has stopped charging. My daughter loved this tablet. :(.
 I ordered a new one thought it was covered for one year. In July it stopped charging and was replaced with a refurbished one.  People were nice but I thought it would be replaced with new one up to one year.It was great teaching puzzles and any thing for a three year old.  Thank you
 It's okay. My kid loves it but it doesn't hold a charge. It'll be 100% and over night it's barely 20%.....why is that?
 Grandkids loved them
 3 yo loves it
 If you have kids 3 to 10 years old... One world, awesome!
 3 y/o grand daughter loves this tablet.
 Amazon has this thing so locked down. Just be friends with Google already.
 So I bought this mainly for abc mouse and the app is not available on the fire 7. I'm pretty disappointed about this. Will have to see what else is on it. And hopefully the ABC mouse app will be available soon. After a while I might change the rating
 I have two toddlers who use this often and they absolutely love it.  Works great and already pre loaded with every child feature you need (plus it’s great for adults!).
 After one year of use, the charging port no longer works.  Very disappointed in the longevity of this product.
 Absolutely pefect for kids!
 I love the foam encasement that has saved the day several times when little mishaps happen. The tablet is very friendly and my3 year old grandson maneuvers thru the apps like a pro. We both love the access to the books that we share during our favorite reading time.
 Great for the grandkids very durable
 This is the SECOND TABLET IVE PURCHASED FROM AMAZON AND I AM TRULY DISAPPOINTED!! These charger ports are robbing me of my money. This tablet hasn’t lasted more than a year just like the last one. I’m so over amazon tablets now.
 It was a gift for my Godson and a close friend
 My son loves it, he is 5 years old, and he’s learning which is the most important.
 The kids really like the Fire kids tablet.  I would give it a better rating except for problems with charging.  I bought two of these for my grandkids ages 10 and 7.  The 7 year old used hers for a little over 3 months and we had to send it back because where you plug in the charger became loose and would not charge.  Since it is the kids edition, it came with a 2 year warranty and Amazon replaced the tablet. I thought she was probably not plugging and unplugging her charger right, so she no longer is allowed to plug in.  We do it for her.  Now, my 10 year old's tablet is doing the same thing and she does know how to plug it in and is pretty careful with it.  So, I'm inclined to think it is the design of the tablet.  They had another brand of tablets for a couple of years and they still charge fine with no problems.  Maybe it's something Amazon needs to looks into, especially on the kids tablets.  If the other brand of tablets had messed up, too, I'd say the kids wee doing something wrong.  So, these are neat little tablets, but if you buy one for a child be sure and get the kids edition with the 2 year warranty.
 It does not hold its charge. It also takes to long to charge. It does not always work. My son does not like it. He prefers his father iPad. He is 5 years old. It is not at all what I thought.
 Hard to figure out,  complicated
 Love, love these Kindle Fires used by my students!  The case is perfect and keeps the device safe from accidental drops!
 So far so good the tab has met my son's needs.
 Love this so much for our nearly 3 year old. I set time limits which has made giving up the tablet a non issue. Good quality. So many different games, videos, books. Definitely worth the price.
 My granddaughter love this tablet just as much as she did her old tablet .
 1 word .<br/>AMAZING<br/><br/>i got this for my two year old son for his birthday yesturday and its probabley ben the best gift ive ever givin him. so CLASSY
 The load up time is a little slow, 3 year old aren’t the most patient creatures. I would suggest spending a few more dollars to<br/>get the 8. I love that it includes so many downloadable activities.
 This was a great replacement for my 5year olds tablet that his sibling broke! I love the freetime program, and will continue subscribing to it, for him, when the free year is over! The kids case is amazing as well!! We love it!
 I love it, except I am still trying to figure out the freetime parental dashboard. But this gift was a huge hit with my daughter and so far we love it!
 Purchased these for my Son, Grandson and Nephews for Christmas.  This was the best purchase I could have ever made.  They all really love of the free apps and the things that they can use them for.
 This device is so poorly designed.  Device loads videos to watch for 48h after you start.  Super slow and frustrating to use.  Absolute disappointment versus other amazon products we own - kindle, echo, dot, etc.  Steer clear and buy an ipad.
 Perfect for little accident prone little hands. Love the Amazon apps. This case is very good for kids.
 I love that it is covered with a rugged bumper and the replacement policy is the best!  It is too easy for kids exit most apps accidentally.  Leads to frustration amongst the toddler set.
 Kids love them and they are pretty user friendly
 Very kid friendly. Tablet is sturdy and durable. Wish my child could have his picture as his wallpaper. That’s the only downside. My 2 year old really loves it.
 I loved how kid friendly it is and the different apps available. One thing I dislike is how I cannot have Netflix on my sons account unless I log him into mine. Doesn’t sound like a bad idea but he is 2 years old and gets into other apps on my login.
 After just 1 month of use the charger porter became loose and would no longer charge.
 These tablets are great and my kids really love them. I'm giving 4 stars just because I had some troubles getting apps to download and had to call customer service to fix. Other than that, it is a great product.
 good for kids
 It alittle hard to use at first but after you get the hang of it it is such an amazing product.. I love the multiple profiles so both of my children can use it and shows content according to their age. I also love how I can control the time my kids spend on the tablet
 I liked the way it is easy to use. It is for my 3 year old granddaughter and she loves it
 Love how it comes with free games for 2 years. My kid LOVES it. The only downfall is if you want to watch youtube you have to switch to the adult account and it takes a min. to do. Other than that my kid and niece LOVE it!

No complaints from this parent at all ❤️❤️❤️
 This is my third kids Edition tablet and I have been very pleased with all three.
 My granddaughter loves it, she has learned a lot for the apps she has on it.
 Loved it. Only thing I do not agree with is not being able to use certain apps that my android platform stuff can. I guess when you buy an electronic, its just not really your property. Too bad. Will not be purchasing another.
 We ordered this tablet not even a year ago and the battery life is awful! It will have a fully charged battery and within a day it is dead. That is with my son only actually playing on it for about 30 minutes top. Other than the battery life it’s been a pretty good tablet.
 I bought this as a Christmas present for my 4 yr old grandson and I love how durable it is. He has dropped, threw and broken 3 other tablets. But this one I’m sure he can’t break it!!! The picture quality is good, the sound is good and it’s perfect for his small and mines.
 Does everything ! Little sisters love them !!
 I bought this for my 5 year old niece as an early Christmas present.  She loves it!<br/>I have purchased other kid friendly tablets in the past for other nieces.  No comparison...Fire Kids will be<br/>my #1 choice in the future.  Nothing beats the 2 year warranty also.
 My grandkids have loved their way through several. The warranty alone is worth it.
 It’s okay for now.
 It’s totally worth the extra $50 I spent for the kids’ edition tablet. This is the second one we’ve bought, and it’s great to know that my 2 and 1 year olds can’t go onto the “real” internet without me doing it. I wish I could find more apps they are actually into, but overall love this products
 It made one little girl very happy and makes her feel like a big girl!
 This is exactly what we were looking for..... If you want a top of the line tablet then look elsewhere, but if you want something perfect for the kids this is the one.
 My Granddaughter loves her Fire 7 kids tablet, she don't want to put it down, and is learning so much from it.  She telling me everyday how happy she is and that I bought it for her.
 My 4year old has used this everyday for over a month and it has held up perfectly. And he's pretty rough.
 Kids love it!
 Perfect
 Well made.
 Great for my family. My boys love them.
 A nice gift
 Works great and 9 year old daughter loves it! No complaints!
 I have a tablet that needs to be exchanged. Trying to figure out how to do that is difficult with this product. Tablet will not charge or turn on. The guarantee says they will replace it but finding out the process or where to send it back to is difficult.
 Got these for my grandkids and they love them. Real easy for them to use. It’s really great they come with all of these apps. The only bad thing is they run out of space fast so had to buy a card to go in them. Some of the apps take a long time to download.
 My daughter loves her new tablet but for some reason the tablet is not allowing me to get the unlimited freetime so I have to pay for it and when you buy it says you get free for year so that was disappointing but other than that it's great
 Cute tablet, my four year old loves it... good variety of games and videos lots of educational content
 Its perfect for what we needed. Works great.
 100% garbage, slow out of the box and instantly need to buy sd card, you get what you pay for... Constant IT support from mom and dad, 2 stars because it keeps them busy once a month when I fix it
 Fantastic kids tablet. You can control everything they play or watch even what time it shuts off.  When you want to you can set it so they can only read books vs. being able to play games or watch movies
 Works amazing, well worth the money. Has alot of usable content available without internet connection. Holds a charge for a reasonable amount of time, The case is very durable. Love the parental controls! I'm very happy with them, and the 2 year replacement policy is perfect for active ( and destructive) kids :)
 Grandson loves it
 My terrible 2s grandson loves this and it’s insanely durable.
 This tablet was amazing up until it just started to not take a charge. I am not sure what went wrong but i take really good care of this tablet, my son uses it mostly but up until last week it stopped charging.
 Kids love it.
 My grandson likes his tablet. He's always wanting more games. He is a tech kid for sure.
 This is the best tablet for kids! and adults when on the regular setting
 Purchased to keep a child busy for a long flight and such a great deal, totally worth it!
 Sent it back because the 8 was the same price as this one plus the battery time is better on the 8
 It's light and durable with a good picture. I don't care for having to log in with my Amazon account, enter passwords and the likes to make it work. I purchased it for a 4 year old, and it seems a bit much to have to enter passwords to get started on certain activities
 Battery doesn't last long not like other kindles ive had and it tends to freeze a lot it gets the job done though I suppose
 Great tablet for kids
 Tablet was great at first, now it will not hold a charge. I can charge up to 100% and it will say it’s dead within an hour.
 Kids kindles are good for the price on prime day deal.
 I love this tablet for my daughter. It has the perfect case and the apps are perfect. I love that I can set up the child age preferences for her. I love that I can control what she can do and when. I have not had any problems with any part of this tablet.
 My stepson loves his free time tablet. He is 3 years old he takes it everywhere. It’s easy for him to use it hurt my feeeling how independent he become. The games the movies and the videos. I also love that it’s child proof.
 My 2 yr old granddaughter loves this tablet
 The box said we would get 1 free year of prime but after a month amazon tried to charge my account $99.00 for year membership. That is so miss leading and not happy with false advertising on the box. Now my daughter can’t watch anything on the device when we go on road trips. That’s the reason we purchased the device.
 My son loved it
 was about the only thing I bought that actually worked !!!! and my niece absolutely loves it.
 Very good tablet and my son loves it!  Some apps do not work on it and the sound quality is the reason for the 4 stars.  Sound comes from one side and is not as good as I would have hoped.  Very light!  Almost too light!
 Excellent for kids! Dont have to worry about all the rude cartoons on youtube. Only thing I did'nt like is that I order 3 and all 3 have my amazon account with my credit card info. The other 2 are gifts.
 Goft
 I bought one for my granddaughter, age 8 and my grandson, age 4.  They both love it and have played with it every day since Christmas!
 Bought for my 3 year old, easy to use and he loves it!
 Awesome tablet! I love the case too. My kiddos love them and they are easy for them to watch/hold. I had a little trouble learning how to download items on it/run it because I am used to apple products, but so far am very pleased.
 Kids love them
 My kids is enjoying it. I like it because you can set limit on their playing and watching time and they understand it! The only thing is that it takes a while to charge.
 My 3 year old son absolutely loves this.  Easy to navigate  for little ones .  The rubber case is very durable, and has already gone through quite a few bumps and drops with no problems. Definitely recommend!!
 Absolutely love it! It is easy to set up and navigate. My 6 year old can download apps worry free with the parental controls and age limits set in place. I love that there are time limits so I can control screen time! Having access to all of the books games and our movies anywhere  is so awesome!! I would highly recommend
 My 4 year old broke her's and we called explained and they sent us right out another one.  It was quick and easy
 better then a babysitter
 With the exception of being able to download or activate "Flash Player" I am very happy with it.  The purpose of buying this was to have my grandchild be able to play "ABC Mouse" which he cannot play.  I have not seen a real solution for this problem or at least one that I<br/>can find myself.
 When I placed this order I requested the yellow rubber casing but for some reason it was changed to the blue case, this was a gift for someone who loves the color yellow and I feel like I should’ve been aware of the color change that I didn’t request!!!!
 Tablet is perfect for kids and the case is great. Lil one dropped it off (a tall) table first day and the case tool all the impact just like I hoped it would. The content on free time is also really really good. Very happy with the purchase
 Takes to long to charge and does not last as long as my samsung does. But the case helps keep it safe and my 3 yr old loves on it. There is a lot on there for children.
 My son loves the bright yellow case. Definitely a must have for kids. Very durable and good battery life. Love the two year replacement. I never have had trouble getting them replaced. These are the only tablets I have ever purchased for my children.
 I’m almost certain my daughter won’t be able to break this due to the very durable case. My only complaint is that the device itself isn’t very fast. So when she is playing games there can be a bit of a lag from time to time.
 Thank you for introducing me to baby shark do do dodo do do. Lol. The 3yo I bought it for is in love with it.
 My 8 year old loved this and uses it all the time! Kid proof case is great as well!
 Works great! Case is great for little hands and durable when it’s dropped.
 It’s a great tablet for both my 9yr old and my 3yr old. Lots of different parental controls for me to set limits and control what they are doing with them. Plus now I’ve got my phone back lol!
 Bought 2 of these tablets worked great for a little bit. First tablet stopped charging  after a couple months the second one went out at about 10 months. Called amazon and they completely refunded my money they were great about it. Had the money back in my bank the next day.
 I love that my toddler throws it and it isn't the slightest bit affected. I also love all the different options and how easy it is for her to maneuver at 2 years old. I don't like how slow it is to load any and everything! Hence the 4 stars.
 The tablet is sufficiently fast for kids and adequate for adult basic functions. Plus it can connect to Bluetooth accessories like a keyboard and mouse. My kids love it.
 Very kid friendly my granddaughter just loves it!
 Bought for my granddaughter for christmas.
 Excellent
 It's the best thing ever!!! My grandbaby loves it. She is only 2 years old and is learning so much. It amazes me how smart the new generation is.
 This quit working after a month. It is not worth the money. 😡 And because I had it sent to another state, my daughter can’t send it back to Amazon for a replacement, because I bought it.  😡😡😡😡😡😡
 The tablet was the perfect gift for my grand daughter. She is 3 yrs. old.  She turns it on, and easily plays game after game.  It is awesome.
 This is a great learning tool
 My son loves this and plays with it all the time.
 Granddaughter just love every square inch of this tablet.
 The screen is vivid and the tablet is amazing
 This is my 4th time purchasing! I love these. Extremely durable too!
 Buy the larger storage space one.  After downloading a few apps, books and games, we ran out of space.
 Wow! I just love this tablet... both my Grandsons received one for Christmas. They are 2 1/2 and 18 months. Very educational and comes with so many toddler friendly activities. Very impressed!
 Great kids stuff, but diappointed that in order to use as a full tablet, child must have an Amazon account. Also cannot access Youtube or Kids Youtube while in childrens mode. Could use some improvements.
 This was a great gift for my daughter. She is 3 and can navigate it well. It is fast, and easy to add content from YouTube to help her transition from the IPad. The bumper case is very effective. I definitely recommend it.
 Nice
 My 2 and 5 year olds love these tablets!  They are very kid friendly and easy to use!
 Item is great for the little ones and I love the no question asked warranty.
 Bought this as a Christmas present for 2 year old grandson, he absolutely loved it.
 I have the amazon fire and ordered the kids version for my boys the features are perfect,
 My kids enjoy their tablets perfect for them! Easy to use
 This is great!  Got it for my grandson (31/2 yr old) and he loves it
 My kids love it I just don’t like the set part of it because it seems like everyday I have to login to a new app rather it be my cable carrier of pbs kids
 I purchased this for my 4 year old grandson. It's great in his eyes. It also has a warranty that covers it no matter what happens to it and that was what sold this product to me. Games, videos , just perfect for him. Thank you!
 We have been using our fire since May 2 when it was given to our granddaughter as a birthday gift. She only uses it 3 days a week when she is at our house. It is broken already. The charge area of the tablet will no longer charge the tablet. I would like to return it.
 Not as great as I imagined. Lots of apps you can’t hide, not user friendly for kids.
 Worry free warranty is great. Had a new tablet within a few days of sending in the old one.
 This is by far my son's favorite Christmas gift. I didn't know, when I ordered this item that it came with a year of free FreeTime. (Free kids apps.) The case on this tablet is basic but it saved the screen from being dropped on our driveway, so it definitely works.
 it was a gift for my grandson he is 4 and he loves it
 I appreciated the content on the freetime and the sturdy case. Definitely worth the money to me.
 I love that it came with a case.  I’m not what you’d call tech savvy so I wasn’t happy that it came with no instructions! It should come with instructions for people who aren’t savvy like that.  I love the parental controls (when I was finally able to figure it out). All in all it’s a nice tablet for kids
 Ok
 Great for long car rides and plane trips.
 Tablet with good parental control functions.
 I like the kid specific profile feature. It saves previous activity for the profile. I don’t have a least favorite aspect so far. They are just different than iPads and take some getting used to.
 GREAT tablet for kids!! Have tons of games, videos etc. to be downloaded.
 I thought it was bigger wrong size.<br/>Thank you....
 Good package
 Love the tablet itself but the chargers don’t last long.  This is my third one and it’s the same with each.  I’ve had to buy numerous chargers.
 great for my 2 year old
 Amazon requires that card information be saved in tablet. That is ludicrous when considering that you may not be purchasing for a family member that you would be able to monitor their access to your account
 My 5 yrs old LOVE THIS TABLET nd im very happy she's satisfied with it
 Perfect size for my toddler. Do yourself a favor and get an extra charging cord and an microdisk!
 Bought this for my 1yo so he would have something to “play” with instead of trying to take my phone or iPad! It’s great! Can’t wait for him to use the learning games
 My son enjoys his fire 7 is easy for him to use.
 Really love it, just with there were more games not needing Internet. We have to go to the library to play
 The case is very tuff/durable... However it does NOT protect screen. The case is great for drop protection. If you were to step on the screen or drop something on it... Other then that. It's great. So if anything just get a screen cover.
 Not at all what I was expecting. Sending it back.
 Quick, easy, simple set up up. Had it out of the box set up and my son using it in less than 30 mins. The kids profile is so easy to use. I also love that it came already linked to my Amazon account. The cherry on top was the free year of free time and everything included with it. 100% recommend.
 I loved all the content on the amazon Free play. There are wonderful shows and games the kids momento play while they learn. I think there are too many preloaded irons on the home page. I spend quite a bit of time trying to get my kids back to the free play or apps I've downloaded while they've locked themselves in a map.
 Somehow worse than the previous generation Fire Kids Edition tablet I purchased. Battery runs down while idle very quickly. Disappointing.
 Stopped charging after 1 month and the  cord is not damaged.
 Granddaughter loves it as well as her mother and father
 My 10 year old son cracked the screen in less then a week. Amazon quuckly replaced and no problems since kiddo loves it
 product randomly deletes content had to have it replaced out the box due to random restarting not a kid/ electronically declined friendly.
 Item nust as described child loves it thanks.
 I got this for my young grandchildren to be able to use for fun and games. I love that it came with the case already installed and once I logged in with my existing Amazon password, it was set up and ready to go!
 Is a great starter tablet for my 6 year old. The parental settings were a  plus, and easy to find. I only wish that these tablets came with actual user guides for all of the different features.
 my grandaughter just loves it...first thing she goes to when coming to mimi and poppy's house.  The only downsize is it is hard to get plugged in due to the plug in part is so far in due to the big plastic cover, which i love, don't get me wrong, as she has dropped it a couple of times already.  So glad i ordered it for her!
 Very good tablet for the price. My daughter loves it. She is able to watch movies in the car, work on ABC mouse to get her ready for school, and it can take a beating with the kid case on it. I'm buying myself 1 and will get my son 1 when he is old enough to use it.
 The sales person at best buy , I told him I only need this device to download the whatsup app. So I could communicate with my daugther n this device is not compatible with the app
 But the battery life is terrible. Not sure why but we can only get a few hours use out of it. Also if we turn off the screen to set it down for a an hour or so the battery will lose about 10-15%. Just seems strange.<br/>Just have to keep it charged.
 So far the tablet has been great but the battery life leaves a lot to be desired.
 It needs better protection from kids buying games on line. Supervise and be wise !
 Awesome. My 1 year old loved it
 Size and features
 This tablet is amazing!!! My daughter loves it. I was so hesitant about getting her hooked on a tablet. But this one has so many games and videos and books! So educational! And the warranty that comes with it is just amazing. I would buy this again definitely!
 Works great for kids. Even my great granddaughter, who just turned 2, can navigate around in it. With a year of kids freetime included it pays for itself and the 2 year (no questions asked) warranty it is all a win win!
 Well this lasted until June. Now it won't charge. I bought a total of 3 and the other 2 are doing just fine. They are suppose to be replaced if anything happens to them, but they don't tell you how to go about doing that.
 So far so good. My son loves this and I like that I have some educational apps for him to use
 My kids love their Kindles. The warranty and customer service are amazing!
 Had to change stars!! It broke and would not charge!! sent back to amazon!
 Very slow processing speed
 everything loads super slow...but my kid doesn't seam to mind it so.  meh
 Kids love it
 Love the tablet. Easy to set up and easy to use.
 We love this device! It is simply amazing and easy to use. The kids love it and with Free Time Unlimited, we don’t have to worry about their use.
 Bought this for my 5 year old son and he absolutely loves it.  Loves the books and the games on Freetime.  My 10 year old daughter is now asking for her own tablet as well.
 Great for kids
 My wife and I just bought these at target and so far so great. As long as u have u WiFi in will be good to go
 Got this as a gift for my almost two year old. He quickly learned how to “download” the preloaded games and apps and to switch between them with ease. He tosses &amp; drops this thing any and everywhere and it’s still trucking on. Love it.
 Very durable, work great, easy to setup, compatible with various apps, let's mom or dad monitor settings, and relatively  inexpensive!<br/>I purchased two for 165 shipping and tax included.  It's a good deal aren't going to be able to find any other tablet for this price, if their is one I haven't found it.<br/>Good job!
 granddaughter loves it
 My 2 year old granddaughter was able to use her tablet right away once her programs were unloaded.
 I don't recommend the the Fire as a child's tablet.  It required an account with a credit card attached in order to activate it to do anything.  Not my idea of a child's tablet.  However, if this is the tablet you want, the case is great.  My kid really loves the tablet.  Aside from my one complaint, it is a very nice tablet.
 This has been a life saver! I bought this for a little girl I am watching and she loves it! Good as gold! She doesn't play it all day, but a good part of it. She loves it.
 Love the apps, got it up and running before I got the email telling me how to start it up with the free year.
 Purchased for my 2 1/2 year old grandson, he loves it.
 My 7 year old son likes it. I like the 2 year warranty. It is unable to download Google play or YouTube onto the kids profile. Very inconvenient. Keeps a charge well.  Has many kids apps preloaded.  The case works well.  I bought the screen protector that was recommended and it didn't fit.
 We got this for our 4 year old and she loves it! This is such a good buy, you will not be disappointed. It provides loads of learning fun! Great for road trips or busy parents who dont have time to work with their children daily.
 I don't really understand why the apps that I wanted don't show up on her profile. and then the battery is dying really really quickly.  Also, I can't get the audible books off her profile.  And can't find the kids your tube app.  anyways, over it.
 Excellent for the little one for a little recreation time.
 It's the perfect tablet for kids. My kids are enjoying it.
 very good quality
 Didn’t work. Had to return it. Amazon support was stumped as to why Freetown wouldn’t download anything to the device
 This is the perfect tablet for my daughter who is 4. My friend also got tgem for her children ranging in age from 4 to 8 boys and girls. I love how the programs are geared toward them.
 These tablets are amazing. Bought 2 at Christmas time for my granddaughter. User friendly and sturdy. My granddaughters absolutely love them!
 My kids love their kindles and when the screen cracked while under warranty, it was replaced no questions asked.
 Perfect for our kidsd
 I got this one for my daughter and she loves everything about it!<br/>I do as well except the fact that it can be rather slow at times.
 This was a Christmas gift for my Granddaughter, and she really loves it. Highly recommend!!
 Charger ports break easily. 6 months after purchasing and they are broke for a second time. It was a huge waste of money.
 I liked the this tablet with very kid-friendly. I don't remember it coming with any instructions. I just had a twelve-year-old put it together for a 5 year old. But I need to know how to set parental securities on it.
 it worked good for about a month then it wouldn't charge anymore the return policy is till November 2019 but every time i try to use the return page  it sends me somewhere else...and looking at the reviews this is a common situation
 Do not buy this junk. I purchased 2 and after 3 or 4 months they stopped  charging. I never had this happened  with any android  device.
 My grandson.
 my son loves it, great parent controls easy to set up. would recommend purchasing a screen protector spell with it.
 Works well
 This is a great item works just like any other Fire tablet it's just kid proof
 Always a dependable product. This is out third one.
 Glad these kids tablets when on sale before Christmas!  They kids LOVE THEM!!!
 I will be sending this tablet back and requesting either a replacement or a refund. The older model ones last very long and have way fewer issues than the newer model ones (I know this because we have one we purchased in 2015 that still works fine but the newer one we got is not working).
 Came in good condition , nice
 My 2 yr old granddaughter loves this. I bought a 2 pack bundle and sent one to my moms for her to have there. Easy for her to use and I dont have to worry about her dropping it
 Excellent gift for my 2.5 year old. She loves her 'computer' and I can easily control what she sees. The case is cute and effective. Love it!
 Doesnt come with playstore, so you have to install program...takes a few minutes to do so but works great.
 Great Tablet, Love the fact you can set a curfew on the device.
 My little boys loves it and so far its holding up well.
 Been 4 year old tested a few weeks now while traveling across country.  Solid buy
 Grandson love it.
 It stopped working after several days. It will not take a charge or come back on. The only reason it's getting a one-star rating is because it won't let me leave a zero star rating
 I love the time limits that I can put on the tablet for my kids. It is nice that I can limit the amount of screen time that they have. It is easy for them to use and keeps them entertained. The addition of the case is great as it eases my mind when they drop it.
 My daughter loves it and it works well.  I just hope the battery lasts longer than the last one.
 Love this thing... and even better my son loves it!! I can control it all (from the amount of time he is on it .. to.. the games he plays.. to.. what he can search for when he is online) or I can let him have free range with a switch of a setting option.
 You know It’s bad when your 2yr old Daughter figures out the functionally of a device before you do, Lol. She loves it though! That’s all that mattered to me.
 the battery dies after a few hours
 My Grandson plays with this all the time.
 Great tablet. My twin 3 year olds love it, but a 3 rating due to the storage.  It seems like after adding just a couple of apps it keeps saying storage low!! Frustrating...
 The case is awesome. My 2 year old almost always drops the thing while in the shopping cart. It has yet to break.
 This tablet works well enough but when we try to use it when it does not have a WiFi connection, the app icons do not always load. This makes it difficult to use and defeats the purpose.
 who can I talk to to get a replacement, we have not been able to get this one to work. we have 5 others that are working well.
 Grandchild (boy) 5yrs. old loves it.
 Works well and good battery life.
 Stay away from Kindle-Amazon! They WILL NOT honor the "2-year worry-free guarantee". They will send you a refurbished replacement or a lesser value/lesser model regular Fire 7 tablet. Don't waste your time arguing or them giving you the runaround! Very, very disappointed!
 Exactly what I wanted for my 2 yr old.
 Perfect! My 2 year old has enjoyed several hours of learning activities, age appropriate videos and books. He is able to use this by himself (too tech savvy for my liking) but also likes to curl up in my lap to watch videos. So worth the money!!
 I just received this tablet in the mail for my son. He loves YouTube kids and this app is not on here. It cannot be downloaded because it is not supported. I’m highly disappointed and will probably return this item.
 My son loves this. The two different profiles were perfect for parental control. I did a lot of research and I'm glad I made this investment.
 Yes! It is very good! Excellent for kids and good quality.
 Was a Christmas present for my grandson and he absolutely LOVES it!!!
 It does not work withou WiFi. We have to use our hot spot which really uses up all of our data. The books and shows seems older. We were using our Hulu account instead of the built in games. Doesn’t seem worth to buy.
 The process of exchanging it was Great, called explained the issue was returned with no issue. The replacement item was a disaster, after charging the device, it took about 2 hours for the screen to go black and totally stop working. Had to be returned AGAIN...
 Good
 This is a very rugged product that they stand behind. My grandson is very rough on tablets and with the warranty these are a great value
 my sons tablet is faulty it always says he never has any games and need to get a parent to download games. I always have to restart it..
 Easy to use, light weight, perfect for little ones. Warranty can't be beat.
 LOVE all the interactive games for this tablet!! Bought it for our toddler for our first vacation as a family (long drive) &amp; never heard a peep! She loves it still, 2 yrs later.
 This makes a great gift! Quality!
 Freetime seems to have some nice things, but it works more like a profile than like an app and it has made switching between tasks impossible for my kids, and frankly, me.
 Got this for my son on prime day for christmas.  It is a huge hit.  Thank you amazon!
 Bought 2 of these as gifts for my grandchildren.  They just got them so too soon to tell how they will work for them.  Do not care for the fact that they are connected to my personal account.
 Let me tell you how I read the reviews and saw someone say that the charging part was no good after a while boy was I wrong not to listen. It stopped working last night and not charging.
 It worked great for the first year and then suddenly when the year was up it magically stopped working so i would have to buy a new one.  Just buy your kid real tablet and put parental controls on it.
 bought this for my 4yr old Grandson and he LOVES it!
 Toddler loves it and he hasn't been able to break it. So A ++++
 Super easy for kids to use. Very well made and easy for kids to connect to the internet.
 My grand.daughter loves her tablet. The size is perfect for a two year old and I like the protective cover.
 I like this product more because it came with an outer box! Just what my kids needed.<br/>The second replacement didn’t have one and now I have to purchase one.
 My 2 year old son love the fire 7. However, most of the content are not working in Africa due to geographical restrictions. I think amazon should work on this.
 We love the kid content on the tablet. It's easy for the kids to navigate on their own once signed into their accounts. Not a fan of not having enough memory on the tablet without having to add a MicroSD card for additional storage.
 I purchased this for a trip and it was a great remedy for a child (2) to keep distracted on the airplane. She still enjoys it today and i am continuing to learn all the features.
 Frustrated I can't get my child's school program to work on it. He has assigned homework on Lexia Core5 but this kindle does not support the Lexia App, nor Flasher Players which prevents using the website base instead. Its preloaded with lots of other stuff, great 2 year warranty, and otherwise works well for my child.
 Durability and a strong battery are huge with this product
 cant beat return policy works great holds up to drops, spills and stepping on make sure you spend the extra on a good screen protector
 Kids really love them also where can you get a two year warrenty on anything in this day an time.
 The bundle of the Fire, case, and 1 year of kids unlimited is a good value. My only complaint, and it is a big one, is the fact that there is no way to lock the touchscreen. Amazon needs to at very least have this capability added to the Kids Edition Fires.
 Works fine in the first week after that it started to freeze and shows some lines in the screen
 Charging plug went out after 3 months but under warranty but having to jump through hoops to get it replace is a pain
 HIGHLY EDUCATIONAL AND ENTERTAINING. VERY PARENT FRIENDLY.
 Love this tablet for my 2 year old.  There are a lot of games and apps in the freetime subscription that are perfect for him to navigate on his own.
 I will never order from amazon a tablet.<br/>lest then 6 month I brought 3 tablet have the same problem.<br/>They say I have two year to return.<br/>Now I'm getting the run around.<br/>That OK I will go to Best Buy and buy my grandchildren and my self another.
 I liked the fact that my grandson can't seem to destroy it. Every other tablet that he has gotten his hands on didn't survive. He knows how to work on it and it offers many educational apps.
 Nice tablet for kids but doesn't keep charge at all. Only 1 month old and already has battery problems.
 My granddaughter loves her very own Kindle Fire. She was a quick study and loves watching her little videos. We do not have to worry about her stumbling across unintended content.
 My 4 year old loves it
 My girls love it. It’s eaay to use and great for even my 1.5 year old.
 I didn't like that you have to have an Amazon account to be able to watch videos etc. I guess we figured it would be like a tablet and would be able to watch youtube videos etc.but the bottom line is my 6 year old niece loves it
 I do like the ease of use and so far it has held up pretty well for our 2 year old. The only thing I miss is the ability to have Youtube and Netflix on the tablet, although I have read about some workarounds, I'd rather not mess with it.
 The only downside I can see to this tablet is you can’t customize a screensaver. Other that that, it seems very kid friendly! I love that I have parental controls, too!
 My granddaughter loves this tablet.
 Very durable. I wish it went to the FREE Unlimited site as your home page.
 It's really nice for kids lots learning things durable easy to use
 This ended up being the perfect gift for my 2 year old daughter.  She loves it!
 Bought this for my 6 year old and she absolutely loves it! I love that it came with a year of FreeTime, all the apps, books and videos are kid friendly. I really like I can control everything she can do from my fire. The battery lasts forever. The case is so soft yet extremely durable. Definitely a great purchase!
 I’m disappointed. The games and apps are fine but the tablet itself has horrible battery life and takes forever to charge.  It also freezes up in the middle of using it. Not worth the money at all. Look elsewhere if you’re looking for quality.
 The tablet is broken it stop charging and the bottom half of the screen will not touch, powering it off and on doesn't help, the touch screen stopped working in April of 2018, and was purchased in July of 2017 smh this is horrible. Will return
 This is a GREAT kid tablet and Amazon is the best for parental controls!!
 I have two for each Grand. they have fun and learn sight words and some math. It’s been dropped down the  steps more then  once never stopped working.  Feel I got my money worth and would buy again.
 What I liked the most about this tablet is that my child can get mad and throw it, but the tablet won’t shattered. She loves it.
 Very slow, and crash all the time!
 This item is very useful and durable, I like that it doesnt have a long battery life and my kid isnt on it for hours at a time. The one thing I dont like is that alot of the games on it are free.
 Kids enjoy the tablets, I need to read up on the parent controls but so far very easy for them to use and has age appropriate material which I appreciate.
 Great product.........the kids love it and I have control what they see and read....Highly recommended !
 Defective- have to return
 Great for my 3 year old
 Great for young kids to focus on stories and games.  Even got my 2 year old grandson to sit still for 15min as he watched a story unfold.
 It has been a great tablet for our 3 years old to watch tv shows on, very secure, easy to use, and easy to download material
 I brought this tablet for my 6 year old birthday and she loves it, to me it doesn’t have a lag at all and it’s easy for her to use. I love the fact that it has a child account under mines so I can monitor everything she is doing and she can only download games that’s age appropriate.
 I purchased this tablet for both of my girls and they absolutely love them. We are very satisfied, they work well and we have had zero technical issues with them.
 The kids liked the games and variety. I didn’t like how there were 3 accounts on each tablet for me and my 2 kid-took up to much memory. My 45 pound child sat on it in a padded case and the screen shattered🙁 might be drop proof but...
 Horrible. Garbage
 Best tablet for the money for a kid, hands down! Just one complaint: some games are not available on Amazon that are on Apple or Android.
 The case for the tablet is made of a very supportive and sturdy material. The settings give parents so many options on picking the items just right for your child's age and needs...gotta love that. You easily switch users and each user's settings can be different. 👍👍👍😸
 It is very durable!!! My toddler is almost 3 and his brother is 19m so if it can sustain their rough handling it can pretty much handle anything.
 Ours quite holding a charge as well......hope I don't have the same problems that others had trying to get replaced.  Got last Christmas.  My son has autism and literally only uses it to take pictures.  John Materese....now doesn't that stink!!!
 I don't like the fact that, in order for the Kids to have access to additional apps you may have downloaded for them, they need to be accessed on the admin side.  This defeats the purpose of having a kids platform.
 Lived it! Bought it for my granddaughter
 Love the tablets.
 Wish we had gone for more memory but love the tablet and settings!
 My daughters love their new tablet. I have two girls ages 5 and 7. The tablets are easy to use. We have used a mani and an iPad. The fire is kid friendly and I love the fact they can play the same games through FreeTime with or without an internet connection. This feature makes long car rides much more manageable.
 I have a very happy birthday girl who can play all the learning games she wants!
 Our grand son loves this device
 Great apps for kids. Easy for them to use!
 I bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas and I must say this is the best gift he received. I’m blown away at all the things and pre downloaded apps it came with.  Very easy for a toddler to use and great for me when I want to use the kindle books option. Highly recommend for all parents with children
 The only issue I had with purchasing them is they were gifts for Christmas for my grandchildren and they had to use my information to start them up. If I had purchased them for someone who was not a relative I wouldn't want them to have my information.
 OVERALL this ithem is Ok or his price. Still think it could off been better. Especially the Charging part. I got this for my daugther not even a month ago . For the holidays. And now I can’t charge it won’t turn on. Real bummer when my 3yr old child gets sad when it doesn’t turn on. After being charged all night
 Son only used twice; sound works whenever it wants.
 Parental features and user friendly operation. My child uses for reading and games. Overall a great buy.
 It is very durable and the battery lasts a long time. I will continue freetime as he loves that app.
 Best thing I ever bought for my child.
 I am super happy with this purchase.<br/><br/>My daughter loves her tablet and has learned to work the functions already... &lt;3<br/>Best investment ever!
 I absolutely love the Kids Edition Kindle Fire. The parental controls are amazing and being able to control how much screen time my daughter has is great.  I would definitely recommend this product to others.
 Kids love it. Works great. Second one we've bought for or 2 daughters
 These are an excellent investment so far. Amaxon free time is such a great variety of content.  Work great out of the box but only had a month so we’ll see.
 My grand daughter LOVES the tablet she has not put it down. Only to charge it. The case is amazing. The tablet tumbled down the stairs recently, no damage was done. This was a good buy.
 Kids loved them.Worked as advertised
 My daughter loved it and used it every day after she got it for Christmas. Unfortunately, after 2 months, it died completely. Wont hold a charge. I am so disappointed because they only give you a short period to be able to return it. Now I'm back to her stealing my stuff. Grrr.....
 There’s a lot of kids apps that aren’t available on this tablet. It’s not user friendly. My son doesn’t care for it at all. He just uses my iPad instead. The privacy settings and child settings are better on the iPad as well.
 They love it play it every day I have two grandababys who live with me thinking about getting another one soon
 My daughter absolutely loves it. She got it for her birthday this month and its perfect for car rides. Keeps her busy on the go!
 The kids love them, haven't heard them in over a week!! Hehe
 Great for trips!  I like that I (the parent) am in control of this.
 This case meets all expectations for me. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because a handle would be nice! But other then that it's sturdy, thick, and very kid proof!
 My daughter loves her tablet. I love the parental controls. She loves all the options for age appropriate apps. I love that there are no ads.
 Very disappointed in the fact that I have to connect to the internet to watch videos that I PURCHASED and downloaded after 48 hours! The whole reason we bought the kindle was so that my son could use it on our up coming road trips.  And to have to delete the videos and re-download them is a huge waste of time!
 This thing is a good educational tool as well as a good distraction for short periods of time...
 Nice at first but after awhile they get super slow!<br/>Don’t even use it anymore because it’s so slow
 The tablet is very durable and does everything it says it's capable of doing. I really like the access to all the apps however there isn't enough memeory to house everything. Some applications I have to remove and reinstall in order for them to start working again. But all in all it is a great purchase.
 That was so fast. Our device needed repair. We sent it off and received a new one back in a few days.
 We love it!
 Wonderful toy, our 3-yr old grand son plays with it a lot.
 I like the blue rubber  casing around it  So that helps when it is droped<br/>What I don't like is that there is no instructions with it<br/>I can't figure it out  I am to old  So I think  I have to wait until my greats grandson is a little older and he can tel me
 These are the best for kids!
 Its not one year since my purchase and the item is not receiving charge. What should I do?
 Frankly it sucks, it keeps going off line and it’s frustrating. I will be contacting soon to see about a replacement, hopefully this one is just a faulty product. I am done waiting for it to work
 She loves it, I'm happy. Comes with timers and controls. For my liking too many preinstalled apps. You either have to delete them or buy an sd card, which is fine but don't tell me I get 16g and you've already used 10g.
 Have to download a bunch of apps, not user friendly. On the upside it’s durable... if you have an iPhone and your kid is use to watching videos on your phone I would purchase the iPad for them, user friendly and familiarity
 excellent
 Bad
 This tablet is awesome. Customer service is awesome I just said my sons tablet needed to be fixed in a chat online with them. They sent me a link for the return label. Now they are sending us a new one. Super easy and my son really loves his tabby
 I like most not having to worry about my son destroying it thanks to the warranty. Being able to do small payments is great. And the age filter with new content for him is really nice. Everyday it's something new and educational for him.
 It is good for both the parent and child. I can get on websites for him to watch and I can also use for what I want to watch. The apps that came with it are entertaining.
 The screen is not enough touch sensitive!
 Well, he hasn't torn it up yet and this is the kid that can destroy an anvil.
 I love this tablet. I love that my two year old has her own account on it and I’m able to modify it how i see fit for her. It’s durable and comes with a great warranty and add one. Def recommend to everyone with small children
 My daughter LOVES her tablet. So kid friendly and light weight
 This tablet is perfect for my 2 year old. He loves it &amp; it’s easy for him to use. I love that it has parental controls so it’s easy to monitor what they do when he’s a little older!
 Ordered as a Christmas gift for my 3 year old and she LOVES it. I was worried at first, she’s never been into playing on my phone or anything but she’s able to work this tablet easily. Everything came as pictured and I couldn’t be happier!
 Did take a while to receive because it was not in stock.  Contacted through instant messenger and he explained the issue that it was not currently in stock and was polite. Granddaughter loves. Would recommend to anyone looking to purchase.
 This tablet is very lightweight and sleek so it fits in the hands of my daughter perfectly. She enjoys the monitored playtime offered and many kid friendly activities. Battery does die fast however so looking at about 3 hours tops of life.
 Least I had a very hard time ordering this item.<br/>I love that she can play her own games and I love the night shade for eyes. Huge reason I got this.
 Not able to download ytube kids.<br/>That is why I bought it.<br/>Other than that huge issue it's nice. She likes it.
 2nd kindle fire the charging port gives out. This one did not even make it a year. They should have made a wireless charger by now.
 While this tablet WAS great, it no longer holds a charge. I purchased it in July of 2017 and it stopped working about 6 months after. If we finagle the port a bit we can sometimes get a bit of a charge but nothing over 10 percent. Not worth the money.
 Won't charge.  Tried on multiple cables that work.
 Very slow and glitchy. Kids get aggregated with it. Rather online or offline non Wi-Fi apps lag and don't load on home screen. Wouldn't suggest buying. But it does get the job done for a 3 year old for the price.
 My grand daughter really loves her Fire 7" Kid's tablet.  The only thing that I would have loved to see included was some sort of built-in stand feature to make viewing a little more hands free.
 Came in great condition, had a charger included. Only reason I have it 4 stars is about 2 days in I had to completely reset the kindle as it wouldn’t allow me to put any new games for my daughter
 Dies alllll the time and after very little usage. Sending it back and trying the 8 HD instead. Hopefully it works!
 Granddaughter still prefers her mom's phone
 Great
 Our granddaughter absolutely loves this. I’ve loaded additional items for her to take on the go.
 Works out very well for my 4 yr old don't have to monitor her , because Its what I downloaded  for her play games or watch shows and  I put a password on  just in case
 My daughter stands on her Fire 7 tablet, tosses it around, and bangs it against anything she's close to.  Best of all, I get to use it when she's sleeping for Casino slots.
 Es excelente para niños y muy segura porque permite programar el perfil especialmente para ellos con aplicaciones acorde a su edad
 Win for us and our son! He searches for his tablet when we are home.
 My kids love this. Only thing that sucks is there is not youtub
 I bought these for my kids for Christmas! Best investment ever!
 everything with this was great! my kids got them for christmas and they love them. VERY durable.
 Got for my special needs daughter. Love all the features with it. How it has parent mode.
 Highly recommend
 My son loves his tablet!!! And so do I with freetime its the best buy out there!
 I love that it is pre-programmed for kids. There is nothing he can click on that could harm his little eyes.
 My kids love these and I love that I can control the amount of time and content they are able to access. We did have issues with the charge port, but amazon replaced it after we sent it back in. The 2 year warranty is a great!
 Came fast, great as always, was an upgrade for my 2 girls making good grades &amp; taking care of their previous one almost 3 years!
 Is not worth it. You need to pay a monthly subscription for this device to be worth it and is having issues opening the apps downloaded with the subscription anywsys.
 These were purchased for my Grandchildren. I love the that the case is soft but durable. It has been dropped many times already and not a scratch on it. They love all the programs available as well.
 My son got this for Christmas from my mom, he’s use to using my iPad so it was a little adjustment for his 5 y/o mind. He has really enjoyed it though, and as a strictly Apple product user I have been pleasantly surprised.
 My kids love these fire tablets. And with the one year freetime app subscription it is worth getting one every year. Including a pic of the tablet in action.
 I loveeee this tablet my son adores it but it dies kinda fast and charges very slow
 Like it but too slow,and don't like the thing that don't come with Google play  for additional apps.
 My 2 year old loves this! He has so much fun playing all the educational games. I love that I can put timers on it and monitor what all he's playing and watching. Works fantastic keeping him occupied at drs appointments!
 Perfect birthday gift
 When starting the tablet it says you have to create an account and you are forced to put in your credit card information or else you can't create an account and you can't use the tablet without a credit card
 Processing/response time is a little slow with the best of internet connections. Out of the box apps and content were good.
 My tab stop charging. Contact me on 18682927692 or staceylegall03@gmail.com
 Slow and web browser crashes regularly. Home button is placed right where little kids fingers would swipe on apps when playing games, poorly designed. I would not buy this again.
 Terrible product! Won’t charge anymore. Samething happened to my kindle fire. I should have learned my lesson then. I sure did now. NEVER AGAIN!!!
 Keeps my little guy entertained for long road trips and weekend long swim meets
 Love the case and the tablet itself. Easy to clean and use!
 This is the second kindle I received and the battery is completely dead and it will not recharge.
 Takes forever to open an app and sometimes it close out the app and you have to re-try to open it
 My kids love their Kindles!  They're great for road trips and doctor's offices.  Recently my son's screen cracked.  Through the warranty we were able to send it in and receive a new one.  The whole process was efficient and was resolved quickly.  Would definitely recommend!!
 It was exactly what I hoped it would be, and my six-year old son loves it.
 It just stop working I don't know why. It has not been dropped or wet. Will not change.
 We got this for my 3 1/2 year old daughter and she loves it!!! All her favorite shows she can watch on the Netflix, YouTube or Nick Jr. app!! Very happy we decided on this device for her Christmas present!!
 I love this product due to the “Freetime option” for my toddler. Great for keeping occupied during long rides and dr visits. I don’t like this product due to the battery life not lasting long. Even without use the battery dies overnight.
 This item was a replacement for the previous tablet. Receive all of them with loose charging ports. I have received 5 replacements now. Need to call about this one as well.
 Sturdy, but VERY disappointed to learn you can not get YouTube kids. Would not have purchased had I known. My grandchildren only want my iPad so they can watch zool babies videos. Should have done my homework but I assumed if had wifi I would be able to get that.
 Excellent condition.  My granddaughter loved it!
 I bought three of these. Half the time the content doesn’t load. I have to restart multiple times for the content to finally show up. The charge does not last long whatsoever.
 I really love the durability of the fire 7.  I love the confidence i have in the safety of allowing my kids to play without worrying about inappropriate material.  I do wish I could get more child friendly and on their profiles that are not offered with amazon.
 We got this for my 2 year old for her birthday and she loves it!! it has so many books and games for her to play and learn with. and the parent controls are the best, she cant make any accidental purchases or be on it past her bed time. It was the best investment we have made for her!!
 My 4 year old loves this thing. Good way to keep him occupied on long trips, aa long as you have some form of hotspot, I pair my phones hotspot and he watches all his fav videos.
 Perfect for kids, the games and shows are educational and allow for a lot of creativity. The perfect device to get my daughter to calm down and enjoy an hour of technology a day.
 This thing is garbage. Terrible video quality. A camera that would be found on a flip phone. Can't download a legit version of youtube kids. Not to mention I have amazing wifi in my home and this junk box only works about 30 percent of the time. Garbage garbage gatbage
 Love it. Brought it for my daughter's third birthday gift as she was always using her older sister's. Live the parental controls, and that the material suggested is age appropriate for my child. Love the durable casing. They take a beating. We use them everyday, mostly for reading Childrens books and playing learning games.
 works well for the kids
 My grandson loves his tablet. He uses it everyday.
 Amazing in every way, wish battery life was a bit better but still. I have no clue how I lived without it.
 Battery life and charging time have been the only problems I've noticed so far.  Other than that its a great product.
 After having this tablet for about 2 weeks now I must say that I am very disappointed in the battery life. Using it for only 30 minutes drops the percentage of the battery from 100% to 76% (timed it today).
 Grate kids love it
 My kids feel in love with them
 The fire program works for only one month and now my kid is unable to use it. Waste of money.
 LOVE IT! So easy to access for any age! Educational and my son and I love it! He is highly accident prone and the tablet still functions as new!
 nice tablet ! got it for my daughter. she loves it !
 We didn’t find these user friendly for our little ones.  For myself I love it but not for my little ones.  We just wanted them to have some basic stuff with a cute tablet for them.  It was more work for us.
 As good as the reviews by the deal guy on youtube.
 Perfect for little kids especially with the child app for safe net surfing.
 Granddaughter loves this tablet
 I love this!!  The case is great!  The Fire automatically comes with a 2 year warrantee and one year of free games.  I love it!!!
 Excellent, especially for the price!!!
 The kids  loved this
 Came quickly and kids love them
 Some cool apps downloaded so far.  The bad thing is that when operated offline the thumbnails don't show the pictures, which makes it tough for a four year-old to find the app he wants.
 Much better charger set up than the old version. Grand-daughter loves it.
 Like it, but don't like the limited downloads I can do. Amazon doesn't offer many of the children's apps I normally allow my kids to use, such as kidstube
 This was a gift for my 21/2yr old grandson. He loves his new tablet! When he received it at Christmas he picked it up and knew exactly what to do with it even at his young age. He loves playing with all the apps. Great learning tool and yet fun to play with. He will have this for a long time.
 I love this tablet!  My 4 year old can enjoy videos and games and I don’t have to worry about her breaking a $300 iPad.
 My grandson still has it and he’s 3 now. Played with it every day for almost a year. No problems! Great for price!
 Works well
 The battery life is awful. We have to charge it daily for only an hour or two of use. It is also not kid friendly and is terribly slow. I wish I would have put the $70 I spent on it towards getting the iPad screen fixed.
 Love the controlled settings and the kids have blast with all the games and books
 We gave these to our boys (4 &amp; 8) for Christmas to replace their cheaper (crappy) tablets and they are worth every penny. Both boys have figured it out very easily and enjoy it very much. I love the fact that its safe and I don't have to worry about what they might come across.
 It's for a 4 year old. Hope it lasts. Nice replacement policy.
 I order this for my niece and she loved it so much, its so easy to set up, the item came in box very nearly and looks expensive and handled with care, the only thing is it came late than the date expected to arrive but Im glad it came before christmas
 Was such a pain to set up, was such a pain for my grandson to use. We threw it out.
 Charging socket has gone bad within a year of purchase, we tried managing the issue until now, but it has become impossible to charge the Fire 7 kids edition tablet. Didnt expect such a weak product from such a promising online seller.
 The software runs so incredibly slow and often times will freeze and you can't even shut off or restart the device. You have to wait for the battery to die, which doesn't seem to take long considering the battery drains pretty quickly.
 My 5 year old granddaughter loved it. Intuitive operation, loaded with easily accessible applications.
 I got this tablet for my two-year-old because her older brother and sister have a tablet.  She has figured out how to work it and has a lot of fun watching videos and playing little games like popping bubbles and feeding little characters food.
 The tablet overall is great, but my 4 year old has a hard time navigating it since you have to be able to read the categories instead of just an app picture. Maybe it's something I can play around with and change. Love the parental controls!!
 Can take a beating but videos not available in other languages.
 Great tablet to get kids. Plenty of games to keep them entertained. Love parental control. Recommend the extra warranty.
 Must-buy for any family with kids who want to explore in a safe, thriving environment.
 I got these for my  8 &amp; 10 year olds and both love them.  I love that I can use it as well under my own profile and can access parental controls and manage time limits for both kids on either device.
 Easy set up,  came pre charged.  This was a gift for my daughter from her new sibling.  Easy for her to navigate with included 1 year of free time.  Love the parental controls.
 Excellent for the grand babies. This comes loaded with tons of learning games in a sealed dogbone case and easy to use parental controls. I bought 4 and all 4 of 4 are 100%.
 My Grand daughter loves it.
 Overall we are happy with the Fire 7 Kids Edition. However there is one major flaw that I can’t get over- this tablet does not have a ‘lock screen’ function. This would be so helpful when playing a movie or show, so that little hands don’t accidentally exit out.
 said delivered, wasn't.<br/>then when finally got one it's the wrong color. id send it back but don't even want to deal with them anymore .  my daughter loves hers, though.
 My son loves this tablet. He's too young for games and all that, but he loves to watch Paw Patrol and Bubble Guppies in the car when we travel.
 perfect of car trips
 Performs well.  Only problem that I can see is that all profiles are on all devices, so now I have kids stealing other kids Free Time.  There may be a way to keep this from happening and I just haven't found it yet, but that's my only complaint.
 My boys, 12 and 7 love these Fire Tablets. I love the durability, parental controls, and the ease of use. I would definitely purchase them again.
 I want to be able to work my son on  school program<br/>The name is "Iready"and won't let me download<br/>So he can't use  the program from school<br/>I'm kind of disappointment with the software<br/>Fire 7 kids edition tablet 7" from Amazon<br/>I don't like it.
 This is the second tablet I have bought for my granddaughter. The first one was passed down to my grandson. My granddaughter loves her tablet and takes it everywhere where with her.Very good quality, simple to use and this is the reason I decided to purchase a second one.
 Perfect for my 4yr old. She loves the age appropriate games and videos. Kind of a pain to add content but easy enough.
 Love the tablet. It’s perfect for my child to be able to watch movies and read books
 I bought this for my grandson but I use it more than he does. It has a very clear quality picture and sound. It’s easy to use. The cover is very thick for shock resistance which is important with children.
 Bought it in july 2018 for my daughter and it just stop working in December don't know what's wrong with it.
 Great product with great service
 My 3 year old absolutely loves this. It is easy for him to use and it was easy for me to set up. Amazon also has tons of amazing content on the free play that my son loves that have his favorite nick and Disney characters oh and blippi can’t forget him my son adores his videos.
 It’s very slow that’s all i gotta day, it works well other than that though
 I bought this item for my little one. Service is good and fast delivery but the quality is terrible. It can not be use anymore because the screen cant turn on but i still sound when i stick charger on. I wish to get a replacement or a repair because it is not cheap at all.
 Still not workinf :(  2 IT attempts later
 I actually use this Kindle, not my child; I am disappointed that like the one that it replaced, it keeps telling me that there is no SD card found. I installed an SD card when I received it and have never tried to remove it.
 My husband and I bought the kindle fire 7 double pack for our girls for Christmas; they love them. Amazon unlimited free time for children is absolutely amazing it has so many games, books, movies and shows... everything to keep your tiny ones occupied on long car rides. 😊 I would definitely recommend!
 My daughter loves it when shes able to play on it, however it's constantly freezing and the images of the apps sometimes don't show up so she can't even see which app she is choosing. It seems to freeze or take forever to load every single time she plays. Disappointing.
 My daughter love the tablet she always watch her shows and play games
 I haven't had the tablet not even for 2 months and there seems to be something wrong w the charger. I switch to different chargers but it won't charge. I read about this before but I never imagine it will happen to me.
 I bought this for my grandkids, it is a great tablet! It has the best parental controls so you can limit their tume, set the exact hours they are allowed to play on it. You can even set a time limit so they have to pkay some educational games before regular games. Hands down, great!!
 The perfect device to occupy the mind of our 17 month old.  His mom travels daily with him alone, and the songs, and shows help keep him busy.  The perfect companion when you have to drive.

 It's a good size for a toddler but it boots up real slow and the battery runs out real quick.
 Got this for my 4 year old for Christmas, it has survived one month, of a very active boy. He has tossed it, dropped it, and hit it, and it holds up great! He absolutely loves the games that came with it. I love all the parental controls that are on there.
 I bought these for my kids two years ago and I absolutely love them. Both my kids still use them daily and the warranty is a life saver, also amazons customer service if something needs to be fixed ( like it being dropped 100 times) is quick and easy.
 Impressed that I can set weekday &amp; weekend time limits, as well as educational goals.  And I can limit access based on my toddlers age so I have no worries about what he is loading or viewing.  He gets the freedom to enjoy &amp; explore.
 My son loves this tablet that we received while his one was still under warranty. We just just had to change the cover.
 Love it
 Keeps my kids entertained but the battery life sucks. Also is a bit slow registering touch when the battery gets low. But a great deal and works well enough for my young kids.
 My grand baby loves this
 Keeps grandkids entertained for hours!
 Amazing product. Bought it as a gift and it has resisted accidental drops.
 Never disappoints especially with free trials.
 We got this for our 2 yo as a Christmas present.  I set it up before hand so he could just open it and play. It took him maybe a day or 2 to figure out how to navigate it. He loves all the content. I love the parental control and the case. Only downside is the charger on our's is broken.
 I brought this for my 4 yr old he luv it
 Kids love it so far!
 My 3 yr old grandson has autism, he loves this!
 I like all the different games and interactive appisodes on the tablet<br/>However I’m actually on my second because the first one got lost and the find your device setting doesn’t work if it’s not connected to internet, so I had to get my child a new one :(
 I I'm very disappointed with my grand kids tablet I brought one for my grandson and one for my granddaughter and both tablet not holding charge plus some of the apps not working I would like to know how to return them
 We love this tablet. Great gift for our 5 year old.
 Big help for hyper kids. Free time is great and the cover helps from being damaged. I have bought these in the past and a 3 year can handle them without assistance. The apps in free time change with child age this is a great product
 AMAZING product
 I'm very disappointed with this tablet.  I've had it right at a year and it wont hold a charge. Every time my granddaughter wants to use it we have to charge it...
 I actually got this tablet for my bonus daughter who is 2yrs old, after getting my son the Fire 8 tablet. which they both love i do not see the difference just in size both keep them entertained.
 Love love love this!<br/>This is our second one and I can’t say better things about them.
 Awesome for kids.  Lots of apps to learn from and the case makes it super protected.  However, after a year you have to pay for kids unlimited access.
 Had to return item as was not working and replaced promptly.  Very good service
 They are durable and have already free video's and games already on them. The grandkids use them everyday since Christmas. Their young 3yrs and 1 yr. The 3 yr old can use it with no problems playing games and watching video's. The 1 yr old needs help of course. But likes the songs and different shape app.
 Great tablet for a 6 year old with one exception.  You can’t add music from prime to the kids side of the tablet.  That is very disappointing and I wish I had done more research and realized that sooner!  Otherwise, he loves it!
 My son loves this. Works awesome for him, very durable. Even if he drops it, nothing happens to it. Super durable, perfect for kids. Keeps them entertained
 My daughter had an iPad mini for 3 years and I feel like the Fire tablet has much more to offer that is kid friendly and readily available. It comes with so many options already on the tablet instead of having to search for them. This makes it easier for my daughter to independently find things she enjoys.
 This product exceeded my expectations so far. My little one absolutely loves it! I love How it’s set up based on age group!
 I ordered today at 8am received today at 4 pm colors are great, size amd case is perfect, educational content is perfectage appropriate
 I bought this for my granddaughter aost two years ago. She recently dropped it and cracked the screen. I called on Monday and by Saturday she had a new tablet. What great customer service
 Very slow and dies right away even after charging it all night. Takes a really long time to add games.
 I ordered this for my son who use to use my phone to watch videos and I love it! I can pick which videos he wants and download them so he can watch offline on long car trips. I can set parental controls so he doesn't browse the internet, and I can set daily time limits for usage. Perfect for what he needs.
 Love the tablet but care must be taken about ease of app downloads! You could easily find (4 ur old) downloading some expensive apps! So make sure you use parental controls.
 When buying electronics now it must be standard not to include a manual on how to operate and set up. You must go online and search before you mess it all up. So needless to say I was supposed to have a full year free of free time and now only have a month. Disappointed and frustrated
 Grand children love it. Sturdy and dependable.
 My daughter is on her second tablet about to be her third. For $100 youd think they would fix the charging port issue. They both have lasted less than a year each. Definitely looking into another tablet brand. So sick of this issue
 Not kid friendly at all! Can’t download YouTubekids and have to pay for all kids videos unless I go to the browser and type in what I’m looking for. My kid doesn’t know how to use the internet browser yet. This is a waste of money.
 This is literally the worst product ever. I got the tablet. Downloaded content for my son to watch offline while we travel and it literally will not let us use the tablet off of WiFi. A waste of money and time. I will be returning.
 I have only have this product for about 10 months bought it as a christmas gift for my grandson and he loves it but I had to send it back for repair...Now it is need of repair again..I love the educational material that comes with it but the charging port is horrible...
 good
 It’s Perfect for my 2 year old loves it
 Order the pink and blue one, the pink one was not set on kid version or had the 2 free yr subscription like the blue one 😢
 The Kibdle, is not charging at all.
 Super easy to use. My 15 month has already got it down and i love not having to worry about her getting on apps that allow purchases. Love it
 I wish I had never brought this. I don't find it easy to use at all.
 It's awesome durable and user friendly  my 4 or 6 year old ask me for minimal help and the battery life it awesome. It's a major upgrade from those sprout tablets. The cost of the protective cover is a little costly but it's totally worth it when I think about It
 Love it
 My 3 year old daughter loves this tablet. She us able to play games, watch videos, and listen to her favorite songs. The biggest issue I have with this device is the amount of time it takes to charge. 4 hours to get a full charge is pretty crazy.
 In less  than 5 months I started having issues charging this tablet. Now I cannot charge it anymore...waste of money!  Plus it seems I have to purchase every app to use them in their entirety.  Horrible purchase...truly disappointed.
 So far good. My son loves it
 we gave this to a two year old! The bumpers around the tablet are amazing!! she has thrown this tablet many times.  She can easily move from game to game.. the games and stories are great, her vocabulary is growing.
 So far I am satisfied with this product despite there being so many negative reviews. It was very simple to set up &amp; the case it comes in is more protective then I thought!
 Love this tablet! My 2yo navigates it with ease and has dropped it SEVERAL times but no damage. Educational games have helped her learn her numbers and colors quickly and it amazes me how she is able to learn a new game within minutes. Highly recommend!
 Good product for toddlers.
 Tablet freezes up a lot. Doesn’t have a lot of items for older kids. Wasn’t worth the money
 Love love love it!!! I like having the parental control over what my child can see. I also like having my own profile to use.
 cute...for a christmas gift
 It is a good device for kids and the case is perfect in case of accidental drops.
 I haven’t opened it up yet since it’s my sons Christmas gift but it came pretty fast. I’ll update when he opens it.
 My grandson loves his tablet and I like that you can add a sd card for more storage and it comes with very well made protection case.
 I don’t like it.  I thought was just for kids. But it is seems like amazon app!  And it’s so  slow , you have to waiting for  Page to page!  Always stock ,  You can tell from the picture ,  and then you have to restart again again
 Hey I'm writing u Amazon I've been trying to get the picture on the tablet to go horizontally  and I took it best buy and they said it was lock can I send it back because it's not working and my daughter is getting mad because it will not go the long way
 Much, much slower than the 8...
 My grandchildren love it.
 I love
 We bought one each for our kids and they really enjoy it. Love all the different activities and we don't have to worry about them getting on sites they shouldn't be.
 best buy for my granddaughter
 Very slow and glitchy. I guess you get what you pay for.
 my son loves it!! He just turned 3 and I got him one for his birthday. so many educational games and apps. he's learning a lot and has a blast with it. so worth it.
 Bought for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it!! I love that it came with a cover to keep it protected!
 so far kid proof, I bought 3 one for each grandkid
 I bought this fire tablet for my daughter and she loves it.  I am able to follow what she downloads which is a real plus for me and my wife.  I recommended it to my co-workers and the immediately bought one for their kids.  Definitely recommending this product.  Thanks to Amazon, I saved a lot of money.
 I like the device but just move or load slowly between application or programs. Great my son, he love it.
 Terrible storage. Lots of glitches, often freezes, not many apps or books work without WiFi, which was the purpose of buying this so the kids could use on a road trip. Very disappointed, better off using an outdated iPad.
 My son loves it! Perfect gift for a 3 year old
 My kids love these. I also love that anything that gets downloaded gets emailed to me, so I can keep track of what they are doing.
 very sturdy and durable
 My son loves his new tablet. It works great and is very tough, it easily handles getting thrown across the room onto our stone tile floor. We are so glad we got him this tablet
 I got this for my toddler . It is childproof case. What i really dislike is that battery drains fast last about 3 hrs.
 I bought this for my grandson for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. My daughter also loved the fact that she could set a time at night that it shifts off so he cannot be on it after bedtime.
 Where are the instructions? It came with nothing
 Perfect gift for my 6 year old granddaughter. She loves it and so do i
 She loves it
 Highly recommend. Great for the kids
 This turned out way better than I hope. My son loves it and it's a very good quality tablet. Easy to set limits and control content.
 I love this tablet and so does my 3yr old daughter. It has many apps perfect for kids her age and older. Lots of learning apps and games. The case is very sturdy and durable. We love it.
 We were disappointed that we had to download apps and not preloaded for our daughter. Battery had to be charged where it did not have a charge. Not sure on the quality of the tablet due my daughter only using it less than a week.
 I have 2 toddlers. One throws things and this tablet hasn't broke yet. We have two of them and the first one we got about 6 months ago. Its been thru having milk dumped on it all the way to being thrown against a brick wall. I tell everyone, if you want a tablet for young children, this is it.
 My grand  daughter Gracie loves her tablet and has learn so much.
 It was a little challenging to set up, but figured it out and it is all set for my daughter to use!
 My granddaughter loves her kindle. Can't put it down for very long. She plays with it for hours.
 My kids loved the tablet &amp; it's definitely kid friendly. My 2 yr old has dropped it &amp; thrown it &amp; it still doesn't crack. The case is excellent.
 amazing tablet made just for kids!! especially great since we're prime members. Movies, apps, books and everything is tailored to the child's age.
 Great tablet for kids! Very easy to use and the case is very durable.
 Highly recommend for anyone with kids
 It is good for departingthe kids account from mine. The problem is that the system is so slow it is not much fun waiting on the loading. I don't know if there is just to much software trying to run or the hardware is just not up to speed. I've had the same issues in other kindles.
 Got this for my favorite little guy he loves it!
 Easy interface for my 3 year old to use. I like the kid mode and parent mode are separate. Good product. Would definitely buy again.
 The necessity for wifi to switch to my child's profile was frustrating, but other than that this tablet is pretty user friendly. I only wish it were spill-proof then it would truly be kid proof.
 hi,<br/> You tube &amp; Netflix I already have on my personal phone &amp; I liked them so much that I downloaded to the Fire Tablet.<br/>The Square Trade is also a pretty good buy for the money, cant' go wrong with more protection of course....
 My niece loves it
 Works great and definitely holds up to the beating my 3 year old gives.
 Great product, is been deopped a couple time and doesnt have a single scratch, I highly recomend this product
 I like it. Kids love it! Love how I can set up how they can play on it and the parental controls are so easy!
 This is such  A great learning tool for kids!  Very well made!
 Great tablet for kids.  My granddaughter loves it!!
 Not as fast as I would of liked, and went on sale a few days after purchase.  Other then that the kid seems to enjoy it.
 Perfect for children! They love it!
 It was great for the few months my kids were able to use it. Now it won't take a charge, which means it won't turn on at all. Very disappointing purchase!
 Tablet was too restricting. Not very many apps as android. Nowhere near as user friendly. The kids mode just loads it up with an absolute ton of garbage apps. Too many to sift through to find good ones. The case was good though.
 Love the tablet and the games it offers<br/> My daughter is 3 and adores it!<br/><br/>My charger broke within 2 weeks of getting the product. I have an android phone so I use that charger but I do feel like the product should have came with a higher quality charger
 I like that I can set a timer for my oldest son to read for a set time before the tablet will let him play apps. What I don’t like is that I can’t stop them from downloading so many apps.(if there is a way please let me know)
 This is the third fire tablet I’ve bought. So reasonably priced got one for all of my kids.
 Easy to use and set up my daughter loves it and the price was unbeatable two thumbs way up
 Wasn’t charged when we got it but everything went beyond expectations. Having all of the options available for free download was awesome. Very user friendly!!
 Love it my son was getting into watching gun show and gun games and I love that he can't do that on here and I like that each one of my kids have there own profile it's a amazing tablet
 Love this for my 4 year old, strong, durable, able to parental control it all. Very easy to us and understand
 My son loves his tablet. The free time application is super easy for my 2yo to navigate around. No issues with it yet!
 I got a Fire for my kids and immediately I tried to play a video it gave me Error 4527.<br/>After some research, I found out that the error is a problem that many Fire show and even if you reset the device it won't make it work.<br/>I'm not happy with the device.
 So perfect 4 my 7yr old grandson! He loves it! &amp; his mother &amp; I love the kid proof case!
 When your kids love it and it does the job ...it deserves 5 stars.
 Good solid cast. Grand daughter loves it. Great job once again.
 It's great and I set up payment installment's  so it only cost me 18 bucks a month
 My children love their tablet and they know how to use it already. I love the fact that they have feature that works without wifi.
 My daughter loves this tablet and takes it everywhere she goes.
 My son likes using it to watch videos, good battery life, works well on our WIFI.
 Can't figure them out.  Keeps going back to adult profile.  My kids can't find anything to play.  To much work for parent to set up.
 We had ours for 6 months and it will no longer charge. I'm still trying to figure out what the 2 year worry free guarantee!
 Tablet is good now tech support call me and the problem resolved my son now enjoy his tablet.
 A great gift for our preschooler!
 This is our third one (due to having three kids). They are awesome, and Amazon customer service is amazing! We had a small issue with the others not charging and customer service assisted for no charge and quick turnaround...Amazon everything!
 If I let my 2yr. old granddaughter alone with this tablet she would be on it all day long. She absolutely loves it. I love the fact that Amazon replaces it when the c=screen gets cracked, no questions or issues getting a replacement.
 Item is not user friendly.  All apps cost too much to buy.  I've really regretted getting it.  It is not being used.
 Really bad quality dont work any more it was good only 5 months and i gave it as a gift and they dont remember the amazon account even the tablet has guarantee amazon dont want to deal with it.
 Bad storage space. Kids can download unlimited games until it’s unusable but once in an app it’s impossible for a kid to get out of it. Requires older kids to operate or full parental attention/participation
 This is an awesome tablet,  however amazon really needs to figure out the charging port issues!!! We are on our 2nd replacement because they stop charging.
 Very slow
 My 2 yr old loves this thing. You can download stuff to access when away from wifi and she can still play and watch. But you will need to purchase an sd card for storage space.
 I've purchased two and we have constant issues with the charging ports. Replacing them is a hassle and the new ones just break again any way. My kids are disappointed as am I.
 The apps are enough for my 5 year old. This was a very good choice for his first tablet. Very durable. His only complaint was that he is unable to get the kids youtube.
 I didn't like the fact that you have to send it back to Amazon and wait 5 days or more to get it back, the charging port are weak on most of the fire tablets, Amazon should address this issue
 awesome
 Best tablet for kids hands down! Very durable and easy to use. My kid is 6.
 I recently bought this product here in Amazon for my daughter and now it won't charge at all it's shows that the battery is dead but theirs nothing wrong with the cable charger at all .. can someone help me my daughter is disappointed and sad..
 Quit working for my daughter with occasional use.
 They are great items I like them thanks
 Good thing it comes with the 2-year warranty. You’re gonna need the services about every 3 months
 Super Great Gift,...<br/>I'm so glad this was available for purchase,...<br/>This was a big hit for my boys,..<br/>I can control the content of what they view and play,....<br/>And the selection of games, books, videos are amazing endless,...<br/>Awesome, Awesome, Awesome,.....
 I loved this product! Couldn’t  have asked for a better gift to my mom and sisters !!! Moreover , the product came way before expected ship date which was a huge plus!!
 no problems. Easy for 9 year old to use
 Excellent seller. I had a problem with my kids tablet and they sent me a new one (in 2 days) great service. Very happy with my experience. Thank you for not making things complicated. My son loves this tablet and I like the parental controls.
 So far so good my two year old loves it, and I get my pone back lol
 These things are great for any prime member with kids. Load movies on them for the long road trips and keep them happy and busy.
 The kids love their new fire. Great product to keep them entertained and learning with the freetime.  Thank you!!!
 LOVE LOVE LOVE the parental controls on this tablet! As a parent you can have your own profile and then your kids profile can be edited for all ages! With restrictions like they can’t play games until they do education geared stuff for whatever amount of time you choose. And the tablet will restrict access after a certain time.
 It would be great if it worked consistently.  We've had issue after issue...charging port...just flat not working....
 slow. freezes constantly. buggy software. limited offline capability. issues with navigation. glitchy. i guess that’s the best for the price.
 This has worked perfectly for my daughter and helps so much during long car trips and flying. I would definitely recommend it to anyone considering.
 This is perfect for my toddler when we are on the go! He loves it and the amazon freetime is perfect for him to grow with!
 The touch screen on this is terrible.  My son gets so frustrated when trying to navigate through his videos because he touches videos to play them and nothing happens.  This happens about 80% of the time.  I would like my money back for this product.
 granddaughter loves it
 This tablet may be slightly more expensive than other ones on here but well worth it! You can get Netflix and tons of baby apps for your little one.
 My 4 year old granddaughter loves playing the games under apps. This tablet seems very well made and the rubber case is a definite must for little ones.
 Granddaughter loves it.
 Gave tablet to my nephew and he loves it for school and online games
 Our one and a half year old uses this and loves it
 Excellent choice! My grandson who is 3 loves it,  adapted to it very quickly
 This product is perfect for kids.  You won't find this type of technology with all the apps already on it with the choices you have in one place.  I love this thing!
 This is great!  My daughter loves her tablet. The ability for her to see what she wants while I protect what content she had access to is fantastic.
 Love it so far. My son uses it about 30 minutes a day. The ONLY downfall are the ads that stay at the bottom of the screen when kids YouTube is on. My son keeps pressing the ads by accident.
 My daughter loves her tablet! It has fun games and I can set parental controls
 Excellent
 perfect for my 8 year old girl, she loves it. thank u
 Its okay I guess none of the cartoons wont play I'm not sure why but my child still seems to like it so that's most important.
 It was great and then it turned off and just reverted to a normal kindle not designed for kids.
 I bought it for my 4 year old grandson for Christmas and he loves it! We haven't had any issues so far and he has played games, watched videos, and taken lots of pictures. He really likes the auto play Dr. Seuss books that read to him.
 Bought 2 grandkids love it.
 Love it
 This was the replacement due to not being able to find the warranty information to fix the first one. Hopefully this one doesn't break with in 6 months of purchasing
 bought 3 for 3 of my grandkids tablets are great all three charges have stopped working ..The parents plugged the tablets in at night so its not from kids misuse.  Im going to have to replace all three charges
 love it and my grandson loves it too.
 Love the games and durability.  Does freeze a lot with little kids playing it but overall its a great tablet.
 I thought the tablets would last longer than 2 yrs. My nephew rarely uses his tablet which is why I thought it would have lasted a lot longer than 2 yrs.
 I bought a set of these for my 2 and 7yr old boys. ABSOLUTELY love how much I can customize their view! Timers, limits, age appropriate settings.....love love love!!!
 My baby loves it, therefore I love it!!
 I bought this for my almost 3 year old great grandson. He loved it. Parents limit the hours per day he can use it.Especially nice for several hour car trips.  I don't know much abut it as it was given as a gift.  I was impressed with the sturdy case.
 Love it!!!!  Super light and has tons of educational app. Keeps my daughter entertained.
 I live in a house with two toddlers and this case is a must. Had another tablet fall from 3 feet and shatter but this tablet has been thrown over my bar into my kitchen, stomped on and dropped out of the car and the tablet still works without a single issue or crack.
 Beware of warranty restriction!! Bought tablet in Oct.  (as Christmas present) warranty ended Nov.  After less than a month of use, charger insert quit charging.  Now, after an hour of dealing with Amazon website discovered "not eligible".
 I love the kids' kindle as it is pretty protected.  Great for those who seem to have butterfingers or those little ones whom just can remember to pick up their tablet and put it on a table if they are not using it.
 Had my son tablet charging and it was burning thank god we notice it. We took the case off because it wasn’t charging and this is what happened
 I ordered this tablet for my two year old grandson. He loves it so much his parents have to hide it from him to control his usage. He enjoys the video books, learning games, and songs. A great way to keep your toddler happy while traveling
 present
 So far my kids love this little piece of work.
 The tablet so far has not gave me problems so far so good in plus my son loves it and it’s good entertainment to have in the car, rather then him having my phone pressing all kinds of things lol
 Both grandsons love it. Only complaint is how easy it is to get out of an app or video with a touch of the screen
 This is her third kid kindle and she LOVES it!  It’s very kid friendly and allows her the same access as the laptop. Best investment ever!!
 Bought for my 5 yr old twins they were premature so alittle behind other kids their age but loves those tablets even dropped afew times with little to no worries lol my only complaint is that I wish they charged faster .
 It works great.
 Nice size for a three year old , very easy to operate. My son loves it and it comes with the cover! I had a blue cover at home even though it came with the pink one!
 I love it...
 My 4 year old son can use it easy and play search by him self . Lasts for ever before having to recharge. Sound is good as well as screen is very good. With blue case it protects it very well wheny son accidentally drops it
 Great granddad love it, as well as mom.
 It’s great!  She really enjoys it and the case is very protective.
 This was great for my 5 year old!!  Durable and holds lots of games!! Only reason it did not get 5 stars is because it take soooo long to charge it!!
 Great item &amp; arrived on time! My daughter earned this a girl scout reward ~ SHE LOVES IT! Thank You!
 My kids love their tablets and they have held up well overall. My only problem is we bought 2 of these and both have stopped charging at about a year of use.  One warranty has replaced but I’m going to have to call in/ mail in the second.
 Good
 My baby loves her tablet. It’s her favorite thing.
 This Fire 7 kids Edition Tablet, 7 is not a user friendly for kids,and it does not come with a youtube on it,my son don't like it because of that he only use it two times and don't use it any more
 Kids love it and it's great for the price.
 my daughter loves it.
 Awesome tablet for kids and I like not having to worry so much
 This tablet only lasted a year. Then, the place on it for charging became loose and we couldn't chsrge it any more.
 Just got this replaced after a few years of use. One of my kids broke the screen and we had a new one within 3 days of sending it out. The kids love this and there’s tons of informational and fun games, books, and videos for them. Best purchase I can think of for my kids!
 Kids love it
 Kids love this and the free time apps. My youngest especially loves the preschool apps!
 Love it just wish the entire tablet would be kid locked and ability to move adult apps to another page. I don't like the delay from the Free time app.
 I haven’t used it myself but my 4 year old daughter and 2 year old nephew LOVES IT!!! There’s tons of learning games that keeps them entertained and some shows they like to watch are on there as well. I’ll probably buy another one because when they are both at my house they fight over it lol
 Great for kids now a days. Don't leave home without em'. Helps them learn stuff,<br/>and play games.
 My kids lovr their amazon fire and all that they can do with it. I love the parental control and the emails to notify me of downloads. I also love the personalized games by age. Awesome choice.
 Excelente
 My 2 year old daughter love this tablet<br/>It's durable and has plenty of apps
 I like the product because not only can they play games it has a lot of educational benefits and it also has parental controls, free software for a year and warranty coverage for free!  You can't go wrong with that! my grandsons love it!
 I purchased the pink kindle fire 7 kids edition for my granddaughter.  She loves it but the charging port broke 2 months after she got it.  I am trying to figure out how to return it now.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>Thanks
 Does what it's supposed to do! Case is great for the rough kiddos.
 Tablet runs kinda slow but overall nice
 My kids seem to love it. It has taken a little bit of time for them to get used to the differences from Android tablets,but they're getting the hang of it.
 Son never puts it down
 Awesome tablet. My daughter received it as a Christmas gift and loves it. What I love about this tablet is that is has parental control and sing it you can control the time they are using it. This is the perfect tablet for your kids appropriate for their age and you control it.
 Grandson loves it.
 This is a great tablet for kids but the charging port broke and I can’t find how to return it. Please help.
 My baby loves the tablet
 we purchased this for my 2 year old toddler, who loves it.  Amazon provides some suggestions for apps and other learning tools which help a lot -- I don't have to search and try to find ones that he will like.  the case allows him to hold onto the tablet easily and protects it when he drops it.  Its a great deal!
 Pretty good. Always open to the adult profile instead of the kids.
 I like this table , it does what it suppose to do and my son really enjoys it. The only thing I don’t like is that certain things like YouTube kids app you can’t get on it because it’s a google play app but other then that it’s a good tablet
 Amazon Fire 7 Kids edition are defective. Tablet worked for a month and stopped working. It was replaced, and same happened again. It stopped charging. I do not recommend it at all.
 My 7-year old loves it!
 My grandson  loves it!!
 I give this two stars my kids absolutely love these but they have had them for 7 months and I cant get them to charge anymore def not worth the money I paid if they are only going to last 7months.
 Great tablet for kids but extremely slow
 Easy to set up and use my daughter loves hers, case is awesome
 Very happy with this purchase. It was simple to set up a kid’s account, which provides lots of great content without allowing access to the wider web or to authorize transactions.
 My daughter loves her little 'puter.  She sits next to me on the couch doing her educational apps while I work from home and occasionally walks around the house telling people she's "working".  It was also great to stream Amazon prime videos on during a recent road trip.
 This was a replacement for my grand daughters kindle that was malfunctioning. I am not sure if this was refurbished but the replacement does not even work as well as the original one did.
 Its a good system although confusing to use. Additional charges for subscriptions and download charges surprising...my 2 year old not as impressed as with an ipad.
 now the blue tablet is not turning on I’ve charged it and nothing
 Great so far. I purchased a refurbished one and have had no problems. In bright sunlight ( I took it on a vacation to New Mexico and Colorado) some of the pictures I took had excessive glare, but other than it has been great.  Great battery life.
 This was just what we were looking for for our 10 year old.
 The tablet is for my 2year old daughter.I love the fact that it keeps her busy and she learns alot from it.The most important thing is the protective casing that comes with the tablet. She throws it around and it does not break.Amazing.
 I got this tablet for my son and I absolutely love it. The parental features are amazing and the overall durability is great. The only thing I hope they can work on is the battery life, it does last for about 6-8 hours fully charged. Other than that I would def recommend this tablet.
 Grandson loves it
 Grandkids won't put it down
 Great kids tablet!! Love the parental controls so my kid is only able to watch certain things. I'm able to download Netflix so she can have access to that still. The case is durable and it can within a stand from a decent distance. Would recommend to anyone with young kids.
 It worked perfectly...add me on IG @Iampeteymedicci
 Case is very durable I have a three-year-old who of course has dropped it plenty of times not a single scratch or damage to the tablet itself and I love the parental controls !
 My 3 yr old daughter loves this tablet, she plays with it all day! I love the fact that it has 2 yr warranty as well, she’s already cracked the screen so we have to send it off to be replaced but awesome product overall!
 I like the fact that they held up their word on the warranty. One of my sons kindles was unable to take a charge and the other ones screen was cracked. Both were replaced without a hassle.<br/>Thank you,<br/>John Walsh
 Purchased for my grandchildren... Hope he likes it!...
 Was great until it quit charging 1.5 years after purchase. Only used for the last 6 months.
 She loves it
 Just got this for my 16th month baby for Christmas and some time the sound is bad
 My daughter likes it a lot and uses it everyday so far everything has been good
 Last a long time my kids love them
 Definitely is worth having for your child. Kids love it with so much that they can do and parents can easily control what they have access to.
 Liked the most how it caters to the age range and suitability for appropriateness of each child linked to the device. Liked least is the particularly detailed parental controls as far as times and amounts of time each child is allowed to play that I haven't been able to find yet.
 Very easy for any kid to use, happy with the purchase. Only problem I'm having is when it does it switches off kids mode sometimes, but if you set up a pin your kid can't do anything untill u switch it back for them so it's no big deal.
 Sent back the same kindle that STILL does not charge or hold a charge<br/>Thanks
 I love kindles and Amazon. I've bought many kindles and Amazon products over the last 8-9 years. I love them and my children love them as well.
 My grandson loves it!!!!
 Great tablet, my daughter loves it. Impressive she hasn’t broken it
 Great item
 Bought as a gift and my grandbaby loves it
 Bought them for my 18 month old twin girls and they are just getting adjusted to them.  One gets a little annoyed by how long it takes to open an application, but maybe it will teach her patience :)
 Love the parental control it’s very good
 My grandson is going to love it!
 my granddaughter loves it. being able to have age appropriate apps are even better as she grows and masters them. it's great to see her development.
 necesito el reemplazo de este producto que esta en garantia, el touch no funciona.
 I like that there is an assortment of apps to choose from. I did not like that there are games that are not educational but rather, much like video games that are of a violent nature. I was hoping my son could use it more as a learning bad and not as a video game console.
 My kids both love this tablet. It is easy to use and has lots of included content. No need to purchase zillion games. I use it as well.
 Great size and case. BUT no YouTube kids on this tablet. Disappointed.
 I am really impressed with this tablet. It is perfect for my 3 year old. I also love the warranty, my son recently cracked his screen and they replaced the entire tablet at no cost to me! They even sent a new case and charger with it!
 Great gift for kids and you can adjust it so they cant see things they shouldnt when your not around , my son loves it.
 Wouldn’t buy this if the child is younger than 2 years old. It’s a good tablet i guess
 I purchased this for my son and he loves this tablet. It's not cause of the freef videos and games on it it's cause the Internet he can watch whatever on YouTube instead of using my phone.
 Cheap and WiFi doesn’t work well!
 My child loves it, entertainment for hours. So durable and kid friendly with parental controls. He has broken it twice (he’s a rough boy) and I’ve had replacements in days without any issue. Great value!
 I like the kindle &amp; the price, but as you can see ,this is like my fifth kindle, they just stop charging &amp; although they are reasonably priced,they shouldn't be disposable. This is the last kindle i will purchase if it stop working like the others.
 Perfect for my 5yr old. She navigates it pretty well not being super a proficient reader.
 Really worth the money and 2 year guaranteed
 Great tablet, comes with many features.  Kids love it.
 This is perfect for kids lots of games to choose
 My son loves it and he can use it in the car without wifi. Fits perfect in his hands.
 My kids really enjoy this tablet. It is great for them because it has personal settings.
 The tablet works great. The blue case is so durable it has already kept it from breaking.
 My 2 year old LOVES it. It's very easy for him to navigate on his profile. My profile has a password and I can put some movies on for him if I want to. So many apps,games,books,and videos all age appropriate. He stays busy and quiet.
 Works great even without internet
 I really like the case on the tablet. Just not user friendly , maybe I am just used to apple products but it's a little confusing. Good for the kids to go straight to their games and youtube for kids.
 My kids are enjoying their new tablet.
 Oh yeah! My Grand daughter loved it!
 Bought for 7 year old. She likes it
 This is a great but, there is a lot of games on here, and I haven’t had to expand memory. My son has dropped the tablet and it’s is still good. This is good for young kids, because the iPad tablet was to much putting stuff on the tablet and advertisements, this also is very easy to use.
 I ordered this for my 2 year old son's bday present. My 5 year old daughter has 2 of them and the kindles are amazing. I'm not too big on the freetime thing so I just put parental controls on the adult profile thing. My son LOVES it.
 I bought this for my grandson and he loved it but it went black 2 months after i purchased it.  I thought it needed to be charged but that was not the case.
 My 3 year old loves his tablet. It's easy for him to use and durable for his clumsy hands.
 It will no longer charge and hasn't even had it a year yet...
 A mi hija le encanta
 My 3 year old daughter loves it and can find her movies on Netflix and play games.  I only wish the YouTube Kids app was available as that was one of the main reasons she would use my phone.
 kids love it
 Nice size for my son but super slow. Apps never work. And takes forever to charge
 I really like how it’s put together. I don’t like how the whole product functions all together is kind of slow and this is even on a fast service internet. It’s just not as expected technologically but it looks good.
 Love it. My daughter LOVES it as well.. the only issue I have is once you tap on an app it automatically downloads the app. I wish it would tell me more about it and what the app is/does.
 Kids love it. Great Christmas present.
 It comes fully loaded with games, books and videos all age appropriate for my 4 and 2 year old! Very user friendly! I was pleasantly surprised I didn’t have to download apps!
 I bought these for the Grandkids ages 2 &amp; 8.<br/>Their parents tell me it’s the best thing ever. They especially love the parental controls. I wasn’t going to buy anything like this I’m from the times when you went out to play. However all the educational games is what made my decision.
 Poor battery life. You charge it today and even if you don't use it - almost completely discharged by the next day...
 I did not like the fact that you cannot search for apps under the childs account.  You can only dd the apps that are listed there which is ridiculous. I can seach for the apps under my account  on the device but cannot send them to my daughters which is why i bought the thing.
 Kid friendly, easy to use
 Bought This "Fire for Kids" for my Great Grandson, an of course he loves it !  BUT if you are looking for something like this for your small kid or grandson you can not beat the MOST amazing  2-YEAR  "No Questions Asked" ~ "Kids will be Kids" replacement warranty !!!!<br/>If it breaks they will replace NO questions asked 😳😳<br/> If you are a Prime member you can not beat this deal with stick, came with good bumper case, works fantastic!<br/>but you do need to get the screen protector, scratches are a part of a kids life ......  but ya know with that kinda warranty I have "0" complaints<br/>Thank You AMAZON!!!<br/>Someone there is a parent and a genius!<br/>Respectfully<br/>Suzanna aka GG
 It stopped working right after the warranty and I can’t get it exchange. Waste of money!
 its basically a tablet with a app that gives you availability and easier access to monitor the usage on the tablet.....and you get a big sturdy case too......its and economic buy and its serving the purpose i got it for.
 I love this tablet. Easy to use very durable 1 year of Amazon fire so more games then you can imagine and the fact it comes with a 2 year warranty is wonderful. My 3 year old is tracing letter and number so many games then help him learn it's perfect specially for long car rides.
 under 2 years old. good tablet but now won't charge.
 1 1/2 year old loved the tablet she can turn it on and click what , she want to watch. She's 2 1/2 now recently broke it. Amazon was wonderful to work with. Had no problem with the warranty, we got a brand new one,it was not  refurbished. Thank you Amazon you have a great crew working for you company
 My grandson loved it.
 Works great, built like a tank!
 Only part I dislike about this kindle in general is the charge port is constantly going out. I have gone through about 2-3 of these and I am super thankful for warranties. It just becomes a hassle when they are no longer chargeable.
 Great great great for kids...so stress free for me to let my 6 year old use.
 My daughter loves it! It is pretty slow, but fine for a small child.
 So far it’s been great (one week of having it) some reviews said it took a while to download things but our didn’t have that problem games downloaded in seconds. The tablet is pretty loud for how small it is all the features work well with it. We love it.
 This tablet is perfect for a toddler.  The case could not be better.  No matter how hard it gets tossed or dropped, the tablet is never in danger of scratching or broken.
 I gave my daughter this tablet freetime is great! Love  it !
 My 2 year old loves this tablet! And im pleased with it too.
 I love how kid friendly this tablet is and the parental control feature!
 The AmazonFire Kids tablet is great!! My 9 and 3 year fight over every day. They love playing on it. I love the parental controls so I can limit the content and time they play on it. I didn’t give it 5 stars because it will freeze occasionally and is slow to load content.
 Amazon failed...twice...I tried to replace both of my tablets under their warranty. Both times they never got back with me. Feels like they are good to you until you need a warranty replacement. Worst.
 Bought this for my grandchildren.  Ages 9-2. They all love it!!
 My girls loved it
 I like the parental controls and passwords. However it is very sensitive to touch and only good for use in our vehicle. It does not live up to the expectations that I had for it, unfortunately.
 Super slow!! Can't do much unless connected to WIFI.
 We got this for our daughter for Christmas. She loves it. The kids apps are easy for her to find/follow. The only negative I see is the battery life. We seem to have to charge it every day even though she doesn’t play on it for hours at a time.
 As advertised
 Wonderful. Grandson loved it.
 Pretty durable but small screen, flimsy charger that no longer charges after a year and limited apps makes this a no repear purchase
 The product works great. But the battery does not last long at all. It last about two hours. And takes about 6 hours to fully charge
 So far, so good! Thanks to next day shipping I got the tablet in time for a trip with my 6 year old son and he enjoyed it. The case makes me comfortable with him handling it! The one year free subscription was a plus.
 It's fine, but the charging port sucks!!! I have already returned one and got it replaced and now this one is broken too!
 Kids 5 and 7 love them and their very durable.
 Great for the Gbabies. The use them all the time
 Grandson just loves it.
 21 month daughter loves this so far. Took it on a 3.5 hour car ride which was helpful to keep her happy (with Elmo).  Planning on using on a 5+ hour plane ride to help with our sanity. 😀. Highly recommend
 Hello! My child loves her Kindle Fire Kids Edition. My only problem was trying to seperate her account from my Amazon account because she began downloading apps with out my permission and charging it to my credit card on file. Is there anyway I can separate the two accounts?
 Love it for the kids. Case is will keep it safe.
 It's great! I have 4 stars because it's a little hard to work/use (my family has always used apple devices) and everything has to be downloaded and takes a good bit of time.
 Purchased for my 2 year old granddaughter. Perfect!
 Easy setup. Great warranty. Really durable.
 My 3 year old got this for Christmas. He loves it! The parent control setting is awesome. He’s able to use the tablet on his own and I don’t have to worry about about him changing any settings or viewing something inappropriate. Definitely a great buy.
 My daughter loves this tablet but the charging port stopped working as well . Along with all the reviews I agree and can’t get it fixed. Anyone know of a similar tablet. My daughter is autistic as well.
 I bought the Fire 7 Kids Tablet for my children five and two.  They love it because they call look at all of their shows, play all their games from amazon, watch all of their movies, and ask for our phones.  My husband and I love these's Kids Edition Tablets.
 Like the parental controls
 I love this tablet for my boys 2 and 6 yrs old, they have to do learning before play time on it. I supervise while they learn then when they are done they can watch movies and what not.
 My 2 year old watches movies on long car trips.
 This was a gift, but no complaints. They must have liked it
 My son loves it! And I love the control I have as a parent on it! It is super easy to use and figure out.
 It works great for my daughter, and the peace of mind that it's very durable is comforting
 Bought this tablet for my 3 year old, so far it has taken all the abuse he can dish out. I love the parental controls. It was a little difficult to learn the operating system but eventually I caught on.
 grand kids love it
 The grandkids love them!!  They are very light weights and work great!!
 They returned mine with another faulty one that will not charge up and now and I can't return the new one. Probably got unlucky, but it's frustrating that I can't get it replaced again.
 Got for our grandson and he loves it
 Great  Christmas gift for nephews
 I love everything except that I cannot download the YouTube Kids app in the kids profile... All my daughter wants is to view YouTube kids and I have to have it in my profile in order for her to be able to view her favorite songs.
 It's awesome, I actually purchased it for my niece, she absolutely loves this tablet. I just wished ALL the kid's apps were downloaded on it already but nonetheless this tablet is still the best!!!
 I bought this for my grandson who just turned three. He absolutely loves it and plays educational stuff on it.
 Kids love it i would recommend this product.
 My 7 yo son loves it.
 My grandson loves this tablet!!!
 I think it is a great product, but Amazon should put some button lock on it. We use it to distract our one-year-old on plane trips, and her little self keep trying to press all the buttons.
 Fantastic!  Perfect for parents to be able to control content, but kids feel like they have all of the freedom/choices b/c there are so many choices for each age range.  We have 2 - one seems to lose battery quicker than the other, but other than that, very happy!
 The tablet is wonderful for the kids. Since I gave them the tablet I have my peace. When they are playing with it, you will not hear a single noise in the house. I love it but the children love it the most . THANK YOU AMAZON
 Expected it to be kid accessible, I can't even figure out how you get the free unlimited,!!!! False advertisement on kid learning, videos and more.
 I like that it is very kid durable.  My kids break all their tablets, but my 4 year old has done amazing with thos one.  I don't like that when my 4 year old downloads the free games you can only okay like 1 basic game and then you have to pay for all three next levels for the game.
 This is my third kids kindle purchase. So far it’s good . Got this for my niece and she loved it
 two year old loves it, easy to use
 It's perfect for my toddler daughter.
 My son loves it. Very nice tablet, should come with an additional charger cord or tell you where you can get one from because they are hard to find online.
 Great
 Nice tab, my grandson love it.
 MY GRANDSON LOVES HIS TABLET
 It freezes a lot, dies quickly,  and its gets very glitchy.
 It's a great deal.  Got it on sale.  My daughter is 8 .  She loves all her Disney shows and there're do many games to choose from.  The free Free time alone is worth it.
 it was a gift
 My toddler loves using it and I also use sometimes as well using the parent profile.
 This tablet is everything I wanted in a tablet for my kids lot of apps easy to use very durable and educational I would recommend this to any and everybody at this point I can't find anything negative to say about this tablet 2 thumbs up
 This was a great Christmas gift to the grand babies!
 I dont think I can go anywhere without his tablet :)  it has made my travels so easyy :) thanks a lot.
 Like that they can play the games they like not thrilled with the memory
 My son is now 8  years old  And he is falling in love with  The tablet and I love it to  but I think Amazon should upgrade the tablet to make more features.
 Wonderful device. We have 3 already.
 So far so good. A bit different set up than an ipad but feel confident in the safety of the shock protector .
 Love the product, it's very kid friendly. The case is durable and strong for an 3 year old, would recommend a screen protector. Lastly the free year of Amazon kid is amazing.
 Best Christmas present I purchased.
 This tablet was great until, suddenly, it wouldn't charge anymore. We tried everything, but it wouldn't hold a charge. Disappointed. We got three at the same time, so hoping the other two don't have the same fate.
 So far so good was very skeptical to buy due to all the bad reviews about the warranty but i havent needed to use it yet....you must download games and the unlimited access is only for a year so be mindful of that
 My daughter loves it. Make sure you get a big enough memory card mine keeps saying low storage.
 I bought it for my daughter for Christmas and I love that she can have her apps and games on the kids side and I can use what I need as the regular tablet. I'm only giving it 3 stars because it's starting to not charge at all or VERY SLOWLY and I'm not even done paying it off yet!
 Best thing ever for a two year old lol
 Product was great til the charging port went out now useless. Says on the site 2 year warranty, but than after a year they remove that feature to file a complaint! Not cool amazon
 its fine
 Not bad but cannot use google plat store just amazon
 Perfect for 9 year old.
 Less than a year and it no longer charges!!! What ever happened to the replacement deal kindle had where if no longer worked they would replace it!!! Not satisfied!!!
 My Grandson loves it!<br/>Thank you very much!
 My kids love it! They use it daily!
 Grand baby loves it !!!!!
 My daughter loves it.
 Thanks great product!
 It’s absolutely horrible. The screen goes in and out, the calibration is off, it freezes forcing it to be turned off and on multiple times a day.
 He loves it!
 Pre loaded with awesome educational apps.  Our 3 1/2 year old grandson loves this awesome learning tool!
 Xmas present for my 3 snd 5 year olf and they love it...my only complaint is on your app store you have pay apps snd the kids try to download....they don't understand...
 May be too complicated for even older parents and grandparents if not computer savy.<br/>Kids catch on pretty fast but need help getting started.Once working it is a great time occupier!
 It came with a cover that is like a Nerf ball.  Protects the unit very well. The tablet is suitable for any use for a child or adult. Would be nice if the kids app would come on automatically without logging in after s complete shut down.
 This was the greatest Christmas gift for my 5 year old ever. He loves it and I love that I can set his screen time. This tablet exceeds my expectations completely. The games that come on it you can't beat and I love having the parent account. Will buy again once youngest is old enough.
 I thought it was able to connect to YouTube and Netflix I guess I was wrong. It's also very slow and I have fast internet
 My daughter loves her tablet. I love the durable case, it’s perfect for an active 3 year old. I like the fact that I can use the tablet and then switch to the kid friendly mode for her.
 Good shape
 My daughter loves it. The size is perfect and the cushion protector is awesome since she has dropped already a couple times.
 Perfect size, construction &amp; capabilities for my granddaughter. She absolutely loves it!
 It is great lots of stuff for my son to do and play he loves it
 Granddaughter LOVES her ipad
 Poor performance and the power is not lasting.Better to go for any other android tab with its half price.
 I gave it to my 6 years old daughter. She rapidly learned how to manage it and started play the games and read the books. The online content is rich. Also., the tools to control the kids access are very helpful and really work.
 I purchased 3 of these, one for each child. Had to get 2 replaced in the first 6 months because of charging issues and now the 3rd (which is just past the year warranty) is having the same issues and will not turn on or charge.
 Perfect choice for a five-year old grandchild.
 Purchased for a grandchild and she loves it.
 Got them for grandkids for Christmas  seem to be good, they have destroyed all the cheaper ones I bought them hopefully these hold up better.
 my daughter loves it
 Very limited on what you can add
 My daughter loves her tablet and I love that it's easy for her to navigate between books and tv shows and she's only 18 months!
 very good
 Love it !
 Grand daughter loves it..!
 Granddaughter opened up for Xmas and she was excited to watch her baby shark videos and sound doesn't work😖 she was so disappointed..faulty tablet, called Amazon and they're sending me a new one ASAP! Thanks Amazon
 THE WARRANTY IS FAKE.
 I’ve purchased two of these, one returned due to not charging. So three total. The two brand new ones have been used for less than a month and will not charge properly or hold a battery.  Returned
 Purchased this for my 2 year old grandson. He absolutely loves it!
 Not happy with this item, touch screen freezes and takes a very long time to transition, with a toddler that makes it all the more tougher!
 Not to happy with.  They will not stay charged.
 I love how light weight the product is, I am disappointed with how slow the tablet is when loading and downloading apps
 This was for my grandson he was so excited it has a good protective case and more then enough caps ability to play for him.
 The tablet worked as is should but it messed up the games if it didnt have constant wifi. I dont believe it should be considered kids edition considering I've sent one back already plus my sons charging port is messed up now..
 I bought this tablet for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. And I love the feature of the two different profiles for her and for me so that way everything in her profile is kid friendly. I love this tablet.
 These are great kids tablets that have easy parental controls.
 A great product the kids love it.
 ok.
 Easy to use and love the thick case for my toddler
 too slow, and if you do not have the connection the children's activities will not work. disappointed, I expected better .
 Works great! We like it but it is also our 4th one.
 Love the kindle just don’t like the charging issues
 So far I am in love with this tablet! I got it and started it right up and set up my childs acct. It is very easy to use, has games designed for your kids age group, and has a nice bumber to protect from drops. It is very light weight so it wont be hard for your little ones to handle
 Better than I expected. Case is thick foam and great protection
 Buena y el cover el mejor compre dos para mis dos nieta y una tiene1 año y otra 9  me encanta
 This really hasnt been working as well outside of a strong wifi connection. But it is fun and keeps my munchkin entertained.
 Ive only has the product for a month so far and so far so good. It keeps a good charge , its sturdy my daughter have already dropped it a couple of times and no cracks or scratches.
 Nice device if you live in the USA, if you are not there do not buy the kid table, due to it doesn't work<br/>the video section do not allow to see any video and you also can not remove this app from the device, Its hard to explain a 4 year kid that he can not see a program that suppose to be for kids due to he is born a race in Costa Rica and not US.<br/>and also is hard to get the web programs in another languages even when you set up the device in Spanish
 I love it!  I bought it for Christmas for my 4.5 yr old grandson and he loves it!  I love the bumper that is on it too, so it will not break if he drops it.
