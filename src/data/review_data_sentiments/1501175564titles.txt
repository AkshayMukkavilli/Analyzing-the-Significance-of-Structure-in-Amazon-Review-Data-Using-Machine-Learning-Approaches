READ THIS BOOK!
What Happened? I Couldn't Finish It. Hillary Rodham Clinton
After reading this I couldn‚Äôt believe she lost. She, according to her was the greatest candidate ever.
"The Buck Starts Here" would be a better title
"what Hillary wants you to think happened"
Tells more about HRC than about the election
Excuses Excuses.
great insight into a misunderstood person
A REVEALING AND CANDID ACCOUNT OF THE 2016 ELECTION, ITS AFTERMATH, AND MUCH MORE
Review Deleted--Again
The book didn't need to be written
This book could be re-titled as, "America Dodges a Bullet."
This pretty much sums up the book
Didn't really learn anything new
Authentic Voice of Hilary Clinton
HRC - My Hero
Amazon wiped out negative reviews
I didn't read much of it.

Emotionally candid and Secretary Clinton answered all the questions I would have liked to asked her over a cocktail: how did you feel during those debates, how are you so resilient and not angry at the American voters who let you down, how do you handle stress and personal attacks?  How did you feel on Nov.9th and how could you go to Trump‚Äôs inauguration without throwing up?  HRC answers it honestly and from the heart.  I enjoyed reading her account.  My heart is still broken, but we will fight on together.
