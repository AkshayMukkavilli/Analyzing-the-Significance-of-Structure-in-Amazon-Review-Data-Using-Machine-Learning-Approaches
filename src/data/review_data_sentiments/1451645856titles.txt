Destined to Become a Literary Classic
Haunting coming of age story
Schmaltz and predictability in a small town in 1961
but his mysteries I read for pleasure as I love his main character Cork O'Connor
Beautifully written mystery and coming of age
If you love beautifully written novels that are also mysteries, this is the one for you.
A satisfying mystery with a touch of faith that's not overly preachy
Not the ordinary Cork O'Connor Book
Redemptive and Rewarding!
Mystery novel with a spiritual glow
An enjoyable read
brilliant

Coming of age story that shows true reflection!
Exquisite! Subtle! Impactful!

Pellucid mix of early `60s middle America and speculative mystery
Ordinary or Extraordinary?
Slow and Familiar
Spoilers Included:
A very honest story narrated with a touch of grace.
Thoroughly Satisfying.
This is nearly a masterpiece
More than just a crime novel.Sprawling tale of a family in crisis with strong characters and an unyielding belief in God's grace
