 I've owned Arlo Pros and Go's for over a year now. I gave both of those cams a 1-star review but kept them because they're better than nothing and really haven't found a good wireless replacement yet. I bought 5 Blink XT's and placed them in the place of 5 of my old Arlo Pros for comparison. I was really hoping I could permanently replace my Arlos with them. I've been using them for a month and I think I have plenty of experience with them now. While Blink XT fixed many problems Arlo has, unfortunately overall Blink is a big disappointment for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. The Blink Cams have a very short range to their base station. I'd estimate that I can place my Arlo Pros at least 3 times the distance from their base station and they're still within range. You have to keep the Blink XT cams very close to their base station.<br/>2. The motion sensor in the Blink XT is far wrose than in the Arlo Pro. If you raise the sensitivity in Blink XT above 5 you start getting too many false positive alerts. If you leave it at 5, it will only trigger when someone is very close to it. Arlo Pro's however have a much better motion detection range.<br/>3. The attachment that comes with Blink is flimsy. Wind can easily move the attachment and the cam which triggers false positive alerts. You can however pretty solidly attache Arlo Pros outside and they have never triggered a false positive alert due to wind blowing them. Let me also reiterate that I put the 5 new Blink XT in the same spot 5 of my Arlo Pros were. So it's really an apples-to-apples comparison.<br/><br/>The above reasons really make it a no brainer that Blink can't replace Arlo Pros. But there are still more weaknesses in Blink XT:<br/><br/>4. You can only have a total of 1 cam live-view at a time with Blink. Arlo allows you 5 live-view cams per base station. If you have multiple base stations, multiply the number of base stations by 5 and that's how many live-views you can have with Arlo. I'm not sure why Blink had to have this restriction.<br/>5. Blink XT cams require a connection to both your Wifi and its own base station. Why? Arlo cams only require a connection to their base station.<br/>6. There's no web interface with Blink. Again, why? When I'm at my computer and want to check out what triggered the cam, I prefer to use my computer. I only resort to the cell phone when I'm not near a computer. Blink always forces you to use your phone.<br/>7. Blink doesn't display your batter percentage left unlike Arlo. Blink just says "OK" for battery so you don't know how much batter is still really left. Based on some research I did, Blink's batteries won't last more than a couple of months despite their 2-year claim.<br/><br/>Let me me also mention that Blink XT is better than Arlo for the following reasons:<br/>1. Blink XT runs on standard batteries you can easily replace or buy your own rechargeable batteries. Arlo Pros however run on their own proprietary batteries which go flat fast, often go dead, and replacing them cost a whopping $50.<br/>2. No subscription cost with Blink<br/>3. Other than the motion sensitivity issue and the poor range, the software with Blink XT appears pretty solid. Arlo has a lot of bugs which they don't bother to fix.<br/>4. Blink is pretty solid. It's always up. Arlo cams and base stations and even their service often go down. Arlo is also dishonest about their down times. They have lots of them and usually either don't admit it or blame it on a third party. Once my entire library disappeared and they blamed it on wrong use of filters. I never used filters for library search. I also saw other users complain about the same issue on the discussion forums, yet Arlo blamed me.<br/>5. I haven't had to call Blink customer service yet. But Arlo's customer service couldn't be worse and they treat their customers like idiots. I contacted them many times and it's just a useless run-around each time.<br/>6. Blink is really smart when it comes to recordings. You can delay successive recordings (not with Arlo) and you can also set much shorter recording times with Blink than Arlo. This can help save a lot of battery.
 I owned both Arlo Pro and Blink XT. Depending on your needs, I would highly recommend Blink XT<br/>Pros<br/>(a) Intermittent internet due to power outages. The Blink would recover and immediately syn-up with the base station rather quickly. For Arlo Pro, it would some time be a trial-and-error process requiring multiple reset to the base station or even the router/modem.<br/>(b) Blink had almost flat in construction and has a very small foot print. That would mean you could install the Blink practically almost every wear.<br/>(c) The Blink's two 'AA' size battery life was far superior to that Arlo Pro's rechargeable batteries. Depending on the level of trigger detection around your house, Arlo Pro rechargeable battery's life typical ranged from short 3 weeks to slightly more than a month for outside installation. Batteries life worsen in cold weather.<br/>(d) Blink was far more cost-effective and cheaper than Arlo Pro. Arlo Pro was just way more expensively.<br/>(e) The support on Arlo Pro is typically via the forum online and is generally poor in my view. You can call the customer support line during your 90 warranty period. However, I'm not sure if they charge any fees after 90 days warranty period.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>(a) Blink had a field of view of 110 degree whereas the Arlo Pro had a 130 degree field of degree.<br/>(b) Depending on your sensitivity of motion trigger adjustment, Arlo Pro was able to capture more motion detection more accurately than the Blink. That being said, Blink is generally okay for general motion triggers like birds fly across and delivery man.<br/>(c)  Subjectively, I felt that the image quality on Arlo Pro was clearer than Blink. However, both were generally good.<br/><br/>Both Blink and Arlo Pro are very good motion-triggered surveillance products in that both were able to survive typical cold weather temperature in the snow. Both provide free cloud storage up to certain number of camera. Check their respective website for more information. In terms of cost, I would certainly recommend the Blink XT to Arlo Pro. I hope my review would be helpful to those deciding between Blink XT and Arlo Pro. On another note, I would not recommend the older series Arlo wire-free.
 Really awesome and easy to setup and use. Very user friendly. Everyone in my house has access to the cameras and alerts, so it's peace of mind for all. Wife is super happy (there's the real review....). Checked Arlo...meh...it looks prettier, but this one has better options. Free cloud storage for one. That was a big seller for me. I expect the system to detect motion, have excellent sound, good night vision, etc., which this system has and more.<br/><br/>Top Five:<br/><br/>1. Price was very competitive (price seems to be creeping up though). I paid $479<br/>2. Easy of use and setup for the family (kids especially). App works really well.<br/>3. Distance cameras located from the house (50 feet is my furthest and still great - I have a rented standard Comcast router/modem at 75 mps)<br/>4. Pic quality with sound is impressive (like the sound part)<br/>5. Very easy to install. Installed the cameras in less than an hour. Deciding where to put them? Take your time B4 making a decision.<br/><br/>The other nice feature is the ability to add more cameras easily and to move cameras to a new or temporary location.<br/><br/>Best of luck!<br/><br/>UPDATE - 9/22/2017<br/><br/>STILL AWESOME!!!<br/><br/>I gave five reasons why I like it, so here's some criticism (nothings perfect!):<br/><br/>1. The arm that attaches to the cameras is a little weak. Be careful with it. Seems to be fine once installed.<br/>2. If you don't place the cameras in the right spot or set the sensitivity correctly, you will receive many motion detection notices.<br/>3. Squirrels and birds love to look at the one I have in a tree facing my house...pretty funny actually!!<br/><br/>Still like it!
 Well as the reviews have said its ok. Liked it at first but now wondering whether to return. Its great in the fact that its completely wireless but I also believe that to be its downfall. Especially touting the long battery life. To me its more like a deer camera with the ability to upload the footage. And I dont know if a deer camera triggers better than these or not. I purchased this for the low maintenance and battery life and easy set up. Did I get that? So far yes. Its true when someone complains about something you should listen though because this equipment does have its downfalls. I'm going to try to list the pros and cons as simple as I can.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Battery life - So far only had a month.<br/>Wireless<br/>Easy to set up<br/>Runs on AA batteries<br/>Video quality<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Night time- Things look white so its basically useless identifying someone that is too close.<br/>Recording- As others have stated it catches like the last bit of footage by the time it turns on. i.e. I could walk up to my garage leave the garage and it will start recording on the way out. (YES I HAVE ADJUSTED THE ALMOST USELESS SETTINGS)<br/>Settings- The sensitivity is either too much or not enough there really is no fine tuning ( I believe a good update could fix this)<br/>The fact that its wireless- I believe this limits alot and creates most the issues as far as recording comes i.e. it not being on all the time.<br/><br/>UPDATE: 9.4.18<br/>The 2 years battery life is a lie from the manufacturer, I don't know what kind of testing they did to verify that. I purchased this item on 2/28/18. I installed a few days after that. As of 9/3/18 I got a message that my carport camera is offline the batteries died. Why bc thats the only camera that gets triggered a few times a day. The company must want you to install these cameras where there is little to no use whatsoever. All I get are notifications about high usage. Like duh thats what the camera is for to monitor things. They want you to have the cameras off when your home and on when you leave. The app actually suggests these things... crazy.  Now you guys get a one star just for the free cloud storage. And btw the mounts are horrible.<br/><br/>Update: 2.27.19<br/><br/>Tomorrow marks a year. I have it still Bc I bought it lol. I tried some yi indoor cameras that are absolutely garbage, so garbage you can’t leave reviews on yi cameras bc amazon has it blocked out. I think I should have definitely bout another name brand system. All my batteries on low area mounted places are still good and haven’t been replaced. Carport camera has been at least 5 sets within a year.
 Over the years I've had a variety of security cameras, starting from the old style Foscam style, to Dropcams, on to Nest Cam HD. I've been pleased with all of those at their time.<br/><br/>This brand really caught my eye because it is battery operated. If you live in a place you don't own, the desire to install minimal power infrastructure can make some places nearly unreachable unless you have a battery operated device. Even if you do own the house, still, sometimes you don't want to run power cables to/on the outside of your house.<br/><br/>I did a lot of research and was surprised at how positive most of the reviews were.<br/><br/>Long story short, I was able to get it installed where I wanted it, outside of a 2nd story window pointing at a narrow walkway path alley between buildings, and it functions as I want it to and as I hoped.<br/><br/>Longer story: This is not even similar to a Nest or Dropcam. It is not 24x7 video streaming/recording. This is action-initiated only, and limited even further by "scheduling". For example, if you had them on the back door of a business or in a back room, you might schedule it to only be on at night when you're not there. It does run on batteries, afterall.<br/><br/>What it does is create clips, or "snippets" like you might think of when seeing security footage on TV many years ago. They are in color in the day and black and white in night, and the illuminator is really amazing at the distance it can shine and provide vision at night. The video is definitely not as crisp and is a bit blurry or soft at night, but it is definitely good enough to see "what's going on" etc.<br/><br/>Setup was simple. The app worked easily, if you are also setting up a sync module as well that was easy, and the camera was easy to pair and bring online. It took me a while to understand what the sync module was about. At first I thought it was some type of low power wireless to communicate with the camera but it's not. It's a command module that manages the settings in the camera, or cameras. It runs on wifi, as do the cameras. You don't necessarily need to have the camera near the sync module.<br/><br/>The packaging feels like cheap imported junk. The device also feels like it's a simple thing. But it works well, and it's cheap, and it doesn't have a monthly fee to store the video on the cloud!<br/><br/>Finally, you have a lot of configuration options in the app and they're mostly around sensitivity of the motion detection, length of clips, and when the camera should be armed.<br/><br/>I use this in a very narrow alley style walkway between buildings, and there is not a lot of action-- an occasional person or cat. I would imagine putting this on a street where there is constant traffic would drain the batteries a lot faster, and that's where I use my Nest Cameras.<br/><br/>This is not a Nest replacement for most. It's definitely a disruptor in the home camera industry, and differentiated from what's in the market already, at at that!<br/><br/>I waited for the weather proof one to come out before placing my first order, and I've now ordered a second one to test the boundaries of the wifi outside!<br/><br/>I'll update the review if things change. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you have specific Q&amp;A.
 So! I’ve been using blink for about, 3 months now, ever since my boyfriends car got keyed in our SHARED garage at our apartment complex, we bought one and hung it up in the garage. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, I recently bought a car back in June, a VERY expensive one too. Not to brag but it adds on to the story.. I was minding my own buisness and boom! A motion detect is notifying me on my phone, I click it, and WALLA! I caught the keyer! He put a nice big scrape on my right fender! Lovely, and was so nice to show the police.<br/>Thanks blink!
 The concept is great because you can move the cameras where and when you want/need to. But the 2 year battery life of the lithium batteries is actually only 6 days- yes days! The motion detectors are more sensitive to side motion and the range of view trips extends farther. Sensors react, despite fine tuning the sensitivity, to wind and shadows.<br/>I have 11 tickets open with the manufacturer. They boast 24 hour service and support but evening hours are only covered by novice, inexperienced techs. One specific problem was with signal- I had full bars but intermittent capture. They said buy an wifi extender but there own product does NOT support the separate SSIDs required when setting up an extender, booster. I bought a whole house router and since installing that I have spent more than 4 hours trying to get the cameras to work properly and finally gave up.<br/>I recommend looking for something  hard wired. Blink may be good for interior but they have a lot of fine tuning before I will consider them again.
 It's really hit or miss on these. I have (had) 2 of them - one has worked perfectly fine for about 2 months and the 2nd one was a complete nightmare. It continually went offline, disconnecting, no sound, crappy IR viewing etc. Several calls to Blink's so-called tech support just left me flabbergasted as to their "trouble-shooting" steps. First they want you to completely restart your modem/router system, even though nothing else in the house is experiencing problems - including another Blink XT camera and sync system. Once that's excruciatingly accomplished to no satisfaction, they wanted me to plug the camera into a USB power brick... like that's what I bought a remote-relocatable camera for. I did, just to appease the poor Blink CSR reading their awful script. After I crossed my fingers and toes just right, the camera DID come back online but as soon as I unplugged the USB and installed the batteries it died... I was able to FINALLY get it to come online after about the 15th time of plugging and unplugging the USB but for only about a day, then the same problems occurred. Blink never offered to replace the failing camera - just kept wanting me to restart my WiFi setup... needless to say I'm returning the crappy camera to Amazon for a refund. Unfortunately I cannot return the "good" camera because of time constraints. I guess when it decides to stop working - I'll just be out my $130. Proceed with caution...
 The biggest thing that this system has going for it is it's dead simple to setup. The biggest problem I'm having is that if I set the new XT to sensitivity 5 or higher I get to many false alerts. When I have it set to 4 all I get is a late trigger that shows the back of the person's head as they've already dropped off whatever they delivered at my front door and I see them walking away. Needs to trigger recoding way sooner. If that part worked right I would give it 5 stars because for the price and quality of video it can't be beat. No one else gives you so much free recording like blink does up to 7,200 total seconds of video (or 1,440 five-second events).  Hopefully it's something that can be fixed in software. Fingers crossed. 🤞
 I read all of the one-star reviews of this product and, for balance, I need to give a very positive one. Complaints were: Going Off-Line, Cheaply made, no live support, does not work in cold. Read carefully. I received my unit and, after a quick read of instructions, had the unit installed and working on my front porch in **about 15 minutes**. It seamlessly connected to my wifi and scanning in the camera module was a breeze. I set a schedule for active and non-active times and set the settings parameters for my needs. It has gone from the 60's down into low single digit temps here. The unit is on my front porch, fully exposed. It activates at 7:00pm and deactivates at 7:00am. Recently on a trip to Florida, I was able to go to the live view easily, with the iphone app, and check things out. I have it scoping out a wide angle from my front door out into the front yard and partial street. I have no misfire activation's. It fires every time for the mail carrier and the neighbors cat.  The picture is clean and very clear, The night vision works extremely well. Very Happy with the Blink System!
 I wanted to like it.  I already one XT camera and had no issues for 9 months so I decided to order 2 more to add the system.  Now, they are very spotty.  Of the new cameras 1. One of them has 5 bar connection to wifi but it's connection to the Blink Sync Module is only 1 bar.  2. the other new camera is 4 bars to the Blink Sync module  but the connection to wifi ranges between 4 bars and 2 bars.  My original camera has 5 bars on both the wifi and sync module.  I contacted Blink's support and they told me "move the cameras closer to the sync module".  If I have to cluster them together, it stops being a system.  As it is there are two on the front of the how and one on the back of the house with the sync module being about 15 feet from all three camera units.  I have the sync module as central as I can get it.  Now their customer support want me to move the cameras closer?  By what moving exterior walls in?  That's not a solution.  I'll be returning these and spending money on something more robust.  Like i said- the one worked great for 9 months and still does but if I can't add to it and make it a consistent system- it defeats the purpose.  UPDATE - after 9 days of back and forth notes with customer service telling me the most basic stuff "reboot", "try moving the camera closer to the module"  (after 15 feet there were issues with all of the cameras) etc. - I tried all combinations of moving the sync module to various places in the house and even the cameras.  I could never get all three cameras to sync consistently.  I could get 2 but never 3.  Blink also told me my wifi might be an issue.  It is not- I have a mesh system and am able to stream HD video on may patio or in my driveway.  I check the signal often.  SO - I went a bought a Ring floodlight and camera to put over the garage.  No problems with it.  It picks up the wifi just fine.  It needs no sync module.  The Ring costs more but I got more including 2 way voice.  Blink is ok for indoors and is inexpensive. To us it as an outdoor system requires  tweaking or getting multiple sync modules and creating multiple systems<br/><br/>More UPDATE:  The camera synced with the separate sync module (10 feet away) on it's own separate system has fluctuating signal strength both the wifi signal and sync module signal.  The wifi is totally fine as the Ring camera with floodlights I mounted above the Blink shows a 5 bar wifi signal.  So now Blink says they are sending me a new camera.  The previous customer service tech calls and notes kept telling me to move the camera closer.<br/><br/>No longer a Blink fan
 I bought the two camera system, and one camera is working fine.  The other camera intermittently posts unplayable videos and drains down the batteries.  I have had to replace the batteries twice in two months in the defective camera.  I have contacted customer service about the issue, but they refuse to believe it is an issue with the camera and instead tell me to reinstall the app.  Why would the app cause only one camera to have issues?  I've been going back and forth for several days with customer service and it's getting quite ridiculous.  I already have a Ring doorbell and should have bought the Ring Stick Up Cam.  The $3/mo fee would be worth it to actually have a working system.
 Two camera Blink XT system:  one camera would not install, regardless of workarounds suggested by Blink Home Security online technical help. The one camera that did install, was just about useless as it kept dropping the cloud in spite of very strong signals. This system is just not ready for prime time.  I should have taken the negative reviews to heart.  I shipped the set back to Amazon for prompt refund, which was accomplished quickly and without a hitch.  Bottom line: save yourself the grief and hassle and steer clear of Blink XT.  Because I wanted to go wireless, I ended up purchasing an Arlo Pro 3-camera system which installed without difficulty and is proving to be a much superior system compared to Blink XT.
 I liked the idea and the sales pitch on the TV however the advertised two year life for batteries is false. They lasted two months. The excuse was the camera is too far away from the sync module and WiFi.<br/>Hold on. The camera will eventually be located outside as designed and therefore won’t be near the sync module or WiFi as they are both inside. They told me that the batteries are only going to last two months and not the advertised two years based on the proximity of camera to sync module. I asked to return this item for a full refund as it is not as advertised. As I’d had it two months but not yet installed it they refused.  They also wouldn’t send me replacement batteries. So. The camera and sync module and WiFi are all currently inside my home but the batteries died after two months because the camera was too far away. Yeah right. Don’t waste your time or money. After purchase Customer support is nonexistent.
 I love the simplicity of the set up, while there is no zoom, it will at least let you know that someone is in your battle space.
 The SmartThings integration provided by a third party made the camera's work reasonably well.  Not everyone has an exact schedule, the desire to manually manipulate via the app several times a day, or work around the very limited and delayed IFTTT interface.  With no notice the company decided to cutoff the integration and with no real explanation/solution.  I'm unlikely to expand my ownership of these camera's partially due to the lack of the integration, but also largely due to the way they handled this case.
 I have 1 camera that works well, and one camera that is junk.  I ordered both directly from the Blink website.  I sent an email and managed to get a response from support.  Unfortunately their tier 1 email support team is completely useless.  They sent back stock answers and that had literally nothing to do with my problem, they didn't even read the issue I sent them.  After going back and forth on emails for several days I was allowed to schedule a phone call to speak with a live person.  The soonest I could schedule the call was a week out.  That's a red flag; they are so busy with support that no one can talk to you for at least a week.<br/><br/>After getting support on the phone and explaining the issue with the camera I was told to switch the locations of the two cameras, save some videos of the camera malfunctioning in the second spot, and call back in a week.  I had to leave town and couldn't call back for 3+ weeks, but when I tried I found that the number I was given doesn't go to Blink support.<br/><br/>As another irritation, the support module has lost connection and needed to be unplugged and resynced twice in the last year.<br/><br/>The camera that works does a fair job.  The other one is garbage and Blink has no interest in resolving their hardware issue.
 Bought this product due to recent vandalisms in our neighborhood. Works 50% of the time, if you have the sensitivity set to high you get a “High Battery Usage” notification every day telling you to lower the sensitivity and if you do It won’t capture what you need it to. Of course the battery lasts 2 years, it’s because this camera is never on. Captured 15 seconds prior to a vandal egging our house and breaking a $600 fountain that sits in the center frame of the camera. Very Unhappy. Thanks for nothing blink. Time to rip all these hideous stickers off my windows and hire a real security company.
 Bought two of these cameras plus a one camera+sync module kit in June. The cameras themselves are nice. Motion sensing is great and the batteries last a really long time. Free cloud storage for clips is also a nice bonus. You can also power the sync module via USB without the wall adapter, so I'm able to power it via a USB port on my UPS.<br/><br/>I'm giving this one star because Blink removed the SmartThings integration with no notice and will not give any details as to why. They also suggested everyone who uses the integration change their password but will not elaborate as to why they're suggesting that. The author of the integration has also not been told any reason why Blink has done this. The integration with SmartThings was a large part of the reason why I chose to buy these cameras so this move by Blink is very upsetting. The fact that they did this without any notice is also extremely shady. I would not recommend anyone purchase Blink products going forward.
 I got eight cameras for a vacation home. Started out great...everything synced up just fine. This morning, a month later, the app reports all eight cameras are offline. It reports that the WiFi connection is good and the Sync Module strength is good. So, now I'm blind until I can get back out there. I really needed something reliable as I'm not always there. This product, so far, is not passing the "reliability test."
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R3INB7PR47WECX"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1BOkrvGkgS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1yC8Uz+pkS.png"/><br/>I bought the 5-camera pack for some basic home security, and to check out what’s going on around my home located in a normal, suburban subdivision. I was really sold on the 2-year lifespan and 100% battery operated - which means I could put them anywhere on my property.<br/><br/>The cameras were easy to install, and did a reasonable job capturing motion. My only complaint with the recording is that the cameras seem to capture video really late after motion is detected. Sometimes I only got someone walking out of the frame. But it usually did a decent job.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is that these cameras seem to be irresistable to squirrels! The website seemed to indicate that you can position these things in trees, which I did. But they promptly get eaten by the squirrels! Each time is it like flushing $100 down the drain. These cameras are all plastic, and don’t last a day around trees.<br/><br/>If you want an easy-to-install, casual video system then this is a good choice. If you think that you’re going to get 2 years or can mount these “anywhere”, then best move to some other camera system.
 Just received this curt email from Blink and within two hours of receiving the email the integration was gone. These cameras are just useless junk now.<br/><br/>"On December 19, 2017, Blink is discontinuing support for all SmartThings integrations including the developer RBoy app. For your security, we recommend that you change your Blink password. We thank for your continued support of Blink and apologize for any inconvenience. Thanks,<br/>Blink"
 What I loved most about Blink was that you could integrate it into SmartThings. On December 19, Blink pulled the plug on Snartthings, without any advanced warning and no explanation.  Very unprofessional. Now I can’t get the cameras to work the way I need.
 I want to start by saying this product is very easy to setup and when it works it does a ok job. Like most other reviews have said the motion catches things at the end, so you’ll get the mailman walking away. The easiest thing to do to prevent this is have 2 cameras on the high traffic area from different angles. This will help eliminate the late triggering issues these things have. This is not an option for all people and it’s annoying because you’ll need extra cameras for areas that should only require 1.<br/><br/>I am now 5 months into my<br/>Experience and my one camera started acting up and only worked half the time. When I finally found time to take it down and try to reset and re-add it to my system it would no longer communicate with the main module. I did the obvious things, reset the home internet, reset the blink module, change the batteries and it still would not connect to my system. I picked up the phone and called the blink support line. Alvin answered the phone. The gentleman spoke broken English and after repeating and spelling out my name 4 times the guy still didn’t have it correct so I hung up. I am now getting rid of this awful system and installing a legit system. I highly recommend taking the time and money to get a real security system installed if your in a home you will be at for a while. If your looking for a cheap, easy to install, mediocre at best security system with awful outsourced tech support go ahead and buy this blink system.
 Blink just disabled integration with Samsung SmartThings overnight (for the second time!) with no notice whatsoever, rendering my seven cameras completely useless. What a disgraceful business practice.
 I loved how easy this was to set up and use.  It worked perfectly for the first few months.<br/><br/>In the past 2 weeks or so, the system fails once or twice a day.  The sync module and camera both show they are connected with five bars, but then I get the dreaded "Thumbnail failed" error when the camera sends session motion or I try to take a pic from the app.  The ONLY solution for me is to delete the camera and sync module, and do a complete reinstall.  No other combination of resetting the router or other advice that comes from the Blink "support" works.  This system reinstall works for anywhere from a few hours to overnight, then it fails again.<br/><br/>In the few months the system worked, it was great.  Now it's completely unusable.  Can't wait to see if I get another canned "Sorry you're having trouble" email from Blink...<br/><br/>UPDATE:  Finally got through to a person, and received a replacement camera.  It installed without issue and seemed to work well all day.  Today while I'm at work, it's not picking up any of the kids coming home and leaving but I can still snap a pic.  I did wonder why the blue "recording" light didn't show up yesterday even tho it worked properly.  I don't have any confidence in my Blink anymore.
 The product comes with a note enclosed "Before you send this back read this."  Followed by how to contact their support desk.  I should have taken a hint from that.  If you proceed and don't send it back, from my experience, you will be in contact with their support people, multiple times before even getting anything running acceptably.  THIS IS NOT PLUG AND PLAY!  To start, this is an outdoor survielence camera.  You would expect some effort to secure it outdoors so no one could take it, knock it down, whatever.  The mount is held in place with a single screw, and the camera mounts to the mount by pushing it on.  It is held on by friction alone. You literally could knock it off the mount brushing against it.  The mount that was delivered to me couldn't support the camera on an angle.  I called, they said "there are a lot of problems with these, we'll send you a new one", and promptly did. This being a survielence camera, my expectation was that it would have a wide angle of view.  No, in camera terms, it's more of a "normal" focal length lens.  This has a lot of impact on where you mount it and what you will see.  Not much.  The camera needs to connect to a sync unit that is wifi connected to your router.  While that combo initially connected and broadcast a live steam of a few seconds (I had to keep re-starting the live stream), after awhile it no longer connected at all.  I started receiving "Live View Failed" and "Camera Busy" messages.  I was told by their support that the sync module needs to be 5 feet or less from my router.  Of course, there is likewise a distance limitation from the sync module to the camera, moving the sync module closer to the router will have an affect on the connection from the camera to the sync module. Don't know about you, but I was not/am not ready to relocate my router and rearrange my networked equipment to meet the very finicky and limited needs of this camera system.  While going through all of this, my, prior to now, stable wifi network started acting really flaky.  Devices started loosing connection.  The router started arbitrarily attempting to reassign a different band width to equipment, I presume because the band width I normally use for most of my stuff was unavailable.  When I disconnected the sync module my network stablized.  You should also be aware that when you start the App, like if you hear the doorbell ring and want to see who's there, it takes many seconds (10 -20) for the App to get the camera going, and the delay in viewing is also many seconds later than live. Even working it is very clunky and cumbersome.  They show a pic of someone monitoring a robin's nest with one of these.  Perhaps that's an acceptable use, but survielence?  No, I sent mine back and strongly recommend against considering this camera.  Buy it at your own risk and don't say you weren't warned.
 Works GREAT.<br/>Had a little difficulty on initial set up . Primarily because I forgot my WIFI password.<br/>All set up and working great.<br/>Good Picture and Audio.
 first the good: The camera itself is simple to install and daytime video is pretty good. It's only 720P though. It has a 110° mounted view. There is NO FEE for your cloud storage of video snippets. Now for the bad : The IR (night vision) is HORRIBLE. So unless you decide to light the area you want to monitor at night, this camera is NOT for you !! I had to buy LED Flood lights to illuminate my shed at night so this camera could "see it". The shed is only 20 feet or so from the camera  and is easily "seen" during daylight hours. I also had a hard time connecting the synch module to my network. It turns out that my android 6.1 has a smart switch in the wifi settings that needed to be turned off before I could connect the device to my network !!
 UPDATE--2 YEAR BATTERY LIFE IS BS!<br/><br/>Generally, I do like this camera. The price is great, and I chose it because you don't have to pay for cloud storage.  The video quality is good, and sound quality is good too.  It's perfect for what I wanted it for.<br/><br/>I put it over my driveway--this is where my kids usually come and go, so I can see when they get home from school.  So that means that the camera picks up video every time I pull the cars in/out of the garage--multiple times a day for 2 cars.  So a few days after I installed the camera, I got a notification that based on the usage, the batteries would NOT last 2 years.<br/><br/>My first set of batteries lasted about 5 months.  I replaced Amazon Basic batteries with AC Delco. Those lasted about 5 weeks--so I thought that the cut rate battery brand was the problem, and went back to Amazon Basic batteries.  THOSE LASTED 2.5 WEEKS.<br/><br/>I like this camera, and everything about it, other than battery life. But I can't recommend it if it needs new batteries every 1-2 months, or LESS.
 I thought I understood the limitations of a battery powered camera. Short clips, lower resolution, etc. But I was so so very wrong. I was initially drawn in by the camera's long battery life using standard sized batteries. Video quality was adequate and set up was easy.<br/><br/>But, and this is a big but, the camera is so slow to react to motion that you miss all the action. It will pick up on motion but by the time it starts recording the event is over unless the person/thing stays in the frame for 15+ seconds (I tested this). I tried changing all of the settings but nothing helped improve the reaction time. I even moved the camera to different spots to see if the detection works better with different angles/lighting. Nope. Very unfortunate and disappointing.
 I had nothing but trouble with this so I returned it. Even when armed, I could pull up in my driveway's turn-around, get out of my car, walk back and forth several times from side to side where I had the Blink installed, and no motion detection whatsoever. Then other times it would work. Sometimes I would get an error message that the Blink had quit working (Android phone with a recent version). The mounting bracket was flimsy; the back was hard to get off to change the batteries, I broke my thumb nail doing so.<br/><br/>The only redeeming factors were no fee and the video, when it worked, was pretty good.<br/><br/>I'm sticking with my Canary cameras, even with the fee they are better in every way.
 Great cameras. I have purchased several units and love the availability to view at any time. Great features, motion, audio (one way of course), temperature, and battery condition. The easiest system to get up and working - amazingly easy to install. (Throw the included mounting screw away, the head will strip if using in hard wood)<br/>I have reviewed other systems, wireless, and these are by far the best. There are other systems that claims to be better, their features are identical, yet they cost 50% more??  Not sure why they are better.<br/>This is not a perfect system, you still rely on your internet, which is the ONLY drawback. I have had great luck installing these at some distance from my router in the house, to the module in my garage, about 75 feet from the router,  then about 100' +  to the camera - very pleased at how far they will still connect with a clear picture.<br/><br/>Cannot go wrong with these !!
 If you are looking for a stand alone system, there are adequate although the motion detection could be quicker.  If however this is part of a whole house system or part of your security system; my personally experience is I wouldn't trust them.  It doesn't play well with others such as Smartthings, even to the point where they killed any integration (killed a year long integration with ZERO notice).  Sure you can use IFTTT but who really wants a lag when it comes to camera?  If your looking for best of breed or plan on integrating with existing home security and automation, I would look elsewhere because even if they have future integration they have proven on multiple occasions they will pull it with little regard for their customers.  (who knows, they could have had a good reason but you won't get any notice nor an explanation).
 I have had the blink camera for a while now.  Unfortunately, I have had it long enough that I can no longer return it through Amazon.  The Blink Support team is very attentive.  I have done everything they asked me to do, to get it to work reliably:  I moved it, I reset it, I moved it again, I rebooted it, I reset it, I changed the sensitivity, I reset it.....<br/><br/>It doesn't work reliably - it's sporadic.  I had a guest come in at midnight and there was absolutely no video.  I have come and gone from my house - no video.  There are lots of videos of comings and goings, just not all of them.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  A sporadic security system does not make me feel secure.<br/><br/>I have requested a refund.  We'll see.....
 I will give this a 2 star because of the very poor Customer Support and a 41/2 for the camera. The cameras are okay except the one fogs during very humid conditions - this is rare. I contacted Blink Customer Service because of the fogging. They CS just give me such a run around. They finally wore me down and I told them I was just returning them and gave a 3 star review. I was contacted by a senior rep from Blink after he read my review and all my contact  messages from Blink. He apologized for the poor customer service and sent me a free camera for my trouble. So I have moved from 3 to 4 stars.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R3ITOLWAQF9KO1"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91UEMr9zqfS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91SK+CyyuzS.png"/> I had my home broken into on 10/12.  The robber kicked in the front door while I was at work, and made off with some belongings. After re-inforcing the front door, I ordered this Blink camera and set it up.  On Monday 10/22, at 3:12 pm, the same robber (he was carrying my checkbook from previous break in) kicked in the BACK door and set off my Blink.  I got a text to my phone, verified on video, and called 911.  I got multiple videos of the guy taking stuff in my house.  Then at 3:20, I got a video of police coming in the front door with guns drawn, and a few minutes later a phone call that they had the suspect in custody.  I returned home a few minutes later, and they had the suspect cuffed and ready to go into the police car.  In the video, he had many of my tools in that cooler, and he was wearing... of all things... a welding helmet he took from my son's room.  Other videos show his face, but leaving the house redhanded with my property when he met a k9 unit should  be enough to convict him.
 Bought the camera system mainly to watch the driveway, as it is in the back of the house and cannot be seen when inside. When someone rings the wireless doorbell at the garage door, we must either go out to the back yard or open the garage door to see who it is. So instead of getting just one, we also got one to watch the front porch as well, just for fun.<br/><br/>Camera -<br/>The camera is a typical outdoor camera within a weatherproof enclosure. The seal on it is excellent but doesn't not appear to be as durable if dropped. So don't drop it!<br/>The mounting clip seems a little flimsy and cheap and am worried that it would become loose and drop the whole camera, however, it is secure for now. The mounting clip can angle the camera properly if it is top mounted, but if it is side mounted (like sticking the camera out from the side of a wall), it has trouble being angled vertically, as the clip only moves in the direction of the axis it is mounted on.<br/>The video quality of the camera is excellent! When not zoomed in, the picture detail is excellent and is very clear. The camera feed is smooth and real time. The sound quality as well is excellent, you can hear everything clearly. On Android, the video cannot be zoomed in but on iPhone the app can zoom in and the quality decreased significantly.<br/>Night vision is mediocre. The picture quality is there but the distance the device can view is about 10 feet at best. The picture is also very dark considering that the setting of the IR is changed to high. Perhaps it has something to do with the street lighting also in the picture so the sensor feels that it does not need to initiate increased IR lighting.<br/>The camera has been installed during the warm months so far, we'll see how it fares in the winter where temperature can get down to -30C.<br/>Battery life appears to be excellent. At first the camera has been recording events for about a couple of weeks and then with the events turned off and only accessing the camera periodically, the battery life is still at full. What I like is that the batteries are AA and readily available anywhere.<br/><br/>Sync Module -<br/>The sync module is a very small and light box and houses the brains of the system. Again, it seems that if you drop it, the thing will shatter, so don't drop it. It works well with the cameras and the response on the app is fairly fast when changing camera settings and accessing video.<br/><br/>System -<br/>The system itself require some improvement but has a lot of potential.<br/>When accessing the cameras through the app, the app lays out your connected cameras and can easily choose which camera to view.<br/>Live video feed access is quick and has the ability to turn on and off the sound.<br/>One thing that requires improvement and hope that the software can be upgraded is the ability to choose which areas of what the camera sees, to monitor. You have the ability to turn on or off the setting which controls the automatic recording of events and set the sensitivity of when the event can be triggered. When the sensitivity is too high, the sun coming in and out of the clouds or a headlight shining from a car turning out of an intersection is enough to trigger an event. When the sensitivity is too low, we walked the dog to the porch made faces at the camera, danced a bit, and walked away, and the event wasn't even triggered. It even missed an Amazon package delivery! When the sensitivity is set in between high and low, it is a hit or miss. Sometimes the trigger can be a head light, the sun, a leaf swaying off to the side or sometimes is misses the flyer delivery man.<br/>At first the camera has been mounted so that it would only see the porch or driveway close to the garage, that way we don't get triggers from pedestrians walking on the public walkway or a car passing the driveway. However, at night any kind of light change, headlight streetlight, an event would be triggered and there would be nothing on the video.<br/>Eventually, we got fed up and turned off event monitoring, re-aimed the camera so we can see the front pathway and most of the roadway and all of the driveway. We would use the cameras to monitor when we access it.<br/>Blink also includes saved events for free on the cloud, which is a huge bonus, compared to the competition.<br/>It would help tremendously if the app allows us to choose which areas of the video to monitor. That way the viewing area can be broad, while actual monitoring areas are specific and does not trigger false events.<br/>Another feature that would help a lot would be to save live video or capture photos (I guess you can screen shot) if there is something in the video you want to keep or save when viewing the live video.<br/><br/>Overall -<br/>The system software has a lot of potential for upgrades and knowing that this is a newish company/device, I'm sure there is work in progress.<br/>The cameras and the sync module produce fantastic video and audio quality during the day, but night vision can be improved in terms of light (or lack of) detection and IR focusing of the dark areas.<br/>The speed to access live video is quick, the software is user friendly, easy to set up, and organized.<br/><br/>Definitely a good buy, not regretting it, but hoping for some software improvements.
 So far so good! Everything arrived as promised , and set up was pretty  easy , as well as mounting. We've had this security system for over a month now and other than having to tweak the sensitivity level of the cameras it is been a good system. I will definitely be ordering more cameras. I have attached a photograph of the two cameras but scribbled out the camera ID codes. I wanted you to see how clear the pictures are. I want to add that if you have the outdoor cameras with nighttime vision you are going to want to place them away from any outdoor lighting. We had to mount ours away from our outdoor lights and turn off the motion sensor as when the light would come on you could not see with the night vision. As long as the camera is mounted 5 feet away and assuming that the light is not shining directly at the camera the night vision is awesome.
 I gave this device a fair shake after some co-workers recommended it. I had a lot of problems. The sync module would say poor connection when it was 2 feet from my router. The camera's motion detection was erratic. It would keep activating when cars just out of the camera's view were driving by. But then when I pull up in my driveway in clear view of the camera, it doesn't activate. On top of all that I realized that I would be relying on the company to keep providing the service for as long as I owned these. Should they ever shut down, my camera is completely worthless.

Seems to offer a better solution than the Arlo, which only stores 7 days of video. Blink offers a set amount of storage with no time limit until it's full (100%) I have two cameras recording an average of 7-10 times a day with 20 second video clips and I'm saving my footage for 14 days. At this current rate, I'm only using about 50% of my allowable storage. The app is easy to use, the setup is simple thanks to the QR codes attached to each device and the system just works well. I don't know if you'll get 2 years out of the AA lithium batteries, but they aren't proprietary and they aren't that expensive or difficult to change, so even if I have to change them once a year, it's not that big of a deal for the peace of mind this provides.  I highly recommend the Blink XT!
 Junk, no integration with Smartthings due to a CLOSED API. This was all because of the acquisition of Blink by Amazon. Will rate higher if integration ever comes back.
 OK, just received a 2 camera kit and the install was very easy, I also receive notification from the Blink app when the camera's are armed and detect motion. One thing I didn't see in comments here but is talked about quite a bit on the Blink community site is excessive sensitivity on the outdoor Xt cameras. They are supposed to be working on a update and adding in motion zones. Also 2 year battery life may be very optimistic if the camera is triggered regularly.<br/><br/>I have Intelligent home as well, its maxed out with 6 cameras and I got the Blink system as a backup. I do like the Blink cameras, they are wide view and very clear, much better than the Intelligent Home cameras. The picture in the totally dark garage was very clear, IR works well.<br/><br/>I will update this review after I have them running for a few weeks. No one reports excessive sensitivity on the indoor cams, just the cams used outside. I have one mounted outside and one is in the garage, I'll see how the outside cam does. Since these cams are passive and don't record till they sense motion, this is a critical feature.<br/><br/>Also you have 120 minutes free storage space on the cloud and then overwrites occur. Even with 30 second clips, (default is 5 seconds) that's a lot of free space.<br/><br/>It looks promising so far.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R1UPHNBDX81LC3"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818bM3B4HSS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91hoQ6xRgdS.png"/> Ok, so I just got around to installing the camera this week after it has been sitting around a couple weeks. Set up was a breeze!!! I like it knowing that if someone walks up to my back door out in the country that I will know with in a matter of seconds! Especially since my wife works from home fours days a week and her office is downstairs. We downloaded the app on both our phones so we both know if something is going on. I liked it well enough that I just bought a second camera for the front door and plan to add more after we recover from Christmas! LOL<br/><br/>Adding more cameras does not require you to buy the add on camera choice. You can buy the cheaper one and not use the module that comes with it and save it as a backup. Just FYI for people like Waldo who gave 1 star for wanting to add and use the add on camera version and pricing.<br/><br/>11-30-2018. Just added a second camera to my front porch! Not one issue getting it added to my current system. No complaints whatsoever so far! Wife feels more at ease knowing we have them and get instant notifications of activity.
 Almost 3 weeks since unit was installed outdoors focusing thru my driveway. We've been in triple digits (105 + deg. F) for almost 2 weeks and still doing it's job. This is my 3rd and 1st XT add-on. Syncing is so simple and easy just like the rest that I have. Here's the catch. So far, the focus and video is just as good as my indoor Blink night or day. What makes it different is you don't have to deal with the annoying blue LED at your preference (on or off switch). I don't see the big advantage of the IR feature at night time outdoor. Perhaps being classified as weatherproof will differ from it's predecessor. At this juncture, XT has still to convince me it's big difference between the $75.00 add-on regular to $119.00 price.
 I have been using the Blink XT Home Security System for 6 months. I got the security camera because I suspected my tenant to have more roommates than what they told us were living in the home and I wanted physical evidence. The main reason I bought the outdoor camera and installed it indoors is because it has infrared night vision. The hall I mounted the camera in was dark but the infrared made motion/movement visible.<br/><br/>First, it's easy to install, so you can install without professional help. All you need to do is install the Blink app and connect it to your wifi. Second, I loved it because there is no wiring involved, everything is done through the wifi. The Blink app allowed you to control retrigger time, sensitivity and clip length. It also lets you control the quality and intensity of the video. You have access to the video on your phone. Finally, most of all I love that it has a cloud storage which you can't find in most security cameras (you generally had to install a SD card).<br/><br/>Pros<br/>- Easy installation - Mount, security camera and module<br/>- Signal - It's fantastic (suggestion: place it close to the router)<br/>- Free cloud storage - No hassle with a SD card.<br/>- Infrared image -  The quality is amazing, even at night. It's very visible.<br/>- User friendly - You can control everything in app like sensitivity, clip length, and intensity.<br/>- Resolution/Frame rate - It's clear as day. The quality is 1080p and 30 fps which is decent for a security camera.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>-  Batteries - Suppose to last "2 years". I used the energizer batteries but they only lasted 2 weeks. So, it depends where you set the motion detector. If you set it in a place where there is minimal activity, then probably it'll last 2 years. If you place it in a place of high activity, I suggest lowering the clip length and sensitivity.<br/>-  Storage - Even though I love the storage, it needs an upgrade. Due to the my camera's activity, my storage filled up quickly in 2-3 weeks. There is no way to save everything to Googledrive in one click(you have to manually store EVERY clip).<br/>- Footage/Audio - You can't see live feed and record at the same time. Also, it's a one way audio.<br/><br/>Overall, I was very pleased with this product. I got mostly everything I expected from it. I had researched a lot before purchasing this.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R2020H5P896KB"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91I3nabiv6S.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BbgzrDKlS.png"/> This camera helped catch a package thief. See attached video.<br/><br/>I generally don’t review products but I want to review this one as I hope my review can help others<br/><br/>LIKES<br/>1) Takes great videos. See attached video.<br/>2) Runs on batteries. Can we installed anywhere, trees, poles etc. you are not limited by availability of socket.<br/>3) Batteries last long time. Our installation location sees heavy camera usage (25-30 video triggers a day), we change batteries every 4 months. For normal usage (5-10 triggers per day) batteries  would last about 1-1.5 years.<br/>4) infra red. Night time videos are decent. You can’t make out face but you can identify who the person is.<br/>5) nice app. The app shows live feed, battery status etc. it also allows configuring how the camera works.<br/>6) free cloud storage. I can see around 15 days of videos. So when my packet was stolen, I just went back to the day and rough time and start looking at who came to my front door.<br/><br/>Dislikes<br/>1) Nothing major. Would love higher video resolution so that we can make our faces a little better.
 Thumbnail fail, live view fail, never works, camera always busy, camera setting like retrigger, clip length, sensitivity can not be set, camera freezes, does not accept update, when updating i get "command failed to complete". when movement system does nor report it, sometime only message with out video, sometimes video of 2 or 3 second despite set to 15 second, I do not think the system is ready to be sold. if I do not hear from vendor by Monday will send back<br/>Friday march 16 2018 - was on location to fix, even with me 3 yards in front of the camera, the sensor didnt, could not even get a live camera<br/>March 22 2018 - returned to Amazon, sorry no star, waste of my time
 Neat idea, but the input lag on triggering motion makes it somewhat useless. It has to be put at a position where it can be given the maximum amount of time to pick up a moving object possible. An example complaint: I put a a blink towards the back of my standard-depth garage. It doesn't turn on to recognize the garage door opening until it is 90% open. Now, in the garage this gives you a chance to see who comes into the garage, after opening, but for cameras in rooms or entryways, the person could walk past it long before it starts recording. In the case of the one I put on the front porch, from a semi-top-down perspective, the mail carrier can drop off a package and ring the doorbell before the video clip starts, leaving me with just a short clip of the package sitting there. Would it even pick up the motion of someone removing the package? I'm not sure. Cranking up the sensitivity doesn't really help either.<br/><br/>As a note, the waterproofing in the black one (XT) versus regular blink is a gasket applied to the square case and cover over the microUSB.<br/>It also (importantly), gains an IR illuminator. I wish the indoor ones also had an IR illuminator.<br/><br/>For 100 bucks a piece they don't seem to bring a whole lot to the table. Most integrated solutions with apps are much more powerful, but do cost a bit more. You're likely paying for the app and the mild storage offers. But storage is moot when you consider that these are 5s clips, and not a ton of them. The Nest gives you 24 or 48 hours of high def recordings on the free plan, which is all you really need to look at.<br/><br/>Biggest strong point of these is that they act more as rudamentary motion detectors, and they have run a couple months on the provided lithium AAs. I can put them anywhere with minimal effort (other than my front porch, which I hung up). The one I put at my front door will shine a bright light at whoever walks in, which is nice for an intimidation factor, of "hey bud I am recording".<br/><br/>Overall they're decent but I got most of the set for free from a friend who didn't want them. If I paid the whole 450-500 a set of 5 plus the XT would cost I'm not sure I'd be so generous.<br/><br/>Blink-driven improvements must be centered on faster startup and connection. I understand that sacrifices must be made to make these easily remote and battery powered, but it needs to start recording faster.<br/>Also I would suggest multiple alarm zones. I want the front porch alarm to remain on when I'm at home, but not the whole system since I'll be moving around within it. A clunky method now is to turn off motion on every camera except the front porch, only to turn them on again when I leave. But that would take awhile given the delay in changes to each camera.
 Alas, I do not :( There are just too many things that are an average grade or failing in my book. The list of cons far outweigh the pros. I will list the pros and cons below to try and streamline this...<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Great night vision. I have this set up in my backyard where it is pitch black and I do mean pitch black. I can see faces clearly and even found out there a stray cat lurking back there at night.<br/>-Free could storage<br/>-100% wireless<br/>-Easy to set up<br/>Cons:<br/>-Price. Price. Price. These are way too expensive for what they are. They are seriously lacking in features yet come at a feature rich premium price<br/>-No option to record from live view. This is a HUGE oversight!<br/>-No option for geo-fencing. Again, HUGE oversight.<br/>-No option for setting motion zones within the frame. If I want to focus on a particular object within the frame (like my car) I can't.<br/>-No option to turn off blue recording led. Dead give away at night. Cams are black so without that led one would never notice they are being recorded.<br/>-No 2-way audio? Huge fail.<br/>-No facial recognition. That would be nice. I can't keep it armed for that very reason. I only arm it at night. My daughter and wife is in and out of the backyard/garage area all day and I get constant alerts. If I recognized faces then that wouldn't be an issue. Several of the other cams offer facial recognition. Even the cheap chinese ones. C'mon blink, get on the ball!<br/>-The motion detector is terrible. You have to be far too close for it to pick you up and start recording. When it does start recording you find you've missed like the first 3-5 seconds of the event, sometimes faces altogether.<br/>-Retrigger time: WTF is that for? How about an option to KEEP recording until motion stops?! Theres an option to STOP recording if motion stops so why keep recording until it stops. As I stated earlier, mine is mounted above my garage. If my daughter runs to get her bike very fast it'll miss her going in and there will be a recording of  nothing. Depending on how fast she comes out it might miss her riding out as well. Or it'll catch her going in but never see her coming out.<br/>-The color image is not the best quality. Kinda grainy and washed out.<br/>-Ir blaster could stand to be a little bit better. By that I mean cover more real estate.<br/>-Saving video to your phone is terrible. It's hot or miss. I have the note 8 and it's updated to the newest version. I even saw there was an upgrade to the app and that didn't help. It says saved in movies folder but it doesn't. There should be an option to save videos directly to your phone.<br/><br/>So I'll most likely be returning for something different. The free cloud storage, imo is the single best thing this system has going for it. Can't give it the nod on being 100% wire free as it is not the only player in the game in that category. The 2 stars are only for the free cloud storage. These cameras cost wayyyy too much to be this basic.
 I researched a bit and chose this system because it allows me to monitor parts of our property without having to run any additional wires. We've been using this for a few months now and it seems to be performing okay. I've joined the Blink community forum, and it appears that there are still things to work out. It is largely a successful product and the development team is responsive. I've contacted customer service and they answer even during the late hours of the night (EST).<br/><br/>Some things to keep in mind:<br/>- In and around the home, it should work great. All it really requires is good wi-fi connectivity.<br/>- Wi-fi connectivity is crucial for outdoor applications and the further you get away from your physical home. I bought a wi-fi extender to improve the signal. I've now placed a Blink camera about 100 feet away from the home with full bars for wi-fi. There is a bit of a lag for me to get notification to my phone. I believe this is due to a weak signal (one to three bars, fluctuating throughout the day) to the sync module.<br/>- The sync module needs to remain indoors and requires a power source. We placed ours in the same room as our wi-fi router (Verizon's FiOS's Quantum Router made by ActionTec) and in front of the forward facing window. It provides almost a direct line of site to the camera 100 feet away.<br/>- Lithium AA batteries are required. Lithium batteries do not self-discharge and will, therefore, last longer on standby. I tried using Eneloop brand Ni-MH rechargeable batteries and they lasted about a month. There were also some performance issues (the IR illuminator wouldn't light a scene evenly).<br/><br/>There's room for improvement, but I think this system does for us what we need it to do. I may need to move the camera around in a few different locations to get optimum results and add 2 or 3 more. Hoping for a promotion, actually, so that I can get a few cameras plus a 2nd sync module and put up a couple cameras for my in-laws.
 I have 4 YI home cameras and each sits just inside an exterior window covering 90% of the exterior of my home. Each one has and SD card that will hold weeks of events and if the event lasts for several hours it will record it. When I pull in my driveway I instantly get an alert.  I can also set a specific region for the motion detection on each camera and since they plug in I never have to worry about batteries.<br/><br/>I also have 1 Arlo mounted to a tree in my back yard that covers the entire back of my house and when it detects motion I get an alert in about 5 or 10 seconds and I can watch a live feed.<br/><br/>Now to my new Blink. Set up was easy, but I quickly found out it won't detect motion through insulated glass windows.  I moved it outside and it detects motion just fine, but the alert typically takes 15 to 30 seconds to get to my phone.  The mounting bracket it junk. The area where it snaps together and allows the camera to be adjusted is so loose that it will not support the weight of the camera so the camera falls or twists until it it bumps something to stop it.  I will give it a few more days before returning it, but my YI cameras were a fraction of the cost. All of the recorded content is saved on an SD card and notifications are instant.  The only downside is that they are an inside only camera, but that is a plus for me because they can't be tampered with.
 PROS: good price point for outdoor camera recording to the (free) cloud. Simple Wireless install. Setup is straightforward. AA Batteries really do last for several months. Specs say you can’t use rechargeable batteries but I use rechargeable Lithium AAs with no problem. Just visible enough to be a deterrent without being too terribly ugly.<br/>CONS: sensitivity isn’t really adjustable, the sensitivity adjustment appears to really be just a delay which disregards short motions. Requires very, very careful positioning to avoid triggering on distant motion or on every little critter that wanders by. Alerts are too slow to use as doorbell camera.
 This might of been the easiest and nicest camera system to setup that has ever been invented! Great job!
 I like it.  I promptly received the kit with the hub and 2 cameras.  Setup was pretty easy.  Download the app, follow the instructions.  Using a QR reader to read the barcodes of each unit helps a great deal.  First I set up the hub to my wifi, then I added each camera.  I've placed the cameras pretty far from the hub and am still getting a signal.  As far as the picture quality, I do wish it was sharper but you need to know what you are getting.  Knowing that, I am good with it.  I have one outside and one inside pointing out through a window.  Anything in close range looks pretty good.  The farther out you go, you lose resolution, especially if you want to zoon in so my recommendation is to place the cameras close to where you want to see the image.  That said, I think I will buy a few more.  Nice to have multiple cameras scattered.  But if you are looking for something with HD quality or long range or better night vision, then you might be better off with something with higher quality of resolution.
 I purchased a 5 camera system at a very attractive price.  Installation was easy.  Picture quality has three modes, Save, Best, and Enhanced.  Picture quality is great for Best and Enhanced modes.  Obviously the Save mode will save you battery and provide you with more storage since the videos are smaller in size.  I switched all cameras to the Save mode.  After six hours of installation on a Sunday (Busy day for motion sensor,) I have already used up 15% of my allocated storage.  Imagine, what will happen if I go with Best or Enhanced quality videos.  In short, FREE STORAGE IS A JOKE.<br/><br/>What else I would like to see:<br/>1. Give me storage credentials so that I can download my videos every so often and store them on a hard drive in my house, or give me more of storage to at least fifteen days of videos.<br/><br/>2. Let the app play all the video clips for a camera, instead of making me click for every one of them.<br/><br/>Even though the cameras are still returnable, I have decided to keep them, as this is perhaps the best value for a system, which uses batteries.<br/><br/>Update 11/12/2018 (24 hours after the installation) : The storage is 46% full.  Okay, Mr. Bezos, you made your point.  Go ahead and charge me a monthly fee and please give me more storage.<br/><br/>Update 2/19/2019: All the indoor cameras have stopped recording.  One camera indicates that the battery is dead (after three months in to use.)  The other two indoor cameras report battery as okay, yet there is no recording.<br/><br/>Update 3/13/2019: Three out of five cameras are now with dead battery in five months of usage.
 Totally disappointed in this. It either triggers way too often sending me 400 notices a day or one level of sensitivity down doesn’t trigger in time to catch anything. I’ve had it for a little over a month and the batteries are already dead!  They do NOt work at night, yes they will capture something but any spotlights or car lights in the view will completely take over what’s recorded - I couldn’t even tell the car make, size or model nevermind get a license plate number if needed (purchased due to recent neighborhood break ins). Also I live in a fairly windy space and the camera triggers every time the wind blows. I’ve struggled with setting issues since I got it and I’ve tried everything and it still either gives me way too much or doesn’t capture anything. My cleaner even came one day and was 20feet away from the camera and walked up to the house- with a direct view the camera never even triggered even at a 7/10 sensitivity!  The camera also fogs up easiest with temp changes and you can’t see anything. Totally crap and I wouldn’t waste the money, not a useful home security system at all!
 Updated Review<br/>I bought four of these cameras, to keep an eye on things while I'm away from home. I was having an issue with the live view. It would take forever to show me the view and sometimes it would just time out and I never could see.<br/>I recently bought a Google Wi-Fi three satellite system and put one out in my backyard and two in my house, all spaced evenly to form a triangle.<br/>That made a huge difference!!! Now these Blink cameras work every time on live view, and I can gray out areas that I don't want the camera to monitor... Once I got the hang of that, I stopped getting so many unnecessary notifications.  I am very pleased with these cameras, I also bought the outdoor housing for them. Blink recommeds using lithium batteries, and I used alkaline batteries with no problems. The lithium batteries are supposed to last longer. I would definitely recommend these cameras, they are simple to set up and you can monitor them from anywhere.
 This security system is having issues and I'm having the hardest time getting it resolved. Great product when it works but not sure about the customer service and warranty.
 What I like most-<br/>I have 3 different brands of security cameras, what I love most about Blink is you can’t find a better value for your money as far as I’m concerned. I got this add on camera on sale on Amazon for 89.00, 30 less than normal price.<br/>-Completely wire free<br/>- Plenty of free cloud storage<br/>-Easy to mount virtually anywhere<br/>-Weather resistant, can mount directly in the elements<br/>-Wide viewing lens<br/>-Easy app interface, adjust motion sensitivity, temperature feature<br/>-Super easy setup, literally takes maybe 2 minutes<br/>360, 720, or 1080p video mode, for best to a lesser battery life depending on your needs<br/>-Excellent night vision<br/>What I like the least but doesn’t really affect my rating<br/>-Can not create a motion zone like some more expensive cameras, motion detection is either on or off in the viewing area, which is fine for me<br/>-Mount could be a little more sturdy<br/>-1 way audio only<br/><br/>Overall I love my Blink cameras, I have 3 XT models and 2 original indoor models, catching them on sale at Blinks website or on Amazon I have 5 security cameras in and around my home for about $390.00, which is less than what you can usually get 2 of different wireless brands for so if you want wireless security cameras that you can put virtually anywhere at an affordable price it’s hard to beat Blink, in my opinion.
 The Blink App for Android still needs some work. The cameras work well and are easy to set up, but some settings in the App won't hold.<br/>I set the video time for 10 seconds and after taping "Update" the videos were still at 5 seconds. Or even odd times like 6 or 7 seconds even though there was still motion.<br/>The Motion Sensors are weak and only catch motion when it happens at around 20 feet from the cameras. Increasing the sensitivity only increases the chance that birds, bugs or wind blown trees will trigger the Motion Detection.<br/><br/>You'll need to play around with the Settings on each camera.<br/><br/>The mounts are very weak and the camera just snaps on and it can be snatched off very easily. I'd like to see a better theft proof housing, much like trail cameras have.<br/><br/>You will get a good picture of the thief though. If you have a large home and the cameras are placed too far from the Sync Module (25 yards) the signal will be weak you may need to invest in a Wi-fi extender to bridge the gap.<br/>I have one at 75 feet and the camera is still recording, but the App reports the camera signal to the Sync Module is very weak.<br/>Bottom line these cameras will do the job, but need some added features.<br/>Edit:<br/>After deleting and reloading the Blink App it is now working as it should.<br/>Videos set for 10 seconds now are at 9 seconds, but close enough.<br/>An added feature would be a timer. I don't require the security cameras to be running during the daytime.<br/>Since the Sync Module re-connects to Wi-Fi after a power failure, I might try a wall plug timer until the feature is added to the App.<br/>I have Coyotes and other animals wandering through my yard every night and as yet haven't gotten a video with the Blink cameras.<br/><br/>Edit after further use.<br/>Finally discovered there is a way to schedule. Duh!<br/>Bought 5 more for a total of ten placed around outside my home.<br/>Out of the 10 one failed to capture a thumbnail picture and wouldn't show live video.<br/>Support recommends you remove batteries and supply power with a usb and voilà. The camera is now working with batteries.<br/>Still needs a way to mask out areas in the motion detection.<br/>Plus I would like to see a stronger mount.<br/>High winds can shake the camera and record false motion detection events.
 After a month of use, I'm extremely disappointed with this camera system. Even after adjusting the sensitivity, it misses well over half of the times that someone passes its line of view. I have a system with 3 cameras, but it only records one at a time so that it misses when a person passes between one camera and the other. It doesn't have a system to identify "hot spots" so that it will only activate when someone passes by a specific location. The daylight camera is adequate, but night vision is next to worthless. I finally wanted to get around to returning the camera system today, but I just missed the one month return deadline. Sure, it's nice to have wireless and batteries, but after less than a month of use, I've already had to replace the batteries in two of the cameras. Forget about the advertised two year battery life.
 Camera is just OK, it only records for 60 seconds per time and only records about 1/2 that it should and it won't pick up a lot,  like white cars!!! Also while it is recording it won't let you see what is going on so you have to wait to see if it's something important. Waste of money! I wish I would've never bought it. I still have the other camera that I never hooked up because they are useless. Good money wasted! I also didn't like that you can't set it to a different way of notification on the iPhone.
 Without warning, Blink cut off all integrations (connections to other services) except IFTTT — and even that is “motion start” only, with “motion stop” not reported. So if you were expecting to use this as part of a home automation or security system, you’re out of luck.  I wouldn’t be surprised if even the limited IFTTT support disappears, too.
 I have the Blink XT  outdoor model that films at night.  Uses up  1.5volt lithium ion batteries fast.  Every 6 weeks I have to change them regardless of how I have the setting sensitivity.  I can't see where it's allowed to buy rechargeables, but even those can only be recharged about 4 times before they lose juice fast.  It's ok as long as I live here, but if I do short term rental, I'd have to pay someone to replace the batteries.  It just isn't going to work out.  My next cam will be hard-wired.<br/><br/>Placement is also difficult.  It will not record anything that comes at it head-on, so you have to place it where any movement crosses its path making it hard to place just right.  Best if you have more than one..<br/><br/> I have Verizon FIOS router sitting by the window, but the camera can only get a signal about 10' away through the window.  I've bought a NetGear 300 wifi extender to see if I can get more range because my carport is 40' away.  Also, would have liked it to wake up and start filming sooner than 6' from the camera, but that will depend on if the activity is crossing the camera or coming straight on.  It will not every activate if you point it toward the driveway and try to record the car or person coming straight at the cam.  By the time it activates, the person has passed the cam.  Not nearly the range they estimate of 25'-30'.  I've increase the sensitivity, but then it activates every time a car passes 100' away or the wind blows the shrubs.  I do like the 14 day free cloud storage.<br/><br/>I won't buy another.
 The camera worked great for a while. Later, the camera would not connect to the Sync Module. I was in contact with Blink's support via email and tried everything they asked several times to no avail. Several months have passed and I still cannot get the camera to connect with the Sync Module. My most recent email to support has gone unanswered for several days now. I like the system WHEN IT WORKS. I now have two Blink cameras One Blink XT and one Blink) and a Sync Module that do not work at all. I have wasted several hundred dollars on this system. I don't think I would recommend buying these Blink cameras.
 Perhaps the 2 year battery quotation is for running the camera WITHOUT recording.  If that is the case then they need to state that up front.  I would not have bought the camera.  Brand new Duracells bought on Amazon only last a few weeks and when they when they die it is too late to return the camera.  This is the biggest problem for me regarding the camera.  Some other notes from usage:<br/><br/>The recordings only save 120 minutes.  You can not buy more space.  That is it: 120 minutes per camera.<br/><br/>Each recorded clip can only be 1 minute long max.<br/><br/>Tech support on the phone doesn’t know the product well.<br/><br/>If you are recording more than just a few seconds at a time, then the app notifies you not to expect to get 2 years of battery life. It seems a little misleading, since the average recording is usually much longer.<br/><br/>The picture is a little skewed sort of like when you look through a fish-eye or wide angle lens but just not so exaggerated.<br/><br/>Application is weak if you are using it to manage several cameras.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R3CSA2LVVGDMA9"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91RweTRml-S.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91vw4aotxGS.png"/> I returned mine. Yeah, it is an economical, entry-level camera with free cloud storage. But for me it has a fatal flaw: it fails to detect an intruder walking directly towards it. In the attached video, the intruder walked right up my driveway (probably stopped to check out my car) and the camera didn't detect until the last split-second before s/he walked underneath the camera. The camera can detect a car driving by on the street, but can't detect the intruder until they are nearly underneath the camera. This is an admitted 'feature' of their camera; Blink has an article on their support page that confesses to this. In my case, I really don't have another place to position the camera to see intruders walking up my driveway that is still within acceptable WiFi range.<br/>Add to this the limitations of the app: you can't record live view, you can't zoom a recorded clip, and there is no web app to view your clips in the cloud.<br/>So I returned mine and am seeking out a better solution; perhaps I will check back in a year or two to see if Blink has improved their product.
 If all you want is wireless cameras that work occasionally, Blink will work.<br/><br/>If you want a system that will Arm/Disarm on schedule, or that will send you notifications when activity tales place, looks elsewhere.<br/>I had my system up and running for a week. It will record, but I have to disarm it and check cameras manually. It will not disarm manually, nor will it send notifications to my phone.<br/>Blink's customer service is worthless. They told me to check that notifications are turned on my phone. They ARE ON!!!<br/> Sync module is within 5 ft of the router, so WiFi signal is not an issue. All cameras have at least 2 bars of WiFi  and Sync signals.<br/>Seriously considering boxing it up and switching to Arlo.<br/><br/>Updated: downgraded to 1/2 stars.<br/>Made a mistake of reaching out to tech support. WHAT A JOKE!!!!. Told me to move reinstall the app (did that already several times, no use), blamed my phone for me not getting notification (BS, ALL other app notify me just fine), and told me that I had to move the Sync module closer to the cameras to Arm/Disarm them. It is already in the middle of all cameras.<br/>All cameras have at least 2 bars of signal between them and the Sync module. What a poor design! Why not use the much stronger WiFi network to connect the cameras? Absolute idiots. The only way to move cameras closer to the Sync module is to move my OUTSIDE cameras INSIDE the house.<br/>Idiots. DO NOT BUY!!!!
 Dishonest company.  I bought and recommended this product to countless families due to their touted SmartThings integration.  They've, without warning, disabled this integration.<br/><br/>The 'free' cloud storage is minimal and won't store enough to catch that thief that you didn't realize robbed you until a day or two later.  Battery life is hype, they certainly do not last 2 years simply because PIR sensitivity doesn't work well and cannot be masked or zoned.  My batteries last less than a month.
 See Update at Bottom:<br/><br/>I’ve had this installed for 3 days now, so let me talk about initial Pro and Cons. The base unit connected to our wifi without a problem. Each camera then needs to connect to your wifi, then the base unit. We have a dual band router for both 5ghz and 2.4ghz. They Blink will only connect to 2.4ghz. My router has extended range. I can be in my neighbors yard and still be connected to my wifi with a good signal. I have the Blink base unit 1’-6” from my dual band router. I had to keep the cameras right next to the base unit to connect initially or they would not. You use the Blink Home app to connect everything. It works pretty effortlessly. Once the cameras were connected, I took them outside and mounted them. One right above the garage door directly in the center. Pointed down about 30deg. The cameras motion detection only works out to 20’, but sound kicks it on allot (will discuss that in a minute). Mounted the other near our front door. This one I have had problems with. It is a good 10’ closer to the base unit and router, but it keeps loosing connection to the base unit. Sometimes it reconnects by itself, sometimes I have to get out the ladder and pull the batteries out. Once I had to delete the camera from the base unit, bring it inside and re-connect it. Since then it hasnt had another disconnect. We will see. Both Cameras are set at 5 motion sensitivity.<br/>Now about the camera at the garage door. Our driveway is approx. 35’ long, then a sidewalk and then the street. We get about 4 cars an hour on our street. The camera is pointed about 15’ down the driveway. Cars going by are setting it off. Its not the motion, but the sound. There is a motion sensor adjustment, but not sound. I turned the sound off, yet sound still caused it to turn on. Very frustrating. I turned the motion sensitivity down to 3, which has helped, but now it does not kick on until the person in the camera view is about to walk out of the view. Tested the sound issue by talking loud outside the camera view and it kicked on. Will have to mess with this camera some more then decide if we will keep it. Might call customer support to see what they say.<br/><br/>The app and video playback works great. About the attached pictures. The cameras shoot 16x9, so if you have a long walk, you need to turn it sideways like we did to get the walk in or all we saw was just as they approached the door. The pic is of UPS dropping off a package. The other is at night. We have NO light on our driveway yet you can see the cars fine. My Wife had just exited the car on the left so the inside light was on. I find anyone’s face looks ghosty with night vision and we really cant make out any details. I read where someone used double-sided tape to try different locations. Probably a good idea. We now have 4 extra holes where we tried them out first and still not sure we are happy with the locations. Would have been nice if Blink had provided some example layouts showing approx. camera coverage. Could be a simple plan view drawing showing camera view cones with approx. dimensions. Will update as time goes on.<br/><br/>Update #1:<br/>Our camera looking at our front door kept loosing signal. I moved the cameras around and the garage camera worked fine at the door camera location, so it was the particular camera. I called Blink support and they walked me through some steps to confirm the issue with the camera and setup a RMA and is replacing the camera. They were great, professional and friendly.
 I bought the 2 camera set. So far they work great. I put them up on my front and back porches to let me know when packages arrive, as we’ve had a problem with package thieves. They’ve worked almost flawlessly, and I say “almost” because yesterday the back porch camera didn’t record the UPS guy running up my stairs and dropping off a package. I saw him through a window, so I believe the motion detector didn’t pick him up because he was moving so fast. But there are settings on these cameras to tweak those types of things, so I’ll play with that today.<br/><br/>I plan on buying a few more cameras for the other two sides of my house. This whole setup was incredibly easy to set up and install. I’ve already had two other neighbors ask me where I got them so they could also buy them. The big draw is the price, ease of setup, and no monthly fees. And they’re really cool. Besides using as surveillance for package thieves they record the comings and goings of my family, which i find helpful.<br/><br/>So basically, the Blink camera setup is amazing for the price. I was actually surprised that it worked as well as it does. I highly recommend these cameras.<br/><br/>This is 100% my own unsolicited opinion; I did NOT receive anything free for this review.
 So I was skeptical about the claim about the batteries lasting 2 years.... I was right. They lasted 2 months.  They were the energizer ultimate lithium ion batteries delivered with the cameras. I am replacing them with the same and will see if they go closer to the claim of 2 years.  Otherwise a good easy camera. Works well.
 Everything was great until they decided to pull the plug on 3rd party integration with SmartThings without any notice.  It makes it tough to trust what they'll do next and not want to continue doing business with them.  Shame on Blink for not caring about their customers.
 Not waterproof nor weatherproof. Within 3 weeks this camera was destroyed. The inside camera did better outside than this one!  I am sick that I wasted my money on this!
 This is my second purchase of the Blink XT camera.  Our first one was struck by lightning and of course, did not survive.  I really love this camera and it has worked great for our needs.  Before I purchased this camera I reviewed several others.  I wanted a camera that was easy to install, wireless, free cloud storage (there is a limit, but it's a lot), great video, night vision, has an iPhone app, and outdoor proof.  This camera has it all!  It will record when it senses motion, about 30 seconds.  It may take you a few tries to set the sensitivity on motion, but you will get there.  It was great to have it running while on vacation.  The app will alert you to any motion, and you can watch the recording later from the cloud.  You can even view a live feed from your phone.  One of the cons for me is that it is sometimes slow to load video from the cloud or live, but really that is a matter of patience.  I would recommend this security camera to anyone!  I am so glad I found it.
 Purchasing and installing these cameras were straight-forward which I am very thankful for.  As they run on battery, not having to deal with hard-wire makes these quite optimum for a Security DIY'er.  The quality of the cameras feels good and the quality of picture both at night and during the day is nothing to complain about.  My biggest complaint is with the app (Android version).  The app is quite buggy at times not allowing for proper playback of recordings, endless loading of recordings and not enough controls for scheduling an active monitoring.  From reading previous reviews, I knew the app was buggy and problematic but I was still willing to take the risk as the cameras themselves are solid.  Since owning these cameras, the app has received a few updates so I know time is being spent to make it better which is all I can ask for as a consumer/user.  Hopefully in time, these complaints I have can disappear.
 The bad:<br/>1. Slow recording off of motion detection if subject is walking directly at or directly away from the camera. Lateral movement is actually picked up quick and records well.<br/>2. Sensitivity. I have had to play with the sensitivity setting a lot on each and every camera. If you don't get it right it continues to record non stop, or won't record at all. Even audio sounds seem to set to recording off if it is set on the most sensitive. Takes some additional playing with to get it set to where you can live with it.<br/>3. No actual web site to go to. Everything is done via the app.<br/>4. NO DOORBELL! I really want a doorbell on my Blink XT system.<br/>5. No two way audio. Unable to chat with someone via the camera.<br/>6. Sync signal and wifi signals seem weak. (I had to buy an extender and now wifi is terrific on all four cameras) I am still playing with the sync signal though and am going to begin moving the sync module to some new A/C jacks in my house and experiment. If that does not work, I may simply add a second Blink XT system and run with two systems.<br/>7. If you don't like ladders, this may not be for you. Mounting the cameras and changing batteries, all done via a ladder. Consider a hard wired system and paying someone to install it, if you hate ladders.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>1. Cost. Very affordable.<br/>2. Batteries last a very long time. I am at 7 months and have not had to change a battery yet. I record a ton as well.<br/>3. Accessories are abundant. I purchased the cases and mounting brackets to help protect the cameras from the sun and rain. Mounts allow me much better angles and positions for the cameras.<br/>4. Terrific app. Easy to navigate and learn.<br/>5. Unlimited users for the app. Everyone can sign in and monitor, that you want to allow access.<br/>6. Good quality zoom. Pretty clear even in when you zoom your video or photos.<br/>7. Easy on/off of entire system. If I work outside, I can disarm each individual camera, or all of them, so I don't waste my free cloud space and battery life.<br/>8. Free generous cloud space for recorded video.<br/>9. 10 cameras per system.<br/>10. App has the ability to run multiple systems. If you need 20 cameras, you can set up a second system via the app.<br/>11. Live camera is very good and clear.<br/>12. Can monitor even when traveling, via the app.<br/>13. Last but not least, it took me less  than 30 minutes to set up. The 30 minutes included the mounting of the cameras outside. This is the most user friendly system, and super fast to set up. Kind of a WOW experience to be honest. If you purchase the protective cases and mounts, be sure to put them on after you have your system up and running. You will need to access the inside of the camera to install batteries, turn the indicator light on/off to your preference and scan the serial number in there, to activate each camera.<br/><br/>In summary, this is a very good system, and it works well. It just does not work great. If it worked great, it would cost a ton more. I do recommend this system. I hope this review helps anyone thinking about purchasing home security cameras.
 I have an established wired security cam system and purchased the blinks for outdoor areas where wiring would be impossible. My main purpose was to put a cam on the mailbox because someone stole a parcel from the box; and, also, to capture the movements of a neighbor who was trespassing on my property. I purchased a total of three cams, and two work well. They are both in heavy shaded areas. The third, the one that faces the mailbox is a nuisance. I get over 400 false alarms a day. With my knowledge of security cams, I've tried everything. Even had the sensitivity level down to 1 - though it defeats the purpose since it doesn't reach to the mailbox - but the false alarms continue. Sometimes I can see the false triggers are coming from deep shadows in the driveway or due to rain. But most of the time, there is no discernible reason for the false triggers because they continue even throughout the night. No other clue why this happens except that the "Last Update" is always the same time as the latest alarm. My next guess is that the signal is not strong enough to keep a sustained connection and the alarm may be dropping and reconnecting. Has anyone had this problem, and would a router extender solve the problem?
 For over a year I have had a Blink camera set up at home integrated with SmartThings.  It has been fantastic; SmartThings was set up to arm and disarm individual cameras based on what was going on at home.  It worked great; so great that I decided at the end of November to set up one of these cameras outside to increase my coverage.<br/><br/>I just--moments ago--got done setting it up. (Things have been busy, and it sat it a box for the past 20 days or so). And I just found that the Blink/SmartThings integration is now broken because Blink has disabled/turned it off.  This has thrown a wrench into what was a working solution for me.<br/><br/>As far as I can tell the camera works properly. But without integration into my home control set up, they are virtually worthless. I will have to arm/disarm them by hand every time the security system arns/disarms?<br/><br/>I'm very disappointed that Blink chose to do this.
 These cameras miss so many things and one of them literally stopped detecting motion unless I go really close to it which defeats the purpose. Even with choosing the quickest start for recording after motion is detected I miss things. For example, a postman walked up to my door to deliver a package that I had to sign for (in clear view of the camera). The walkway is long so there is enough time to start recording. All that blink showed me was a clip of him walking away. Way late to the occasion.
 I got one camera to try and bought 5 more... once I got more cameras, my rating on them went down. "system busy, please wait"<br/><br/>First of all, this system seems to only communicate with one camera at a time... however it seems that it can record multiple cameras at the same time, or I would give a one star review... "system busy, please wait"<br/><br/>But if the 'system is on' and a camera is detecting motion, its impossible to change any settings. like if someone is robbing your house or a bee is flying near a camera, and one of your cameras is off... you can't turn that camera on, until all motion is stopped. "system busy, please wait"<br/><br/>Also if you have the 'system on' but the motion detection of two cameras is off, you can turn one on... you have to wait until you can turn the next one on... but I see a lot of "system busy, please wait"<br/><br/>The cameras sensitivity are defaulted to '5' and grass triggers the camera, I set it to '4' and I can do jumping-jacks in front of the camera and not trigger it... "system busy, please wait"<br/><br/>I wish the camera previews would refresh when clips are recorded, and maybe if they could be set to refresh all at once and not one at a time... "system busy, please wait"... and maybe if a timer could be set to refresh the camera previews... "system busy, please wait"<br/><br/>also the cameras will not record if you are viewing them live or refreshing the preview... "system busy, please wait"<br/><br/>Video clips will not save to the device, but they can be sent to Google Drive... "system busy, please wait"<br/><br/>I am glad that the XT cameras can have the blue light disabled, or the rating would be one star...
 So these were on sale and I've wanted easy to use security cameras, and since they are part of Amazon I thought I'd take a leap of faith and purchased the 2 pack XT cameras for outdoor use.<br/><br/>Setting up was super easy.  Longest part of the installation was finding a screwdriver.  Really!  The camera app for phone walked me step by step through the process.  I've had these cameras in place now for a month, and so far so good.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>1.  Super easy to set up.<br/>2.  Image quality during day is excellent.  Night time usage isn't crystal clear, but I live in a dark area and still amazed at what I can see!<br/>3.  No wires to deal with--great when you live in a house that can't easily run cabling or power.<br/>4.  WIFI Range--very good.  I have one camera at the front of the house and the other camera about 100 feet away on the front of the garage.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>1.  Cameras do not handle shooting into bright light--for example, my front porch is 8 feet deep and sometimes the cameras have a static white balance and people can appear dark once they come onto the porch.<br/>2.  You can only view cameras from the smartphone app.  Blink said that the cameras can not be accessed from a computer at this time.  Would be nice to be able to have a window pop up while in my home office.<br/><br/>Bottom line is this--would I buy them again knowing what I know now about how they work for my situation?  YES.  I have piece of mind when I'm not home.  I can see when I have the cameras on when I get a delivery, a visitor (human, feline, or deer and raccoons).
 I have the Blink system and I love it. Works like a charm. When they came out with the exterior camera I ordered one. When I went to add it to my existing indoor system,when I scanned the unit brand new out of the box it told my iPhone invalid serial number. I called Blink customer service and was told it is a refurbished camera and I’d still linked to another account. They could not resolve this because their systems crashed. I wish I knew it was used and refurbished because I paid full price. I am waiting to hear back from Blink to see if they can fix the problem. I ordered this before taking an extended vacation and have had it more than a month si I am unable to return it. Not a satisfied customer here at all!
 I have made many purchases from Amazon. Fairly satisfied with most, so I had high hopes for Blink cameras. Very very disappointed, first let me say I have two devices the outdoor units. Each time I try to access cameras I get the infamous, “camera busy” warning. I refresh the page multiple times, only to get the same thing. When I finally get through to view Live video, it quickly kicks me out.<br/>Will not, buy again, would not recommend!<br/>For the price of these cameras, more or better software should have been put into them for better functionality.
 I am very pleased with my purchase and would definitely recommend (as a matter of fact, my neighbor bought them based on my recommendation). If you're like me, you read every review you can BEFORE you purchase. So let's get into it.<br/><br/>First, product came as promised. Set-up and installation was easy! (NOTE: order some mounting brackets, I did not and would not use the ones that came with the camera.) I originally purchased 2, but added a 3rd camera a few weeks later - because RING sucks!<br/>I would remember that you get what you pay for. If you want high quality, hire a professional to install and then pay your monthly monitoring fee. If you're a DIY guy like me, this is the best option out there that I have found. I wanted peace of mind (since we have had some cars broken into in the neighborhood).<br/>Second, I am pleased with the battery life. Some complained about it in reviews, but I have had no problems.<br/>Third, picture quality is OK. I can zoom in while I'm watching play back and while watching Live. I won't be able to describe a neck tatoo, but I can tell who it is. Night vision is not the best when it comes to picture quality. Will play more with the settings on that end.<br/>Fourth, it took me some time to dial in the motion sensitivity. Play with it until you have happy. Birds, squirrels, and even leaves will set it off. I don't mind that at all! To me, I know it'll catch something bigger if its catching those small things.<br/>Finally, I LOVE that the videos are mine. I don't have to pay to share them, store them, etc. To me, that is THE selling point for this product.<br/>Research all you want, but this will be your go to camera for peace of mind. There are no hidden fees. Even if the battery only lasts me 2 months, its still cheaper than another products monthly monitoring fee. My home is covered. I know who is around my property. I have peace of mind (at a price I am very happy with.)
 I cannot believe that with all the technical engineering that went into this product, that it comes with the crappiest, cheapest plastic mount that just clips on, and not well.  The clip is so loose that 6 mph wind gusts blow it right out of the clip. And that doesn't even speak to the fact that it is easily stolen as all you have to do is grab it and go.  At a $130 price point, I would expect to have a solid mounting system that at least makes it difficult to steal.<br/><br/>There are many after market mounts available, which shouldn't be necessary.  Also, the after market mounts have to provide an encasement to surround the camera for the 'tripod' type mount to screw into because the Blink XT only has a clip hole which is worthless.<br/><br/>If I had paid full price, I would have returned it. (I got it on Cyber Monday for $79) I will use my 'savings' to purchase a proper mount.  However, since I bought this one to test out their system, I will not be purchasing any more or recommending them to my clients until the mounting issue is resolved.  I think they owe it to anyone who paid full price for the camera's to dispense proper mounting hardware.<br/><br/>Other than that, I like the cameras; the quality of the images; somewhat Alexa functionality; and that they are battery operated with long life lithium batteries.  I expect to get 6-8 months based on 'real' use, not the ridiculous 5 second clip 'marketing' bull they base the 2 year battery life on.<br/><br/>One note about the App.  I've only been using it for a couple of days and there seems to be about a 15% server access down time.  Also, when tapping on a motion notification which opens the App, 80% of the time, the App is blank and I have to force close it and open it from the App list. So it seems there needs to be some fine tuning there also.  I also wish the App had widgets to arm and disarm and display the temperature as the cameras have have thermometers with customizations to notify you of temperature extremes.  It would be nice to be able to display my local temperature on my mobile device.
 The Blink System is amazing.  While there are software features I would add, like "on demand recording", for what you pay, the product works very very well.  The cameras are great, and the outside system IR is unbelieveable.  Over time, the software and other features will evolve, and the system will get even better.  But for now, expect a very fast :15min set up (total) for 4-6 cameras, including staging the cameras (getting them just the way you want takes a try or two).  Hints - put the camera mount on every camera out of the box, and write the camera SN and your Sync Module SN on a piece of paper.  It's easier than taking them all apart each time.  Also, pay attention to how many wireless devices you actually have on your network.  Most systems (ex., FiOS) limit you to 10 active devices.  When you start adding phones, tablets, cameras, etc., it is likely you will go way over that number.  Fortunately, Blink minimizes usage until you actually view (or security records), but be aware of this if you notice any issues.
 Color me ill informed, but I was looking for a way to have an alarm on my iOS device ring loudly until I shut it off, when activated by a motion event in my backyard. Thus the outdoor aspect of the Blink XT “security system”. But all I get is a feint, barely noticeable when your awake, “ding” when motion is detected. Can’t I have a list of sounds to choose from that exists on my iOS system, that play when motion activated until I push something? Can’t I have the Blink app open automatically as well, lighting up my bedroom eyes with the live video playing of potential home intruders within view? I’d prefer fireworks and a marching band to wake me up from deep REM sleep, yet I must contend with a tiny, barely perceptible “ding” not even worthy of a capital “D”. I’m disappointed.<br/><br/>To be fair to Blink, it may be an iOS restriction common with all the current crop of motion detection systems that send a “push notification” to a smart phone, I don’t know. Do you????

Cameras were easy to set up. It helps to read the blink website instructions first. So far, no mysterious folks have appeared of late.<br/><br/>We expect that during the summer months we will probably disarm the system during the day when we are outside (mowing, yard work etc)- There is a scheduling system available to accomplish this by hour of day and day of week.<br/><br/>So far this winter, we keep it armed all the time. Have had good success with the alarms (though the dog or cat  trigger the motion detection occasionally ;-) ) - Using my phone I was able to customize the notification alert sound. I try to remember to set it to a softer "knock" sound during the day and set it to a more attention getting "siren" sound after 7pm. A nice feature to be added some day would be to have this function be able to be set natively.  During the day when we may be in an outbuilding, a gentle sound to alert us of someone on premises is adequate, but in the evening/night we want something that will wake us and maybe be integrated with an Alexa or something to turn on yardlights etc.<br/><br/>NOTE: Even though this works with an Android phone, it doesn't work with a chromebook. Hopefully this can be addressed at some time.<br/><br/>Overall, seems like a good product.
 I bought the Blink for the front door of my office condo because I like to keep the door locked.  We have way too many solicitors in my office complex and I don't have too many people dropping by so there is no reason to leave my door open.  I have Arlo at home, which I like very much, but this seemed like a fairly comparable and less expensive alternative since I only needed one camera.  So far, my biggest problem is this unit has become pretty unreliable. I have the sensitively set to 1, the lowest possible setting, because I only want to see who is directly at my door, not the people walking on the sidewalk near my door. This works well when the unit is working; and for the first week or so it worked perfectly.  The problem is now it doesn't work all too frequently.  I had an instance last week where the Blink servers couldn't find the DNS address for my Sync Module and I had to re-start my router/Wifi for the system to work.  Since then the camera works some time and not others.  Today, for instance, it went off several times for people walking by, but did not work when I entered and exited my office right in front of it.  This is very frustrating.  Even when I set the sensitivity to 2, it works sometimes and not others.<br/><br/>I guess you get what you pay for.  I have had my Arlo at home for over a year now and it pretty much works flawlessly. I also prefer Arlo's features like being able to look in on the camera, even when it is recording; being able to use the Arlo app on multiple platforms i.e. iPhone and iPad; and a battery meter so I know how much battery is left on the Cameras.  The Blink will only work on my phone and no other device; no battery meter.  Having said that, I am willing to give up certain features due to the lower price.<br/><br/>I am keeping the unit for now, but I can only give it 3 stars until Blink works out the kinks and makes the unit way more reliable.  Hopefully they can achieve that or I predict their sales will suffer.
 Works too well! What I mean by that is it picks up any motion such as shadows from leaves blowing in the wind, etc. I tried setting the motion levels way down but that doesn't seem to help. If you use it outside, make sure it is in a place that will not record any false motion readings.
 Trying to catch someone red handed? With these cameras you won’t. The max video length of each clip is 60 seconds and the minimum time between each clip is 10 seconds. So let’s say motion is detected, the camera will record for a maximum of 60 seconds, stop, and then wait 10 seconds to detect motion and begin recording again, during which time someone can sneak past the camera. It’s not hard. I’ve done it. There’s a nice little blue light on it that let’s you know whether the camera is recording or not. Think about how much can someone do in 10 seconds.
 It is like Sonos, but with pictures.  Installation was as easy as 1) download Blink APP to phone/tablet,  tell APP your WIFI password, create BLINK account;  2) add the  supplied] batteries to each camera, tell APP the xxx-xxx-xxx serial number found on each camera... bingo. up and running very intuitive interface on APP.  Use the given mounts to place cameras.  Only downside, is it appears data is off-site, but I am using it non-personal area.
 The cameras do their job, for the most part and the night vision is fantastic. However, they are HORRIBLE for security purposes!!!!<br/>First off, the camera CANT be very far from the sync module which is really problematic. We put one camera on the side of our house about 15 ft from the sync module and it showed it had a connection (2 bars "camera to sync module" ... all 5 for "camera to wifi") and we have the sync module directly next to our wifi router. Even though it had 2 bars, it would not record motion and video was choppy. So we moved the camera a good 10 feet where we were able to get 5 bars for both sync module and wifi.<br/>Second issue, these cameras dont start recording motion when its first detected. There are times when we will get an immediate notification of motion and the video clearly shows what it is.... but more times than any it delays the recording of motion. For example.... husband was able to walk to our shed in perfect view of the camera, unlock it, take his dirt bike out, lock the shed, and walk away with the bike before the camera even recorded any sort of motion (at least 5-8 minutes of movement before camera even started recording). The split-second video we got was the back tire of the dirt bike being taken out of frame. Kind of delayed for a security system, if it were someone stealing the bike, we would have no video of the person taking it. There was also a small bird on the same shed later that day and motion detection was going crazy... we got 10 video notifications of a bird, but not someone opening our shed and removing a dirtbike. We also had the system armed while I was home and it didnt even record the FedEx truck that pulled up. Motion sensitivity is turned all the way up, full wifi and sync module bars on both cameras, full battery, and it still has a delay in recording clips or notifying about motion.<br/><br/>I like the night vision, video quality, and not having to pay a monthly price like Ring.... however the delay in video and the short range dont make me too confident in these being used for security purposes.
 The Blink XT video security system is a great buy. I got an Echo Dot (3rd gen.) free with a 2 camera system that I set up easily with clear directions.  I can now completely control my entire home automation, including both Blink XT cameras, through voice activation, programming or with my smart phone.  The Blink XT system integrates seamlessly with the Echo Dot and both apps can be used independently or synced.  I highly recommend buying an all-weather housing (pictured) for an extra $15 (for 2).  It features a fully articulated secure mount and simple styling.<br/><br/>Here are the pros: totally wireless, battery powered, zoom capabilities, up to 10 independently controlled cameras, free cloud storage, great night vision, fast response on motion detection, compact size, price and sophisticated styling.<br/>Cons:  one-way audio.<br/><br/>If you don't need 2-way audio you will get a system that equals most other brands and save a minimum of $100!  Sure, you can tell me an Arlo or Ring has better video quality, but I can't see the difference.<br/><br/>One other vital purchase I recommend is a battery backup.  I have my WiFi, satellite TV box, bluetooth devices, laptop and the Blink XT module all plugged into it. In the event of a power loss or surge,  all my sensitive electronics are protected and will continue to function fully.
 I've used the them all it seems . A wired Schwann, NEST, ARLO, LOGITECH CIRCLE, FLUR ONE and others  theyvallbsuufer from ongoing monthly cost issues, to go,promise in placement, to middling battery life, to high initial cost.<br/><br/>I can't speak for the basic Blink, but the Blink XT is cesp to start with and easily expandable . Keep a few Lithium AA batteries on hand is all the maintenance required, I have cams on the street looking toward my home, around perimeter mounted on the house itself and one in my detached garage. The we have great range and the picture is great on all of them  For my long driveway I bought a separate IR ILLUMINATOR so the cam can see the entire length at night<br/><br/>So far bettery life is so long that there is no anxiety. The cams have good audio reception, but you can't send audio to the camera  two way I am sure will come in the next gen  to Bkink bring a relative new comer I am satisfied in their long term prospects and capacity to innovate on the theme of home and small  biz security. Doubly so now that they are owned by Amazon<br/><br/>I don't much care for the included mounts and I use mounts gym a different manufacturer for the cams  another important feature is you can run the cams off AC power using micro USB cable  Unless you use a custom enclosed mount, using a micro USB comprmises the all weather nature of the camera.<br/><br/>Put these Blinks anywhere, small they blend in easy, long battery life, long range, free cloud video stirage, good easy to use app. The hardest part was figuring out how to open the battery compartment. If you are tech challenged I would especially recommend a Blink XT system.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Very pleased . As long as your have good wifi coverage this is the system to protect your home.  No WiFi, no private EYE is the only limit to installation on this versatile, long battery life, security camera system that you can have confidence in  Accessing a life picture is fast, about 5 seconds. No wireless csm yet is instant , but these come close.
 Here’s my opinion on these cameras. 1) these work great. Why. There movable. In my case I need to move them around sometimes into blind spots. 2) you can hear the conversation of what or who you are looking at. 3) clear cameras. 4) I am alerted when someone walks into areas I have them and watch and hear what’s going on. 5) no subscription at all.<br/><br/>I have 16 hard wired cameras up that I can not move once I set them and they run 24/7 and are the most reliable and I looooove them.<br/> But these are great for getting into areas I could not cover or I thought were not so important.<br/>I live with my Bf who runs his business from our home with 5-20 employees on the property. And ever since I have hung all these cameras, things have been great. Lol. That is why I have so many. But what I really like about cameras is this.<br/>Some days I will have put something somewhere and for the life of me I can’t remember where I put it. Lol. I get to look back at my day or days on my cameras. And find it. Thank god. Caz sometimes my mind thinks that someone may have stole it. And they did not. The cameras never lie.
 Out of the box, very nicely designed and built to last. I followed the instructions and recommendations set by both the Blink Manual and Blink Tech Support. The issue started when I noticed you could not record video manually or take pictures manually. Then, I saw that the PIR Motion Sensors wasn't triggered when there was motion at least five feet in front, going in the direction from side to side never leaving the view of the camera. What is PIR? That's when I contacted Blink Tech Support. The Tech gave me some configurations to try and get the camera working correctly, but it was the same settings in the manual which raised a red flag that something was wrong with the cameras. Also, if you don't know what PIR Motion Detection is, I recommend you do the research. When you hear PIR Motion Sensor think in terms of the movie Predator and how the Predator hunted things visually. With that being said folks, I have to pass on this product. Passive Infrared(PIR) should be used as a filter, not a sensor.<br/><br/>Cons: These type of cameras are not suitable for small areas. A person can be in an area for five seconds or shorter, and the camera would never record them. If it's cold out and people are fully dressed, would that interfere because the heat signature is being blocked? In the summertime with it being hot to extreme heat, would you get a lot of false alerts? Listen, I'm not saying regular motion detection is any better, but I rather have that then PIR.<br/><br/>Pros: Looks good and saves on recording depending on what season you're in(spring, summer, fall (autumn), and winter.)<br/><br/>Returned on: 03/25/2019

You just mount them, position, and go (to say the least.) I wanted to set up ONE cam to watch my driveway, but unfortunately, they are pretty limited in range. I uploaded a picture, the red zone is it's detection zone (NO I did not exclude everywhere else!) The cam is roughly 8-10 feet up (wanted it high enough where kids couldn't just smack it down and take it,) attached to the side of my house.. and that zone is roughly where something has to be moving before the cam starts recording. The video attached shows our mailman, walk a crossed our driveway, and only when he is about to my  walk way (maybe 5 feet away,) does the cam start recording. So if someone walks around the far side of my black car, over to my red truck, the cam is unlikely to record anything. My neighbor's red van, comes and goes, and the cam never activates. I had to get another cam set up on my fence (in front of the truck) to capture anyone messing with my truck. That cam, is set lower (6 feet high) and still has range issues. Only starts recording about 5 feet away.<br/><br/>I would not recommend getting these for a front yard surveillance (high public access area) where you really have to have them mounted at arms reach, and highly visible. Watching wide swaths of area are not these cams strong points..<br/>If you have very narrow passage ways that need to be watched, that's where these will shine.<br/><br/>I still like them, they are nice to slap somewhere, where I have no plugs or watching low traffic areas like the back porch for piece of mind. Hope this helps in your decision to buy for your specific needs, good luck!
 I ordered the 5 camera XT system, received it a few days later and started trying to set it up following the directions. I ran into nothing but frustration. I could connect the sync module without issue, added one camera and it failed to capture a thumbnail during the setup. I got live view working immediately after connecting the camera but then the camera would drop and be unresponsive. I tried connecting a second camera but it failed to find it. I removed the camera, reset the sync unit and tried starting with the second camera. It acted the same - sort of worked, dropped out, couldn't connect the other camera (the one that I did connect the first time).<br/><br/>So why 5 stars? Customer support. If I had to ding them for anything it would be the requirement to email support so something that could be resolved in minutes can take days of going back and forth. I work in IT and could just imagine what would happen to my business if support was handled this way. That said, the support was thorough and we were able to rule out network issues and it didn't seem to be the cameras since they would connect briefly. They sent out a replacement sync module, I installed it and everything suddenly worked as advertised.<br/><br/>As for the cameras themselves, the video is good, motion detection works and I do like having a completely wireless system. The mounts do leave something to be desired but there are plenty of affordable aftermarket options. My review is based more on the cameras themselves as well as the interface. The motion captured videos are uploaded to the cloud almost instantly and I receive an immediate alert. It wouldn't matter if someone destroyed a camera and/or destroyed my networking equipment or anything else in my house, once the camera catches them, the video file is sent outside their reach and right to me. Are there more robust security solutions? Of course. But for a relatively inexpensive system that is this easy to set up and install, it's hard to beat. I haven't had the system long enough to test out battery life or long-term performance of the cameras or sync module but so far I am impressed. I will update my review in the future with any positive or negative experiences.
 I was really excited to get these new XT cameras for my house, but unfortunately they leave a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>First, when I opened the cameras, it looked like they had already been used. No joke. I saw some other reviewers saying the same thing. The plastic film that goes over the cameras looked dirty and had fingerprints on them. Not the best feeling for securing your home.<br/><br/>Then, the brackets are a joke. I ended up buying some mounts off of Amazon that were way sturdier and I'm very happy with them (sold by DG-Direct), but it shouldn't have been an extra expense. The mounts that come with the Blink XTs snap in and out of the camera. So it's very easy to walk up to one, give it a light smack to pop it off the mount, and then take it with you. I don't want these so easily stolen. Come on!<br/><br/>Then I get them set up and the app is very underwhelming. The functionality is very basic. You have settings for the cameras, but the big thing missing for me is the ability to record on demand. If I'm watching live view and see something I want to record, why do I not have that ability? Seems so basic yet it's missing. Your cameras will ONLY record when motion is detected.<br/><br/>Another huge issue is the fact that you will only get a notification AFTER the recording is complete. That's right. So if you have an intruder at your front door, you will only be notified that your camera detected something once the recording is finished. If you have your recording set to a minute, it'll be a minute before you get notified. WHAT?? The employees on their forums even suggest lowering your recording time to as short as possible so you receive the notification faster. But then you only get a few seconds of recorded video. How is that an acceptable solution? Why can't the notification be sent when the recording STARTS instead of when the recording finishes?<br/>This is the exact quote from their forum from "nick_at_blink": "...While you can’t currently record during live view, you can set your clip length to be very short, allowing you to get a motion notification sooner and allowing you to check live view sooner...."<br/><br/>Also, the badges for iOS are bugged. You will get a notification to your screen, but the badge won't appear on the app until after you open it.<br/><br/>Lastly, the IR at night is really bad for any sort of open space more than about 5 feet. I ended up spending about $30 at the home depot to get a light switch with a built-in timer so I could illuminate the areas my cameras were in since I could hardly see anything with the night-vision mode.<br/><br/>I expected a far more competitive camera system based on the price point and the reviews, but I can't help but feel unsatisfied. We're talking about the security of my home and my family here. You don't want to settle for an inferior product. I would look elsewhere.
 Super easy to set up, however, there are a few cons that I'd like to mention for those who are interested. One is that the mounting brackets offer no way to keep someone from stealing your camera, and are also pretty flimsy so you'll want to plan an extra $30 for better brackets if that's a concern. Second is that when the temp drops below freezing, in the evening, they fog up pretty badly so you really can't see anything, at least here in the Pacific NW. Third is that the app is only for Android and IOS so no viewing on a computer unless you have some technical know how and can work around that. The fourth is that the app doesn't send notices until whatever it's capturing is well under way so you may not have time to actually prevent anything or catch anyone in the act. There are other drawbacks but I'm only mentioning the ones that are the biggest drawbacks in my opinion. Other than that, it does have good night vision, works fine in rain, has a pretty clear picture in the day time and really is easy to set up. Plus no monthly fee and works really well with WiFi. You'd probably want something else for the front door though because if you put it low enough for a decent face shot, it would be really easy to steal and it doesn't offer two way audio.
 Normally I wouldn't post and be the person that says this device actually worked but we bought this due to someone vandalizing our property in hopes of catching them. Not only did this device catch the suspect but also recorded video of them actually doing the actions - twice!! The video it captured will be used by the attorney so to give this 5 stars I feel is a discourtesy to the product and would give 500 more if I could!  It was so easy to link directly to our phones and get notified every time it detected movement in both our front/back yard (we purchased 3 cameras total). Picture was clear and even in the dark it still gave a clear video to see what was happening. They are small enough that unless someone is actually looking for them they would be pretty difficult to spot - hence how we caught our suspect :) Again - thank you to the entire Blink team - so glad we purchased these when we did!!
 Easy install very nice. Cameras have good resolution and can see in dark also. They have a great sound recording that can pick up from a 30 feet away. I have had these cameras for just over a week and the batteries are already dead. It said it had a 2 year battery life. And the weather has not even been cold out. Good thing is that I have already in the first week caught people trying to break in to my neighbor's car and was able to turn it into the Authorities.
 When it works, the video is crisp and clear.  This one stopped working about 4 months after installing. It has stopped working several times in that period of time.  All efforts to resolve the issue failed.  Customer service recommended the same things I have already done, but I did them again.  Still doesn’t work.  When I initially contacted the seller, I was told the camera was under a one year warranty.  After wasting hours repeating troubleshooting suggestions, I am now told it is not under warranty.
 I really really wanted to love this camera but I just can’t. First and foremost, you need to have a connection to a silly WiFi “box” in addition to your own WiFi. This in itself screwed up my plans in a BIG way. I have a very good WiFi network covering 80% of my 15 acres of woods and field. I thought, how awesome would it be to have this camera anywhere on my property. WRONG! You have to be within range of this silly box! With that said, the camera itself isn’t horrible. It does record good quality video and audio. The software or app is not the greatest. Settings seem to change themselves randomly. The batteries last longer than I expected. We always record video and they discourage this to preserve the batteries but mine have been going strong for 2 months. One snowstorm it maxed out the cloud storage recording nonstop snowfall and it still says battery ok. What is ok? Got me! Another little quirk I’ve noticed is if I haven’t had any videos in a day or 2 I hit live and watch then stop. All of the sudden I’m getting videos again! Why? No idea. The mount is not good at all. Flimsy plastic that doesn’t want to stay where you set it. Then the camera just pops onto it. So if you have these in a place where someone can reach it. See ya!<br/><br/>In conclusion, I had hoped that these babies would be the cats meow. I was planning on buying at least 10. Now I’ll stick with the 1 until the next best thing comes out.
 We ordered 2 of the Blink cameras...having placed the order, I visited YouTube where I found an excellent tutorial which led me through, step by step the setup of the camera, from opening the box to end of install.  This averted any confusion as to how this camera works and the setup with the app which can be used on your smart phone or tablet.  (I have an iPhone &amp; iPad .. installed app on both...in doing so, if there is a file which I want to view a bit larger..the iPad fills the bill !  From the app you can customize the camera very well.  AA Lithium batteries included...when necessary, we will replace with AA Lithium rechargeable batteries....remember, if the camera triggers every time a leaf drops or a bird flies by, it wears on your battery.<br/>The 1080 res is very good.<br/>VERY GOOD APP... You have an easy option to remove files which are created from non-useful triggers..and can set a calendar for each day of the week, regarding when you want the cameras to arm and disarm.<br/>REMEMBER. NIGHT VISION on a battery operated camera is only good for about 20 feet.  If you need night vision to cover a greater area, you need to purchase a 'wired' camera which is made for outdoor use and night vision.  I researched this issue, having found from our original install location...the night vision was poor.<br/>We moved the camera near the door and it is great...and you have several settings regarding same in the app.<br/>We are happy with these cameras and feel they will serve us very well.
 Extremely limited range. It can only see cameras within 50 feet of their module. The vendor says i should move the camera closer. Not possible since it was supposed to be watching a building.<br/>Would not buy again nor recommend to a friend, enemy yes but not a friend.
 I love Amazon. The idea of Amazon devices intrigues me. The blink xt was a waste of my time.<br/><br/>For the right purchaser, this is a 4 or 5 star product. For me, it's a zero.<br/><br/>What I wanted: a security camera to view my several amazon deliveries each week at my front door.<br/>A camera to keep an eye on our vehicles because we have street parking and always worry. We live in a busy area of town with many cars passing our back door (and cars) daily. The advertised 2 year battery life lasted 7 days for the camera set over my back door. Keep in mind, I'm not in a city, it's a small beach town (it's December) and a 7 day life is unbelievable.<br/><br/>Other than the battery, I only had a rolling 1 day ish of video clips, gosh forbid I want to leave for a weekend a not constantly monitor the camera to see if something happened.<br/><br/>The good, the night vision is great.<br/>The reactivity for motion sensing is very good.<br/>The app is good, only problem is that you can't record while watching live. Could you imagine if you watched someone stalking your property but your only option was to capture screen shots on your phone? Why can't you record it take snap shots?<br/>Why can't you view from a PC on a website?<br/><br/>If you're looking for a camera to monitor your porch, this is awesome.<br/><br/>If you need to monitor a busy walkway or street, don't waste your time. Neither the battery life or the video retention is sufficient.
 Some prospective buyers should be cautioned that this camera's reaction time may be too slow for their needs. This is the reason why I have removed 2 *. If Blink can resolve this with firmware, I would give it 5*. In my example, the camera is mounted above the front door and positioned so that the camera can see about 15 feet out, and down to about 2 feet in front of the door. Well, some package delivery people are so fast that the camera recording shows nothing but one can hear them leaving. Many delivery people can only be seen leaving, thus no faces/fronts. Some times, they are slow enough that a face is shown on the recording. The point is, while motion detection may trigger out at the far reaches, the camera/recording takes too long to begin, there's a significant lag in reaction time. My guess is that this lag is as much as 2 seconds. Now, imagine it's a porch pirate and not a delivery person, you likely would have a nice clip of empty space. Immedia/Amazon, fix this and I'll love this camera.
 Purchased the Blink as it claims to have motion detect, record clips and the ability to view live. Followed instructions to the T. The sync module sat 3 feet away from me and the camera. Within the app, I verified both the camera and the module were getting all 5 bars (aka strongest connectivity). During initial testing the camera was able to detect motion, but when I tried to view the recorded clips (none existed), when trying to view live or take a photo, the app would have a persistently spinning wheel and would spit out dialogs with "busy" or "fail". In troubleshooting, I removed the batteries for the suggested 10 seconds and even reset the sync module to no avail. I clearly expected better with this product/company having been acquired by Amazon in 2017. Blink is simply not ready.
 UPDATE ... increased my rating from ONE to THREE stars.<br/><br/>After struggling thru the guides and help pages and setting the blink system and ALEXA link, I found the product functional as a security cam and the cloud service very reasonable at no cost.<br/><br/>The only problem and annoyance is a sync module and its impact on the overall system complexity and reliability. The fact that the sync module is a single point of failure that will affect all managed cameras/devices is not comforting.<br/><br/>The site surveying and location trial and error for the sync module and all managed cameras so they can communicate with the sync module is an art more than science. Then, all of these BLINK devices have to have a decent connection with the WiFi access point ... this can get tiresome, and sometime it is an impossible task.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW<br/><br/>I am an engineer but when I talk to or write for "normal" people aka customer/consumer I use descriptive sentences with nouns and verbs, consistent info, and provide enough detail to maintain the continuity while guiding throughout the process to the final goal.<br/><br/>The BLINK technoheads use mental shortcuts and are missing crucial facts, provide fragmented and inconsistent info, often the outdated info ... the requirements and versions would be a good example. The mismatch between printed guides, web guides, and various support pages is mind boggling.<br/><br/>A seemingly simple action of setting ALEXA skill and linking the account is giving people hard time. Why?<br/><br/>PS1&gt; Is the BLINK.COM domain featured in BLINK documentation even owned by BLINK? Guess what? NO!<br/>PS2&gt; When you send a confirmation email, make sure to include the link to complete the registrations. Gee!<br/>PS3&gt; When you refer to the release time for example as "today" put a frigging date somewhere on the page.
 So far it is working great motion sensitive is actually a little high started to find we had late night visitors.
 We love the blink!  It was easy to install using the enclosed instructions, and the alerts are fairly quick.  I would say, a 5 to 10 second delay between when I hear the alert on my phone, and when the video shows up on the blink app.  Our router is set up in our entryway, so it's close to the blink on our covered porch, about 16 feet away.  We set it up on both of our phones, so we both get alerts.<br/><br/>We have ours on the side of the porch, perpendicular to the front door, so the image of the person is not backlit.  We get a very clear image of anyone who comes up to the door.  We mounted it at eye level in clear view so that it acts as a deterrent to anyone who decides to ignore our "No Solicitors" sign.  My husband and I both work at home, so it's nice to know when deliveries arrive.  We have the sensitivity set on "medium," and it's working great.  So far, we've seen 4 videos of deer running past the porch and several delivery guys.  The videos also provide audio, so you not only see what's going on outside, but you hear it, as well.<br/><br/>The videos are saved for as long as the free Cloud storage allows, then they start deleting automatically.  We don't care about saving the routine daily vids, so we delete them at the end of the day.  Either of us can do that from our phone, and it will delete the video on both phones, since it is set up under one account.  The default recording length is 5 seconds, but we set ours to 10 seconds to record a longer video.<br/><br/>Anyway, have fun!  We love it.  It is not a 2-way audio, and the audio only goes one way, so you can't talk to whomever is standing at your door.  But, it does provide the advantage of knowing who is at your door, and what to do about it.  :)
 I really, really like the Blink camera systems, and it is a bonus that they do not have a monthly fee and I just run them myself. After purchasing about 6 cameras (both interior and exterior), I have come to the conclusion that I prefer the exterior cameras even inside my home.<br/><br/>The reason why I like the Exterior cameras better than the interior:<br/>I have interior cameras due to a family member that has been stealing (probably too much background info but it is relevant here).<br/>The interior cameras, while recording or when you are live viewing, have a blue light that comes on in the middle of the camera in that center circle, and you can visibly see when it is on. I find that my family member understands this and waits for the 10 second lag time in recording to do things. I do not mind the 10 second lag time between recordings, but I do not want her to see it. The Exterior cameras do not do this while recording or when in live view.<br/><br/>The interior camera also has a built in light which is nice; however, sometimes it is so bright that it makes it difficult to get good video footage in the dark - where the exterior cameras have night vision and do not need the light to record movement.<br/><br/>Again, I like them both but prefer the exterior cameras now. I hope this review will help others in the same position.
 For my application of it, pretty happy with it. I placed it in an RV hooked to a nighthawk mobile router from att. I realize the seller and directions say to only hook to a 2.4 GHz WiFi but I’m the type of guy who wants to test it... in theory that nighthawk mobile hotspot seems to make perfect sense and yes, it seems to work just fine... so moving along, all I wanted was this to monitor if someone went into the vehicle and stole my stuff... because you can disarm it you don’t have to use bandwidth when you’re not in it, and your use SHOULD be non existent when it’s armed unless the bad guys go in... so again, SHOULD use virtually no bandwidth unless there’s a LOT of bad guys . Ha. Ok.<br/><br/>Testing it, it’s mounted at the front of the vehicle pointed backward and it picked up on the drivers door opening in pitch dark instantly sending notifications to the phone. I was thrilled it picked up on the door as it doesn’t seem to be line of site and although it didn’t capture good video of the door it did catch motion which means trouble. The second notification was good video of me pretending to rumage the vehicle. Again in pitch dark. I was in it a total of 45 seconds and got three notifications and one good video shot of myself worthy of incriminating footage.<br/><br/>All in all, I’m pretty happy with the choice and am happy I tried it. For the peace of mind of having free cloud footage with pretty much no room for false triggers in a closed windowless vehicle like that, it only makes sense to have this.<br/><br/>I’ll update in the event I change my mind after months of testing but otherwise i highly recommend. Setup took 10-15 minutes. Very easy to configure
 I bought my first Blink set-up in January 2016 when they first started shipping, before they were acquired by Amazon. I gradually added more cameras because the system worked incredibly reliably. Starting in December of 2018 I noticed my system missing almost all of the motion detection and very slow to respond to Live View, if it even did at all; often I would just get an error message. This issue has persisted until today. I have messaged support multiple times and its always "your camera's are too far from your router". My cameras are in the same place they have always been, my wifi is the same as its always been. I upgraded to the black sync module and purchased two black cameras thinking perhaps my system was outdated; even worse outcome. If I even get an alert at all, it arrives up to 5 minutes later. I can't even use Live View on my front porch cam because the signal is too weak. There was a big discount of the Blink system around December 2018 and my speculation is they sold a lot of units. I say this because it was around this time my system became unresponsive. I, therefore, suspect their server capability cannot keep up with all the recently added systems. Curious if anyone else is having this issue as of late. Anyway, purchase with caution.
 Of the two pictures I uploaded one is from an Arlo HD camera, and the other is the Blink XT. The Arlo camera (right pic), though low resolution still has vibrant colors and is overall brighter. The Blink XT (left pic) is terrible resolution with random green pixels. The image is dull and almost dark. The Arlo's (which are decent, not great) they win this showdown by a landslide!<br/><br/>These are not HD quality, not anywhere close.<br/>As a CCTV professional I have designed, installed and serviced 100's of commercial and residential wired camera systems over the last 10 years.<br/>Some times a wired system just wont work. I have been trying out various wireless battery powered cameras in order to bridge the gap between wired and wireless systems. And of all the systems I have tested, these Blink XT cameras are by far the lowest quality ones available. So low quality that I wont even take them into consideration as a camera system.<br/>My first impression is that the cameras seem very flimsy, lightweight and cheaply made. I thought this could be overlooked if they can perform and be used indoors.<br/>The battery cover is clumsy to use and it feels like you are going to snap it off. I'm not sure how they are considered "weatherproof"...<br/>If anything the flimsiness of the camera are the "Pros"...if there are any<br/><br/>The video quality is HORRIBLE, I mean really poor.  The resolution of these are closer to 480p at best. Its definitely not 1080p HD, not even anywhere near what they are advertised at.<br/><br/>On setting up the app, and loading the camera, I thought maybe the image was so poor due to the distance between the base unit and the camera (20 feet -ish). So I moved the base unit to within 5' of the camera and there was NO difference in quality. Its not due to wifi limitations (25mbps download and 15 mbps up) The app showed 100% connection to the base unit and wifi. I double checked the settings and made sure that it was set to the highest resolution. No change. Played back the recorded video thinking that maybe the app lowers the resolution to conserve bandwidth....no change.<br/><br/>I know "there is no substitution for a wired system", and "you get what you pay for", and "you should've know better"<br/>I knew that these weren't going to be crystal clear and compare to even the lowest price wired camera.<br/>But these are not worth the time it takes you to send them back.<br/>Buyer beware
 This little camera is awsome! Someone tried to break into my house a few months ago. Put these up and they notify me on an app that you get on your phone. They were so easy to hook up!  I would recommend them 100%. I did have to get an internet extender for a better wifi signal, but I needed one anyway.
 Got it two days ago. This product really tested my patience to the max. Two days of trying to sync the camera and i just went through the loop of "Please remove and reinsert the batteries. Also, make sure you are in close proximity to your Sync module and WiFi access point. When you are ready, tap the try again button."<br/><br/>There must be a fine print that goes, "If you have done it a dozen times and you are still trying and hoping it will work, you should have already figured out you are an idiot."<br/><br/>Needless to say, I fely like one after two days.<br/><br/>Will now return.
 We have been using this system for a few months and it’s really more annoying than anything. It’s hard to get a sensitivity that does not pick up cars driving by or bugs swarming. It also has a really weak mount so camera angle is almost impossible to control if it’s windy outside. We get at least 30 alerts a day. The camera also starts recording late when it senses motion. The live view is not available when recording is in motion so you can’t see who is at the front door 🤬. I did like ease of installation but that’s about it.
 I was expecting better for this price. Loud clicking sound at night when there is movement and the red light goes on. No PC based live view (Smartphone Only). You can get an Android simulator for your PC and then load the Phone app and use it that way if you're smart enough to figure it out. Picture quality is just okay. Live view is only 30 seconds at a time, then you have to tap on Continue or the live picture stops (I suppose this is to help keep the battery working longer). Again, another Amazon owned product that does not live up to its hype.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/>Here is a bit of perspective for getting the 2 year battery life claimed: In order to get that kind of battery life according to the advertised 4,000 five second video clips per year. You would have to average less than 1 minute of video recorded per day over the course of each year. And that would be using the lowest possible settings (5 seconds, Low Infrared Lighting, Low Quality Video). Also there is no schedule timer, so you can't have it only running at night to save on battery life, you actually have to remember to turn the camera on or off every time you want it to run.<br/><br/>So if you to put this camera in any location where there might actually be any traffic/movement, you most likely won't get anywhere close to 2 years of battery life. Just sayin'.
 I ordered to xt version and within 10 min i had the system up and running final tweeking and its running great.  People have<br/> mentioned the motion sensor activates and nothing is recorded,  i have seem that also however after watching the video its picking up tree branches blowing in the wind from across the street.  Minor adjustment and things are great.  I like ayatrm so much i will be buying another xt camera.<br/>Have showed my system to friends and they like the system as well.  I havent had a need to call support yet... for me its working perfectly.<br/>If i had any recommendation i would like to see a better mounting bracket.  Seems that the company is asking customers what they would like them to work on next for improvements and are responding to the requests.
 Pros:<br/>Very easy to install, set up and use<br/>App is very user friendly, lots of settings.<br/>Price is great<br/>I've read some complaints about when in live view mode you have to keep hitting continue, yes this is true but it pops up about every minute which I<br/>  see as a feature because if you put your phone down and forget your in live view mode it will shut off and not drain the batteries.<br/>Completely wireless<br/>Great picture, very clear<br/>No monthly fee<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The mounting kind of sucks, this camera would be super easy to steal if someone wanted<br/>Wish there was an option to record while in live view mode, otherwise the camera must be triggered to record, there is an option to take a snapshot<br/><br/>so far I'm happy with this purchase but going to wait before I add anymore cameras to the system
 I am reasonably tech-savvy but struggled for years with the Foscam cameras - they were constantly dropping, no good app and just generally frustrating.  Even my super-tech friend found them really annoying when he tried to help me with them.<br/><br/>I was searching for a reasonably priced alternative that would allow me to keep an eye on my home without paying an additional monthly fee.  My alarm company offered cameras that were three times as expensive and would require an increased monthly monitoring fee.<br/><br/>I really love the Blink cameras. I use two of the outdoor cameras - one for the front door/front yard and one for the back door/backyard.<br/><br/>They were incredibly easy to set up. It seriously took me longer to drill a hole to mount the camera than it did to actually set up the camera system. I had to play around with the sensitivity settings, but after a few days, I figured out the right setting and haven't had to change anything since then.<br/><br/>The app is so easy to use and I have had zero issues with it. I like that I get a certain amount of free storage. I think it starts deleting the oldest clips after you fill up your storage, but I haven't ever filled up the storage. I just delete the clips as I view them unless I want to save one for some reason.  I also like that I can select live view through the app and watch exactly what's happening at the time.<br/><br/>I've recommended these to friends and family members, and if I ever needed to buy another system (for a vacation property - these would be great!) I would definitely buy more Blink cameras.

I set the camera up to film down on the box and send an alert to my phone if the cabinet door is opened. I had my thief within 2 days of putting the camera up there and was able to download and give the video evidence to the police. I can say I have not tested the night vision capabilities yet, but plan to do so in the next few days. Very happy with the ease of the set up. You do need home wifi with this camera. It uploads to the internet and saves videos for no cost. My nestcam charges me 10 a month for the same service. It was easy to adjust the sensitivity. I can't say how the battery life is yet, I have had the camera less than one week.
 loves at first but within 3 mths 2 of 5 of my cameras have stopped working. These are expensive so thought they would last at least 6 onths! cameras arent functioning properly, first started saying batteries are dead even immediately after changing them :/ now won’t even function immediately after changing them
 This camera system could be awesome, but for now it's just ehh.  I really wish the battery life was better, but to not have to fish wires through my house I will take it.<br/>Pros<br/>Great quality<br/>So simple to setup<br/>Free cloud storage<br/>Portability is awesome<br/>Schedule<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Battery life for high traffic areas is basically non existent I find I am replacing the batteries every couple of months, 2 years forget it.<br/>There is no way to exclude areas in view, if you have a decorative flag it will trigger the camera and the only suggestion is to lower the sensitivity which is a sacrifice I am not willing to make.
 I was looking for a system that was wireless and that didn't require a separate subscription for cloud storage.  Blink is the one that fit the bill.  I first purchased the single camera and then purchased an add-on unit a couple weeks later.  Now I have a camera in the front of my house and also one in the back.  I love how easy setup is; I was able to quickly hook up the camera to my wifi and then I used some Velcro strips to adhere the camera in the front and the back.  (I did make a rookie mistake when setting up the camera by entering the wrong serial number in the box, which kept giving me an error code.  I was sure I was entering the right number, but I was not.  User error! ) I actually put some Velcro strips in a couple different locations so I can move the camera around.  The camera has stayed affixed with those Velcro strip just fine.  I like being able to control the camera through my phone to adjust sensitivity or temporarily shut it off for when someone is working within the camera's view and you don't to keep getting alerts.  I like being able to do a live view to check for something that may not be close enough to trigger the camera.  The cloud storage can hold a lot of videos.  I usually let them pile up for a while and then I go through and delete them.  The free cloud storage definitely makes this worth the price of this system.  Once you have purchased the camera, you are done forking out money.  I also love how easy it is to save and/or share videos to Google Drive or via text.  This is a very user-friendly system and I have recommended it to others simply for the cost factor alone.
 The 100' range estimated for this device is very optimistic.  In practice I found it to be closer to 30'.  During the setup process it took several tries to get the sync module to connect, and after that it took several tries to get the camera to connect to the sync module.  This was with the sync module and camera on the same desk, and both within 10' of my router in the same room.  Once I finally got everything connected, it took 10 tries to get the system to take the initial snap shot.  Most of the time it would tell me "camera busy" and "snap shot failed".  I only got the thing to give me live view once.  It's tough to position the camera correctly when you can't tell what it's looking at.  I couldn't install the camera where I wanted it, because it was too far from my router, and I could not get the sync module to connect to my wifi extender, even with the module sitting right beside the extender.  After a dozen tries I decided there must be something better out there.  They can have this thing back.
 Battery life is abysmal.  With any sort of reasonable recording triggers, batteries won’t last two weeks, and these are expensive lithium batteries it requires.<br/><br/>If you use the USB cable, the port interferes with the bracket if you want to angle the camera downwards.<br/><br/>Then comes the app. Live streaming disconnects in less than a minute. Even after you acknowledge the app and click “continue”.  This is aggravating especially if you’re trying to use it as a baby monitor. Audio cuts in and out and frequently the app says the camera is busy.<br/><br/>Should’ve spent my money on a nest instead. Our Nest Hello’s picture quality is better and we can live stream without constantly needing to babysit the app.
 I bought this since it was totally wireless, and needed something to monitor my house but not to use as a full fledged security suite. Obviously since this is battery powered it has flaws -- slightly lower quality than wired 1080p cameras, not as good motion detection, etc. But it works well for what it is, the only alternative is the more expensive Arlo cameras. I ONLY use Lithium Ultimate AA's since they are long lasting, I'd suggest using these only as does Blink's team.<br/><br/>If you need to put the camera in a place where you can't screw in at, or just don't want to, buy some "Scotch All-Weather Fasteners". It is basically plastic velcro meant for any surface, I stuck mine to aluminum around the house and they don't budge at all. Since the velcro part is plastic it sticks together very well and won't get worn by weather.<br/><br/>Update: Battery life with my Litium Ultimate AA's has been excellent. I bought two in October 2018 and it's now April 2019 (7 months later) and the original batteries still work great. This is because I only have the system enabled at a scheduled time, during night (10 PM - 6 AM) and I have the custom motion detection areas set so it doesn't false positive against the wind moving bushes or cars driving down the road normally. If you want live camera all the time or want a full security suite with constant 24/7 motion detection I'd still suggest getting a fully wired camera setup.
 I live in a VERY windy neighborhood.  We have to replace our flags twice a year due to the wind.  The motion sensing of these cameras cannot detect human from inanimate objects, like plants, flowers or other decorations.  That leads to tremendous battery consumption.  They claim two years under normal use.  My back yard is normal use; they lasted two days.  We are at home, awake, for about 2 hours in the AM and 8 hours in the PM. So the cameras are on for 14 hours a day.  The very expensive lithium batteries lasted three days NOT two years.  So you WILL buy solar panels for each outdoor camera $$$.  In this day and age I have zero clue why this product was not designed to use rechargeable batteries. ALSO you will NOT be able to store video local.  This has been a HUGE complaint that has never been answered.  Each videos has to be downloaded by your smart phone… seriously?? My WIFI router has a NAS option.  This is a go-fund-me-thing, that Amazon bought, who has heard the complaints of the consumers but not responded.  AMAZON LISTEN! Local storage, better control.  Buyer beware.
 Just what I was looking for and at a reasonable price.  I had my Blink camera (pictured - can you see it over the front door?  barely ... ) up and running in about an hour's time.  You may be able to do it even quicker.  Mine is located not far (10 ft) from my computer so the signal is strong and the picture excellent.  It took me awhile to get used to making sure the camera was both enabled and armed.  Btw - cats, squirrels, birds and bugs all can trigger your alert - but not to such an extent you are annoyed by it.  In the Blink App you can adjust various sensitivity and record settings to your own needs.  I monitor my alerts on my iPad.  You can do this from anywhere on the globe as long as you have access to the Internet.  If you get an alert and you want to see your monitored area in real time, just switch to "Live View" and see your possessions being scooped up by your nasty neighbor.  btw - you also are monitoring audio too. Perfect..<br/>The time/date stamp is great (and essential).  Many states require this in order to charge a person with a crime or to prosecute -- if it comes to that.  The Blink sticker may be enough to discourage most would-be bad actors.<br/><br/>Things I'd like to see?  I'd like to be able to go to my PC and see the same thing in my browser as I do in the Blink app.  This is not yet possible<br/><br/>I'd also like the ability to save a still frame from any video I wanted to keep or to print.  Not available as far as I can tell.<br/><br/>Not sure how far you can place the camera from the mother ship. The farther away you get, the more likely you'll have a signal problem.  I'd like 100 feet - but not sure you'd ever get that - lots of things factor into this including - walls - trees - etc.<br/><br/>All in all --- this device gets a BIG thumbs up.  If you don't want to drill holes, run cable, pull your hair out -- This IS the security camera for you - indoors or out.
 Purchased first unit and loved it. Works perfectly during the day and at night. Purchase a second unit and this one came in different package compare to my first unit. Return the second unit because it did not work at night. Had horrible white lines throughout my video. I will update again when my new unit arrives. The blue box was my first unit. The white box was the one that gave me issues. Will update rating once new unit arrives.<br/><br/>Update!<br/>Received new unit and it work as intended. Be sure to use the provided batteries  because I used a regular energizer battery and it drained it in two days. I set my video qualtiy to enhances and the image is HD. My signal is also 4/5 bars because I moved the module as close as possible to the unit. IR is ok but not great, then again I paid about $63 for the unit because of the promotion they had. For the price I cant complain. Loved how there is no service fee like other devices. My advice is to play with the setting to get what works for you. I end up turning my front unit sensitivity down because it was picking up every car that drove by and it was taking up to much storage space.  4 star because the night vision is soso but gets the job done
 I am a retired GE engineer and enjoy photography as a hobby.  I decided to purchase Blink XT cameras for a security system at my rural residence, after reading all the great reviews.<br/>I found much of what was said in those reviews accurate. The free cloud service, layout of the app and features are fantastic and really well thought out.  I was very impressed here. However, there is a major flaw with the camera system which turned out to be a deal breaker for me.  I experienced extremely poor image quality which none of the app IR adjustments could begin to compensate for.  During daytime, where the subject is back lit (and I'm not talking extreme, only subtle no direct sunlight),  the face comes out so dark, even professional video software can't correct for it.  Conversely at night, the exposure is so overblown, the face is completely washed out and again, cannot be correct.  In both of these examples, the poor exposure compensation becomes even more exaggerated as the subject is closer to the camera.  So in my case, the camera is located adjacent to my entrance door, bringing out the worst of what this camera should but can't handle. Like making all faces look unrecognizable, unless you were standing at least 10 feet away.  And even if there was a functionally useful IR intensity adjustment (which now fails miserably), one  could only hope to correct for one, not both situations. So the correction software solution is flawed right out of the starting gate. There needs to be 2 separate exposure compensations, one for daytime and one for night. As this camera now stands with today's camera technology available, this is simply unacceptable not to mention completely useless if it came to identifying someone.  I ended up returning all my cameras because of it.
 A rash of local home breakins prompted me to look into DIY home security cameras. Some history: I’m no stranger to home security in the USA and abroad, both with DIY and with big-name monitored systems. In my experience, if scumbags want to get into your house, they will get in. The monitoring companies’ and police response times are less than ideal, so really the best thing you can do is get a shot of the crooks and hope to catch them after the fact. Anyways, I wanted something that didn’t need “professional” monitoring, and didn’t cost me anything to DIY. These fit the bill. Super easy to set up, they work well without needing to fiddle with the settings (yet provide you with room to adjust them), zero cost, the app works nicely, overall I am very pleased with them. Another feature I like is that the system will email you if faults happen (for example, a camera or base station stops responding, a battery dies somewhere, etc) so even if it’s not officially “monitored” by useless sleeping desk warmers, our robot overlords will still attempt to protect us. I’ve read mixed reviews on the battery life so we’ll see how that goes, but barring that, it’s a good solid product. I got 2, for the front and back entries, but I will definitely order more.
 Best camera for the money, lots of FREE  video storage( We have 5 cameras and  can store almost 2 weeks of video) does not force you to purchase a monthly fee for cloud storage like its sister company RING( both owned by amazon) which only holds free video for 24 hour period.  WORD OF ADVICE PURCHASE THE CORD AND PLUG THEM INTO USB CHARGER, which means it needs to be within 25ft(longest cord available) of a electrical outlet. ADDING a electrical outlet in the attic is very easy and the best option for powering cameras mounted to the outside of house... if you want to go the easy route EXPECT TO REPLACE THE BATTERY AS NEEDED and don’t complain about it, or you can buy the ring camera with a flood light which doesn’t even have the option to use a battery. The only time you should use the battery is if you need to monitor a location for a short period that you won’t need to view after  that short period(  Monitoring  a trailer parked at house during  a home remodeling job) OTHERWISE PLUG THE THING INTO USB POWER, AND STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT BATTERY LIFE.” Batteries don’t last long enough blah blah blah” that is why they give you a solution to that problem and allow them to be plugged into usb. Remember BEST CAMERA for the money. If your wealthy buy RING. And pay a monthly fee.
 It's awful. It's cheap and takes awful video. People are a blur. I wasted a lot of time installing it and it's a piece of crap. Also, technical support person was lousy, though the supervisor was fine, but the device still stinks. Learn my mistake and avoid!
 Does exactly what it says on the box, which is the key to my review's 5-stars.  Be careful though, like when you don't buy a 1/2 ton pickup truck &amp; knock it for not being able to haul the stuff a Semi can, you shouldn't expect this little product to have every feature under the sun That said:<br/><br/>I've had mine for almost 6 months now.  Extremely easy setup... nit pick would be a wish that the mount would be more of a multi-axis swivel but was able to get things where they were functioning for my purposes.  Interface via the app on an iPhone is extremely easy &amp; intuitive.  No issues with battery performance as of yet.<br/><br/>No fee for cloud access/storage is outstanding.  Everything works like a champ.<br/><br/>The sensitivity adjustment on the motion activation sensor works pretty good but it's not like on a Ring where you can set distance motion parameters &amp;/or cone on or off certain slices of the field of view.<br/><br/>Can't say enough about how easy this product is to set up &amp; have working right out of the box.... Great product that does what it was designed to do.
 Ohhhh my gosh.... where do I start... these are the most amazing cameras ever!  The picture is great, the audio is clear, and they are EASY as heck to set up.  I can spy on my teenagers and put cameras in areas of the house that they do not belong (where alcohol is stored, etc).  The kids know BLink is watching them so they would'nt dare try anything! I love it!  Do you have a teen who likes to sneak out? NO WORRIES, these have night vision... they won't be going far when your phone alerts you that movement has been detected!  Other than keeping kids in line, these are great for seeing what is going on when you are not home. When packages are delivered, or people just showing up.  We were out of the country a few weeks ago and I could check in to see if the pet sitter was feeding the animals and taking care of things at our home... it is amazing.  GET THESE CAMERAS  ... So easy, so affordable!
 We have had some less than honest neighbors as of lately so we decided to go with this system. It's been good for the most part except for the mounting brackets that are included. They are Terrible as we have come to learn! I had the cameras up for about a month and one of them fell from the tree we had it mounted in because it is a cheap mount... you'll see if you order it. Anyway, we got lucky as one of our honest neighbors picked it up and we got it back... "clipped" it in again and within a week it fell off the mount again. This time we were not so lucky as the "not so honest" neighbor picked it up and it is likely we will not be getting it back. Probably thinking well you should have video of the neighbor picking it up, yeah I wish! but these cameras only seem to catch what they want to catch sometimes they work sometimes they don't, the front camera didn't even "go off" that would have also seen the neighbor with the camera! I spoke with Blink about the issue but they informed me that it is not covered even though the mount failed and that I should of called the first time it failed so they could send me a new mount... excuse me for giving your system a second chance, but I should have known when I seen how these cameras mount! The piece of Junk Neighbor wins again! Thanks Blink! For these reasons I have to give this a one star rating and I would not recommend this product to anyone I like.
 Purchased the set with 5 cameras.  Overall, the cameras aren't bad, the mounts they come with are flimsy though.  One bird or squirrel that decides they are interested in the camera will be able to snap it right off.  Thumbs down.<br/><br/>My biggest problem though, is the software.  One user only, Tried setting my parents up on their own accounts using the same equipment.  But once the camera was registered to me, they couldn't add them.  What good is that?  None.  If I'm away and something happens, they would have no access to footage for the police.  Also, no computer access????<br/><br/>Blink made shiny cameras with a crap software package, got amazon to buy them, and overpriced the daylights out of it.  I don't trust them.  As soon as I can afford another option, I'm ditching blink until they get their software to track better. It feels like I got ripped off big time on this purchase.<br/><br/>DO NOT BUY
 Really wanted this to work. Did everything step by step. Installation failed the first time but worked after restarting sync module replacing batteries etc. However it does not work consistently. Repeatedly got “live view failed” and “  thumbnail failed” messages. Followed everything suggested in tech support -rebooting modem, router, sync module. Worked once and then the same “failed” messages. Very disappointing. Will return.
 These are the answer. After having an overpriced and underperforming Ring doorbell that I returned, a cheap-o WiFi camera that got fogged up and was slow to respond to motion, and a Simplisafe camera that just straight up didn't work it appears that Blink is the answer.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- The resolution is clear day and night.<br/>- The sensitivity adjustments make it so it's not going off every time a car drives by.<br/>- Super easy to setup.<br/>- No monthly cloud subscription to store footage.<br/>- Actually captures people walking onto my porch, not as they're walking away (like the Ring did).<br/>- Small and inconspicuous.<br/>- It doesn't thrash the internet speed on my other devices!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Would be nice to have a way to secure the device to the mount. Someone could literally just walk up, pop it off, and walk away.<br/>- Also, not really a con, but it would be sweet if users could isolate "zones" for the camera to detect motion in or ignore. For example, I park my motorcycle in clear view of the camera but it's out of the sensitivity range. If it never moves and I wanted to set the motion to alert me if the bike is moved that would be cool. I only mention this because my old DropCam used to do this and it was a nice feature.<br/><br/>Overall would recommend to anyone who is looking into a system such as this one. The price is right and it functions exactly as it's supposed to. Strong connection in my house between both cameras using the included WiFi base thingy.
 I absolutely love this home security camera. I primarily purchased this camera for the mere fact that I live in a "troubled" apartment building. There have been more fires in this building than you can shake a finger at. My neighbor who hasn't learned (even after 2 nights in a row) that aluminum doesn't go into the microwave and drugs / alcohol make you a HUGE red flag and his apartment door is actually a revolving door. Then there's the occasional drunks that actually make it past the security gate and like to POUND as hard as they can on my door at 3 am not realizing they're in the wrong place. Now, you might ask if there are cameras in the building - why in fact there are however, my apartment is around a corner and out of sight of the building cameras so, in order to protect myself better I decided on a home security camera.<br/><br/>The camera is super sensitive, even at its lowest setting. The audio is pretty good although you hear a lot of background noise. I like that it has an IR setting for when it's too dark to see normally. Installation was easy, you just follow the step by step instructions. All in all, I'm extremely happy with this setup. I just wish the little blue light and a noticeable "click" noise didn't happen every single time it was triggered - seriously takes away from the discretion of the device.<br/><br/>P.S. My neighbor says hi!

I'm very impressed with the video quality as can be seen in the attached video of my recent delivery.
 I am beyond in love with this camera system. Love!! I had been contemplating getting cameras and had been reviewing some but eek the price is a little high.... then some drama went down in my neighborhood and my neighbor had her camera pics of a potential situation all over our neighborhood app. Long story short, I got freaked out thinking that my safety was really being compromised so I got online and bought the 5 camera system. They are easy to install and considering the price of your valuables inside, I figured $500 was a fair price to keep them safe. I’ve not found them to be overly sensitive and I guess you just have to tweak that as you go along but I’m beyond pleased. Oh and the guy caught on my neighbor’s camera turned out to be another neighbor, but the whole sitch was enough to make me up my security game. Just a minute ago I was alerted to movement at my front door and lo and behold it was the fed ex man. The only issue I have is due to the delay of the camera picking up motion and turning on, if someone just drops off a package, my camera is only catching the back of them walking away. If someone knocks and stands there a minute, I’ve got good camera feed.  I’ve even been able to watch the front door live then turn to the front of the garage camera to watch the rest of the movement of someone walking away or getting in their car. Anyhoo, buy this system. It’s a great investment.
 Videos get deleted automatically. One moment its its there, suddenly its gone... Terrible...
 Update.  Wish I would have returned these cameras.  I've made all types of adjustments and they work half the time for think that shouldn't trigger them and other times they don't work for something that should obviously trigger the sensor.<br/><br/>Thinking about returning.  Great quality and easy to setup.  Only records short snips and usually starts recording late.  The cameras are too easy to remove and I won't feel comfortable unless I get them up high so a thief would need a ladder to remove one.  Software and motion detection just seems buggy.
 Was happy with product until company disabled smartthings integration which is why I bought this camera in the first place.  Stay away if you want smart home integration.
 It’s been a couple days of use and a few changes to the settings but I am very pleased with my purchase. Black Friday sale for a single camera system was a great deal! If its sensitivity is set to 8 of 10 the motion detector picks up every passing vehicle in front of the house with a 35ft setback from the road. I used Scotch weatherproof two-sided tape to attach to the vynl siding of the window at the front entry in 24 degree weather. I get instant notifications every time the camera records, plus free cloud storage! Sorry garbage and mailman it’s not for you, you do a great job!
 Cons:  This product lacks many features that are available on less expensive products<br/>- only 1-way audio<br/>- only records in response to motion detection and then for a limited time<br/>- real-time images/video cannot be viewed on a computer - only a smartphone through the blind app<br/>- my unit was delivered unable to boot - took several days of working with customer support to fully reset the sync unit before the system would even boot<br/>- app is clunky - requires multiple clicks to see the live scene (need to choose between refreshing in live view mode (streaming) and a single snapshot)<br/>- live view mode only streams for a few seconds and then requires you to press another button to continue the streaming<br/>- they know that additional troubleshooting steps are relatively common, but they don't provide them on their website (instructions say the lights should have a particular pattern during the setup - but they don't tell you what you can do if that's not the case even though they have those instructions at hand and will provide them if you contact them for troubleshooting help)<br/><br/>Pros<br/>- battery operated - I don't need to have wires running all over the house<br/>- weatherproof (I don't have personal evidence yet but that's their claim and the package seems reasonably weatherproof)<br/>- clear images<br/>- storage is free<br/>- setup was relatively straightforward AFTER I got past the several days of troubleshooting to get the sync module to boot (it should come out of the box with at least some working version of firmware)<br/><br/>I previously owned several Funlux cameras, but all of the units failed within 18 months.  So, I was looking for something more reliable.  I'm hoping this is more reliable but have no way to determine that now.  Several other reviewers say they feel cheap and recommend other units, but I did significant research before buying this and found that all of the available systems have a very broad spectrum of reviews, including considerable negative reviews about a lack of reliability.  It's not clear there is a consistency reliable product on the market.
 Their size and wireless platform make them great to move around until you find the perfect spot. The biggest limitation is the distance from their sync module. I bought each camera separately, so I use each camera's sync module, instead of multiple cameras to one module. The main purpose is to keep an eye outside around the house while no one is home. I have an alarm system and a large, scary dog. But, there have been a lot of reports of intruders looking in windows, checking out back yards and garages before eventually breaking in. If any of these losers picks my house, I'd like to have everything covered. Of course, best case scenario is that they don't even try to break in.<br/>I first tested one camera in the house. It picked up my dog CONSTANTLY. The picture was great! I finally moved that camera out back to view my back yard/garage. The picture is still really clear.  Thankfully, there haven't been any intruders to really test it out. It does pick up my dogs when we first let them out when we get home from work. Night vision isn't good right now because one of my spotlights is pointed in the direction of the camera and ruins the view. I'll be moving that to face a different direction to help out.<br/>The front camera is currently installed inside, on the windowsill. During the day, it still has a nice, clear picture. Night time isn't so good. There's a reflection from the glass. I just got a bracket to install the camera outside. Once I decide the best spot, I'll update the night vision clarity.<br/>The app is fine. I can view live feed whenever I like. Motion detection is fine. I haven't messed with the default settings, but I will just to see if I can improve anything.<br/>The only negative I want to add is the rising cost of these cameras. The price has increased enough since I first purchased mine last year, that I won't purchase any more. They keep advertising a 20% discount on social media, but the discounted prices is the usual normal price. That's pretty sh*tty to raise the price, then raise it some more to offer a discount to take it back down to the first price increase. Bottom line, these cameras are not worth $100 when there are recent better options that are a lot less expensive. They'd sell even more if the price was better.
 I bought five of the white cameras for indoor and five of the black for ones for outdoors. The black cameras seem to provide better resolution. It was necessary to buy a better router to obtain the added WiFi reach we need. I bought a gaming router with antennas from Amazon that works just fine for our large ranch style house. It allows coverage for the basement and garage, too. The camera resolution is sufficient to obtain license plate numbers at close range to about fifteen or twenty feet. Alaska's cold weather hasn't buggered the cameras in the few weeks since they arrived and we installed them.  Easy set up for old guys like me who know nothing about electronics. You might want to buy adjustable mounts for the cameras and a wall or electrical socket mount for your control box. You can't simply access the cameras and see what's going on live around your place without giving a camera, one camera at a time, a command to activate to see what's happening live. I'm not referring to the activation button that you must set in order to obtain footage when the camera detects motion. There is no continuous camera footage. The cameras are generally dormant is one reason the batteries must last so long.  Don't forget to preset the cameras for time periods you want them to detect motion and to record, nor to turn your cameras on when you leave home, otherwise, nothing will be recorded. Magpies and Canada jays are drawn to two of our cameras so they activate them frequently. Catching wildlife wandering around or flying nearby is a pleasant advantage to having cameras outside of your home in Alaska.<br/><br/>Update: March 9th, 2019<br/><br/>Satisfied with my first order, I ordered two more sets of the outdoor cameras. The sets arrived by UPS in a badly damaged box. I asked the driver to make a note of the damage then took a few pictures of the box. After looking at the contents they appeared undamaged so I put the camera systems up outside of my home. Two of the ten cameras were not operational. The work was complete for the time and task at hand so I put the ladders, tools and other items away. I called Amazon to get a replacement for the two defective cameras. I spoke consecutively with two representatives and asked both to replace the defective cameras with good ones. Neither would help me. Both ladies stated that I would have take down all of the cameras, repackage the contents of the box and send it back for an exchange. Amazon sells individual cameras. I shouldn't have to put in the labor and effort necessary to send a complete set of cameras back to them. This is an unfair resolution. Only two cameras are defective. I contacted the maker of these cameras who state in writing that they offer customer service seven days a week. They do not. I was unable to contact anyone this early Saturday afternoon, not online and not by telephone. At this point, I want buyers to beware. I will update this review again if the seller or Amazon have a change in heart.<br/><br/>Update March 9th, 2019<br/><br/>A very personable young lady by the name of Maria called me tonight and resolved my situation with the cameras. Maria is the kind of employee every business needs. Thank you and, as you can see, my rating is back at five stars.
 Ok so. It has great visual! The fact that you have to keep selecting “continue” every 10 seconds to keep veiwing the security system, SUCKS!!!!!<br/>When you watch a camera for too long they do become heated. One camera was  97° at one point. So I stopped monitoring it. It took about 2hours for it to get back to 73° (room temp). As far as the motion detection anything triggers it but it’s not like it records, so it’s kinda pointless. Back to this DOESNT RECORD ANYTHING! It’s basically a monitoring system and not an actual security system. I don’t understand why it has storage?? Like for what? I can’t record nothing. So if I get robbed I won’t know who did it or what time... STUPID!!!! Hopefully they will upgrade or let you exchange in a monitoring system that you already have when they start actually RECORDING stuff!
 Worked great in the house, and set up was straight forward, but as soon as it was moved just outside (within 2 feet of where it worked previously inside) it was inconsistent. This is the OUTDOOR camera model. After tinkering with moving my router, moving the cameras, resetting cameras, moving sync module, playing with sensistivity settings, nothing worked. It would pick up random movement, and other more important times (like people coming and going) not pick up anything. Live view worked less than 50% of the time. Again, when used inside was great, but that is not why I purchased. I am returning this product. For a little more $ I can purchase a system more consistent and have it installed without 3 weeks of aggravation trying to get it to work.<br/><br/>If you want something cute to film your pets or kids inside the house, this is great, but if you want actual home security usage outdoors, I would suggest paying and have a solid system installed. Should have heeded the warning from the professionals from the beginning.
 Update: I have grown to like this camera more. Sure, rough spots in set up and the app UI but, over all, it is fine. Captured my local fox on my back deck (looking for bird seed probably). The local cat. Me. Yard cleanup landscaper. Postal workers. But not all the time (good) just when I am not home or, middle of the night (animals only).<br/>I do wish it had speaker so I could talk to people at the front door though…<br/>--<br/>When you follow the instructions on opening the back, be gentle. It is more a slide and pull just about 4 or so millimeters of slide. Very little. You are pulling back on an O ring and then pulling the O ring and back out.<br/>Once you have it out and batteries in, leave the back OFF. You actually will need to access it 2 or more times (the directions do not say this!). One more time to take a picture of serial number and probably to flip a small switch buried in the back too (why this is so small and buried…)<br/>The camera is dead easy to install. Pre-drill a smaller hole (a very small size drill bit!) then just screw it in and click it on. The little adjuster screws on the hinge are fussy and should be a bit larger though.<br/>The only issue I ran into is that I did not have the right ladder for where I want it to go. So I mounted it lower and will move it when I have the house painted. Painters have bigger ladders!<br/>One annoying interface element is that you have to click on Home with the inverted triangle at the top to access more very useful features like scheduling. Don't miss it!<br/>These cameras are geofence capable with IFTTT. Search for Blink on IFTTT app and then set up on arm and disarm geofence applets for the feature. They work fine. Then, it just automatically arms when you leave home and disarms when you return.<br/>They are also beta testing a feature, Activity Zones, to block segments of the field of view. This is on one of my cameras (randomly chosen, I guess) which turned out good as it shows a bit of street. I turned off those two upper right grid segments and, no cars trigger it.<br/>Be prepared to see interesting things at night! Like the black cat that walks up on my back deck at 2AM! These are basically wild life trail cameras but, attached to your home.<br/>It will be interesting to see how long the batteries last and how well they do in sub zero or high heat and humidity. I live in a true 4 season location but the summers are notably humid and brutal here.
 I had hopes for this wireless security camera system. I needed wireless since I had did not have the time or ability to run wires throughout the house by myself. I have a split-level house (2400sqf) on a corner lot (9000sqf). I had only installed 2 of the 7 total cameras ordered in easy accessible areas, but at different corners of my property to verify the ability of the system before climbing up the ladder.<br/><br/>I tested both cameras at various angles and distances to see how the IR worked and to check the quality of the picture/sound. I placed 1 camera at one end of of my deck and pointed it directly at the stairs on the opposite end which is 25 feet away with no obstructions. With the camera IR sensitivity set to the highest level (9), I waited for 60 secs to let the camera to fully reset before walking back up. When I did walk back up, the camera did not trigger until I was about 20 feet away. That short distance does not give you enough coverage to start recording before something may happen. The other camera was placed on my fence facing back towards the house. I had the same issues as with the other camera.<br/><br/>My settings:<br/>- Clip: 10 secs<br/>- Reset timer: 30 secs<br/>- IR sensitivity: 7<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Easy to setup<br/>- Easy to install<br/>- Quick notification (if turned on) through Blink app when a camera is triggered<br/>- Easy access to recent triggered video through Blink app<br/>- Camera mic picks up a soft voice very well, even from 30 feet away<br/>- Camera (with Wall Mount Bracket accessory) was not bulky and did not "stand out"<br/>- Camera firmware updatable through app. No need to pull camera down.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- Camera needs to be much closer to the hub than expected<br/>- Batteries died within a month<br/>- IR distance trigger is only 20'-30'<br/>- Not a good option to use IR sensor for high mounted areas<br/>- No option to purchase more cloud storage<br/>- IR will easily trigger with a single snowflake or bug flying by<br/>- Field of view (FOV) could be better<br/>- Included bracket is cheap and flimsy<br/>- Only 720p, but rumored to be upgraded "soon" to 1080p via a firmware patch<br/>- Easy to steal. Camera is not secure in any way.<br/><br/>Accessories used: (I recommend both)<br/>Blink XT Camera Wall Mount Bracket (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F8KPBBL)<br/>Kasmotion Hanger Bracket Holder for Blink XT (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GWG7WRH)

Let's say that up front.  However, I am not bias and I do not have an agenda, so consider this a reliable one.<br/>BACKGROUND<br/>I bought these because we recently bought a house and the local area has a high population of poor.  Where this is the case, crime and desperation are unfortunately common to that culture.  Since moving in, have had my car broken into and someone stole a package off my porch (which, by the way, is very hard to prove).<br/>THE PRODUCT<br/>Decided to try this system, because the ring just didn't seem like a value compared to this system.  Some of the reviews for this product, however, warned that it had terrible range or wouldn't link.  My experience so far is that this product works very well.  One of the pictures above gives an idea of how far apart the synk module was from the wifi, and how far the cameras are from the module.  The cameras maintain a good link with the module.  The one that is 50 ft from the module sometimes takes a while to upload its videos and provide an alert due to a lower connection strength, but it has been faithfully connected so far.  Instillation was pretty easy and setting up the system was one of the more painless electronics installs I've had to do.  The app allows you to monitor your cameras from wherever you are, even if you are miles away.  Frankly, I do not understand reviews with people saying connection does not work well or that they had to keep the synk module right next to the wifi.  They must live in a bunker or some other reinforced structure!  There are 3 walls between the front camera and the synk module, and it has 4 to 5 bars consistently.  There are 2 walls and 30 ft or so between the synk module and the wifi unit, and it has not lost connection once.<br/><br/>PROS<br/>-Easy to set up<br/>-Comparatively cheap for the initial system<br/>-A lot of great options in the app, including a GREAT beta testing element that lets you select which areas of the camera view will respond to motion, so, for example, if the camera includes part of a road, you can configure the camera to ignore motion on the road while monitoring motion in the rest of the field.  Cool, huh?!<br/>-Pretty clear video<br/>-night vision that can be adjusted in sensitivity.  At full sensitivity, the camera in the back lot was activating in response to motion that was at least 100 ft away.<br/>-Signal strength is pretty stable between camera and the synk.<br/>-New cameras can be added to the system at any time after you've got it set up.<br/>-You can set up multiple zones if you have more than one synk module.  So...for example, if you have your own business, you could have one synk module monitoring your business and one that is monitoring your home, and control both from the app.<br/>-Amazon is backing this company, and that is a good thing.  Amazon tends to maintain competitive standards for the products that they support.<br/><br/>CONS<br/>-Price of peripherals is ridiculous.  The yard sign, which is apparently of poor quality, is sold separately and is 30 dollars!  Each additional camera is 95 dollars.  I want to add 3 more cameras to this system before all is as I wish it to be.<br/>-If the signal is weak for a camera, it will take a while for the video to upload, and they system will not alert you to movement until that upload is done.<br/>-I have noticed that motion detection works better with daylight shots than it does with night vision shots.  They will probably iron this out as development moves forward for this product.<br/>-I think the app for this should include an emergency call button that you can hit within the app to immediately contact the local law enforcement.  Should you see something in your camera that needs police involvement, you will need to exit the app and call up the local police, and, in an emergency, every second counts.<br/>-Similarly, there is no option for door or window triggers other than motion detection.  It would be great if BlINK added support to the synk module for actual alarm system features, so that you can add them in later if you wish.  If they are smart, they will add this option on down the road.<br/>-This only comes with one security protection sticker and no yard sign.  See above for the con of that.<br/><br/>Neither Pro nor Con, but useful to know:<br/>-This product is clearly still in development, offering beta testing for new features.  This is potentially a con, because it means there may be bugs that still need worked out.  This is a pro because it means anything you don't like will probably get fixed if it is a problem for other users.<br/>-The two most important features in the app are sensitivity adjustment (you may need different sensitivity depending on what is in the view of the camera),  and the zoning off of areas that you don't want the camera to detect motion within.  Using these two features, this camera can be set up for just about any situation you need it for.<br/>-The cameras will pick up motion within 40 ft, but the motion sensor is very directional, and must be pointed towards the area that is important to monitor.  As I stated, though it is officially within 40ft, at the highest sensitivity, my camera was picking up movement 100 ft away, and the movement that triggered it was a change in the lighting of that area, with car lights moving across that street.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase, and I'm hoping to build my system up to 5 cameras.  I recommend this product, and the cons I've listed are all things that will probably be addressed by the company as they continue development.  I will update this review if there is more to add to my review, or if I feel the star rating needs to be changed, but, at this time, I'm very pleased and give this product 5 stars.
 I waited several months before commenting on this system and I am glad I waited.  A point the company does not make is the fact the cameras have to be able to "talk" to the sync module, which in turn has to connect to your wifi.  I have adequate wifi throughout my home but the sync modules seems have weaker "receiver" electronics as trying to connect to the cameras and wifi router proved to be a challenge. The manual states the cameras can be placed up to 100 feet from the sync module. Maybe in an open field with no structures or walls in between.  I was forced to install a second sync module for cameras at the end of my home.  Otherwise the cameras kept dropping the connection.  The additional inconvenience is now I have to activate two different systems when I leave the home.  Additionally I noticed the batteries with the indoor system were generic no-name batteries. Yet the ones provided with the outdoor system were name brand reputable batteries.  I had to replace the indoor batteries after a week or so due them becoming weak and losing connection to the sync module.  Customer service was responsive but not helpful as I became frustrated in trying to explain the issue to the rep. I was spending more time exchanging emails with blink than it was worth. I ended up buying new batteries and chalking it up to not buying another blink product again.  I was hoping to add their doorbell if it ever hits the market but I now have serious doubts.
 We have had these cameras since July 2018, It's now January 2019 &amp; we haven't had one issue with them!<br/>We received the 2 pack &amp; they arrived in 2 days as we used our Prime acct. They were packaged very well, damage free &amp; in original packaging.<br/>They were super easy to set up &amp; just as easy to download the app on multiple devices.<br/>The settings take some tweaking (motion, recording time, ext).. The camera can be set to super sensitive or not sensitive. It took us about 2 months to get the settings where we like them for optimal battery life!<br/>The super sensitive setting picks up things very easily (Squirrels, Bees &amp; the wind shaking it), which will use up the battery life quickly, so I suggest that you use the sensitivity towards the middle.<br/>We were unable to drill holes in our rented house so we had to go with a wire free camera!<br/>The batteries might last for 2 months in an area that doesn't have a lot of traffic, but my house has a lot of traffic (and squirrels), so we get about a month of life out of each set of batteries (which still ins't bad at all for being a wire free camera system!)..<br/>The sound works really good as well! I like to check the live view from my phone in bed if I hear a noise.<br/>What I really like about these cameras is that you can move them around. It was very handy to be able to move one of the cameras to the porch when we were expecting Christmas deliveries.<br/>The memory that they allow has A LOT of storage! We delete a lot of the videos as they have no use to us, but we have had 80 videos (30 Seconds each) in there at one time and it wasn't even 1/4 full.<br/>We will be purchasing 2 more cameras to add to our existing cameras when we get our taxes back this year, the peace of mind is worth every cent spent!
 The directions were easy, but not idiot proof.  You don't need to be a Geek Tech to understand, but it helps to be somewhat tech literate. Once you figure it out, an "add on" camera is a breeze, except for figuring out where to mount it.<br/><br/>Once you get the cameras working, the directions tell you NOTHING about setting the settings, such as sensitivity, and how many seconds to play when motion activated. Play with it and guess. For example, what does "retrigger time" mean? And what is an IR illuminator? (Discovered by googling works better if it's OFF!) The directions don't even tell you HOW to get to the settings. Like I said, helps to be somewhat tech literate so you can guess.  My one concern is that even though you can permanently fasten the mounting bracket to a surface, the camera just "clips" to the mounting bracket. Someone could still steal the camera off the bracket if they are tall enough. I had to put it just above my door to get a good picture. A tall person could still steal the camera.<br/><br/>Oh, one thing I was happy about....once you "install" the camera on your phone app, it doesn't matter if you move the camera to a different location. Once "activity" is noticed, it refreshes to new location, or you can "refresh" in the app.<br/><br/>Good picture during day (See 4th photo). View goes from my stairs then across paver walkway, to edge of sidewalk. I cannot see who is walking on sidewalk. I do live on a busy thoroughfare, so every car that passes sends a video clip to my phone if it's "armed." I cannot see the car, only hear it on the clip. (Putting "sensitivity" setting to 4 remedied this.)<br/><br/>I walked outside to test the picture. Decent, as long as the person isn't wearing a hoodie or staring at the ground. As other reviews have said, night vision isn't clear. Picture is great of the detail on my porch (see first photo), but if a person walks up the person Is "washed out." I tried both with porch light on and without porch light on. Didn't matter. A person approaching after dark will be washed out in white. (Later figured out that the corner street light near my house is the problem. The camera I installed in back yard was good on night vision, better, but not perfect picture of a person, as long as I did not have an interior light shining through windows. See 5th photo.) Turning off the "IR Illuminator" remedies this (2nd and 3rd photo). But if you turn off the IR illuminator, you need to leave a porch light on. See 2nd and 3rd photos.<br/><br/>If IR illuminator is on, daytime will be black and white, not color. It's either IR iluminator for night vision automatically and black and white all the time, or turn off IR illuminator and have color during day and bad vision at night.<br/><br/>You can define the viewing area, I made a T shaped viewing area. There is a section of my porch most people wouldn't go to so I grayed that out. Apparently that capability is in BETA testing. It's to prevent sensing motion in areas that are not necessary.<br/><br/>As one reviewer said, I entered WiFi and password manually.<br/><br/>I ordered an "add on" camera, and put it in back yard. I also have Alexa on Fire TV, and it took some effort to get the cameras to show on TV. You need the Alexa phone app for that.<br/><br/>The "arm/disarm" affects the entire system.  However, you can disable one camera for situations where you might want to do this.
 I really like this camera, after I spent a long time looking at all the options. This has the best online clip storage.  You get rolling storage, so you get to keep your clips for as long as needed, which is great if you go on vacation and cannot view them until later.  Some companies only give you 7 days of storage....so a long trip you could loose important video.<br/>-The app was simple to setup, easy to use. The battery life so far (one month+ in) is good. It notifies you if you have high usage on a specific camera, so you can adjust the settings.<br/>only negative I have found is the length of time to activate the video after movement detected.....we put this in our driveway to watch an outbuilding.  Our dogs regularly walk to and from the shed, and often they set the camera off but the video takes a couple seconds to activate so you don't even get them on the clip because they are inside it already.<br/>Would not be an issue with humans as we are slower than a Labrador!
 There's a lot to like about the Blink outdoor camera.  It's small and produces a nice picture.  At first, I liked the Blink system so much, I recommended it to friends.  Now I regret it.  After only six months, the sync module (the smaller box that wirelessly connects to your home network) has become flaky.  The sync module constantly goes offline.  The Blink support community page is filled with complaints about this. Apparently, the Blink module cannot automatically recover from even the slightest internet outage.  The temporary fix is to reboot both the sync module and the router.  That's kind of hard to do when you're not at home.<br/><br/>**UPDATE 12/12/2018**  Whatever issues the Blink camera was having staying on line have been resolved (at least for me).  The camera is now stable and has had a solid connection with Blink servers for a month now.
 Indoor/outdoor Blink XT review. I already have several IP cameras (purchased on Amazon), but was interested in a completely wireless IP cam. I chose BLINK based on the many described features. Difficult to rate this review. If I could, I’d rate this as 3-1/2 stars. Video quality and sound quality that gets picked up is perfect for me.<br/><br/>TIME LAG: if somebody walks within the camera’s field of view, you will not see this activity for a good 5 seconds. All of my other IP Cams are real time—there is absolutely no waiting to see what is going on. With Blink, if somebody is running by, I doubt you’ll see anything in the video. There is a setting to stop motion alert videos if activity stops. There’s also a beta function to pick which areas of the camera view should be ignored. For example, I clicked on the parts of the grid that included my palm tree. Now when the wind blows (a few times a year), the cam will not record the leaves moving.<br/><br/>ALEXA INTEGRATION &amp; BUFFERING: I used the Alexa app to run the Blink Skill. I can say, “Alexa, show me the driveway,” which I think is really cool! With the TV on and connected to my Amazon Fire TV box, the TV screen switches to the Blink image... up to 10 seconds later while you see “waiting for Blink.” Even then, it automatically closes 60 to 90 seconds later. Not sure why there is any buffering, but there can be.  I’ve never seen my TV buffer while I’m watching streamed content (watching an Amazon movie or listening to Amazon music on TV).<br/><br/>MISLEADING DESCRIPTION*: you cannot “monitor” camera activity for longer than 30 seconds or so—the so-called Live View. The camera will either become unavailable or you have to click “continue” to, um, continue watching. I don’t want to stand by clicking “continue” repeatedly. I ordered this to be able to glance at my iPad to make sure the children are doing okay in the backyard while I was cooking. I can’t cook and click at the same time over-and-over. One of the product’s images includes children playing outside with a dog, which I find grossly misleading.<br/><br/>USER MANUEL &amp; INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS stop short on explaining anything. The video tutorials explain how to enable this and that, but do not explain the basic functions. What does it mean to arm or disarm the camera? I am attaching a screenshot of the camera armed but offline. So much for that. While I understand what “sensitivity” means, new camera users may not. Why not explain everything? People who already know can move on.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe is not being able to keep Live View on, and there is no date or timestamp on the videos. That and the fact that the app closes itself after a minute or so on both my iPad and Android cellphone. It should stay open as my other camera apps do. I’m not even going to ask why there’s a password printed on the back of the module. It is not mentioned anywhere.<br/><br/>Final rambles ... The back of the camera is a real pain to get off. If you have long nails forget it. You’ll break your nails taking the cover off to check or change the batteries. I don’t understand why the company makes it such a hassle. Needs to be redesigned.<br/><br/>(*) “Check back in with live HD video and audio streaming right on your smartphone from any of your up-to 10 Blink cameras per system.”
 First Impressions<br/>The box and overall packaging of the product is amazing very nicely finished everything is well organized in the box and securely packed. The cameras come with a protective cover on them as well. Everything is in its own package and neat. Nothing is just floating around.<br/><br/>Set up is very easy. Everything scans with a QR code for simple syncing with the app.  The module takes about 10 minutes to update and sort itself out. The cameras link up and update the firmware in about two minutes.<br/><br/>Installing and aiming the cameras is a breeze with the app allowing you see the perfect angles.<br/><br/>Initial Pros<br/>The images are very clear during day light.<br/>Clear instructions.<br/>Super easy set up.<br/>Look great.<br/><br/>Initial Cons<br/>Reach of the sync module is far from 100ft, at 40ft the signal is weak and at 50ft non existent in a frame and stucco house.<br/>The mounting brackets are rather flimsy, work well but just don’t feel secure.<br/>Night vision is not half as good as the day time pictures, I don’t expect them to be but I expected much better than what the reality is. Especially with the night time being when people like to break into cars and such.<br/>Motion detection could be better straight on.
 I bought these and the Ring doorbell at the same time to see which one I liked better. I returned the Ring and stayed with these cameras.<br/><br/>For the same price you get 2 cameras. I have one set up in the back door and one for the front door. They work very well with adjustable motion settings, length of video etc. they often will stop the recording early when motion stops which is nice. The mounts are plastic but allow for articulation in any direction for the camera. I would place them out if reach as someone could just snap off the camera - though it would be caught on video.<br/><br/>The app is nicely thought out and simple. It allows for easy adjustment and sends notifications right to your phone. You can disable motion on one or all of your cameras with a tap if you are say going to play in the backyard.<br/><br/>The notification comes in slightly delayed from real time (5-10) seconds but for me these don’t need to be realtime.<br/><br/>The set up is a snap and The cameras seem to have great range with the WiFi. I was surprised.<br/><br/>Video quality is very good both day and night. Obviously at night it’s not as good as day because visual cues simply aren’t as available as during normal light. Still very good with the IR.<br/><br/>The only downside I can see thus are is if the battery life is short. I’ve had mine set up 2 weeks now and the app still says the battery is “OK”. I’ll update as we go. However my logic was even if I spend a few bucks on batteries it’s still a wash or better because these have free cloud storage.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Good little cameras for the money. Quick motion detection and fast alerts.
 Reasonably good installation is relatively easy but it takes some effort to get everything dialed-in.  Manufacturing quality is excellent would recommend a third-party bracket/enclosure for mounting outdoors. The one provided for the camera appears flimsy but may work for some applications.  Placement is everything since it has limited range but adequate enough for a smaller to a medium size home.<br/><br/>Plus;  Ease of installation, small size, no wiring required.  Picture quality, motion detection, night vision and sound is excellent.  Zero recurring monthly fees.  Support community is very active you will rely on it.<br/><br/>Minus; Quirky installation can be frustrating, the UI is dated and needs to be improved.  Intermittent issues connecting to the Blink cloud.  Recommend a robust router if you're using a dated router you will have some issues.<br/>No ability to monitor or adjust settings from PC having a spare inexpensive dedicated Android tablet as a permanent monitoring station and control point is recommended.  Disappointed I cannot manage to link to my second generation Alexa enabled FireTV supposedly it's supported but could not get it to work yet.<br/><br/>I would cautiously recommend it okay if your tech-savvy and can deal with the installation process. Works fine when everything is correctly set-up.  At the price point it's a robust offering filled with features and again the picture quality is excellent.  Worth consideration.
 Been a little over a week since I set this camera (Blink XT) up to watch the driveway.  What a piece of cake to setup - just remember to record the numbers on the back of each module (A+).  Can't beat the FREE cloud storage, and that is key. You see so many cameras that have internal SD card storage. Internal storage doesn't help with an external camera that can be plucked off the mount (A+). Now for the down side. First, the default recordings are 5 seconds, which isn't a big problem, but there doesn't seem to be a pre-event buffer, so you see half a second of event (motion trip) and 4.5 seconds of whatever happens after the trip. If sensitivity is set low, you may see 4.5 seconds of nothing. I have a Ring doorbell and they have a 5 second pre-event buffer and that works really well. So C- for the clip, although to be fair, it is good quality (of mostly nothing). So you say, just set sensitivity higher and catch the event in the distance, well there are no motion zones, so anything in the picture can trigger it. I'm watching the driveway and I don't want traffic on the street to trip the camera, so I have to set sensitivity way down (D-).  All this camera needs to do to be a winner is a add a pre-event buffer and motion zones.  Hopefully coming soon.
 Installation was a breeze.  However the video is anything but high quality, and isn't that the reason you buy a security camera.  The playback has an annoying clicking/ticking sound.  I reported it to support; their response was "This ticking sound is due to the hardware moving inside when the camera is recording or trying to record. This ticking sound is actually normal specially for XT (outdoor) cameras."  It you expected to hear audio on your recordings, you will be disappointed.  Kudo's for adding infrared camera capability unfortunately, even on the least intense setting, people's faces are totally washed out.  The motion sensing is virtually worthless.  By the time a person walking up to our doorstep or driveway is detected and the camera activated, the person has walked out of frame.  Finally, I installed the system on November 12, 2017.  Today, January 15, 2018 I had to replace the batteries in the driveway camera.  Not exactly "two years" of battery life, more like two months.
 It's always a pleasant surprise when a product delivers exactly what it promises. The setup, installation, and first couple of weeks of use have gone flawlessly. The automatic "arming" of the alerts has occurred without a glitch and the automatic movement detection and video recording at each camera (two outside and one inside) seems to have always worked.<br/><br/>At this point it's too early to comment on the battery life in each camera. But the fact that these are wireless and small made it easy to find locations to install them. The mount seems too simple, but actually they are well designed and enable any orientation needed; Just a single screw!<br/><br/>It's cool that you can select the resolution, but actually all of the settings provide really decent images.<br/><br/>A couple of improvements would be good:<br/>- Currently, it appears the only way to record video when there is movement is to have the entire system "armed". But then you get an alert every time. I'd like a "day time" level, where the video records activity but doesn't send an alert. Then I can review activity during the day as needed. Also, "armed" should be selectable by camera; Right now it's either all or none.<br/>- It would be nice to have the system automatically take a daily snapshot. You can do this manually, so that when you're reviewing the camera list you can see what the camera view is. But it can be disconcerting to see the snapshot that may be quite old and think something is amiss. Or, at least, the age of the picture should be shown. (The other day I thought my car was stolen from my driveway -- I'd forgotten that when I installed the camera and done the manual snapshot, it was in the garage! Yeah, a simple refresh took care of it, but still...)
 I have an Arlo Q and Arlo Pro system. This is very somewhat comparable. The Arlo app is slightly more advanced with trigger zones and zoom for videos. The Arlo Pro really sucks for motion sensing. You often will record too late missing the beginning of the action.  The Blink seems much better.<br/><br/>Where the Blink wins is battery life. The Arlo battery life is terrible using expensive batteries. You can enable 1080p "enhanced" mode on Blink, but it will drop battery life in half to 1 year. That's funny because my Arlo battery life is only 30-40 days for the same amount of recording. So one year sounds pretty damn good.<br/><br/>I don't like the mounting brackets on the Blink. Very flimsy and feels like a strong wind or accidental bump from a bird would snap it off. I also wish it had defined trigger zones like the wired Arlo Q so that I can point at street and not have passing cars trigger recording. Instead, I have to face the cameras sideways away from street. Still, the Blink is so easy to set up it's ridiculous. Good job on that.<br/><br/>Now onto the bad part.  It worked fine for 3 days, then suddenly stopped recording.  Snapshots wouldn't work.  Would always say "thumbnail failed."  Oddly, live view worked fine.  Cameras to wifi 5 bars.  Cameras to sync module 5 bars.  Sync module to wifi 5 bars. So all vital signs are strong.  Once it gets into this stuck mode, it cannot trigger recording ever again.  After I wasted a lot of time, I was able to reset the system by:<br/>1) delete all the cameras from sync module<br/>2) delete the sync module<br/>3) reset the sync module with paper clip press and start over setting up new system in the app<br/>4) add cameras back<br/><br/>This sequence fixed it.  However, having to do this does not sound great to me, and googling will show you many people with this same issue.  Not sure how I feel about longevity of the Blink XT system, but when it works, it works great.
 It worked flawlessly for two weeks. And then it died. To fix it I am supposed to take the batteries out and reboot. The whole point of the device is that it is supposed to be reliable. You’ve seen the video. The device is tucked away. Oh... they don’t show that you need to be onsite to reboot it... so sorry we advertised this was reliable for going away for a weekend.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R2FIIRO0Z3595L"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sUIfiumbS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615UvM0Q7LS.png"/> I’m torn between loving this security camera and hating it. I love it because it does what it’s supposed to. When the camera is “armed” it starts to record when it senses movement. I hate it because the battery does NOT last 2 years like it’s advertised. I had to decrease the sensitivity tab because it drains the battery. But by doing that - the camera doesn’t always catch what triggered the motion.  I emailed amazon about this issue, and they told me to return the one I have and buy a new one BUT all the blink cameras were sold out and wouldn’t be in stock for some time because amazon had some sort of sale. Overall,  I do like this camera syatem. I just hate having to climb up on my ladder every 3-4 weeks to replace twelve batteries.
 - Camera triggers constantly even when there is no motion and when there is motion, doesn't get captured<br/>- Goes through batteries very  fast - 2 years is a joke, maybe a month at best with very limited use. I had to buy a long cord and basically run it inside on electricity<br/>- No ability to back up clips to your cloud storage. Blink provided storage is a joke, I used up mine in 3 days and then all the old clips got deleted<br/>- Can't download multiple clips at a time so you have to do each one by one which takes ages<br/>- In the new OS, you can't scrub the clips because there is an overlay. This means you have to watch each clip in full<br/>- Camera will randomly stop capturing motion then half a day later will suddenly capture a bunch of useless clips with nothing in them<br/>- Instead of useful features...such as the ability to back up clips on drop box/cloud etc or the ability to download multiple clips, the company decided to add Zones?!<br/><br/>Please fix the basics first and stop with the bells and whistles especially ones that barely work.  The reviews are right that it's easy to set up. However if the product doesn't actually work then the easy setup doesn't really help.
 It captures and record movement depending how long you set it to record. Its captures the video and record it then send you notification or you can watch live feed if you just want to see what’s going on. I believe thats why it’s called blink. It records good 720 quality video. Its easy to install. Pretty decent size. Easy to follow instruction. Note: make sure you follow instructions when installing cause its really sensitive to movement. It will tell you what to avoid. We are happy with the purchase.
 I will update once fixed, but as of now, 1 star.<br/><br/> I ordered 2 Blink XT cameras to install outside under my eves to monitor my driveway and front door. Once installed they worked flawlessly, for 18 hours. The one camera is still fine, but the others night vision just stopped working entirely. I have contacted customer service twice, the first person just completely had not idea what I was saying, the night vision isn't working, and they sent me a list of stuff to fix the motion detection, which was working fine other than in the dark. The customer service takes far too long to get back to you especially when their products are something people rely on for home security.
 I bought them for the wireless feature to monitor outdoor activities. I don’t think they work as expected. When high sensitivity was turned on, it captures every little movement (leaves, far away people, light changes) from 30+ feet away, but fails to captue the close movements within 10 feet. So, I either get a ton of false alerts or miss the actions that should have been captured. Also, like others mentioned, the motion sensor has some delays, not triggered fast enough. The night vision does not seem to work (pitch dark from the videos recorded).
 IT EATS BATTERIES.  I've played with all the parameters to minimize the usage such as  sensitivity, retrigger time,  and clip length with no improvement. They suggest lithium batteries, but it just ate a pair of them faster than the last pair of alkaline batteries. The range is very short. I cannot put it outside where I need it.  I am not satisfied with this purchase. I cannot make it work like I need it to. The bottom line is that "battery operated" is a total farce.
 Since the camera has good digital resolution I was expecting a better picture. The camera has a very wide angle view. The result is that objects appear very small and the digital resolution doesn't help much. If for example a car passed by I would like to have been able to read the license plate if necessary, but no, that's not going to happen. I noticed that it can a long time to take a picture. I timed some pictures to take 15 seconds to appear on my phone. Also the motion detection can also be very slow. I've had many videos where the passing car was almost out of view before the camera started the video. I will probably just use this camera at the front door so I can see who is ringing the bell. Other than that I don't think it's good for much. I'm returning the extra two I bought before I noticed the poor performance. If you think that maybe you can document bad behavior from people coming on your property you probably won't be able to offer the police any usable evidence.
 I have enjoyed using one as a critter cam. Works OK for capturing wildlife outside or whatever. You won't be  putting any bad guys in jail however as the resolution is low and the compression is fairly high. They falsely advertise these as HD but it's actually only 720p video which for a fish eye lens is pretty useless for identifying faces or license plates. 4k is HD, 1080p is medium and 720 is low people. this isn't 1995.  I've contacted tech support twice and they did not respond to either issue.<br/>Pros: quick setup, comes with lithium battery. Cloud based recording is free. Camera seems stable, no need to reboot after 1 week in rain. Good range with extender included. Motion detection has been good and you can configure zones and sensitivity.<br/>Cons: Very expensive for a low res outdoor camera.  low resolution, distorted fish eye lens, cannot used in rain without a cover  as image is blocked by even a tiny drop of water. Tech support is usual non-english speaking by email and slow to respond. When they do respond the answers are canned and they are really there for knuckle heads, not for solving actual technical problems. (this is normal with consumer products however) . You have to use a repeater thingy so this will occupy an outlet somewhere in your house.<br/><br/>update1: supposedly if you set the camera to high quality, it does 1080p. i tried. this introduced a band of noise across the bottom of the image but otherwise there was no change in quality.<br/>update2: the lithium batteries included lasted 3 weeks with occasional use.
 Even though our condominium has security entrances/exits, I wanted some added protection for my unit just in case of a break-in.  After reading the various reviews on Amazon, as well as from other sources, I decided to get the Blink XT, especially since you don't have to pay a monthly fee for their cloud service.  I have two Blinks, one is monitoring my main entrance door and the other overlooks my balcony door on the outside.<br/><br/>The system is very easy to setup, to connect to your home wifi, and mount, once you decide on the area that needs monitoring.  I also made a bracket which attaches to the included mount, so I'm now able to adjust the direction of the camera up/down and swivel it to the left/right.  The iPhone app has also been working well and I've been able to check my unit and arm/disarm the cameras while I'm traveling or away from home.  Adjusting the motion detector sensitivity may take some trial and error, but there isn't a lot of activity in the areas that I'm monitoring so I haven't had too many false alarms.  The cameras can be powered by lithium batteries, but it also has the option to power it via USB through an electrical outlet.  Although, you would need to buy the USB cable and power outlet.  I tried using the power outlet from my iPhone along with an appropriate USB cable and it seems to work.  Although, I'm using them with the batteries at present.<br/><br/>A couple of added features that I wish it had are the ability to manually save photos and videos, since the videos are only saved to the cloud when the motion detector is triggered.  It only has one way audio, so you can hear the audio that the device picks up, but cannot send audio.
 That's a lie. The battery does not last 2 years nothing. Only if you put it on and turn off the camera then it lasts 2 years. I bought 3 cameras, and supposedly the camera is to detect movements and activate, everything else works well are very good, but it is a lie that the battery lasts 2 years, I have to change it every 10 days or so. Then I wrote to Blink and they told me to reduce the Clik of movements and decrease the sensibility of detection, and I say, so for the hell they say it lasts 2 years, specify that it lasts 2 years if the camera is set and almost not working.It is true that the camera is good. But it is a lie and a deceit to the consumer to tell them that it lasts 2 years. Also the reactivation time is very long 10 seconds is a long time. I have to put new batteries every 2 weeks. I'm going to have to ask for a personal loan from Bank of America to be able to pay for batteries.
 I am very dissatisfied with this camera. I’ve had it for 6 months and decided to warn others against it.  On the plus side: very easy to install and set up, clear video during the day, decent video at night, no monthly fees.  However, the camera is very slow to wake up and often catches movement after it has happened (a car has already passed for example and gets the tail lights).  I have it over my garage and someone can walk half way up my driveway before it starts recording.  Thankfully I don’t have a lot of crime around me. If I really needed it for evidence, it would be useless.  The other poor thing is the mount. The hinge is loose and can’t be tightened anymore. On more than one occasion the camera has tipped all the way over so that it is pointing straight down to the ground. My husband has tried to tighten it to no avail. All in all, this camera is very poor. I would not recommend it at all. Go with Ring. I wish I had and still might.
 At first I was pleased with how the Bink system works.  It was quick and easy to set up.  Then, about 18 hours after I it was set up, the sync module went off line.  Essentially, it was no longer communicating with my wifi.  I tried moving it closer to my wifi router, followed the instructions for performing a Hard Reset.  Nothing worked.  Then, I discovered that when you press on the link for support in the Blink app, you get "Oops, this page does not exist."  There is no way to contact support from the Blink app.  I went to my PC and to the Blink site and discovered that there are no phone numbers for support.  Only email support.<br/><br/>I submitted an the problem through email and detailed all of the troubleshooting steps I took, and, to their credit, they responded with an hour.  However, in their response they basically wanted me to perform all of the steps I had already performed.  Okay, I did them again with the same result and then reported back.  Their response was to perform a Factory Reset of the sync module.  Even though I had already done that before and told them that I did, I did it again.  And of course, it's still not working.<br/><br/>The solution is to replace the sync module but after my last response telling them that the Factory Reset didn't work, there hasn't been a reply.  I will wait a few more hours but if there isn't a response that they are replacing the sync module, I'm sending it all back and getting a refund.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I received the replacement Sync module and now everything is up and working.  This week, Amazon had a sale where i could purchased the starter system for less that the price of an add-on Outdoor camera and even less then what I paid for the current starter system I purchased so I ordered another system.  I'll add the camera to my existing system and keep the sync module as a spare.  The only reason that it isn't 5 stars at this point is due to the difficulty in getting support.  Support pages don't work through the app and you really have to search online to find support info.  Still know phone number - email only.
 This is my first home security camera system and so far it has worked very well. It isn't 100% though and there are some definite pros and cons to consider.<br/><br/>All in all I would recommend this to others, but would also caution of some of the gotchas below.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Setup was super easy. Install app, set up base, set up cameras, install cameras. Done.<br/>2. Having free online storage (limited though it may be) is great.<br/>3. App is pretty easy to use, more of a pro than a con here.<br/>4. Nice to have everything included: mounts, batteries, etc. Can get up and running in less than 30min.<br/>5. Video quality and handling of lighting seems pretty excellent. I get good picture at night and during the day. Resolution is a bit of a con though (below).<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. No web view available. This is app-only for now. There is a thread on their support forum where people have been requesting this for a year and a half... don't know why they can't prioritize such an obvious feature.<br/>2. Adds a to my daily routine. I have to open the app and watch and delete unneeded clips. This takes time from my day.<br/>3. Requires tuning to get the video captures right ... I've found that it requires tuning to get the videos needed for my home and application.<br/>4. Provided mounts are junk. They are flimsy, made of plastic, and don't hold the camera well and adjusting angles is difficult. The purchase of better mounts is a requirement.<br/>5. Video resolution is low. This may make identification more difficult when suspicious or criminal activity is recorded.
 Installed one unit about two weeks ago. It works so far. A lot of things can be improved.<br/>1. The motion sensor starting point is not consistent. Need careful set up. Change the Sensitivity for trigger to slow or too much, use the Activity Zones to block unneeded area in the camera view photo to reduce the interferences... Using the Help in the software to familiar with how to set up the system for your site and application.<br/>2. The 110 degree view range is not wide enough compare to some other products but may good for some application.<br/>3. The night video is not good enough for a clear video even setting at the highest level.<br/>4. User manual may be mention that for best connections between the WiFi router-Sync Module-Camera, locate the Sync Module half way between the router and camera, make sure the router is straight up and facing the camera. Avoid metal subject between the path.<br/>5. The setting should have a option to allow to instantly showing the alerting video on the phone immediately instead of open the software, tap the file folder, then tap the latest file to play.
 These cameras are amazing, but I get a pronounced ticking/clicking from one of the cameras audio feeds.  It's INCREDIBLY annoying to hear this *tick-tick-tick-buzzzz tick-tick-tick buzzz* from my front porch camera.  Additionally, the hub itself emits a high pitch whistle barely detectable by my ears but very irritating to my dog.  When I googled it, I discovered that Blink's official position on the ticking/whistling noises is that it's normal.  If it were normal, why does one camera work perfectly silently?  But unfortunately, I know companies well enough to know my issue isn't worth bringing up.  They'll make up an excuse and explain away the low quality issues instead of assisting me.  In the end, I'm of the opinion that this is a great product, but it needs some improvement, and I'm sure, given the whole "it's normal" statement, that Blink doesn't actually care about improving their products at this time.<br/><br/>The app also could use some improvement.  My chief complaint in the software lies in the inability to disarm individual cameras.  It would be nice if I could hang out in my backyard, turn off notifications from my back yard camera, and still get notifications from the front door.  It's either disarm all cameras, or none.  Because I sit on my back porch at night while winding down for bed, I have to disarm all of my cameras in order to avoid my phone blowing up with excessive notifications.  Then, I often go to bed, forgetting to rearm the cameras.  Totally defeats the entire purpose of having a security camera system.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you're looking for a perfect home security system, look elsewhere. But if you're look for a decent system without running wires, this may be your best bet.<br/><br/>*Update.* At this point I'm 4 months in to ownership.  The app now offers the ability to disable specific cameras by tapping the icon that resembles a running man.  I would still like to see Windows support.  Additionally the files are saved in a strange encoding issue that makes it impossible to share online without converting to .Avi.  not sure why.
 The system itself is sub par.  Slow response to motion (footage starts too late). Despite being an outdoor camera, constantly picks up slight grass / bush movement (not talking about windy days).<br/><br/>The real kicker, though, is the HORRIBLE support. Putting aside the constant contradictions, vague answers, and lazy reading... It takes multiple days between each response.  And the ticketing system is the only form of support.<br/><br/>Basically... Blink XT isn't ready and neither is the company behind it.
 I bought a outdoor camera on July 2017 and the plastic lens for night vision deteriorated from the sun, and broke causing camera to fail. Customer service said it was my problem and the warranty is up. I will never buy another Blink product because they do not stand behind them.
 I installed it next o my front door.  It is a well lit area.  The quality of picture/video is horrible.  Everything shows up as white.  I set the resolution to the highest but didn't help.  In a dark area it works fine.  I am attaching a picture as an example
 Zero stars... and I rarely dislike items I purchase on Amazon because I research, read reviews, etc BUT Blink (and Amazon) completely omit 1 very important fact ANYWHERE in the description / specifications that YOU CANNOT use this camera system to CONTINUOUSLY view. Yes, it has a live-view feature that lasts mere seconds, until a prompt asks 'continue' once or maybe twice often actually showing you a 5 second video clip just recorded.<br/>Then you have to exit the app, restart the app to get another few seconds of 'live view.'<br/>This process can take minutes. 15 max live view, then 2 minutes of restating etc.<br/>I literally watched 2 people walk into my yard.... (restart needed after 10  seconds of semi live view) .... and then observed my backyard missing a secured, expensive bicycle.<br/>BOTTOM LINE: affordable sort of useful,  NOT continuously viewable camera that might capture a crime at your residence.<br/>Sidenote: batteries barely lasted 2 months.
 Let's just go with pros and cons for this review and conclusion at the end.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>1. Inexpensive for what you get.<br/>2. No monthly fee<br/>3. Free cloud service to store clips<br/>4. HD and looks good for security purposes.<br/>5. Records audio.<br/>6. Super easy to setup and install<br/>7. App works really well and easy to use.<br/>8. No wires, place it anywhere inside or out.<br/>9. Wifi connectivity strong for me in all areas cameras are placed.<br/>10. Weather proof.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>1. Can easily be stolen as the camera snaps into the backing. The backing is screwed where you want and the camera then snaps onto it. If the camera is within reach, someone can simply grab the camera and pull it down or steal it. Better to place high enough so no one can reach it if possible.<br/><br/>2.  If you lose power you lose the system. The cameras are battery powered which is a big positive. However, the hub is not battery operated and needs to be plugged in. If power is lost or cut, the cameras cant talk to the hub and you cant see your system. Being that this is a wifi system, any loss of internet or power and this system is not usable.<br/><br/>In conclusion. This is an great little system without monthly fees to help secure and watch over your home or business. You can watch from your smartphone anywhere. Easy to use and setup with lots of in app options to change settings like sensitivity, video quality, audio on or off, clip length, ect...  I am happy with my purchase and feel more secure as i can check on my home from anywhere at anytime.
 Ok, these are super easy to set up. Video quality is pretty good, motion capture is good, slightly delayed, but not bad. Caught kids riding bikes around my car in my driveway already!<br/>Now, the mounting system is horrible. I think it was an afterthought, whoops, we made this sleek small camera, but how do we mount it. Well, if we jam this plastic thing in the removable door, that should work. How hard would it have been to add a standard 1/4-28 nut insert in the thing? Bottom line here, buy the aftermarket mount that holds the entire camera.<br/>I see other complaints about the app, but looks like they fixed them, like new photo or camera name is easily changed.<br/><br/>After using this for a month, i have to drop one star. I thought I could live without a web version, but it is such a pain. I get alerts at work, and can't view them on my phone simply because reception is poor in the building.  Why in the world Blink would not provide a web portal is beyond me, they seem to be more concerned about contests and marketing than making a very usable product. I mean really, everyone already has an account, what would it take someone to build a basic web portal, 4 hours?<br/><br/>Ok, i'm adding another star back only because of the last software update.  The motion masking option now makes these cameras pretty darn good. My false alarms have dropped by 80%, i'm able to point the cameras out further now, and turn the sensitivity up.  Hey Blink, you want 5 stars, get a web portal set up. Thats my only complaint now.
 We hooked up 3 indoor blinks and the process was super easy. My biggest complaint is that you can’t live scan a room like our vimtags cameras. My 2nd complaint is that in order to get a night time photo the light flashes so bright that everyone will know they are being recorded and the picture still isn’t clear enough to see who the person is. Overall, it’s a simple system that can do what you need it to do. Just hoping to spy at night but won’t be doing that with such a bright light flashing. My vimtags picture at night is perfectly clear with no flash but changing WiFi password in them is a huge pain
 Set up was a breeze and the camera is small and discrete. The mount is super easy to mount but very flimsy.  the biggest problem i'm having is the motion detector isn't picking up everything and i have it on enhanced mode which should be the best. I don't care about battery life but I've replaced batteries 3 nights in a row and every night i get a warning that i have low batteries. the 3rd time i replaced them i bought a new pack of double As to make sure i didn't have bad batteries. I only get clips that are sometimes 9 seconds long and shorter and only occasionally get the actual amount of video i requested in the app being 45 seconds long with the "end video clip early if motion stops" box unchecked. I have 1 Blink indoor and 1 Blink XT and the motion detectors on these these are spotty. The indoors motion detector doesnt work and the outdoors one only gets it 80% of the time. I also get a lot of late motion from the camera where i will see a car drive by but only see the bumper for the first second and then its gone. At first i thought it could be the speed of the cars is to fast but once it started doing it for people I knew it was just the sensors fault. These objects are about 20ft away from the camera i have outside. In the end these cameras are pretty cheap and i read a lot of mixed reviews.
 This is a great camera for my needs - right priced (bought on sale, not full price), quick install and works. It does exactly what it says it does, although time will tell about the two year battery life.  Now - this is not a full surveillance system - meaning that it is not continuous streaming and recording video. If it is triggered by motion it records for 5 seconds (time can be adjusted for greater length, I set mine for 10 seconds).  So, this is great for me to see who walked up to my door or who entered my driveway (which was my goal).  If you need continual live video, select another system which will have to be wired/powered. You must go to the app on your mobile device to see recording, no computer/browser viewing. You can probably setup on Android TV or Fire TV as well but I have not looked into it.  Bottom line, this is an easy wireless system, especially for outdoor use.  For indoor, I may have gone cheaper with the Wyze (or similar) cameras but only if the USB connection was convienient.
 I got this for my front porch. Unfortunately, the camera's contrast or light-sensitivity settings are way to high. In the day time, faces are completely indistinguishable because of the daylight in the background. At night, the IR washes out the faces completely. This makes it pretty useless as a security camera. I tried removing and reinstalling the batteries as several forums suggested, but it didn't help.
 For the price this is the best thing on the market for truly wireless cameras. Super easy to setup.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Free cloud storage. That saves me real money. Until amazon gets enough subscribers that they start charging.<br/>Decent night vision<br/>Audio and live audio<br/>Not at CR123 battery.<br/>Decent mounting bracket<br/>Color during the day is pretty good<br/>App interfeace is really well thought out. Simple. Nice work<br/>Like that you can see a small picture of the beginning of the video in the storage area<br/>Helps with identifying if the video is worth watching<br/><br/>Cons<br/>No way to select motion areas or deny motion areas. Motion sensing works so so. If u are looking at a huge area plan for some issues. If u will have this in a tight area should work fine. By issues I mean there will be variability in when it triggers.<br/>Birds set this off and I expected that but would be nice to be able to select zones for motion.<br/>This is not a high end camera by any means but does give the view I have been wanting and I can use it in tandem with my other security cameras.<br/>View is a little distorted but not bad just at the edges.
 Set-up on a device like this should be straight forward, it was until I tried to copy the software chosen password (can't see the whole thing on your phone) and it just moved forward in the set-up. Now not knowing the password to set-up the app to control the device, I'm stuck. No fewer than four times I've submitted for a password change, not one e-mail back. Would have liked to have more devices, but it seems I'll never even get the first operational.
 Purchased Blink XT 5 camera system during 2018 Thanksgiving break. Initially setup one camera in a high traffic area to see if met my expectations. Btw, my expectations are high regardless how much money paid for a product.<br/>Installation was simple as I used the supplied bracket. Aimed camera at Driveway/Street to identify motion from people and cars. I rate the camera B for decent clarity during the day. At night the camera picked up a car driving by house, but couldnt identify type of car or shape(length or height). Image was blurry, showing only headlights. The distance of camera from street is approximately 25 yards. Fast forward to December 20th, camera didnt pickup car parked in driveway, nor the individual getting out the car. Adjusted the sensitivity and still no detection. Discovered the sync module has two bar wireless connection. So I will place a wifi extender towards the camera area to see if detection improves. If doesnt improve, I'm returning back to Amazon and look for another system.
 I have bought several wifi enabled cameras within the past five years, but they have all been indoor cameras. The Blink was the first outdoor Wifi camera. I have a wired surveillance system for my barn, shed, driveway, etc. Overall, I would say this is a great little camera for the price. Things that need improvement or are lacking all together include a zoom feature, wireless connectivity in terms of range (you cannot place it very far from your router), and a longer battery life. Although it is not difficult to replace the 2 AA batteries, there is no way in hell they last for 2 years unless maybe you disable the night vision and the motion sensor. I love the fact that my home Wifi might get disabled because of a power outage, but it does not affect the camera at all, it just reboots itself and begins where it left off. That is a major plus! I have other indoor Wifi cameras that once the power goes out, they do not begin working right afterwards, which is a pain when you are out of town! But anyways, overall I really like this Blink camera and plan on getting another very soon!
 I really wanted to like this camera. First of all, I'm not comparing this directly to any of our Nest Cams, which are in all respects except lack of battery option far superior. Still, I think I was spoiled my my experience with those. Here are the issues we've had:<br/><br/>  - Flaky connection. Either the camera hardware or the phone software are the cause of a flaky connection, where sometimes if I click the video button I get a loading spinner for a while before it gives up. It's not a wireless connectivity issue -- it happens if the camera is directly next to both our wireless router and the Blink sync module.<br/><br/>  - Bad wireless range. I'm currently testing out this device *directly* next to both our wireless router and the Blink sync module. They're all within 2 unobstructed feet of each other. But what I wanted was to use this "outdoor" camera outside. Unfortunately, it loses its connection if I go about 10 12 feet away, through one exterior wall/door. Contrast this to my Nest Cam (darn, I said I wasn't comparing them directly but it's hard in this case) which connects successfully over about 25 feet through an exterior wall.<br/><br/>  - Lack of ability to view the video stream on the web. You can only view it in the mobile app.<br/><br/>  - Lack of ability to have continuous streaming. It's "clip" based, and clips (default to something like 15 seconds) only activate when the camera is "armed". What we would have preferred is continuous streaming when armed. I guess this is probably impossible with a battery-based setup, but it's hard to stomach after our experience with the Nest Cam (there I go again).<br/><br/>Based on our experience so far, three stars is pretty generous. I can discount some of the feature inferiority, but not the flakiness.
 Battery Life is NOT 2 years!  We have it on the front of our house.  It says to to only turn it on when you are not home to preserve battery life- AFTER you kill the battery and get a high usage alert.  Well, we only use it when we are away or sleeping, so just the pulling in and out of our driveway and the occassional neighborhood cat trip the camera.  The sensitivity is ridiculous.  It doesn’t capture motion until a second or two after the motion is detected.  Example: our mailbox is on our house, 20 ft from the sidewalk.  By the time the camera registers the mail delivery approaching our house all you see is the top if their head, and then they are out of frame.  Then when they leave it doesn’t pick up until they’re approaching the sidewalk.  Of course this is what they’re back to the house and the camera, so if this was somebody trespassing, vandalizing, or burglerizing our home, we would not be able to identify anything except the precise time that if occurred.  Additionally,  if we get an alert that there’s somebody is on our property we cannot watch the live view while the camera is recording. So we have to wait for the camera to finish recording before we can contact the police and tell them what’s happening.  Also, the price- I bought 1 camera for $69 and it came with a new echo dot.  Now the price is $129 and it comes with NOTHING. That is a steep jump in price.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-RND5VJ56IWE6R"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816Wn5OzSyS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61H2nkI381S.png"/> At first glance and setup I thought the blink cameras would be a great security addition to my home, I liked them. Within a month one camera (regardless of settings) would go into a malfunctioning state of internal shutter 'clicking' at which point the camera would continuously try to record video until it killed the battery (see video). At this point I would receive continuous notifications to my phone and the video would not play at all.<br/>I immediately contacted customer support, as the temp and connections were not the issue. After days and days of back and forth asking for video proof and on and on we are in a stale mate in which they refuse to replace a 30-40 day camera. STEER CLEAR!!! Customer service is awful, complete waste of time an a LOT OF $$$. I will be going to ARLO. Please not the seller attempted to help me contact BLINK due to it being just past the return window, I do not blame the seller.
 I have been using these cameras for a little over two months. The quality of the video is very nice. The quality of sound not so much, but that is not very important. I love the fact that there are no cables, and you can mount them anywhere. As to the batteries lasting two years, I don’t know where the hermit lived that provided those test results!  I have already had to replace the batteries once, but I’m not complaining. It picks up everything I need to see. My two complaints about this product: 1) It can take up to two minutes for you to be notified of any movement, so by the time you know, it is too late to act. 2)  you cannot use live view when the camera is recording, so if you want to look at something that is happening, you have to wait until the video has been uploaded to the cloud.  Overall still a good product that I would recommend to anyone interested in a inexpensive home security camera system.
 If your buying these for outdoors. DONT! they are not weather proof. I had mine for less than a year and even with the silicone cover on it, it got moisture inside the eye of the camera and now can’t get a clear picture. I contacted blink and they are under warranty but you can buy another for 50% off because they don’t cover moisture??? Lol that is what it said WEATHER PROOF exactly why I bought them so find other cameras theses don’t last and they’re very expensive to have to buy over again  because they are not weather proof it a lie and warranty is crap!
 I wouldn't recommend this camera to anyone who does not absolutely needs the wireless camera connection (the module still needs to be plugged in unless using a solar panel.<br/>Yes, being able to place the camera anywhere and move it at will is great when there is no way to connect it to a power source but ...<br/>Because of the limitations imposed by the battery power reserve, there are several major negatives:<br/>- not a good idea to run "live" vision for more than seconds at a time. Using motion detection is best.<br/>- there is no night vision capability, not even low light.<br/>-no zooming<br/>-audio is only one way (you can listen but not talk) and no siren.<br/>Picture quality is no better than my wyze cameras which cost a quarter of the price.<br/>And, importantly, there is no battery status so one cannot tell when the battery is going to run out.<br/><br/>On the plus side, it seems to stay connected through power outage, free cloud storage is nice, installation is effortless.
 UPDATE: I have had my this camera for a little while now. The battery life is pretty good on it. It def. can withstand getting wet. It was in the pouring down rain and didn't even have condensation inside. Taking the back off to put batteries in is quite awkward and it has a delay along w a lack of strong internet connectivity that i get with my Yi cameras. The Yi cameras also offer much better picture quality. I have recently purchased a Yi camera for outside since they have them now. I will deal with the plug in style camera before dealing with some of the quirks with the Blink for around the same price. Yi is a much better quality product, and there are no picture delays, no hesitations when i am pulling up the app....no timing out like the Blink either. You also don't have to have a separate box to connect your camera to the internet with Yi. The camera itself connects to the internet. To me Yi is just a much better product all around.<br/>______________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>It gets the job done I guess. The picture isn't too bad, but it doesn't cover as big of an area as some better cameras, and it is not made as sturdy either. That would be all cool if they would keep the price lower than better cameras, but lately the prices are creeping up.
 Love the concept of an outdoor cam that can run on batteries. The video quality is very good during daylight hours and the array of features are somewhat minimal but adequate. However the camera has proved to be very undependable since I purchased and installed it two months ago. Most of the time I do not receive any notifications of activity. Sometimes the audible notification works but I rarely see the notifications on the app's icon unless I open the app. Today, it has decided not to to work at all despite having a good wifi signal. I have tried the troubleshooting tip of signing out, deleting and reinstalling the app and the system works well for a few hours after I do this and then it quits working again. It's pretty useless for a security cam when it is this undependable.
 Having Ring for a while, i had high hopes from another Amazon branded product - Blink. Forget about being a premium product, this is CHEAP!!! The camera itself looks and feels so flimsy and poor quality and its wall holder is even worse.<br/>Next worst thing is the process of pairing and setting up. It has been soooooo cumbersome and painful, at one of point i thought it was defective. But luckily it started working after couple of attempts of pairing. But the problems didn't stop there.<br/>Attaching the screenshots of various errors i keep getting, even though as you can see the wi-fi signal is 3 out 4 bars!! And i do not understand what it means by system is busy. With just two cameras connected to the hub, how busy can that get?<br/>Not a great product. Definitely not up to the mark of Amazon brand. This should be called a "Flimsy" brand. Currently it "seems" to be working, so not returning it, but the moment it stops, i will return it. Don't have too many hopes that this will last long
 Technical support for this camera has been a nightmare. They persist in taking me down yet another path to troubleshoot the problem.  The problem with the camera is that it doesn't recognize the batteries. There should be no issues with the batteries and with fresh batteries, it doesn't make a bit of difference. I purchased 3 cameras, the other 2 work fine. The cameras were purchased for my brother and are on his account, not mine. There is no way I could recommend Blink cameras. Heck, I was considering buying a couple but will go back to add to my Nest account another camera. An extremely dissatisfied customer - they should just replace the camera.
 This one matches up with the original kit I got as a gift.<br/><br/>I'm updating my review. I just added my third Blink XT camera trying to make up for the limitations of the one camera. No matter how I set the settings I could honestly out run this camera and it won't get a picture of me coming up to the camera. It will know there is motion when I'm three feet in front of a camera that is 8 feet up and it doesn't even get me. There is a reason why the Nest and other cameras cost as much as they do. If you're looking for security go elsewhere. If you're looking to capture the wild life grazing in your back yard buy one of these and hope they get close enough to the camera.
 I've been slowly getting into Home Automation and wanted to add some exterior security cameras that I could integrate with SmartThings.  I didn't want to have to run new electrical lines or have extension cords draped all over, so I was looking at battery powered cameras, specifically Blink and Arlo.  I wound up deciding to go with Blink because (a) it's cheaper and (b) I read far fewer reports about delayed recording starts with Blink.<br/><br/>Currently, I have two of the Blink interior (white) cameras mounted on the exterior of my house in well protected areas (covered front porch, screened-in back porch) as well as an XT/exterior (black) camera mounted where it is subject to the elements.<br/><br/>On the plus side, set up of the cameras was easy and straightforward, and both the audio and video quality are, in my opinion, quite good.  I can't comment on battery life except to say that after slightly under a month of use the cameras are still reporting their battery status as "OK"<br/><br/>On the minus side, I do experience significant delays in recording start times with all of these cameras.  For example, when a neighbor kid recently was watching our dogs while we were out of town, the porch camera didn't start recording until she had walked up the walk to the house, traversed the porch, and had started unlocking the door, at which point she was barely visible on camera.  I finally decided to try an experiment with the exterior camera; I armed it, went outside, walked to about the edge of its field of view, and then ran to the camera, jumped up, and touched it.  It did record, but it actually didn't start until after I was underneath it and hidden from view.  If somebody wanted, they could actually steal my security camera by running up to it like I did, jumping up and grabbing it, and removing the batteries.  The solution, I suppose, would be mounting enough cameras that a stealth approach to one camera would be picked up by another, but that's a lot of cameras and expense.<br/><br/>I'm also disappointed with the SmartThings integration.  That's my fault, as I did insufficient research to determine that while there is a custom device handler which supports Blink, the author charges for it.  Arlo integration with SmartThings can be accomplished free of charge.<br/><br/>I'm still tinkering with placement and sensitivity settings to see if I can get the cameras to work better, and not having used the Arlo cameras, I can't say if they work better or worse, but I am somewhat dissatisfied with my Blink cameras.  On the other hand, in my mind one of the primary benefits of having the security cameras is simply to deter would-be thieves or vandals; why take the chance of being caught on one of my cameras when they can just go to a neighbor's house and have no such concerns.<br/><br/>I have some interest in buying an Arlo camera to compare the performance, but at least for now the interest isn't strong enough to compel me to actually do it.  On the whole, I think my take with the Blink cameras is that they're a pretty neat idea but don't work sufficiently well that I'd want to rely on them in a situation in which timely recording was critical.
 Update: After a couple of software updates, this camera became very stable in terms of reliability and speed so I updated to 3 stars.<br/>I also have an Arlo, Ring spotlights and Wyze cam that I am using as references for this opinion. I don't know if the Blink unit shipped to me  is defective but the image on this cam is considerably blurrier than any of my other cameras. I did experience the purple tint issue which was corrected after I cycled the camera off and on. But that is not where the disappointment ended or rather started for me. The included mounting bracket broke during installation; the vise screw used to tighten the swinging arm stripped as soon as I tried to tighten it. I purchased a 3rd party mount that worked better. Like I said, the image is rather disappointing compared to even the $30 Wyze camera but then this unit takes forever (more than 5min) to upload the 20sec video when it detects motion and during that entire time, the camera is inaccessible (I have 6 other cameras on the same network working just fine, without unreasonable delays). When it's not busy uploading, 75% of the time (and that may be generous), the camera is just inaccessible. "Camera is busy, try again later" or "Video stopped unexpectedly". Sometimes it just starts working again and at least on two occasions I had to remove the batteries to get it working again. As of the past 24 hours, , the camera is once again not working but it's 20 degrees outside and I don't feel like going to pull the batteries again.... Hopefully just a bad unit but this has been my terrible experience with this thing and not worth the price!
 I've had my cameras for a few days now and have identified several weaknesses and strong points:<br/><br/>Weaknesses:<br/>-There is no option of expanding the 2-hour storage limit without buying another system, and even then, just 2 hours per base unit.<br/>-Set on highest resolution it offers a clear image but limited to "information as to what is going on" and not necessarily a close that can make an "identification".  They need to have some cameras established with a ZOOM capability for facials to catch who it was, not just what happened.  Currently cameras are WIDE ANGLE (offering information to activity, not identity unless a suspect gets close enough).<br/>-Battery Life - 2 years if you only "blink" now and then, not for surveillance of a home (1 min. max storage at a time).<br/>-No computer interface, only from your mobile device.<br/>-Unable to store footage on a hard-drive like many conventional systems<br/>-Multiple ways to “cut back” on recording time, limiting recording time by design.<br/>-Not rain-ready, expect blurry lens in rain if exposed.<br/>-Temperature seems to be fickle, inaccurate.  Two outdoor cameras at night are off by 10 degrees F. from each other, same during the day both temps are not right.<br/><br/>-The easy to install camera base (a single screw) can be a little tricky until you work through the swivel and turn aspects.<br/><br/>Strong Points:<br/>1) Good in low light using the IR which has 3 settings, (does drain battery faster on higher settings but good image)<br/>2) Good in low light without IR, but very poor in very low light (becomes pixilated and digital without activating the IR).<br/>3) Ideal for packages left at the door, elderly parent alerts leaving a door, but very limited storage.<br/>4) Convenient easy setup,<br/>5) portable, you can move it to any location without a problem so long as you are in range.  Take an outdoor camera and bring it in to watch a pet while away, etc.<br/>6) GREAT SOUND<br/>7) Decent 100 foot range (pending walls)<br/>8)  Capable of 10 cameras per base unit (but keep in mind, that’s 120 minutes total storage)<br/>9) Easy and user-friendly Camera settings, sensitivity, clip length<br/>10) Motion eye picks up motion even to the sides of the camera (outside the camera frame), which can “alert you a second faster before activity comes into view”.<br/>11) -Helpful articles and videos to get through the set up<br/>12) Waterproof for outdoor cameras
 I purchased because of the wireless connectivity and mobile viewing app. I was reluctant at first to really think this system was going to work without issues of getting connectivity wirelessly. Installation is straight forward. Doing research on internet and Blink forum makes it a simple install. Once I was connected I had perfect connection to the sync module but weak signal to the camera to WiFi. I only got 2 bars at best and sometimes dropped to one. System is connected to a 2.4 mghz router as it should. Live view would show a failure numerous times. Some recordings and audio were missed. Became very frustrating. I researched boosters but they seemed to work sometimes if not at all. My router was placed in a bedroom in rear corner of house. Camera is located in front of house. I decided to relocate router closer to my camera in a front bedroom (cable and phone line already installed) in hopes of a stronger signal. Sure enough it worked. Mostly Constant 4 bars strength which is required. Live view works consistantly as does audio and video recordings. Picture is clear in daytime on “best” setting. Night crispness is lacking but adequate. Faces are a white blur. I have wired cameras that are recording so night is sharpness if close is covered by those. I like this as it alerts me on my IPhone when not home as the other cameras do not.<br/>  I so far like this camera a lot. I see my family leaving the house safely when I’m at work or away from home. Camera does have an alert delay but only seconds. Still too new for battery life longevity test. Still playing with  settings for best battery savings without missing video. Not much of a deal breaker if they do wear out sooner than expected. My t.v. Remote goes through them and I don’t think twice to replace them. If the camera functions as it should, I’m good with replacing them. I put the camera in a location to watch my house and vehicles so it will get usage. That’s what it is there for not to lay dormant. I’ll update my review if something changes for the worse.<br/>  Update: recordings sometime have no audio.
 It is really to bad, the best feature about this and the only reason it gets 2 stars is that you do not need a subscription to store video. Could be so much more - I waited over a month for these to come in stock and what a let down. Had I known that a slight breeze would cause this to move - so far that you no longer have a viewing area, I would have sent it back right away. Unfortunately it was never breezy /windy till - yes I know - 10 days after the return is up! UHG- Mother nature lol - I will say the picture - when it is not pointed at the ground - is great. The timing on alerts though - same if not a tad slower than the competition. And yes I checked all my settings and even pulled everything off the network just to test - zero change in the lag time. So can I recommenced this above the others - not really. If I was to do this over, I would just buy a package of cameras from costco with the dvr and call it a day. Amazon - you failed here on multiple front's - the worst is the cheesy sub par plastic bracket that moves at the slightest breeze. FAIL
 Bought this plus an additional two cameras in June. The cameras themselves are nice. Motion sensing is great and the batteries last a really long time. Free cloud storage for clips is also a nice bonus. You can also power the sync module via USB without the wall adapter, so I'm able to power it via a USB port on my UPS.<br/><br/>I'm giving this one star because Blink removed the SmartThings integration with no notice and will not give any details as to why. They also suggested everyone who uses the integration change their password but will not elaborate as to why they're suggesting that. The author of the integration has also not been told any reason why Blink has done this. The integration with SmartThings was a large part of the reason why I chose to buy these cameras so this move by Blink is very upsetting. The fact that they did this without any notice is also extremely shady. I would not recommend anyone purchase Blink products going forward.
 The camera after 6 weeks (post installation) is a definite 5, however, the cheap PLASTIC mounting bracket for OUTSIDE is horrendous. The plastic mounting bracket will not support the weight of the camera if you need to adjust the camera's position for a better view.The bracket should be metal! Also, Blink (an Amazon company) does not provide brackets for sale?? Blink needs to change the bracket for the outside camera ASAP and provide them gratis to customers who paid for these not inexpensive cameras. Amazon look into this, you own this company!
 As a diehard Amazon fan, I wanted to adore these. We’ve had them about 5 weeks and it’s been meh. They’re easy to connect, the app is well laid out, and the concept is great. However, of the first 3 we purchased, we found one had odd sensitivity. It either is so sensitive that it’s constantly recording every time the wind blows (literally), or a single notch down and we miss most notion (completely misses our dogs going outside, the kids running around, etc). The other two seemed good, so we decided good enough. We purchased two additional cameras for inside, only to find the battery died within 2 weeks. We ordered new lithium batteries and within 12 hours of replacement, it declared it needed a third new battery (so there’s a bum camera). Tonight, one of our month-old exterior cameras that spends most of its time disabled anyway stopped because it also needs a new battery. Perhaps we just got bad sets, but between those issues and the inconsistency in when they choose to record, I’m not impressed.
 After testing the range of the WiFi and the sync module and the camera we found that yes, the throw is short specially since my house has 12" walls (concrete and stone), and since we installed this camera in the driveway we expected it would struggle a bit but still work and indeed it works (three bars in the range). It has a little lag but nothing major, if you want instant video feed then yes get a wired camera system or a higher-end one but this little gadget for the price works great for me as I went in knowing there would be a few shortcomings but in the end I am happy with the system and would recommend only to those that want a little extra surveillance of their surroundings. Wide angle works fine for me and you can change the video quality for faster response an again, it just works. I believe that adding WiFi range extender or a dedicated router to your home network will make this a perfect system.
 We bought them to use as baby monitors, so my review is based on that usage.  It's somewhat important to be able to check in to the live video and watch your child for a minute or two.  These cameras after about 10 seconds ask if you want to "continue?" watching.  If you don't hit it the video goes dormant.  If you want to keep watching you have to keep pressing "continue" over and over.  Very annoying and what's the point?  Also, we use multiple phones to monitor and unfortunately they all have to be set up under the same account.  So, if one gets motion notifications - they all get notifications.  This doesn't work well if you have say a nanny that is only in your home sometimes.  She would be getting notifications of movement even when she is not currently watching your child, as the preferences can't be altered on a per-phone basis.  Based on these criteria we are going to keep looking for the right cameras for us-
 The XT cameras are easy to set up out of the box - especially for the absolute beginner; the app follows you through the process.  I had it up and running within 10 minutes and 5 of those were redoing the process because I accidentally deleted the Sync module and had to redo it again.  Video quality set at 'Best' (720p) is good enough for what I need.  I have mine aligned to minimize any erroneous motion triggers which should maximize the battery life.  Time will tell but so far so good with detecting side to side motion alerts although sometimes I'm noticing motion detected too late after the person is almost off the screen. After reading the other reviews I decided to buy a standalone mount instead of the one that came with it. Hopefully this will help as well.<br/><br/>Here's my suggestions for improvement that will elevate Blink cameras above Arlo.  Make a BlinkXT2 line that has the following upgrades or just a newer model of the XT at same price point:<br/><br/>1) Connect to wifi/ cloud directly instead of needing to connect to a sync module first.  Each camera has to connect to both wifi and the Sync module - so if the house is very long and cameras are to be on each side, one would need to buy 2 sync modules as the connection to the Sync module will probably be poor if the sync module was in the middle.<br/>Also if another sync module is needed, this creates a new 'system' - why not just have multiple Sync modules/ cameras under the same system? And then name each camera descriptively (garage, front door, basement, etc).<br/>Anyway I needed to do this so purchased 2 sync modules + cheap wifi extender at each end so that wifi at the camera and sync module has a strong connection.<br/><br/>2) Motion zones - my cheap foscam ip camera from 5 years ago has the ability to set up motion zones.  This one is easy to set up as it'd just be a new firmware update and surprised Blink (an Amazon company) doesn't have this.  If the big issue with these cameras are battery life, why not implement zones to avoid false alerts like traffic/ trees blowing in the wind and minimize video usage to 'true' motion alerts.<br/><br/>Or have an algorithm to detect and motion capture only humans?<br/><br/>3) There's a check box that states 'End Clip early if motion stops'.  However each video capture is the same as what the Clip Length I have set - 30 seconds.  So even if someone/ dog walks by for a split second, the clip will still be 30 seconds.  So it appears this setting doesn't do anything and should be resolved. This again negatively impacts battery life<br/><br/>4) Motion isn't detected until it's too late and subject is almost off the screen making any identification difficult at times.  Arlo has a feature to record when motion is detected minus 3 seconds.  Blink needs to do something like this. This can be done by firmware update.<br/><br/>5) The DELETE camera and DELETE Account options should have a prompt asking if you really want to delete them or move them to a sub menu - these options are close to all of the other options.  If you press this accidentally (like I did) you'll need to start over which involves scanning the bar code on the back of the camera inside the battery compartment- a huge PITA if you already have them installed up high accessible by ladder.  I suppose you can write the serial numbers down as a preventative but it's not something you should need to do more than once.<br/><br/>6) Instead of scanning a bar code to add a camera or Sync module, why not just have it broadcast/ searchable like any other new wifi component (similar to a bluetooth pair)? If this is because of battery life, just have them broadcast initially before they're added to your system and then it can go to 'sleep'.  This way if someone is all thumbs (like me) and hits delete by accident, re-adding them can be done in a pinch; they'll just go back to broadcast/ searchable mode.<br/><br/>7) The USB flap needs to be revamped to allow a USB connection AND still remain waterproof.  This way one can supplement power needs with external options like a USB battery bank/ USB solar panel.  With the battery bank in a waterproof box, I'd be able to just quickly swap with a charged replacement instead of taking the camera apart and messing up camera alignment - it did take me a bit to get it aligned so as not to get road traffic in the picture.  Who wants to climb up on a ladder and mess with that in the dead of winter?<br/><br/>8) Instead of just a plain OK, add a battery meter with life expectancy based on video taken so far. IE;  half full ~300 days left.<br/><br/>9) Would be nice to have: FTP support for recording much longer than 2 hours total.  Free recording at all on the cloud is generous compared to others (Ring) - but would just be nice to have an option to record elsewhere of my choosing<br/><br/>I think the the 2 year battery life expectation is extremely optimistic. Maybe this is based on a camera under a porch overhang/ out of the direct elements &amp; looking at a front door where someone might go in and out a few times a day + post office deliveries.  With mine on the side of the house I'm getting the dog walking by, trees blowing in the wind and a few cars here and there setting it off.  If I lower the sensitivity, it may or may not get me when I test walking by.<br/><br/>Most of my complaints here are due to the constraints on battery life.  If only #7 could be resolved, I'd easily give these cameras a 5 star review. I'm sure a lot of others would as well.
 I ordered the system and was looking for a camera that could have clear images of license plates of cars passing by.  That was my major criteria.  Unfortunately it did not pick up on the plates, despite the different levels of quality or resolution.  At night, image quality borderline quality for complete darkness. With ambient light such as a porch light, the picture quality was not that good, either.<br/><br/>Initial setup was easy.  I plugged in the receiver, downloaded the app, and synced the receiver to my network.  The app is used to add each camera, one by one, using the QR code or entering manually.  The firmware will update, and finally, it will turn on.  To my dismay, one camera did not work out of the box.  I was referred to Blink Tech Support since the dealer cannot send one camera to replace the defective part.<br/><br/>Customer service is excellent and very responsive.  I got an email immediately to ship the replacement camera from Blink.<br/><br/>Setting up each camera is simple, use the button in the back of the unit to release the lock, add the Lithium batteries, and then close the case.  Mounting takes only one screw.  However, you’ll notice that the position you set it isn’t ideal sometimes, and you have to mount it elsewhere. The screws are soft and aren’t really amenable to doing that. I’d recommend getting tempered steel screws instead of the cheap die cast metal screws that strip easily.<br/><br/>The App itself is user friendly.  Each camera and its parameters can be adjusted through it.  Battery strength, signal strength for the battery and signal for the base are all shown.  Parameters such as delay, sensitivity, duration of recording, duration of latency call be adjusted.  The sound is recorded but it is not a 2way communicator.  Each camera location can be named as you wish, through the app.<br/><br/>At times the camera would give me a notification but nothing was there for one camera.  Could have been due to swaying of the tree upon which one camera was mounted.<br/><br/>Depending upon the WiFi’s signal you may or may not be able to see what is happening in real time on any particular camera.<br/><br/>Overall, it’s a decent camera for the money. In bright daylight, it has excellent quality.  In lower light and dusk, it has good quality.  In absent light or where are are secondary lights, picture quality is poor.  Due to the size of my particular house, this is also not ideal due to signal strength.  I’m sad to say that only wired will work.<br/><br/>Pros<br/><br/>Simple setup<br/>App driven<br/>Good quality in bright light<br/>Technical support<br/>Customer service<br/><br/>Negatives<br/><br/>No two way communication<br/>One camera was dead on arrival<br/>Lag time when recording<br/>Poor quality mounting screws
 First;  The one camera system<br/>if you just want a short video of whose at the door you might be ok with this system.<br/>BUT if you want to see who ripped you off the Blink one camera system will not do the job.<br/>Each Xtra camera has a Minimum of 10 sec. to restart after a recording no matter the recording time.<br/>Now you can set it to run for 1  minute and get your perp. At the camera location. Then 10 second pass before the camera comes on again. 10 seconds... The average 20 something fat person can EASLY run 50 yards / 150 ft. In 10 seconds.<br/>Therefore you have an empty scene on camera as they make their second trip to your door for your packages.<br/>10 second recovery is WAY-TO-LONG.  you have to have at least 2 preferably 3 cameras just to cover your front door.<br/>10 SECONDS OF NOTHING COULD MEAN DEATH TOTAL LOSS OF GOODS AND a fat kid running 55 yards.<br/>The average residental home lot is 75 x 50 feet with the house in the middle.  The perp will be at the next block before your camera starts again
 Me:<br/>Horrible! I’m fairly text savvy and it took (17) attempts and over an hour to finally link the module Then, as soon as I left the house the next morning the module disconnected from the network - no notice sent to my phone either.  Blink tech-support is nonexistent and goes straight to voicemail.<br/>Equipment: iPhone 8+ and one year old (4) antenna $200 Linksys router<br/><br/>nick_at_blink<br/>November 29<br/>Hello @mdieter,<br/><br/>I am messaging you regarding your recent posts. While you are certainly allowed to express your opinions on the community, please limit yourself to one post on the same subject; you posted the same content numerous times throughout the Community. If you would like further assistance with your Sync Module issue please let me know, and I would be more than happy to assist.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Nick<br/><br/>Me:<br/>And express my opinion I shall. You’re texh support number says “available 24 hours” yet goes straight to voicemail. And after spending $350.00 and 5 hrs attempting to resolve a faulty product via your videos and forums, your solution is an online chat? Why, so you can tell me what your forum is telling hundreds of people - all having the same exact problems? What a joke!
 It's fine for what it is - a camera.  It will not detect motion nor will the night vision work through windows - but that's normal for Infrared and motion detection, so that's not why it's 3 stars.<br/>The main reason this is 3 stars is because of the soul crushing amount of times you must press "Continue" while you are watching a live stream of your camera from the phone.<br/>Every 20 seconds you have to press continue on the phone screen in order to just keep watching through the camera's eye. I will probably be returning it because of this. What's the point of passively monitoring my camera if I can't do it passively?<br/>Additionally, and maybe the biggest thing: there is no webapp or means of accessing the camera through your computer. If you don't want to use a phone or tablet - too bad. Seems like simple things they could include considering it is not that much lower priced than other security cameras.
 SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Overall my opinion is simple. If you need something to catch and document activity while you're not around. It's alright. It catch if someone goes in your room or<br/>Is doing something you may be suspicious of, or maybe a good precaution for more info in the event of a crime..<br/><br/>If you have outdoor pets this camera is likely not for you.  THE CAMERA IS NOT DESIGNED FOR CONSTANT USE.<br/><br/>However, This camera can't be viewed remotely while recording. It can't manually record. Often there is a 1-5 minute delay on some recordings reaching my phone, this is with optimal Connection on entire link of device's.<br/><br/>In the event of a violent crime, I honestly DO NOT  believe the camera would help you be better prepared. You wouldn't know what was being recorded until a minute or two after it's recorded, and then if you decide you wanna go look at what was recorded.<br/><br/>If you have outdoor pets this camera is likely not for you.  THE CAMERA IS NOT DESIGNED FOR CONSTANT USE.<br/><br/> PROS :<br/>Extremely easy installation.<br/>High quality video (not perfect)<br/>In-app controls<br/>Easy cloud setup<br/>No fees<br/>ir works well.<br/>Very aesthetically pleasing. (They look good)<br/><br/>Cons :<br/>App is limited in comparison to other cameras. ( No manual recording. Limited Quality options )<br/><br/>App is very slow sometimes.<br/><br/>Camera can't be viewed while recording.<br/><br/>Camera isn't very stable on mount.<br/><br/>Camera can't charge on mount if mount is anchored under the camera. It must be mounted horizonally to either side or anchored from the top if you want to use the charger. (This is an issue if you'd like to mount the camera somewhere like on your roof or base of window seal with charger)<br/><br/>Camera is not waterproof while charging.<br/><br/>My camera often takes a few seconds to record after motion is detected. Sometimes catching the tail of motion. This including walking speed.<br/><br/>I'll continue my test.. But so far ..eh
 Pros: easy setup, no wiring to contend with, good video quality, can be armed/disarmed by voice command with Alexa.<br/>Cons: a little slow to notify of motion detection on your phone... about 10-15 seconds. Once you do get the alarm it's another 10 seconds to view it, and then react. It does not give a voice alert. It uses your phone's notification system only. I set a custom notification sound for it that only works on my tablet, not my phone. In order for this to really "work with Alexa", Alexa has to be able to give a voice alert of which camera has detected motion. I found an Android app that will give you a voice alert when an alarm comes in, and open the Blink app immediately. Unfortunately, the rules here preclude me from endorsing the app by name. But if you search the play store using the term "out loud" you should find it. I suppose there are other ways to do this, but this one is easy.
 The camera is great.  I do have a night infrared issue.  When a person gets about 2-3 ft away from the camera, you can't tell who the person is.  Their face is solid white.  The mounting bracket is horrible.  The mounting bracket should screw in, not snap-in-place.  Horrible design.  I was worried about a wind or a bird knocking it down and it breaking.  I ended up setting it like I like it and then taping it in place on the terrible snap-in-place bracket.  Any ideas about fixing the infrared issue would be great.  Camera does excellent in the daylight.
 OVERALL: These cameras have their moments. After several months of using them, the sensors are not as sensitive anymore. I wouldn't recommend using them as a security camera for outside the house. Several times where the motion senors should have tripped and record, but it didn't. The recording length is capped at 60 seconds per event. The camera has to reset which takes about about minute or so before it can record another event.<br/><br/>POSITIVE: The cloud storage is free for up to a certain amount of storage. After that storage is used up, the older videos get recorded over. The smart phone app is somewhat easy to use. It can run on AA batteries or be plugged in. Videos can be downloaded and stored on your computer or phone.<br/><br/>NEGATIVE: The recording length per clip is capped at 60 seconds. Battery usage can be depleted quickly if the sensor area has high traffic. If you decide to use the AC cord for power, the camera is no longer weather proof.
 We have had these cameras mounted for over a year<br/>1 - We are on the third set of batteries for all 4 cameras<br/>2 - Constantly get "Live view failed" when attempting to view from camera<br/>3 - When not getting "Live view failed"  we get "Camera/System is busy"<br/>4 - Night Vision has been failing on one of the four cameras<br/><br/>When we first got then and we bought them because they were wireless, they worked pretty good - but with minor issues. Now they are pretty much useless. We have a set of four Crystal Vision cameras mounted for almost two years now and they work flawlessly and they have an app so we can view them remotely. The difference is that each camera needs a power supply.<br/><br/>******* MODIFIED RATING<br/>I changed this to 4 stars as the items 2  and 3 above were discovered to be a garage door on our detached garage. I experimented and found out the when the door is closed the cameras in the garage become unreliable and when it is open they work a greater percentage of the time, the other 2 that are external work great. I m still disappointed with the battery life but we do use the live feed frequently.
 I have waited 6 months to write this review, just so I could thoroughly test the cameras. I have had nothing but trouble with these things. Installation was easy, and set up was easy. But that was it. They constantly go offline, fail to record, and "stop unexpectedly." I am always resetting them (sometime 2-3 times per week) or even having to delete a camera and re-add it. When accessing through the app, I might get one camera to load and check the video, but then I am done - it will not load any subsequent cameras. Like I said, I have given this six months, thinking software updates would eventually correct all of this, but, to no avail. I cannot recommend this product unless they figure out how to keep the cameras and wifi sync modules from losing communication ALL THE TIME.
 Went through the installation process as directed. Synced 2 cameras and they were working sporadically. . . .only able to take "thumbnails" about half the time. Same with motion activating only working sporadically. Both cameras are less than 30' from the sync module and everything always showed full bars. One camera pretty much stopped working within 15 minutes of installation hasn't done anything since. . . .the other one stopped the next day. Now neither work. One won't sync at all and the other syncs but transmits nothing (no thumbnails or footage). I've deleted and tried starting over many times and have gone through resetting my router as well and nothing. Very disappointed as I've now wasted many hours trying to get this to work. . . .will be calling customer service later when I have the time. Will update with what that experience was like. . . . .
 So after hours of watching YouTube videos I learned that the sync module that it comes with needs to be plugged into the wall and needs to be very near your internet modem<br/>The actual camera cnanor ge places anywhere because a lot of places it would not sub to the module so I had to keep moving it so it’s not ideal to where you want to put it<br/>Also it’s supposed to have motion detection!!!! Well I have all my notifications on and no alerts have been sent to me and it’s been about a week already I called customer service and they cannot figure it out<br/>The signal seems to be weak rot he meoje her it’s only about 15 feet away from losivle but it is in another room so a wall is in between them<br/>These things they don’t tell you when you are buying but you pay and invent time to find out these cheat things aren’t really reliable so I am very disappointed in amazon
 Good looks and rugged. Very disappointed w performance. In order to have something recorded you must be right in front of it. It misses almost everything. You see the persons back after the fact. A waste of money.
 It's a great device!<br/><br/>I upgraded my wifi and the sync module stopped working. Reset it and unplugged it again and again and nothing.<br/><br/>So I get intouch with customer service through email.<br/>"Rose M. (Blink Customer Support)" has been an absolute nightmare. She has been accepting nothing but explicit answers that quote her question. So for example if she asks, "does the blink-xxxx wifi not work?" she won't accept "the blink wifi access point doesn't work". You have to quote her exact question.... maybe she's some automation machine?<br/><br/>In any case, I have explained my situation about 10 times for the last week and she's recommending that it's my internet that's not working lol.....<br/><br/>I'll call in next week. I just wish customer service wasn't an exercise in morse code communication.
 Usually don't work very well when they do work they are very nice most of the time mine does not connect called customer service they told me if I have a brick Home Connection may not be well I purchased a Wi-Fi extender it helped for one of them but not the other I don't plan on buying Wi-Fi extenders for every camera that I own. I have a 1600 square foot home the camera is approximately 40 feet from One camera 10ft from the other
 I've only had the unit installed and running for 3 day. But so far it hasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>-Installation is easy. If you can operate a screwdriver, you can install it. You are walked through the internet setup by the app.<br/>- The notification time you get on your phone is quite quick. Usually within 10 to 15 seconds I get a notification on my phone that a camera has been triggered.<br/>- The camera definition is good. Not amazing, but good enough to see who it is.<br/>- No monthly fees and 3 hours of free cloud storage. There is no reason I will ever need 3 hours of storage. I can download or email any clip I want through the app.<br/>- It works with Alexa, In my case the Fire TV cube. It took me a few tries to link it to alexa, but after switching to a different phone it sync'ed right up. I can display live feeds on my TV through Alexa.<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>-I wish the motion trigger time was quicker and had more depth/distance. This will likely affect where you place your cameras. If you need the camera to trigger 30 or more feet away then this may not work for you.<br/>- I hate how the cameras attach to the mount. Even though I purchased a more durable and adjustable mount. It worry a strong wind will simply blow the camera off the mount.
 Great product for the price.  I bought the black outdoor ones. For the most part they are trouble free.  Batteries definitely won't last 2 years unless you have them on the minimum setting which most people will not use since it won't catch much.  I like the ease of use and set up.  I have them set up to cover the perimeter of my house and it pretty much catches everything.  Contrary to what some have said these cameras are extremely sensitive to distances over 30 feet even with sensitivity turned down to 6.  Sometimes there is a delay before recording of up to 5 seconds even if it isn't on a cool down.  Cameras with get foggy lens if it goes from cool/cold to warm/hot quickly which makes everything blurry.<br/>  So far it catches bunnies, cats, squirrels, some flying creature, opossum, a fox, neighbors dog, and many amazon and package delivery people.  I have has only a few small issues.  2 cameras have lost sound when it got cold with one still going in and out every now and then.  These cameras are well protected from rain and snow so somehow cold weather will sometimes mess with the sound.  The cameras worked even in temperatures as low as -24 ° with wind chills in the -40°.  Great low light cameras with color well into dusk.  I have 1 camera that lost the update that also you to turn off sensitive areas for the camera which leads me to believe that they are not pushing out firmware updates to the camera but OS updates that when you change batteries resets them back to factory default without any updates applied.<br/>  I've gotten about 4 months battery life from these but I'm OK with that since I want to capture everything with these cameras and and still playing around with the settings to test what these can do  10 sec Cooldown, 1 minute record, stop if not motion detected, sensitivity between 6 and 9 depending on the camera.  I have 8 cameras active.<br/>UPDATE: 2/26/19  Several of my cameras are failing.  I don't know if it is due to the cold weather or what.  3 out of 5 of them intermittently lose audio.  There is nothing covering the mic.  Not bugs, water, or anything.  It isn't related to temperature since 1 hour it will record normally and the next it records no audio.  I also have several that constantly report replace battery even with new batteries that I have verified with multiple meters as near 100%.  Then there are 2 that will just constantly click on and off every now and then sometimes with the blue LED flickering.  Not sure if quality control is that good since the others still work fine mounted right next to the ones that are failing.
 I have the camera mounted over my driveway. There is a delay issue with the product.<br/>You can't see the face or front of a person walking up the driveway. You can see the back of someone's<br/>head and body walking away. Huh?  It's a good 10 second delay. Not good for facial recognization. If someone<br/>was to steal or break something on my property all I would be recording is the back of their head and a going away shot. No good for identifying the suspect.  Contact with their help desk was no help.
 So far, I have been fairly pleased with the blink xt system. I imagine they made their engineering choices in order to get the best battery life, but for me, that made it a bit more difficult to set things up. I attached a picture of what I'm monitoring. I should add that I have two other types of security cameras around my property. (1) I use Vivotek linked to Insteon motion detectors. I use smarthome techniques to turn on the motion detectors using a light switch in my house (or via Alexa/Google Home spoken commands). (2) I use Wyze cameras for less sophisticated monitoring (how much oil do I have in my oil tank?). The blink cameras are the first cameras I've chosen because I wanted to monitor purely for security reasons. I placed my trailer over out of the way -- my property is split by a road and the trailer is on the non-house side of the road. I cannot see the trailer from the house and the one security camera on the dock that CAN see the trailer is too far away to be useful for motion detection-based security monitoring. And, of course, there is no power for cameras near the trailer. Blink seemed like a good choice.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of having to connect both cameras to a sync module in order to get all the functionality to work. I would rather the cameras find the sync module via the WiFi network. Lucky for me, I wanted to put the cameras near each other. I actually tried to put the sync module on the opposite side of my WiFi network to test it without connecting to the cameras. Things worked but weren't stable. I moved the sync module to be near the camera and things stabilized. So, I'm not an expert as to why that is, but it seemed to support the direction I got from Blink support to make sure the cameras were always in range of the Sync Module.<br/><br/>Their motion algorithm isn't sophisticated enough to weed out sunflares on the lens. I had to choose the camera positions very carefully. The motion algorithm didn't weed out car's headlights either. In any other position, the cameras would pick up the lights from cars driving by... all... night... long.<br/><br/>Finally, I was hoping the Blink cameras would work even when not on WiFi. I used to turn off the WiFi on the dock at night as it is run via a set of batteries (powered by solar panels). Now, since I have to keep these cameras online in order for them to work, I will probably have to double the battery capacity on the dock in order to keep it running all night long in the winter. I would prefer they capture motion and send the video up to the web when the reconnect to the network. I don't expect I will catch a thief in the act of stealing the trailer. I expect to be able to provide the video to the police if the trailer is stolen/broken into.
 For two years I've been researching and wanting a surveillance system.  I've looked at wired vs. wireless and was going to go with Arlo but then Blink came along.  My mom has the Arlo system and even though these are very similar the only difference that I see is the battery life.  I'm sure there are many differences but that's the only one I can think of off hand.<br/><br/>I bought the two camera set up and installed the cameras by the front door and the back door.  I own an in ground pool and for obvious reasons really wanted to be sure I was keeping an eye on the pool while I'm not at home.  The set up of the module and the cameras was very simple and super easy.  Download the app, plug in the module, create an account, set up each camera and done.  Probably all together about 20mins maybe.  The hardest part is finding a good spot for the camera.  I did the installation at night in the dark and by myself.  So with my phone close by I positioned and re-positioned the cameras until I felt like they had the view that I wanted and used the screws provided to install.  I'm going to say that it was probably a good thing that the installation was at night due to the fact that where you have the camera and what is close to the camera will greatly effect the night vision.  My front door is offset in the house with vinyl siding on both sides for about 18inches, if I installed the camera it was picking up light from the reflection of the siding from the street lights and all you could see was the siding.  I had to install it on the outside of that offset and all was good.  I can see my stairs and part of the driveway and even part of the street and intersection from my house.  As for the pool it was just getting the entire pool in view with part of a gate close by and one corner of the house.  I thought that I would want them closer to the door because if you walk up to each door (back and front) you are out of view.  My solution is to install a camera on the inside of the house that could view those doors.  For the most part all I wanted was a view to see if someone was where they could be at a time they shouldn't be.<br/><br/>As for the camera settings I think that the sensitivity is going to be an issue because the next morning I was testing that and as soon as I enabled notifications I got several from the pool probably due to the water movement.  I turned the sensitivity down to a 2 and so far it doesn't give me false alarms and with a test of me walking around it will detect motion.  The views during the day are clear and crisp the night vision is also very good.  Overall this was a great purchase and plan to add cameras as needed.  One thing I would like to see is if they had some sort of skin to place over the camera to give it a little more camouflage.  These are black camera on a lighter siding so to me they stand out.  But they are very small in size and obviously serve their purpose.  Also for the money this seems to be one of the best options compared to other systems.  I will update the review as time passes but for now I'm very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Update 6-13-18:<br/>Yesterday I was at the mall and when I enabled the motion sensors about two hours later I received a notification from the front door camera.  After reviewing the footage it was as I expected, the UPS driver was delivering a package to my door.  About 30mins later another notification and another carrier was delivering a package.  This was a big reason why I went ahead with this purchase.  We had normally had our packages sent to a business where my father-in-law worked and he just retired.  So we had to start sending our packages to the house to which both me and my wife work during the day.  This gives us the opportunity to see that we have a package and on any given day we are close enough to the house that we could run home and put the package away.  The pool was a given reason but the package delivery is another good reason and will be the more useful reason for the purchase.  One minor issue I couldn't get one of cameras to respond when asked to show footage, it would say camera is busy, after a few minutes it did work but at the time it was frustrating.  I also saw that they did have some vinyl skins for the cameras were I ordered two of their desert camouflage.  This will help them blend in to the their background and not stick out so much.
 I did a lot of research and read lots of reviews.  I wanted something affordable and that didn't have extra fees like cloud storage.  The real motivation to get these is that I had a package stolen from my front porch while I was home working in my back yard!  At the time I didn't know that my neighbor's sneaky young grand kids were seen hanging around my front porch after my mail had been delivered (only found out from observant neighbor when I told of my missing package).  Had these cameras been operational I would have known when it was delivered and I would have known it was not placed in the mailbox but instead left within reach of these sneaky kids. It didn't come from Amazon unfortunately otherwise I would have at least gotten a text message (although maybe not in time to head the thieves off at the pass).  I'm quite certain of who took the package but I had no video evidence that would have shown them leaving with it.  As soon as I received the box  I had these cameras up and ready to go within minutes which they now alert me when my mail or packages have been delivered.  So if they try this again I have proof and can file a report with the Postal Service (remember kids, stealing mail is a federal crime).  Thankfully it wasn't a real expensive item but it's the principal that my mail is not as safe as I always thought it was.  I like that I can easily hide the cameras from view and it's given me a sense of some control.  I don't feel like an easy target for those who don't respect other people's property.  I've had these for about four months now and so far everything is working very well. It should be noted that I did buy the camera enclosure even though I think the camera would have done fine without it as it's not in direct contact of the storm elements but more to protect it from the fine dust that blows around here regularly. I do have a issue with the stupid tiny "clip/mount" that comes with the camera.  What a laugh that is, you need to buy a mount bracket from another seller as it gives you something more to work with when installing the camera.  I also think a camera enclosure might be a good idea if it's exposed to a lot of dust or rain.  Better to keep your investment working as long as possible to get more bang from your buck!  Otherwise I'm very pleased with the purchase and recommend it for someone who isn't able to hire someone to do wiring for the other types of cameras out there.  You just need a smart phone and it also helps to be able to get up a ladder to install it out of reach of any thieves.
 I really wanted to like this product, but I am going to be returning it. The motion detection sensitivity ranges from triggering if a leaf is blowing, to not detecting when the mailman, or meter reader show up. I have placed it in 3 different locations and it either detects everything in the world, to not detecting anything. I had to mute the audible notifications because it was beeping every 30 seconds when it was detecting even the smallest movement. This will definitely drain your phone battery with all the unwanted and unnecessary notifications.
 3/12/19<br/>- the camera has settings for how long a clip it records, then there is an adjustable reset time.  i mentioned in my initial review that getting this just right was alluding me.  now, the camera seems to have serious glitches and does not record all movement at my front door.  for instance, this eve a family member exited to empty trash and was not recorded reentering.  there was enough time for the camera to have reset.  actually, reviewing my clips, there have been several similar glitches (stops recording after 5 seconds while someone is still in motion on porch)<br/><br/>i contacted the merchant regarding lack of battery life but received no reply.  expected they would most likely refer me to manufacturer - but no response is not acceptable.<br/><br/>plan to contact manufacturer<br/><br/>*************<br/><br/>i read many reviews before purchasing.  if you have too, you will notice some of the same pros/cons<br/><br/>system requirement:  this unit has to be connected to your wifi.<br/><br/>pros:<br/>- battery operated (i have no outlets outside)<br/>- 1 time purchase cost, no monthly subscriptions<br/>- EASY (!!) installation<br/>- lots of different settings to customize for you needs<br/><br/>cons:<br/>- battery is dying (3 month battery life)<br/>  i do receive notices that the camera is having high usage.  it is at my front door - which is where the crooks would<br/>  come in :-/ .  high usage is based off of coming and going from this entrance on average 6 times a day.<br/>- replacing batteries/mount.<br/>  i picked a spot on my eve that was not easily reached - because i don't want the crook to steal it.  the camera just<br/>  kind of 'snaps' into the mount.  i was initially worried that it would fall out.  also, finding a spot to get a decent<br/>  visual of those coming up to my door was a bit tricky (having the camera high &amp; out of reach, but too high and you<br/>  just see the tops of heads).  ALL said - unless someone has their back to my front door, all the captured video is<br/>  profile.  i have to use a ladder to reach my camera - which i am dreading doing today.  ALLLL of this seems like small<br/>  nuisances though ... some pretty easily solvable.<br/>- settings.  this is one area i am not super pleased with.  you can set 'clip length' and 'retrigger time'.  i have not figured<br/>  the perfect mix of these 2 yet.  i have been amazed what can happen in 15 seconds, and then missed in 10 seconds,<br/>  at my front door.  this is one area i actually feel is ineffective on this camera.<br/><br/>as i said, very happy with entertainment value.  it is good viewing what dance my friend might do on my front porch.  #1 benefit for me ... i know who is at my house and how long the dogs were actually walked for (thus, my recommend for homes with teens.  you would also need to be wise about where you hook up the wifi monitor, cuz kidz these days are pretty dang savvy to getting around obstacles).  as far as for crime ... well, i guess i would have proof of what someone stole and could post to social media to warn others in my neighborhood (the notice i receive is delayed by 10-ish seconds, so not in time to stop anything from happening - unless it was clearing out my entire house).
 I originally purchased the Blink XT System with three cameras but based on how well those performed, I have since added two more cameras. They are super easy to set up and install and initially, you'll be entertained by calling up each camera and seeing what the dog might be chewing or the cat might be chasing when you're not in the house. But from a security standpoint, this is the reason we I bought them.  The XT is a night-vision camera meaning that you can see what's happening in complete darkness.  I have them watching various entrances of my home and set to record 20 seconds of video whenever they are triggered.  I've tested this with my own car driving up to the garage door and triggering that camera.  I can then send the video clip to my PC and clearly read the license plate number.  This could become handy and extremely important evidence at some point.  I live where we have four seasons and these little discreet devices work in extreme weather conditions from blazing hot to frostbite cold.  The XT units are black so I also purchased the rubber covers in a color that blends in with the house so as to make them less noticeable.  I also mounted them such that no one could actually reach them to steal or damage them without having a ladder.  The good news here is that anyone attempting to touch them would be recorded on crisp and clear video (as well as audio) that could then be shared with your local police to assist them in apprehension and arrest.  Reportedly, the two lithium batteries it takes to run each camera should last for two years.  I've only had my system installed for two months so I'm unable to verify that.  I will say that you need to have very strong WiFi coverage for your home.  I happen to have that so connecting these to my WiFi was a snap.  If you're at all curious, I'd say, start small and add on cameras as you need them.  I bought the 3-camera system and then added two more.  Adding a camera can be done in a matter of minutes.  The mounts that come with the camera were sufficient enough for me but you can buy more substantial ones to accomodate more challenging positions.  Overall, I find the Blink to be an excellent and valuable product.
 I purchased this on one of the many deals just before Christmas. I am very happy with its performance, I mounted it to an oak tree, simple one screw mount. I thought maybe it wouldn't hold up in the snow and very high winds we get here. Not a problem, I don't have any extra covers on the camera outside so it gets the full gambit of snow ,ice and rain. I haven't had any problems at all. It was easy setup. I love the no monthly service fee. I get a message on my phone when motion is detected, whether I'm away from home or at night my iPad gives me a chirp. We have had temperatures here below zero and I was wondering how the battery would hold up in the camera. It's been fine. I was also pleased to see a twelve pack of the batteries for just over a buck apiece. Very affordable. The night vision works, the audio works great too. It has a very wide field of vision. I like that I can arm and disarm the system whenever I want. So i usually disarm it when we are home during the day and may go out to a vehicle in the driveway. I arm it when we leave home and at night, a simple slide to arm in the app on my iPad or phone. Knock on wood we haven't had any theft issues in this neighborhood and I've been here for 23 years. I recieved a notification one day when we were out and about doing errands of a motion alert. I checked and it was the UPS guy making a delivery. I will add any updates to this review if I have any problems or maybe in a year or so. This way I can tell you how it's holding up. Would I recommend this, absolutely!<br/>Update: it's now been outside and working for over three months, we have had sub zero temperatures, snow storms, heavy rain storms and high winds. It's still working perfectly! I had armed the system when we were out and about and recieved a motion alert, I looked and saw someone soliciting something and with no answer at the door they just left. What I like with this system is that I have it hidden and people look at the front of the house and don't see a camera or door bell cam which people can identify before approaching. The wide angle field of view is great! Would I recommend this to family, absolutely, I already have!
 Placed the item on the front door, outside under cover about 40 feet from router and 20 feet from the hub.since purchase, I have not been able to get a full clip recorded and always stops part way in the recording. Spent few weeks back and forth with support team trying everything they recommended. Nothing helped. They blamed the location, batteries, router etc. Then I was told my internet service is too slow, so I sent them the screen shot showing speed test of 26.9 mbps. I have wireless camera 3 times as far that function fine and I have good internet signal on my land in the same direction as far as 350 feet away. I have seen others on their support site complaining about the same. I have come to beleive that the blink design is poor and the unit generally too underpowered. This is disappointing from Amazon. They need to redo this item or remove it.
 Just installed this system at our home.  We decided to not purchase until we reviewed how the system operated at one of our other properties.  This system does exactly what we need, no subscription,  easy install, able to monitor cameras from our phones, great picture quality, and the ability to store videos for legal and personal purposes.  I was a bit upset with the sudden price drop just after I purchased the new system, watched that price in my cart for almost 4 months, but such is the nature of online purchasing.  I recommended this system wholeheartedly!
 We've had the Blink Security system for about 3 weeks. It was easy to install and the picture quality is excellent. So far the batteries are holding up good. We have used it a lot by looking at the live feed and I am surprised that the batteries are still good as much as we have used it. I did set the sensitivity to 5 so the motion detection would not be constantly triggered and to make the batteries last longer. The only minor issue I have is the mounting clip that came with it could be a little better quality. It is flimsy but so far as done the trick. The night vision is also very good and I was surprised how far you can see with it. Overall a good system. I'm still a little skeptical with battery life, but time will tell.
 Slightly disappointed. Setup was fairly simple since I already have a separate 2.4Ghz WiFi network set up for all my "Home automation" devices. Setting this stuff up on the main WiFi was proving to be a real PITA (probably because of my ISP, TBH). Settings are all controlled through the app and are pretty straight forward.<br/><br/>There's a tiny switch inside the camera which allows you to turn off the blue "recording" light but no switch to turn off the red "motion detection" light. Also, there is a very audible CLICK as the camera starts recording. So, as I was walking by the camera I hear a CLICK and turn to see what the CLICK was and get blinded by a red led light which screams "Hey, you are being recorded, fool." I am sure this click is coming from a mechanical relay but in 2018 I would have thought the relay would have been solid state and silent. To prevent this device from getting detected, it should be silent and have no led beacons. I have this feeling this camera would be ripped off it's tiny bracket and taken with the perpetrator, smashed on the ground, or simply misaligned so as not to record the desired area.<br/><br/>I don't see any type of date time stamp on the recordings, so this video would not help with any legal proceedings. Every recording or picture ever admitted as evidence requires a date time stamp. Also, would recommend posting signs that both audio and video is being recorded.<br/><br/>Be prepared for a lot of notifications if the camera is set up in a active area or your motion detection settings are set too sensitive.<br/><br/>I had these cameras outside during a rain storm and one of them stopped working. Not sure why but after taking the battery out, to reset it, I noticed the inside was dry so it may have been a glitch. Have had no problems with it since then.<br/><br/>One aspect I like about the Blink camera, that no other camera with a cloud service has, is the free service provided so you can monitor your cameras remotely.
 I purchased 4 cameras after one of our neighbors had their car broken into. So far they seem to be performing as advertised.<br/><br/>Setup and Installation: 5/5. You simply download a free app. Create an account. Scan a code inside the battery compartment of the camera (or manually enter the numbers on the code) and the camera is added to the system. The batteries they included are top of the line Energizers. The only thing I'll say is you should buy the mounts that are sold separately. They greatly increase your ability to aim the camera once mounted.<br/><br/>Picture: 4/5 - I'm not quite sure if I'd call it 1080p, but then again I don't remember if it's supposed to be. It's clear, though. Night time is pretty decent. You can pinch zoom the image if you want a closer look at something, which is cool.<br/><br/>Things I didn't like: I don't like that I haven't been able to find the sweet spot with one of my cameras. It seems like the motion sensor is picking up traffic much farther away than I thought it was rated for. Cranking it down during the day works well enough, but then you're under-sensitive at night.<br/><br/>I also find the wi-fi sync (device that sits between your home wi-fi and the cameras) be be pretty particular to one side of the house. If I wanted to add cameras to the other side of the house I fear they'd be out of range of the sync. I've read elsewhere online that Blink suggests people get a second sync and create a second home network, which is accessible through the same app. I may do that.
 I bought this camera thinking that it would perfect to record the back patio area of my condo. I wanted something completely wire free with motion detection and decent video quality. This camera touts that the battery can last 2 years and I'm sure that's possible if no one ever comes to your door, but I have gone through 5 sets of batteries in the last 4 weeks. I contacted support and they told me that the battery life was likely due to my router's distance from the camera, and that I should lower the video quality in order better save battery life. I did that and my next set of batteries died just as quickly, as did the next set, and the next.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that my router is about 10-12 feet from my camera and the camera somehow struggles to connect to it. It 's most likely whatever cheap antenna they have built into this thing, as I have wireless devices all over my house that are much further away and connect just fine.<br/><br/>The video quality is good during the day, but average to bad at night. There is a lot of grain and a noticeable dip in the resolution.<br/><br/>Oh the app is an unresponsive mess too, and using it to change the settings of the camera is hit or miss.<br/><br/>Anyone that gave this thing 3 stars or above has seriously low standards.<br/><br/>All in all, I would not recommend this camera to anyone. I'm trying to return it, but it looks like I might have missed my window. Crap.
 Pros - simple, simple, simple. Activate the battery, install the app, attach it wherever you'd like and boom, you've got a home camera system. Additionally, at this price you can install several around your house or wherever you'd like for complete coverage. You might need a WiFi booster but that's easier than running cable and/or electric to every camera, imo. Another PRO - if you'd like you can run a charging cable to it and NEVER worry about replacing the battery.<br/><br/>Cons - it only records on motion, so it's possible to miss things that don't trigger recordings so if you want something that records everything 24/7 - this isn't your solution. Mine seems to sense motion out to about 50'. You can still view live shots.
 I originally purchased this item as a pair. The first two I thought it was my internet. I switched and got a faster speed. I purchased another one and they sent me this one with another module. When I tried to connect the other module they told me I didn’t need it. Why couldn’t I purchase without I don’t know. Three months into have a three system camera and they are constantly showing as busy, I can’t check on the picture without getting a system is busy notice and when I get an alert and it’s actually something, it recorded when the person is gone. I’ve tried calling to get help and they keep telling me it’s my internet. I don’t understand how it i updated it but anyhow try another system because good luck with this one.
 We are using these at a cabin located in the wilderness out in an area where there is no power.  We have solar power panels and cellular WiFi setup and it works perfectly.  We set up three cameras to see the main entrance, the generator and pond areas.  We have caught the neighbors riding in on their lawn movers being nosy.  I love how it alerts us when a new video has been recorded because movement had been detected.  You will have to play with the settings a bit to get that perfect setting because it can be touchy with the slightest movement.<br/><br/>The picture quality is superb, as well as the audio.  We can clearly hear the neighbors lawn mower as they ride through.  There is nothing negative I can say about these.  We have only had them up for only a few months so I can't comment on the battery life, but I check the battery status often on the app which is a neat feature.
 I bought the five camera system when it was on sale for $350.  So far, it works fine as expected.  -  I bought the system primarily based on the "two year battery life" advertised claim.  Once I received them and read the manual, I was not happy, since it said that was based on five second recordings.  Who wants a recording that lasts only five seconds when someone is breaking into your home or vandalizing your property???  You can choose longer recording time from settings, but obviously that lowers battery life.  -  I previously owned the Arlo by Netgear security camera system.  I didn't like that they started charging  for cloud storage, which Blink has so far avoided.  Blink cloud storage is free so far.  I hope it stays that way.  That will heavily influence me insofar as future expansion of my system and other products.  -  The blink cameras are plastic.  The Arlo cameras are metal.  I also have Reolink cameras.  They are also metal.  - -  I have no problem with high grade plastic items.  But, I was a bit uncomfortable with the way the Blink cameras attach to mountings.  It is a snap on connection - no screwing-on involved.  The snap on may well be very secure insofar as weather, but anyone who is able to get their hands on a mounted camera can snap it off very easily too, since it is not secured against theft with screws and/or screw-on metal mounts.  The Blink cameras can easily be knocked loose with a stick and fall to the ground,  or by throwing something at them.  That can't happen with the Arlo or Reolink cameras which have the option of very secure screw-on mounts and are all metal.  -  The mounts that came with my five camera Blink system were of poor quality, so I bought some wall mounts to replace them.  They were also all plastic, unlike those with Arlo or Reolink systems.<br/>  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FSG55D8/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1  -------- Overall I like the cameras function.  The software/App works well.  The cameras capture video well, plus sound,.
 PROS:<br/>+ Cameras completely battery operated; truly wireless, with included Energizer Ultimate disposable lithium AA cells (use ONLY lithium)<br/>+ Excellent picture quality<br/>+ Very good sound<br/>+ Robust cloud relay - seldom down after 5 months<br/>+ Claimed 2 yr battery life; so far, so good<br/>+ Easy set up - a model of how to make things easy<br/>+ Surprisingly good range; as good or better than some plug-in WiFi cameras<br/>+ Nice to have temperature, signal and battery condition telemetry easily available<br/>+ Cameras are weather resistant all by themselves; have operated nearly  flawlessly in temperatures from 0-110F, rain, snow and shine.<br/>+ No localization BS - works well in Brazil, Missouri and Virginia.<br/>+ Can set up and monitor all three locations on a single account and app.<br/><br/>CONS<br/>- Video only activates and captures after being “awakened” by PIR motion (battery saving technology).  Events that occur reasonably rapidly may be missed or only captured at very end (I have lots of videos of the tips of fox tails exiting the field of view)<br/>- Fine adjustment of some app controls difficult - too small, even with Android size maxed out<br/>- System requires a “puck” sync module, plus WiFi. Cameras have to be within range of both (difficult in a medium sized house)<br/>- Sync module doesn’t seem to have the range of WiFi - may be some kind kind of Bluetooth,  Zigbee or Z-Wave transceiver with limited range<br/>- Putting the battery cover back on trickier than it should be.  Need care to ensure it’s really on and sealed<br/>- Placing in the sun, in a hot climate may overheat the camera.  Fortunately, reasonably priced skins and housings available.<br/>- You can have any color you want, as long as it’s black<br/>- By the nature of lithium AA batteries steep end of life decline curve , will probably only get a couple of days (or less) low battery warning before the batteries die.  Ok, if you’re local.  Harder, if one is remote (solution: replace batteries way ahead of time)<br/><br/>Bottom line:  If they actually pull off a two year battery life, it will be close to a technological miracle. Even if the batteries only last 6-12 months, it’s a really nice, capable system that rivals most powered WiFi systems.  I like my Yi cloud cams and these working together; they complement each other nicely.  Because I don’t need power, I can use these in more locations than the Yis, but I can use the Yi continuous recording (even if the Yi doesn’t trigger an alert) to retroactively view something that triggers the Blink without capturing a complete video. I wish it didn’t have the sync module, as that complicated two of my installations. But, if that’s the price of two year battery life, it’s well worth it.
 UPDATE 2018-12-24<br/>Between the time I wrote this review and the time I took down the camera for return, I have not seen the configuration reset issue (not that I tried, but I do not see it anymore). Perhaps a software update happened that fixed it. Come to think of it, the one case in which a "full picture" motion was missed might have been during a software update as well (but if so, it is still a problem: the camera should not apply a software update on its own; it should be initiated by the user). Regardless, because of this confusion, I will make the review give 3 stars.<br/><br/>I am still returning the product, for all the other reasons mentioned in this review. One other thing I forgot to mention is the fact that you cannot access your recorded clips over anything other than the app. For example, if I want to download the clips for long term storage, I want to download it on my computer and store it somewhere from there. With the way Blink is set up currently, you will need to download it to your phone, then transfer it over to your computer in some way, and then store it from there (this is assuming you have your own storage system, as opposed to some other cloud storage accessible from your phone).<br/><br/>Also, it seems, for some reason, I am not getting updates to comments to my reviews... So I do apologize if I do not reply to any comments.<br/>END UPDATE 2018-12-24<br/><br/>The battery-powered weather-proof with free cloud storage idea is definitely good. The size of the camera and the way the mount works is also great. However, it seems there are several hardware and/or software, or perhaps QA, issues that make this camera not good. Two main issues on the usage level:<br/><br/>First, the configurations seems to reset on its own. I set the camera's configuration to record 30 seconds, and to _not_ stop if motion is not detected afterwards. This was set, and I tested it after a few minutes to confirm it works (and it did). However, every single time I test this, the next day, the configuration resets to the default 5 seconds. What's worse is that when you check the app, the configuration is still shows the 30 seconds with no auto-stop!<br/><br/>Second, we had a case in which a person walked right in front of the camera. Yet, the camera never picked it up. We know this because we have multiple cameras pointing at it. For a security camera, this is unacceptable.<br/><br/>Now, perhaps these are issues not universal to this camera. For example, maybe my networking is bad (a). Maybe the batter went bad (b). Perhaps the sync module was offline (c). Or perhaps it is a bad unit (d). For (a), however, it does not explain the configuration reset issue. Further, the connection has always been available (which is how I got the picture of the person walking past on a different camera). For (b), these are brand new. The app shows the battery as "OK". So this is unlikely to be caused by that. For (c), the sync module is only for passing configuration. So it may be a bad sync module. But it then does not explain missing the whole person case. Finally, for (d), it may be true. This may just be a bad unit. But that implies poor QA. Configurations should not reset, and a whole person walking past the camera should never be missed.<br/><br/>From reading other reviews and doing some research, there are a couple of things to keep in mind:<br/>1. SmartThings integration was removed without notice. I don't use SmartThings, but this is important for people who do.<br/>2. Amazon. Since Amazon purchased this company outright, they will have control of the future of this company. Keep in mind Amazon has several smart home security camera products.<br/><br/>For (1), if this was a feature that was advertised, such action makes one question future support of this product. For (2), with existence of 1st party cameras, a 3rd party fully owned by the 1st party may not be supported as much. What I'm trying to get at is, at least for the long term, support may not exist. Now, I'm not saying this is definitely the case, but is also something to keep in mind in deciding whether to buy (or in my case, keep) this camera.<br/><br/>I'm giving this product 2 stars because the idea is good (1 star) and maybe this was just a QA issue (1 star). But I am still returning this product because of all the other points I have touched on in this review.
 I've been using my blink system since Dec. 2018. Since that time I have given it a good chance to feel the system out. I know everyone loves the 'pro', 'con' reviews, and hates the 'this product sucks!' but often times these reviews are after only a week of use.<br/><br/>I wanted to love this system, it was easy to setup, camera placement isn't permanent, no ongoing fees, low cost... Everything was great except huge flaws. In one sentence. The system runs off your home Wifi, and for whatever reason if the system can't get a good connection it will disable the home security system completely. My system will ' go offline' about once a day for many hours. I have great internet (80mbs) and a great router to support those speeds. The sync module is only 15 feet away...<br/><br/>Do not buy. This system is unsafe, could be cool as a baby monitor.
 Ordered 2 cameras.<br/>What went well;<br/>Setup and connection to wifi and their cloud service.  Everything including their firmware update went without a hitch, including using higher level of WIFI security that has caused other devices problems.<br/><br/>Good quality images and video.  Good night vision.<br/><br/>What could be improved;<br/>Depending on duration of intrusion into set alarm area, may or may not alarm depending on time in the field.  Set with a perpendicular view of the entryway catches people walking through its view and straight thru doorway maybe 20% of the time.  Even UPS drop-off at door only catches about 50% of the time.<br/><br/>Not waterproof if you use external power port.  Battery use only for weather exposed areas.<br/><br/>What could really be improved;<br/>App &amp; notifications.  Some of the issues.<br/>Click to download the video, says complete, tap where it tells you to tap to view the video and opens Gallery with - no video.  After several go-rounds with support (responded with an actual human, not a synthetic pretend human -yea),  found the app was downloading them to a different location than what the app opened when tapped on.  Don't know why the app doesn't open where the videos actually download to but it doesn't.<br/><br/>Get an alarm notification and click the link to view the cloud stored video and - no video clip.  Come back sometime later and the video clip may or may not be there.  Works first time about 75% of the time.<br/><br/>Really needs to have a way to turn on or off the alarming based on time of day, sunrise/sunset, or similarly.  I don't need to get notifications when I know the family is in the area.  Nothing makes you want to use alarming less than getting alarms you don't want/need.  Just want the flexibility.
 All the specs about this little camera is correct except battery life.  The info for set up is very sparse and not at all with much detail.  However after loading the app onto your phone it's relatively easy to set up except with a dual mode router modem, which you'll need to turn off the 5 MHz for the initial set up as this operates only on the lower 2.4 (as do most all these wireless type modules).  Once recognized, then you can resume operation of both frequencies.  I didn't use the camera mount that came with the unit as it really doesn't support the capability of the portability of the camera, which is disappointing.  The picture quality is excellent and the app is fairly well self-explanatory and easy to understand and use.  It has many settings that control the camera, picture sensitivity, quality, length of image capture, time between image capture, etc.  But now I'm receiving a replace batteries indicator.  I've had a single outdoor unit in operation now for about 8-9 days, using it is primarily used to monitor an outside cat who resides on my side porch.  The camera sensitivity appears to be okay but I cannot find consistency in the settings - it seems to be either too low or too high in spite of having a 1 thru 10 selectable setting.  Something else I've incurred in a week of use is that sometimes when you receive motion detection, you're not always able to open/see the recorded portion as the Blink app just spins or you get a black screen.  If you try to adjust, you'll get a "Blink cloud busy" message which is totally ridiculous and unacceptable considering this is supposed to be cloud based/driven.  The only way I've found around any of this is you just have to wait. Go out of the app, wait a few minutes and then access again.  I've found that it appears that you're only able hold about 49, 20 second recorded segments (nothing really tells you about image capacities).  Night time is the only time I turn on camera, which is easy to enable/disable the camera from the phone app. The night time image is very good too.  But I think to advertise in your specs that the camera has a 2 yr. battery life is very misleading.  There is hardly no way for someone to have any degree of camera usage/image capture and have the batteries last two years (maybe if you just had the camera set on a painted wall and capturing the occasion fly that lands on the wall, then you're batteries would last 2 yrs!).  I have flashlights that I barely use at all and with the flashlight just sitting, the batteries don't last 2 years - so think about it!  It just doesn't make sense to state 2 yr battery life.  And having lithium batteries doesn't insure that being a true spec either.  But overall I don't feel "rooked" by the poor battery life as much as hugely disappointed in the honesty of the specs on the unit.  For this unit to be viable for me, I'm going to have to really find out more of what the app can do to help control the camera usage by way of the picture quality selection and the sensitivity settings.  For what I  want it to do, I would be fine if I had to replace the batteries every couple of months or so but I think even doing that is going to be a huge accomplishment considering the history of how this camera and app interact.  However today I'm going to explore the usage of alkaline batteries, what kind of life I can get out of those as well as the possibility of using rechargeable batteries.
 First : this is a very inexpensive camera compared to others . ( bought for $70 something on sale ) So with that in mind ... it has a good picture during the day - only an ok picture at night . At night its a little blurry .<br/>Battery died on 1 of mine after 3 weeks of use and only 2 or 3 triggers a day ! So much for 1 year of battery life !!!!<br/>Motion sensing is supposedly adjustable ... but so far : high setting gives too many false alarms - and low setting doesn't trigger . Although there are 10 increments - it really seems like there is a high / medium / low  adjustment no matter where you set it in between .<br/>The mounting bracket ... is Pure GARBAGE !<br/>It is so flimsy that its almost comical that this is what they include ! It seems like a joke because it is . It has no left to right aiming adjustment , only up or down ... and it is so cheap that it vibrates in the wind and sets off the motion trigger .Now much better aftermarket designs are available for $10-15 dollars . But really Blink ... just raise the Blink retail price by 5 or 10 dollars and include a real mount<br/>.<br/>So the verdict : This camera is low cost , acceptable quality and will alert you to motion . Although not right away . ( doesnt send clip until recording has stopped )<br/>It is small , wireless and supposedly has a long optimum battery life . But it doesn’t ! ( 3 weeks and mines dead )<br/>The app is way way behind ring , arlo and cloudcam as far as features and refinement .And  Although amazon bought Blink ... I do not think that this " Brand name  " will stand on its own for long . I see that much more emphasis and refinement is being poured into Amazons other companies , Cloudcam and Ring,  and not  Blink . Hopefully the Free cloud storage, software updates and warranty will be supported for years to come ... but I doubt it . It seems like Amazon just bought Blink in order to get their technology - not their Brand .<br/>For $70 or 80 ... buy it . Full retail ... wait for a sale !
 Bought in 2017 when they were promising to release cellular backup, door and water sensors, and a monitoring service. Well nothing had been delivered like they posted on their site and at trade shows. If you ask them you get told “we do not discuss.” Time to move on. It appears Amazon bought them for their tech and scrapped any advancements. Maybe Nest or Sumplisafe are better options.
 Very portable and easy set up. I am impressed with quality of the videos at highest resolution so I believe that’s 1080. The mounting is very flimpsy and designed poorly. I am not a designer but it can be improved easily to allow side-to-side tilting which it does not have. This makes installation very limited because the view angle is perpendicular to the installed surface. It can only be tilted up and down. The battery housing on the back does not feel like it can keep out water so will see what happens after I use the cameras a few months. The camera cost is bit high but storage is free so that’s sorta paying for cloud subscription in advance. With that said the cameras better last 2 years to worthwhile in the investment.<br/><br/>Nite mode is not useful as others have noted. If there is sufficient light, I would suggest turning IR mode off at night. I don’t use it for my front porch.<br/><br/>Update after 1 week use: I played with the length of video and it has to be around 20 to be able to capture people with faces. If too short, the response is too slow from camera when turning on or the length is not able to capture  the real action.<br/><br/>The most frustrating thing is the mount. Blink needs to prove the mount. I tried purchasing 3 alternatives from Amazon but they all failed. This is so frustrating. The mount is the easiest thing to design. I have to decrease my rating to 2 start for the overall experience.
 I monitor three different properties (indoor and outdoor) using these cameras. They are battery operated and the quality of the videos (and audio) is very good for the outdoor camera. I find that the quality of the indoor cameras is a bit less but still acceptable. However, be aware that the outdoor cameras can be operated in stealth mode with IR lighting at night. The indoor cameras have a bright LED light that gives away that the recording is being taken, etc. When you combine this fact with the lesser 720p video for the indoor cameras it makes sense for me to use the outdoor cameras indoors too. The IR lighting and 1080p quality makes a nice difference.<br/><br/>I originally used a Z-Wave systems tied to more expensive cameras. They had to be powered with 110v and separate motion sensors were needed. I am delighted with this system over the former systems. Also, the motion sensor activation of these Blink cameras can be adjusted in the Blink phone application. The adjustment is both with sensitivity (distance) but also sections of the scene can be blocked out. This is a recent upgrade that put icing on the cake for me. One other thing to know. Each sync module can manage up to 10 cameras AND the Blink application can manage multiple sync modules. I use the Blink application to manage 3 different properties all on the same phone and the different locations and notifications are integrated into one place on one phone app. Very cool I hope this helps you understand how cool this inexpensive system really is.
 I use this camera to keep an eye on our cars at our apartments. A few of our neighbors had their cars broken into, and I always kept putting off buying a security camera system. Mainly because I living in an apartment and I wasn't sure how to mount the camera's and run wires everywhere without upsetting the landlord. This provided a viable solution at a reasonable price. The image quality is adequate in both day/night environments. Physical set-up was easy, open the back of the camera, add batteries, plug in a couple dongles. Software wise, however, set-up was a pain. Mainly because the Blink app is buggy during the set-up process. My phone could connect to the wifi portion, but couldn't find the camera. I'd enter in my camera's profile, enter in the bar code info, and it would fail connection. I couldn't troubleshoot the issue in anyway since all functionality is set-up on your phone. You can't use a PC to log into the camera during set-up. I finally got it to work by deleting my camera profile multiple times, and redoing all the settings until it just randomly worked. The app isn't intuitive once you get the camera to connect to your network. The forward &amp; back buttons seem backwards. The "sensitivity" setting doesn't give you any information. Just a slider bar numbered (1-8). No real information on what you're adjusting, or how the camera determines sensitivity. Same thing with other settings for the camera. Seems like Amazon is using it's customer base to field test their apps. But once you get past all the software issues, this camera does work well. I also get the feeling that Amazon is data mining information through this device. But then again, who isn't data mining these days? Over all, is this worth it? If you can get over the app yes. The camera functions as it should.
 1. i bought 2 camera system  on 11-17-2018  for $229.  Today 11/21/2018, the price for two is the price for 3 camera system. i felt being cheated.  this kind of pricing on amazon has been happening for a while.  this is the reason why i am gonna to dump amazon membership next year. I have been a member for almost 20 years!<br/><br/>2. the cameras are easy to install but they show a lag time in recording.  most of time, it only record half of the motion.  it is not every useful.
 I don't write review often. But I think I should write about this product after nearly a month of using it.<br/><br/>I was seeing problems with this product for a while but I kept giving it a try until the other day an event happened. Someone broke into my neighbor car (parked next to my car). So she knocked my door and asked me if I have any videos for her to report to the police (she knows I have a camera installed in front of my apartment). So I checked my phone and what really disturbing that the event was not captured. So I had to say sorry to her (what a shame that you have a security camera but didn't work). Luckily my car dashcam has a feature that it see movement in front of the car and captured the event, but it only shows the back of a man in black jacket. So I sent this to the police (still better than nothing, right?). After this happened I remove the Blink XT and sent back to Amazon for a full refund (thanks to Amazon excellent refund policy).<br/><br/>So here is my review about Blink XT Home Security Camera:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Compact design &amp; lightweight.<br/>- Completely wireless. You just hang it on the wall, no need for wiring.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>- Missing too many events. It only captures activities randomly. Everyday my kids leave and comeback home but the events were not captured at all. At first I thought it was really smart to understand they are my kids and should not be alerted. Like a pet recognize it owners. But there are no clues that this is a "smart" device.<br/>- Batteries only last for a month. The claim that 2 years batteries is totally a lie. You can explain that it depends on the usage and settings. But there is a big difference between 2 years and 1 month battery life. Maybe if you hang it there and turn it off then it may last for 2 years.<br/>- Active Zones: I know this feature is in beta version. But it didn't work at all. I set the activity zone to only capture activities on my pavement but they also sent me alerts of the cars running on the opposite of the road.<br/><br/>To summary: this product contains so many bugs and needs a lot of improvements. So many things that I think it needs a complete rework. Maybe in the future but for now it just a false product.
 I was a bit skeptical that the quality of the camera would be very good since it's one of the cheaper outdoor models on the market. But it is much better than anticipated and the night vision isn't bad, either.<br/><br/>It is super easy to set up, it has step by step instructions and is packaged very well.<br/><br/>The mounting bracket just kind of pushes into the back, this doesn't seem super sturdy to me but I imagine since ours is up high and out of strong wind/animals that it won't detach and crash on the ground.<br/><br/>The app is free and so is saving your video. It shows the temperature and how your battery level is as well. You can take instant pics and video through the app as well.<br/><br/>A couple of times the notification didn't come through on my phone showing an activity had occurred so I had to go into the app and review it. I'm guessing there may be an occasional glitch now and then.<br/><br/>Overall, definitely worth the money.
 Important to note that the motion feature of the Blink XT does NOT work if you keep the camera inside and point it through a window!  After many frustrating weeks of trying different settings, system resets and different batteries, I finally discovered this issue (and confirmed it with Blink technical support.)<br/>  The Nest camera system I also use does capture motion through windows with no problem (but Nest currently requires a wire for power, Blink XT does not.)<br/>  Otherwise, the Blink XT camera appears to work fine.  I will consider mounting outside but temperatures in my location may be an issue, especially for battery life (which means mounting should be done where access to camera is easy due to more frequent battery changes.)
 The camera is easily activated using the Blink App.  The camera is simple to use since the app automatically sets up web storage that may be viewed on your smartphone.  The camera basically has 3 modes of operation; live streaming, clip capture, and photo.  In both the live streaming and clip capture modes audio is also collected.  The device uses motion detection to trigger clip collection for a settable time span. The span is settable from 5  up to 60 seconds, but there is a warning that longer time spans will drain the battery more quickly.  Once a clip is recorded it is stored in provided cloud storage and an alert is sent to the phone.  You can specify how long a clip is kept in the cloud, up to one year.  If cloud storage is exceeded the cloud will delete the oldest clips first.  Clips may be downloaded, but I have yet to find a way to download photos or live streaming.  Clips may also be discarded after viewing.<br/><br/>Mounting the camera was a bit trickier.  First I found the supplied mount virtually unusable, which is the main reason I'm giving the product a 4 rather than a 5 star rating.  However since the mount was an unknown when I bought the camera, for $11 I bought a, Blink XT Camera Wall Mount Bracket,Weather Proof 360 Degree Protective Adjustable Indoor/Outdoor Mount and that made installation a  cinch. The installation above my door is shown in the pictures.  However at this point you run into a physics problem that I'm sure effects all surveillance cameras.  If the camera is too high it cannot capture what is going on below it without sacrificing the far field.  Additionally pointing the camera down will tend to capture only the top of someon's head.  Not terribly interesting if you want to identify the subject.  I opted to point in the medium field so I could see the subject approach and get a shot of the face.
 I bought the two-camera pack. It took me less than 30 minutes to get the module and cameras synced and up and running. I looked at a Youtube video before they arrived and that helped.  The hardest part was getting the back of the camera off to install the batteries. The main reason I bought it was because the cameras are battery operated....so much better than hard-wiring the cameras to an electric outlet.  We will see how long the batteries last.<br/>I placed one camera in my driveway and one in my backyard: both were easy to install but I would recommend using a bigger screw than the one they supply, especially if you live in a windy area.<br/>The motion detection is pretty good except that there seems to be a few seconds lag time before it begins recording.<br/>Example:  It picked up a car going passed my house but only caught the back of the car as it was leaving.<br/>You can adjust the length of time to record, time before resetting, quality of video, etc via the app on your phone.<br/>It has a pretty good range as well:  I was about 25 ft from my house at my mailbox and it detected me with pretty good clarity.<br/>I took off one star because you can not view the cameras on your computer...only the app on your phone. Perhaps they will change that in the future.<br/>Overall, this seems to be a pretty good system for the money!
 I so wanted to like this product, but it just doesn't work right. I got it on a Christmas bundle which included a Echo Dot V3, which effectively made the blink kit $49. For that price, I'll keep it.<br/><br/>The pros: battery operated, small, black, free cloud storage. Cons: 1) Huge detection delay. Even on the most sensitive setting, you can walk past the camera and the detection will occur after you have passed the field of view. 2) very poor WiFi connectivity. I had to put a router within 6 feet of the sync module and camera before I got stable connections. Otherwise, it would drop offline, fail to record events , fail to respond to app commands to view live feed, etc. 3) No 5Ghz band. I know it doesn't say it does, but for full price and in this day there is no excuse. For the price I paid, I'll just accept the cheap.<br/><br/>Maybe they will fix the problems with a firmware update, though none is shown on their support site. I would say the $50 I paid is worth the hassle and problems. It may detect and record an event of interest, and does at least serve as a dummy camera which has some protective value. That's why the two stars. If I paid full price, it would be one star at most.<br/><br/>Maybe someday there will be an outdoor Wyze camera. I have 4 of those, and all work perfectly, but they are suitable for indoor use only.
 I wanted to love it but...<br/><br/>I currently have Nest outdoor cameras and was hoping to extend my coverage with Blink without the use of wires. Unfortunately I had too many issues with it to continue using it so I returned it and I'll be getting more Nest Cameras.<br/><br/>Issues I had:<br/>Poor quality video-If I bumped up the video quality I got a warning that the battery life would be considerably lower.<br/>Non rechargeable batteries-Another expense.<br/>Poor motion detection-I did set this up in a busy area (near a chicken coop) but even then---the motion detection did not go off a lot which was concerning<br/>Inability to set to human/vs motion.<br/>Poor night vision-even if it did catch motion, there was no way to tell what it was.<br/>Base does not swivel -maybe I was hoping it was closer to my Next than it actually was, but it was really a major pain to get it set at an angle that made what I needed visible.<br/>Poor signal via Sync box-You pretty much have to be right on top of your Wifi to get this to work very well, and BOTH of them have to be within spitting distance. At that point I'd rather be wired, since I almost have to be anyway. Anything outside of 50/75ft from the sync box saw a huge strain on the video quality and speed.<br/><br/>I know I may have been asking it to do more than it was made for, and maybe I misunderstood the reach of the box---but I did expect much more than what it could handle in the end.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a security camera I'd recommend going fully wired (Nest has been great), if you are looking for a "trail camera" or something that can detect motion in a non busy location---this MIGHT? It seems like it would be a good camera for an outside front door---but anything further than that will push its limitations.
 There is a lot to like about the ease of set up and use of the Blink system, and it seems that they promise upgrades to the firmware that will continue to enhance the system.  Being a battery operated system it make sit super easy to pick a spot to set the Blink without worrying about wiring.  This ease of setup brings some inherent limitations.  Primarily, if you want the batteries to last the projected two years, it cannot be set with high sensitivity to turn on at the slightest movement and cannot have endless clips recorded.  Also, it cannot have advanced features such as continuous camera monitoring so that when motion is detected the system saves a clip that includes a second or two before the motion was detected.  You can't blame the blink for not having this in a battery mounted situation, but it would be nice if the camera is operating under USB power.<br/><br/>The only significant problem, and the reason that I gave it 4 and not 5 stars, is the lousy, completely worthless plastic mounting bracket.  I would NEVER use that mounting bracket on an outdoor installation.  It simply clips onto the camera, making the camera an easy object for theft,. It's so flimsy that I would also be afraid that a strong gust of wind could blow it off.  The mounting system is huge weak link.  I purchase a separate mounting system that is vastly superior though still not perfect. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FYGDF71/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1
 When will Blink fix the bug that only allows it to record for 5 seconds? I used mine for years and now with this known issue the cameras are useless. I had just bought another unit last month but had to return it as I don't know when or if this bug will be fixed.  A 5 second recording is useless.
 I tried out this Blink camera after previously trying to use a Reolink. I ran into several connection issues with the Reolink and setup was a bit of a pain so I had to return it. With the Blink however, connecting took less that 5 minutes and the camera was installed and running in less than 10 minutes.<br/><br/>The camera is light weight and small, making it easy to place in discreet and hard to reach locations. It does run on 2 AA batteries, making it 100% wire-free (which is very nice). The camera does not have any local storage, which might be a drawback for some. I'm using it for external security, so saving directly to the cloud is not an issue. It should also be noted that saving footage to the cloud is free (unlike many other systems).<br/><br/>To keep the camera small and light, the Blink utilizes a separate "sync module". This module syncs up with your router via Wi-fi. Then the camera sends its signal to the sync module.<br/><br/>The only minor "complaint" I have with the Blink is this; there is a bit of lag (about 2-3 seconds) when live viewing the stream or getting notified on your phone that the camera captured something.  For myself, all the other features of the camera far out weigh this minor thing.<br/><br/>It should also be noted that the camera is a fixed view of about 110° FOV. There is no panning features. The night-vision viewing picks up well, even in completely pitch black conditions.<br/><br/>Overall if you are looking for a completely wire-free camera solution that is quick and easy to setup, Blink might be the right one for you.
 I like this system but wish it was zone or camera armed vs all of them.  I bought originally to place outside to cover other area not currently covered by my other camera system.  I decided to place indoors as a monitor for my aging father and care for my handicapped sister-in law.<br/>  Don't get me wrong.  This is a great little system, but pricey &amp; limited.  I just have a few issues I would love to have improved as a better overall coverage for the system.  I have placed 4 of my six cameras in various places inside my home.<br/>  1.  I feel it's a bit limited because you have to arm all the cameras.  I would prefer arming by zone or per camera which could be updated to all if necessary.  2.  Also after installing I noticed only my phone allows me to zoom in on the camera currently viewing.  My girlfriend phone can only monitor but not zoom in and we have the same exact phones Hauwei born August 2017.  3.  Another issue would be two way talk.  Currently this system only allows one way audio.  It would be nice to use for children, animals or even burglars.  4.  Another issue is only one person can monitor the system at a time.<br/>  5. Another nice feature would be if you can monitor all zones or cameras at the same time.  Currently only one camera and you have to hit continue for longer viewing.<br/>  6.  Another issue is why the hell do you have to buy the mounting brackets separately.  After spending $500+ for this system I would've thought that the brackets come with.<br/>  Anyways  I suspect since each camera uses AA batteries and last up to two yrs that some of these luxuries cost this system potential.  Anyways I later have also learned that Blink is a company owned by Amazon.  Some of these issues I bring up are legit to me because similar systems offer these features and at a lower price.  (# can you say baby monitor! )  If you feel you want to try these I'd honestly wait till Blackfriday sale.  You'll save hundreds off the price.  Anyways hope this helps.
 I have two Blink systems at two different houses.  I really like the cameras, the video quality is very good even at 720p, and the cameras have many features that are customizable.  (i.e., many different options for various settings for each camera, within the app)<br/><br/>The biggest selling point for me was the no monthly monitoring fees, no contract, and FREE cloud storage!  Very very nice.  I already have the monitored security systems at each house, and I bought the Blink cameras to augment those systems.<br/><br/>The biggest weakness with the equipment, as delivered, is the very cheap mount that comes with it.  These are really not well-suited for outdoor use at all.  They are fine for indoors.  But each camera "snaps" into the mount.  Guess what that means?  Each camera also UN-snaps from each mount - and that can be done in literally a second or two -- meaning that the camera can be stolen very easily.<br/><br/>From a security standpoint, there are a couple of things to consider.  One is that if this is your ONLY security system, keep in mind that even though the cameras work 24/7, will YOU be able to respond quickly if needed to any alerts, 24/7??  Probably not.  That is, when you're sleeping, if you're like me, you'd never hear any alerts from your phone.  If you don't hear the alert, a burglar might be caught on video but that would not stop them from breaking into your house.  And naturally if you are sleeping and do not take any action on a Blink alert, there will be no police response.  (unlike a system that is monitored 24/7 by a professional monitoring center, that does have a monthly fee)  That is the primary disadvantage to this system if you are relying on it as your only security system.  Another consideration is that this system could potentially be completely thwarted by professional thieves.  All they would need to do is use a radio frequency jammer.  If they jam the radio frequencies on which this system operates, it will not work - at all.<br/><br/>No security system is perfect.  And there is no such thing as perfect security.  That's why security is best when multiple layers are used.  The Blink system has many positive attributes.  Just realize that it might be best to ALSO have another security system in place that is monitored 24/7 by a professional monitoring company.
 UPDATE: Got 11 months out of 2 lithium batteries. Really good.<br/><br/>Decided to try the Blink XT for coverage in the back yard. Took about 20 minutes to set up and install. The video quality is good and the motion detection and alert to my iPhone seems a little more robust than my Ring doorbell. The viewing angle could be better, though - I have it directly to one side of my deck and it barely covers the stairs to the deck which are centered. Hopefully future models will improve on this. The mount also needs improvement as you should be able to adjust it to different angles - not possible.<br/><br/>For price and performance I'd recommend it. Just don't expect it to cover a wide expanse of your yard unless you order additional cameras.
 Because this product is battery operated at uses most sensors if you don't want to be changing the batteries every couple weeks you have to set the motion sensor to be not so sensitive. So basically what I end up getting is video of people walking out of frame. This is pretty much a useless system as far as it works at my house you don't even get the benefit of people noticing that you have cameras so that they won't approach your house because the cameras are very small and discreet. if and when I replace this I will be going with a wired system even though it's a much more difficult task at least that way I can have constant monitoring and not just see the backs of people's heads and their feet as they walk out of frame every damn day
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R3SJ86EAK2CL6Z"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HvaeI5+iS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/914CCldWRgS.png"/> They sell it as security camera, but it's very hard to work with it as security camera because the 'wireless system' has too  many trade-offs for that, but I bought it to record wildlife, so it's somehow OK for me.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- decent video quality - also during night<br/>- very easy to install and connect<br/>- good, responsive and fast App<br/>- can be installed on multiple phones<br/>- was successful to catch wildlife footage (s. video) in the first nights - not bad<br/>- wireless range as indicated, but expected more from a proprietary communication (with this limited range a connection module does not make much sense).<br/>- description of wireless signal strength in App faulty (there is no communication between camera and router as far as I know or at least it would not make any sense at all)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- IR sensor activates either too late or causes countless false alerts (which ruins the battery life) based on settings, but nothing in between.<br/>- IR sensor range very limited<br/>- Does not work southward (will cause huge amount of false alerts)<br/>- No internal storage (one of the major flaws). This would have cost maybe $1 to add and would have added so much more safety and comfort. Terrible construction/design error.<br/>- No (PC) desktop or web access<br/>- Battery life (as most others state ... I have to confirm)<br/>- 'stop video' on 'no IR detection' does not work at all<br/>- no real 'manual' apart from quick user guide and some FAQ on website
 They were easy to install.  The included mount is more versatile than it looked like at first.  It is fine for indoors but get the mounting kits for outdoors.  They offer more movement security and ease of aiming.  Also they have little hoods to help keep rain off of the lens.  The app notifies me quickly of movement in its view.  It can be adjusted in the app.  The cloud storage is free which I find a huge advantage.  Nice color in the daytime and good range for the backyard.  Too close and it burns out the image but in the backyard the extra power is an advantage and it never burns out the image because is far enough away from the subject.  One way audio is all I need for my purposes.  It took me awhile to figure out the settings on the app, but it was not problematic.  Just figuring out anything that is new.
 The killer feature of this camera is its awesome 2 year battery life. Other cameras have battery life more on the order of 3-6 months, which is just way too short, especially if you have multiple cameras to keep running.<br/><br/>Other advantages are small size and relatively low price.  At about 1/2 the cost of many other cameras it makes putting up multiple cameras more feasible.<br/><br/>However, this camera also has significant downsides:<br/>- The most annoying drawback is it's HORRIBLE mounting system.  It would have been simple and inexpensive to have a ball-joint mount that would allow it to be easily pointed in any direction, but for some reason Blink has gone with an ultra-cheap design consisting of a plastic arm with an elbow in it.  The result is that you can't independently adjust the up/down and left/right angle of the camera.  If you move it a little bit in the left/right direction it also changes the up/down angle.  Very frustrating.<br/>- The whole system feels slow, which is probably related to its low price and low power consumption. It's slow to pull up an image from a camera, and it can't multi-task: if a camera is triggered and is recording then you can't do anything else on the system until it's finished, which could be up to a minute.  This is a problem if a trespasser passes from one area to another and you need to look at a second camera to see what they're up to.<br/>- The camera is extremely sensitive to car headlights and taillights.  I tried putting one of these outside the front of my house, but if there was even a small amount of the street included in the field of view the camera would trigger with every passing car.<br/>- Live-view video can't be recorded/saved.  Video that's triggered by motion is automatically saved, but if you manually activate the camera to see what's happening then there's no way to save that video. You may have turned on the video to witness something, so it's a problem that it can't be recorded/saved.<br/>- The images quality isn't the best.  One of my cameras has really striking vignette artifact.<br/>- There's no speaker.  From using other cameras I've found that having a speaker is actually a really nice feature.  It's both fun and sometimes practical to be able to talk to the people that you see on camera.
 The good: A reasonably-priced outdoor security camera that is completely wireless and runs on only two AA batteries. Sweet. No  monthly fees for cloud storage. Really sweet. The bad: Setup went mostly smoothly but a few things were not intuitive and took too much fussing to figure out (like how to turn on motion detection). Better instructions and a little more hand-holding would be good. The really bad: The mounting bracket connection is flimsy and after detaching and re-attaching the camera a few times while setting up, it got so loose that it seemed to barely hold the camera. And sure enough, the camera fell off within 2 weeks and ended up on the ground in the snow. Fix the mount and provide better setup instructions and I'd give 5 stars.
 The answer is yes they should be improved.  The set up is easy and simple from unboxing, Android app &amp; configuration, as well as hanging.  For me the picture clarity is decent BUT only during the day, in color and from 10 feet.  At night, you could possibly make out an identity (facial) of someone from 10 feet; honestly good luck.  However, I like the notification aspect, which works good.  The RING Doorbell camera and notification works much better.  I purchased a third one the Blink cameras just after purchasing the 2X set, I suppose out of excitement.  I hung that one into a tree, in the open, while the other two are under the roof's easement.  The tree-camera lasted 3 weeks before it began losing signal, fell out of it's bracket, and pictures turned red.  I ended up taping the camera to the bracket and that seems to have held it in place.  As for the lost-signals and red pictures; I had to remove the camera, removed a battery to reboot it and then it works.  I don't understand why it would lose connection when the sync-module is 12 feet away next to window and the WIFI Router is 8 feet away from the sync-module through a single wall.  The other two camera are much further from the sync-module and have never given a lost-signal error.
 Pros:<br/><br/>a) Light weight and small - made entirely of plastic so is super light.<br/>b) Easy to set-up - phone app is good to provide step by step directions for set-up.  I had the set-up done in about 15 minutes for the entire set-up.<br/>c) Base unit will connect via WiFi which makes it flexible to be placed conveniently where needed. Now this could be good or bad, as if you do not have a whole house WiFi mesh system and if your internet system is in basement, then you might have a internet issues.<br/>d) Uses regular AA batteries which are easier to find and works well cost wise in long run.<br/>e) Has a good motion detection - has activated almost always in the last 7 days I had the chance to test this system.<br/>f) Has temperature sensor to display temperature where the unit is placed.<br/>g) The app is fairly intuitive to use.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>a) The night vision is just sub-par - you cannot detect the face of the person, so this may be an issue when actually you need the recording.  Daylight recordings are better, I would not say the best.<br/>b) Build quality feels cheap - the plastic is really cheap feeling.<br/>c) The back door of the camera does not snug close easily - it is an issue for the outdoor system as rain water might sweep in.<br/>d) The holder will only allow tilt and no sweep and again has only 1 screw to hold the entire system which to me does not feel strong enough. To some this might not be an issue, however, to me this is really a big put off.<br/>e) The aesthetics - the system is really ugly to look at, I am sorry, I like my products to look nice, feel nice and blend into the environment.
 For the price, you get what you pay for.  The biggest issue I had with this camera system was the connectivity.  To say it simply, the had intermittent issues in my 1000 square foot, one level home.  The units use 2.4GHz Wi-Fi.  Which is good and bad.  Good because it can penetrate walls better than 5GHz, but the amount of data that can be carried is less.  So, considering all this, and that the units use both the WiFi signal from your router and the sync module (supposedly 100 range), I’m surprised I had this issue.  When I did have a connection, the units worked well with motion detection, recording, and video quality.  I don’t like that the units don’t have geofencing.  Arlo Pro 2 does.  Arlo covers 200 feet from its base station.  It shows.  Much more reliable signal.  But you get what you pay for.  Arlo is twice the price.
 When I first got this camera system I was disappointed because the description says it is compatible with Alexa. I assumed that meant I would be able to say "show me the front door" and see a video of the front door. This system cannot do that. The Alexa integration is to arm and disarm the system to control whether it sends motion detector alerts to your phone or not. But after getting over the disappointment, I have found this system to be powerful and easy to install. The clips sent include both video and audio and you can control how long the recording lasts. I have tried several different home security cameras and I would recommend this system.
 I read many of the reviews, and in spite of some negative reviews, I decided to try the outdoor Blink camera system. It was on sale, and I decided to buy it.(The black  XT). I did not prefer the fewer options on the white(cheaper) I USE THE BLACK BLINK XT AS AN INSIDE CAMERA TOO.<br/> So I bought it and unpacked it. The "Blink"app is simple to download(I am Android-Samsung tablet user)<br/>I connected my camera with very little difficulty. The only minor set back was that the 9 digit code that you need to synchronize the camera is on the back on the Blink synch module (little black box) not on the back of the Blink camera. Once I figured this out, the rest was a breeze. The application popped-up on my cell phone and Samsung tablet.<br/>There was the clear picture of my living room. Another feature that Simplisafe camera app does not have and Blink does, is the ability TO DELETE recordings saved on my phone. It also has a clear option to to "Arm" the camera. This allows you to turn off the motion detector to stop unecessary can turn it on to record movement when I am not home. This is a big time-saver, as there are so many extra useless video clips on my Simplisafe that just stay on the screen. I cant delete them.<br/>Lastly, I tried buying one of those no-name mini cameras. In reality, that are generic cameras packed in black box with a white sticker on them. The directions are translated terribly from Chinese and the cameras are junk. Don't waste your money. Even though it seems like a good bargain to get a $45 camera, the directions to download the application are unbelievably difficult. It takes a PHD in computer science to figure it out!<br/>Go with Blink: It is a great camera with a great and simple app,easy-to-use display, and a great picture!!!
 I've bought this second camera hoping for the same performance as my primary camera.  For some reason, the motion activation is slow to respond, even after adjusting the sensitivity multiple times.  I can walk within range (25 ft. or less) and the clip doesn't show me passing across in front.  The mounting bracket could be improved with a firmer griping action.  I've purchased solar compatible power source that works great and the display says "OK"<br/>UPDATE: Initially the unit worked just OK, but after about a month it started to flickering the blue LED and could hear a relay chattering.  Now it has failed to operate!  The original unit is working normally and still delayed triggering.
 I am a repeat customer.  I purchased the indoor system.  It was easy to add the camera to the existing system.  I probably could have just purchased the cameras as add-ons.  It's been extremely cold in the northeast and the outdoor cameras have not failed.  My only issue with positioning and placement of the cameras - probably more to do with the layout of my house and property.  I find that the in order to pick up movement at the average height to pick up a person, the camera has to be aimed lower which reduces the area of coverage.  I probably need to purchase one or two more cameras.  A  built in speaker would also be a nice option.  Great devices and they work well.  I am happy with the Blink product.
 I live in the mountains where black bear roam. I had just installed the blink camera system but not armed it yet and I also have a drive way alarm. That night my driveway alarm went off and I always just go to the front door and open it and look and see what is in my driveway. I was on the way of doing just that when I said, "hey we just installed blink at front door lets see if it is getting anything. I turned on live view and at my front door was a 400+ lb black bear actually standing up (looked to be about 7 ft tall) with his giant paws on my door. He was not scratching or making any noise just exploring his options. If I had not looked at my blink camera and gone ahead and opened the door, it could have been a horrible and deadly tragedy for me and my family. Thanks to the blink camera working very well at my front door, I am able to write this review.<br/>The only thing that is really a problem as the terrible mount. the wind will and does blow the cameras off the mount, I have one on my deck rail and it was knocked off several times before I had to move it. Even the better mounts you buy still attach the same way and that is the big negative. Such a great system and yet they chose to not figure that out before release.<br/>2 months of use: I still love my cameras but Amazon and Blink have to do at least one thing that is totally mandatory. They have to put more powerful transceivers in each camera, even if it cuts battery life in half, it has to be done as the current cameras have very little range outside of your home. I have mine not more than 30 ft in all directions for all 4 cameras and it is very slow, buffers alot and even with a small temp change you cannot connect at all. They are great inside your house but I got the outside cameras hoping for some range but limited is not even a fair assessment. It seemed in a little warmer temp they work bettery although for most people temps in the 40's is not that bad. Do this change and I think you will have an even bigger winner.
 I have been running the Blink system with a couple of cameras for the past year.The biggest issue for me is the lack of local storage for video. In the event that your internet connectivity dies so does your system. So there is no video and no alarm. This effectively means that you are not notified and if there is any activity it goes unrecorded. Amazon should address this firstly with a local storage unit and the ability to have cellular connectivity as add on. This would allow remote monitoring of sites.<br/><br/>The camera is quite mechanically robust. The mounting bracket is a little on the flimsy side.  Motion notification and ability to configure the app is where the system fails for me. Motion event notifications are delayed or can be missed depending if your device is muted.<br/><br/>With regards to event triggering. The camera is on the slow side. fast moving events can be missed. I have had the UPS guy make it to the front door drop the package and the Blink misses the capture.<br/><br/>No ability from within the app to customize the alarm sound to differentiate it any other message notification so they can be ignored easily. Real time video feed has quite a long delay on it. Bottom line this is not a very feature rich product.
 I really don’t get why people give this such high reviews.  Yes, set up was easy but everything else is sub par.  With mounting hardware a close second, the most egregious shortcoming is the app.<br/><br/>What do you think the most important feature might be from a user standpoint?  In my opinion it would be controlling how I’m notified of an alert.  Because Amazon has NOT built custom alerts into the app, you have no customization options in iOS.  It’s just a generic, default sound that doesn’t differentiate itself from any other 3rd party app that also lacks customization.  You can’t change the sound, you can’t utilize a unique alarm, nothing.  If it went off in the middle of the night, you wouldn’t know if someone just broke into your car or if your PayPal payment to Netflix  just went through.  They also don’t provide any option for email alerts, so you can’t even configure a workaround for this problem via that route.<br/><br/>Another issue is the motion triggering - hit or miss on the 2 units.  Seems to trigger super late no matter how I configure it.  I know it would be battery drainer but perhaps a pre-record option provided with a small on board buffer would be a good step forward - even if it was only available when coupled with a hardwired power supply configurationn.<br/><br/>And finally, IR illumination quality and subsequently night video quality are seriously lacking, IMO.  Regardless of whether it’s set to low, mid or high, faces get blown out so much you’d have a hard time identifying anyone at night unless you already knew who they were.  The metering is really poor and there really should be an option for the user to dial in exposure compensation if they wanted or needed to.<br/><br/>Overall, 2 stars.  Really could be a great product with a serious upgrade/expansion to the user app, better mounting options and some tweaking to the function/controls for camera.
 I bought the Blink XT on the Black Friday deal. It arrived and was installed on Monday. Today, Wednesday (2 days later) the system is dead. Neither snapshots nor video will work any longer. The camera and module are both seen by the system and both signals have good strength. It's too bad. I liked it a lot so I bought a second unit which is on the way. Unless there is a miracle recovery they are both going back for refund when the second system arrives.<br/><br/>Update 4Dec18: The first system came around later that day and has been fine since. So today I opened the second camera and will install it shortly. After the initial failure (firmware updates?) the first camera has been fine.
 The biggest issue I have is that the delay before it starts recording is too slow. I have 2 of these, one is recording my front yard (to catch the cars parked in front of my house) and another to get anyone walking up to my front door and potentially taking packages.<br/>The problem is that it starts recording a little bit after it senses movement. So often times, the one in my front yard will start recording after the person has already walked past it (it's got plenty of time to catch them from when they turn a corner, before they're out of view, so there's at least a 5 - 8 second delay).  The front door doesn't catch people walking up the sidewalk until they're already at the door putting keys in, at which point it can no longer see anything other than the top of their head.  If someone were stealing a package, they'd be in a hurry. So the system wouldn't catch them until they were already running away with my merchandise, it might get their feet as they run away, but that's about all I'd catch.<br/>I've tried raising sensitivity, but that might kill my battery as I now get notifications from every moth that flies by. Additionally it doesn't seem to change the delay.<br/><br/>Update: car was stolen and camera didn't catch anything
 Outdoor security. Have an indoor cheaper Camera that goes off every time the curtains move. I have this blink camera outside and my neighbors who are as loud as 10 cars driving down the street, it does not detect. It only Detects motion. It does not detect noise. You can hear what is happening outside with the camera but the camera does not alert to noise only movement.  A car accident did not trigger the camera to come on.<br/><br/>  The quality of the picture is average. The ease of use average. A less expensive  product with a good app that detects noise would be my next choice.<br/><br/>Since I have another camera on a different app, I know that being able to record is also important. If the camera alerts you, you can see what the camera sees but it won’t record a new video . It will only take a picture. I want the option to record a video at will.<br/><br/>The best thing about this camera is the easy set up. But if it doesn’t do anything you want it to, it’s a bit of a waste.
 The cameras don’t record even if there is motion, and vice versa (keeps recording though there is no motion). The retrigger timer doesn’t work (retrigger:10s) and sometimes takes 2 full minutes to record the next. The cameras do not record the full 60 seconds even though specified in settings to record 60 seconds and not to end early. Bad and faulty system. The most ironic of all is how the video quality is so good yet won’t pick up movements further away. And it won’t start recording until about 5 seconds after any movement. I don’t recommend this system.
 This is a low cost way to monitor your property. The average rating is mostly because of two deficiencies. First, the motion detection range is 10 ft (3 m), at most, even at high sensitivity. Turning the sensitivity to its highest level means the camera activates on snowflakes, literally. So, that's not very useful.<br/><br/>Second, there is no way to save videos taken when viewing in live mode. Thus, it's of limited use for police or other investigators if the motion detection doesn't pick up the activity. I'd leave a picture with this review, if the system made it easy.<br/><br/>Other comments: the system and cameras were very easy to set up; almost self evident. The video and picture quality is excellent, even at night with IR. The pictures look like they are from a fish-eye view which takes a little getting used to. The camera holders seem a little fragile, but they are working fine, so far.<br/><br/>I've only had the system for a couple of weeks, so I may provide updates over time.
 The setup was super easy...actually using it is another story.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, by time I set these up, and spent some time trying to troubleshoot them myself, and then a week of back and forth with their tech support, my return window closed, otherwise, these would be going back.  Don't get me wrong, they aren't a complete waste, but as a security camera, they leave too many holes for me to feel even ok about them.<br/><br/>Issues:<br/>You can only review the videos on a phone or tablet, and the videos are pretty big so they will be chewing up data (minus 1 star).<br/>They don't detect motion coming straight at the camera, so the one at the front door is nearly useless (minus 1 star)<br/>There is a delay before the camera starts recording, so by time it starts, I typically only get a view of a delivery person's backside which wouldn't be much help in identifying someone if they were walking away with a package instead of delivering one (minus 1 star)<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you are looking for a portable baby monitor to take with you on vacation, this would be useful.  If you are looking for a good security camera, this probably isn’t it.  Sorry.
 I have a few cameras in my house by Dlink and foscam, and because of what I'm seeing with this blink camera, I'm seriously considering a full move to blink. I put my XT out on the front porch using just battery. I live on a pretty busy street with lots of kids and dog walkers, and cars go by constantly.  I was able to set my camera to ignore the zones where cars drive by, and adjust the sensitivity so that I see the packages delivered and just a glimpse of the walkers who go by, and I keep the clips pretty short.  I'm hoping this will let my batteries last a while, but I'm prepared to plug the camera in if need be.  The ability to move this thing around without worrying about wires is nice but not a requirement. I can say that the module is only about 20 feet away but the signal is going through 14" stone walls with no issue. It's a pretty wide angle and high resolution so pan and tilt is not necessary. I'm truly impressed with this camera so even if the battery only lasts a week, I would still give it 5 stars at this point. Setup was just too easy. If I had to request anything, it would be to allow account management so I could give access to my babysitters with limited access to settings. Also, no cloud charges?  Almost too good to be true. I hope that lasts!
 Purchased the 2 camera system in Nov, 2018. Since I live in MI, only concern I had was, how well the batteries would perform in Michigan winters? Glad to see the batteries' status still showing OK.<br/><br/>The setup was easy. Just follow the instructions and you'll be up and running in 15 mins. The camera comes with its own mount bracket but that gives you very limited direction control. I purchased these wall brackets (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D5VSM69/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and would recommend that you buy these too.<br/><br/>As is the case with all video door bells, there's a few seconds delay between when the camera detects motion and when you get the alert on your phone. Only had one issue last month where camera was not sending alerts. Customer service was very helpful in resolving the issue.
 We installed these cameras a week ago to replace outdated Zmodo camera system. I’m not a fan. I will be returning them.<br/><br/>Packaging was great: the stuff to go with each camera (batteries, mount, screw) each come in an individual package, making it easy to prepare cameras one at a time.<br/><br/>Prep: pretty easy. The hardest part was trying to remove the back of the camera without feeling like you are breaking it. Insert batteries, then leave the back off!<br/><br/>Adding to system: super easy to add to system using the app and scanning the QR code for serial number on the back of camera (inside...this is why you need to keep the back off). Cameras were recognized and connected right away. You will add one camera at a time.<br/><br/>Mounts: flimsy plastic mounts use one screw but only snap into the back of the camera. They were easy to install but left me feeling nervous that the expensive little cameras would just fall off.<br/><br/>App: This is my problem with the camera system. There is a long delay between the action taking place and receiving alerts. This does not serve my purpose at all. I need to know what is happening WHEN IT HAPPENS. For example, our driveway camera would alert as the person was walking in the back door. This means they walked 100 ft down our driveway, then another 150 feet through our carport, opened a gate and walked across our patio, before opening the door. Too late.<br/><br/>Also, there is no option to monitor live camera views as a group. You have to connect to each camera, which then allows you to watch live for a few seconds before asking if you want to continue. While watching live, there is not an option to clip video or take still shots. Again, not helpful.<br/><br/>The cameras have pretty good ability to pickup audio and decent picture quality. The WiFi range was much smaller than the cameras I was replacing, so I had to reconfigure placement to cover all areas of our property.  I do like that they have the ability to zoom on the short clips taken during alerts.<br/><br/>Overall, if you are looking for an easy to install, wireless system, that will show you what has already happened, these cameras are for you. If you are looking for a better system than the much less expensive Zmodo cameras, this is not it!

We ended up purchasing these for our non-profit just to keep our facility secure but because the theft of donations dropped off to us. We had several people claiming that they saw someone taking donations from us that were dropped off while we were closed. We didn't want to get cameras set up but eventually, it was something we decided. After much research, we knew we needed wireless cameras because our facility is made out of dirt and tires. Yeah, good luck navigating inside wiring and we didn't want to wire on the outside. We decided on blink because it overall had great reviews.<br/><br/>After weeks of using them, I have to say I am very impressed. The notifications are on point and so far the batteries are running incredibly well. I also love that we can use AA batteries to run them. The quality of the videos are impressive, you can absolutely see clear video and the sound quality actually picks up conversations really well. The night vision is overall pretty impressive as well, although the night vision only stays active in two areas because the rest of our facility has a lot of lighting.<br/><br/>I absolutely recommend this purchase and provided a video of how the cameras helped us identify donations that were taken. The only feature that would make these cameras better is if we could talk through them. Maybe in the future but for now Blink is incredible.
 Only had for about a month, but so far...<br/><br/>Cons: You can't change the alert tone.  I had to change my text tone so it wouldn't be the same, but now I have to get used to my texts being a different tone, and I wish I could choose a less annoying tone for the cameras since we get a lot of alerts.  I am new to this system, so I am also hoping I can schedule when it is on and off during the weekday and weekend without having to change it all the time.  I don't like how when another user, my husband, turns the cameras off on his phone, it also turns them off on mine.  It sometimes cuts off the beginning of a recording, but you see most of it.  would be nice to have two way sound, but not necessary.<br/><br/>Pros:  Love that I can watch live and zoom in.  Love the price (no monthly fees).  Lots of free storage. Good picture quality.  Has sound.  Alerts come quickly.  Waterproof.  NO WIRES (I have one on a tree facing the house). Super easy to install (one screw and snap onto mount).  Has better mounts you can purchase to get better angles.  Great peace of mind for thieves, dogs pooping in my yard, and keeping an eye on the teens.
 I have no clue why Amazon would put it's good name on a product like this. The instructions are confusing. The Blink website is dreadfully slow. When you *finally* get signed up on the website... the iOS app will not recognize you as a user. Something about your login credentials being wrong. There's absolutely no help available to you at this point. I had even recommended this to a friend who bought 10 of these. What a waste of money and time. The concept is good but the execution is horrific.
 I like the portability.  Being battery powered gives lots of ootions for placement and makes moving the camera easy.  If only it had a reliable connection.  I deleted and reinstalled the app on my phone but that didnt help.  Power cycling the camera itself is a non-starter...the back is difficult to remove and I would have to climb a ladder because it's placed above my garage door.  I have and currently still use 3 other brands of home security cameras.  All of which work perfectly with my current wifi router.
 Initial out of-the-box, up-close-and-personal testing I did in my house was pretty good.  However, once I got the camera outside, the motion sensing is absolutely HORRIBLE.  You literally have to be on top of camera, waving your hand right at the IR sensor to get it to respond - and that is on the highest sensitivity setting.  This product is only useful if you want to monitor your property real time.  If that’s what you desire, then this product is for you.  However, do not expect that it is going to alert you of any kind of movement unless you have it installed where the movement will be right on top of the camera. Terrible and expensive purchase for me personally.  Don’t get sucked in.
 Batteries came between 63% and 57% charge. They don't function well outdoors if there's any humidity when the temps get below 38F, they fog up something fierce.<br/><br/>One camera in particular has a terrible squeal/whine when watching it with the sound on, and that's even the one we keep inside.<br/><br/>Mounts are relatively insecure and would make easy theft targets. They just snap in and out.<br/><br/>I was told by support about 2 weeks ago that they support the RBoy SmartApp integration for SmartThings, and today (12/19) got an email saying they're no longer supporting it.<br/><br/>Servers have gone down twice making viewing "live"-feed impossible.<br/><br/>The only two good things about these cameras is that they're easy to set up, and they have a decent amount of free cloud storage. Other than that, if you want a true smart home camera system, look elsewhere.
 Objects have to be fairly close for it to trigger, night vision is mediocre. Notification of activity is slow, subjects are gone before I receive a notification.  Documentation is lacking, It backs up to a Cloud Server. I have no idea what Cloud Server. I don't know what the security on the Cloud Server is, could Blink people view the videos? Who knows. When I replaced the batteries, it lost all of the wireless settings so I had to redo the wireless process. Batteries don't last as long as they claim. If I want to upload the Videos to anything I have to select the videos one at a time. I'm limited to iOS or Android. All of above means I won't purchase another one.
 First off love the system and it works very well. BUT lets say you are like me. You care a lot about your car but you have a crazy ex who has threatened to wreck it. Sadly my garage spot is far away from my apartment which means I need a wifi extender. Now the camera is wireless, but the server module, no. So if your wifi reaches far you must account for powering the module too. You can extend the range of the module with wifi but the camera must be within 100 ft (no obstacles). So if your doing long range you must account to power the module too. Message me if you have any questions. I should have this small problem fixed soon.
 I am fuming mad a the fact that we just got this today and we're already having issues. It's only been a few hours and one of the camera's live feed isn't working already. We've tried every troubleshoot and no luck. We are leaving for the weekend and was relying on this for peace ofind. All we got is wasting our time trying to fix a problem that shouldn't have been an issue to begin with. Beyond disappointed and upset! Will be returning.
 I bought the version with one camera and the module, and it seems to be working well. The app on my iPhone is working well, and I really like the fact that I don’t have to pay for storage of the videos. We feel more secure knowing the camera is keeping an eye on our driveway and entrance.<br/>  So why only three stars? Terrible quality control. My initial setup went pretty well, using a secondary WiFi network I set up on the same floor as the camera, as our main WiFi network is in the basement. The signal was too weak, so I installed an extender for our main WiFi network. Then when I tried to set up the module for the different network, it wouldn’t reset.<br/>  Tech support was great, they responded quickly via email, but this led to our finding the module was defective, and their sending out a new one.<br/>  Then the camera didn’t work, and tech support sent out another camera. Each of these times, it took a series of emails to identify the problem and find a solution.<br/>  Bottom line—it works great now. But really.....should I have had to spend hours working on the system, not to mention two weeks to get the two replacements in?<br/>  Buyer’s remorse for sure: would a Nest or different camera system have been easier to install and reliable?
 It doesn't have every feature of more expensive systems but for the price, it's really good. I never bought security cameras before and didn't want to spend a fortune on what might be a learning experience. I give it an A for easy setup. Just opened the box, downloaded the app and followed the prompts. Picture quality is good enough for our needs, it captures sound and the motion detection is good. I like the way it integrates with Alexa  "Alexa, show me the driveway camera"]. I don't like ongoing contracts so the fact that Blink comes with free cloud storage was important. We just got it today but so far it looks like just what we need at a very good price. We bought the 5 camera set.
 I have had an Arlo system of 5 cameras for several years now, and found them troublesome for several reasons, so thought I would try a Blink XT for comparison.<br/>BETTER THAN ARLO:<br/>The application is less quirky than Arlo's, which causes random motion alarms on one or more cameras every time it's accessed. Blink's app is solid. The camera also stays solidly connected to the hub, which I can't say for the Arlos, which randomly drop from the hub for no reason. The motion detection is more consistent than Arlo's, and triggers recording sooner. The batteries and power consumption for the Blink is vastly better than Arlo's. The range of the camera to WiFi and it's hub seems noticeably better than Arlo's.<br/>WORSE THAN ARLO: The lens is inferior to the Arlo's, with noticeable color fringing, washed-out colors, and low-fidelity images; unsharp at any range. With both systems set to maximum quality video, Arlo's image quality blows Blink's away. The case design and camera mounting scheme is inferior to Arlo's. I wouldn't trust the provided mount at all; flimsy, insecure. The infrared night vision is inferior to Arlo's in image quality.<br/>BOTTOM LINE: I wish I had invested in a good wired system with local DVR looping. At some point, I will probably do that.
 But I still wanted to write a few things on my initial thoughts.  I really like this camera.  The software works great, and I got it on a black friday deal so I am happy with the price point for what it is.  The two year battery life will determine my overall impression because I get notification that it is a high traffic location and that the batteries won't last long because of that.  What's the point of a camera if you can't look at the footage?  It's still great to have.  The night vision is very impressive because there are different intensity levels you can choose to your preference.  The resolution is great, but I have found this camera to work MUCH better closer up.  I have tried it at my front door, and also up under and overhang one the second story.  The fish eye stretches just a little too much at that distance and doesn't cover nearly what I thought it should, or what my other camera does.  For the price though, it's wonderful, and you can easily travel with the thing, not needing a power source.  The reason for the 4 stars is the mount.  They include a single mount, which is not trustworthy at all.  I didn't think it was trustworthy before it broke after moving the camera one time.  I ordered replacements, which I think should be included, and if they break and this thing falls to it's death, I will return it.  Otherwise, it's working great for now!
 Had I not gotten the black friday deal I would have returned this.  I think folks are glossing over the video quality problems due to the unique features of this camera vs. the crop of wired, infrastructure-heavy competitors.  Even with all the settings turned up the video quality is not enough to tell two people apart even during daytime (suspect was wearing a blue hoodie - that really narrows things down for the police) and the night vision is not smart enough to not be blinded by a light aimed toward the camera during the short recording window.  In other words, this product isn't going to catch any but the least intelligent criminals around your house and is useless for reading license plates or otherwise producing identifying information about folks who might behave badly within its view.  On that note, the fish-eye lens makes the claimed field of view less useful than it should be  even if you could make out useful details in the middle of the frame<br/><br/>As an activity monitor for your door that doesn't require wiring or data cable runs it's not bad for $70.  As a competitor to a PoE system or one of the higher-end camera systems it's not in the same ballpark.
 I set this up to watch my parking spot 15 feet away with my car center frame and it's simply not living up to expectation. For starters, the sensitivity is way off. It's super sensitive at 9 and oblivious to any motion at 8 and below.  It can capture motion 200 feet away and nothing 15 feet away, which is what it is set to watch. The only benefit is that you can stick it anywhere and turn off the night vision.  Overall, I should have spent more time researching...
 Setting up my two new Blink cameras only took me about 30 - 45 minutes - including mounting time. While they essentially worked "out-of-the-box," I have two problems.<br/>1. Every time a car passes in front of my home (which is often), the camera records that and sends me a message. (I understand that there may now be a way to correct for that by changing its field-of-view, but I've only just read about this update and I'm unsure if it's now available.)<br/>2. I have both a light on my front door and a lamp post about 20 feet away. So, no matter how I position my camera, the glare from the lights at night totally obscure all the details from the infrared imaging - I get only a white "ghost" moving in and out of view. Not helpful at all! Of course, I could shut off the lights and it works fairly well. On the other hand, the lights themselves are part of my home safety. (Not to mention, that they're on at night so that people don't trip on the steps, etc.). As I assume that I am not the only person who has these problems, thee are probably some solutions. Probably! I I can figure out how to rectify them, I will likely purchase additional Blinks to cover other areas of my property.
 I help do Trap-Neuter-Release (TNR) for the feral cats in the community and this camera made herding cats infinitely easier. I was using a drop-down trap bed was able to catch all but two kittens. They wouldn't ever go near the trap for food if a person was watching. We normally had to peek around and the corner of a building to see if we should trigger the trap,  but the kittens always spotted us and ran away before we could even react.<br/><br/>I needed a camera that was:<br/>1. Weatherproof<br/>2. Wireless<br/>3. Able to show live footage on a cell phone or tablet<br/>4. Had night mode<br/>5. Relatively cheap<br/><br/>Enter the Blink camera. It had all the requirements! The kitten nest was not in range of my Wi-Fi. Luckily, I am on good terms with one of the neighbors with a Wi-Fi range within the kittens' area. They took care of the installation and syncing the device.<br/><br/>Even though I wasn't connected to their Wi-Fi, I was still able to log on to the Blink app and access live footage and get updates for motion detection.<br/><br/>It took my neighbor 45 minutes to set up live footage and motion detection of the trap area. Within the first 60 minutes of watching the live footage (night vision), we were able to know immediately when the kittens were in the trap, how many were under the trap, and which direction they were facing. We are not very stealthy people, but the camera made it so easy to catch them at night (the only time they came out to eat).<br/><br/>Literally within 2 hours of opening the packaging, I had caught the kittens. They are now in our county's foster care system and I wouldn't have been able to do this without Blink. I wish I thought of it sooner.<br/><br/>TNR programs, I highly recommend this product if you want a good catch rate.
 Im only goving 2 stars bc the battery does not last as long as advertised.<br/>However, I have realized the more features you have activated the shorter the battery life.<br/><br/>I do like that you can easily swap out the two lithium batteries quickly.<br/><br/>My first cam died and they gave me another one.<br/><br/>I have the black outside cam and I loved thenfact that you can place it anywhere without any wires.<br/>Its about time they made this type.<br/><br/>I use to watch front of my house and driveway.<br/>It has great features but lacks IR.<br/>Instead it used a beam of light at night.<br/><br/>Also, I was not happy with the HD.  It is 720, however it appears very unclear and blurry most of the time.  It is no where close to HD.  More like SD.<br/><br/>If you just want some minor security watching over a street or door it works ok.  You can have it up and running in minutes without running any wires.<br/>Put it anywhere.  For this camera in todays market the price was steep I thought.  Ove owned 20 security cameras and I figured the proce was bc it is fully wireless.
 I haven't started using the camera yet and even if it does everything I would want, I would still give it three stars for the terrible startup guide.  I'm a techie and I've written tech manuals.<br/><br/>Here are some examples:  the sync module goes with two USB sockets (large and Micro).  It tells you to plug in the module.  But which socket (the micro USB socket)?<br/><br/>Step 2:  "connect to the blink ### network where #### is the last 4 digits of the sync module's serial number."  I never got this message.<br/><br/>The app shows a video.  You cannot pause or restart the video if you missed something (it does repeat at the end...but c'mon...)<br/><br/>The video shows you how to insert the batteries (I still can't figure out what the gray latch does).  After putting in the batteries you close the sync module case.  You click next on the app and then you are asked to enter the serial number.  But you have to open the case again to get the serial number.<br/><br/>A typical explanation will show you a video camera icon and tell you click on it.  But on which device?  The camera?  The sync module?  The app (it's the app).<br/><br/>Where are your clips?  Nothing in the setup guide tells you.  There's an overflow (three vertical dashes) in the app but none of those accesses a clip.  Turns out there's a folder icon in the upper right of the app...but I don't know if that's even it because what is a clip?  How do I save what is currently on the camera?  How do I access it?
 The Blink XT is our first security cam and so far it has met or exceeded our expectations.  It is pretty basic but hard to beat for the price.  It’s also very nice that no monthly subscription is needed - the free cloud storage is probably more than sufficient for most users. The image quality is quite good and motion sensor works reliably (ours is set to a sensitivity level 6, to avoid being triggered by cats, squirrels, etc.  The app is straightforward to use. Both the camera &amp; sync module are very compact, and the mounting bracket works well and is easy to install.  Note that there are several steps involved in getting the system set-up initially but nothing too complicated if you follow the excellent quick start guide carefully and in the proper sequence.  There are also some very good on-line videos showing the entire process.  One improvement we’d like to see is for the camera to keep recording beyond the pre-set clip length when motion is still detected.  For example, we currently have our camera set to record 20 second clips with a 15 second “re-trigger time” between clips, which should be fine most of time (e.g., monitoring when a package is delivered, etc.).  However, it’s well know that bolder crooks will sometimes ring a doorbell, wait a bit to see if anyone answers, then try breaking in.  We’re hoping Blink will do a firmware update in the near future to address this - ideally the camera would extend a recording up to the 60 sec max clip length when motion is still being detected.  Great product - highly recommended.
 This is a solid first attempt from this company and I hope that there are more exciting updates as Amazon has now purchased them. I ended up buying the five camera set and I liked it enough to buy another five camera set for my home.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>• easy to use and set up<br/>• no cost for cloud storage<br/>• battery life is long<br/>• app support makes viewing and downloading to your phone simple<br/>• wireless means you can easily move the location of the camera<br/>• video and audio quality are pretty decent<br/>• weatherproof<br/><br/>Cons<br/>• no talkback feature, so if you see something going on you can't scare off burglar<br/>• you can only access through your phone, no web browser support<br/>• Limited cloud storage means that if you have a high traffic area, the storage fills up fast and you are forced to delete clips<br/>• you can't record live playback<br/>• cameras are limited by distance to the sync module.  Although to be fair the distance is pretty good. If you have a very large home you might need a second sync module
 I really like these little cameras. The video quality is acceptable for the price, and the installation is pretty easy. We have 2 sync modules and 4 cameras total, one set for the back of the house and one for the front. We did have to get a little NetGear wifi extender to power one of the sets, as they need good wifi access and access to each other to operate well. I like the ability to monitor with the phone app.<br/><br/>PROs: Easy to install, simple instructions, fairly crisp video<br/><br/>CONs: Monitoring kicks on by motion and that's a tad slow to activate, but not lethally so. Individual units are quite expensive. Can't use the app to monitor more than one set linked to one email address (for instance, I can't monitor my folks' setup as well from my phone, because theirs is under a different email address).<br/><br/>Suggestion: If a customer already owns a couple of sync units and at least 3-4 cameras, they ought to give you a break on adding an additional (or replacement!) camera. I would buy a couple more if they weren't $90+ apiece.  Also, make the app more robust so you can easily change to another registered system (it would help with monitoring elderly parents who don't use phone apps at all, or easily).  Great system for the money. Although it isn't cheap, at least you are not connected to some monitoring company in China somewhere. At least...I think we're not...hahaha
 This Blink camera system was very easy to set up with the instructions.  The range of the module is good enough that I have one camera on my front porch and one in my back yard, both probably 30' and 40' in opposite directions, and they have a strong connection to the module.<br/><br/>The picture quality is decent, on the middle setting.<br/><br/>It's not perfect though.  There are some "zones" that can be deactivated from motion sensing, so that there aren't a bunch of false activations.  While this is a great idea to block off the street (so I don't record cars driving by) or so I don't record a blowing shrub and billowing grill cover . . . the feature doesn't work very well, and I wind up recording many of these things anyway.  Also, one camera (only one) is very sensitive to some things, but not to others.  It will pick up a leaf blowing, but ignore the door opening.<br/><br/>However, for the money it is still a 5-star product.  I am well aware that if I wanted a perfect camera system, I would either have to spend 5x-10x the price, or get a wired system.  Or both.
 We have a had a Ring Doorbell for ~1 year now which has been nice, but the two issues I have with it are: 1) the camera angle only fits at doorbell level 2) the subscription fee - which although small, is still a few. Cue the Blink.<br/><br/>Small, durable, portable, wireless and no subscription fee! We purchased x2 on Black Friday and could not be happier with these. We mounted one above our front door archway and one over the garage.  Set up was quick and easy; maybe 30min tops including pulling out the ladder and placing cameras. Where the ring only really had how far distance wise, the camera could pick up, the Blink has a wide variety of settings that offer much more customization.<br/><br/>My only gripe with this product would be the distance it works from your router. My Garage camera is probably ~40-50ft away from my router and is juuuuust on the edge of connectivity. ~1 foot further and it will not connect to the wireless router. With that said, it works where I need it to and I am 100% pleased with the purchase. I may look into ordering 1 more in the near future as apparently x10 cameras can hook up.
 I tried to love these cameras but they've let me down several times now.  Their motion detection is erratic at the best of times and since there's no ability to continuously record to an sd card or anything else, if the the motion detector doesn't catch it, it's not recorded. It takes too long for the cameras to wake up so I get a lot of 'blank' clips, where whatever finally triggered the camera is over by the time it gets around to recording it. Worst of all, the whole system has a tendency to randomly go offline where it stops communicating with the cameras and nothing gets recorded. After the neighbors annoying free-roaming dogs set off my Wyze cam for the 20th time today it suddenly occurred to me to wonder why I wasn't getting Blink alerts. So I checked, and lo and behold, I wasn't able to connect to any of the cameras, and apparently hadn't been connected for at least 18 hrs based on the last stored clips. But there's no indication of any problem on the aggravatingly bright leds on the hub, they look like everything is peachy. I had to unplug the hub for a few minuted then reconnect. Not so convenient when you're not home, which is when you most definitely want your cameras to work. This is the second time this has happened and I'm done. Returning these.
 Fantastic outdoor camera.  I live in Maine and the temps get pretty low and the weather can be harsh.  I bought these during the summer and I finally got a low battery about a week ago.  So I would say about 8 months of use before I had to change the battery.  The location of this particular camera was at the front door with a decent amount of traffic (10-50 captures per day).  The range on these are not too shabby either.  I have really thick exterior walls and I have one installed inside a detached garage about 50 feet away and works just fine.  I recommend this to people that are looking not to run wires and want ease of use.  I have a Swann security system as well with more cameras.  The night vision on those are premium but they are also powered and use tried and true tech, but Blink gives them a run for their money.
 Overall, these are good cameras to monitor you home. I purchased these for my weekend cabin so I can check in on it while away. It is also in a remote area so I wanted some type of system to monitor the property while I am not there. This system can be 5 stars but it has a few issues. Overall I am happy with the system so far. I have had it for several days so long term, we shall see. I will update as time progresses.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>**Easy to setup and install.<br/>**Picture quality seems good.<br/>**Holds up in all weather conditions.<br/>**You can easily add on cameras.<br/>** You can view the cameras live at anytime. This was a huge plus for me.<br/>** Records audio pretty good.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>**The recording is limited. When it detects motion it will record up to 60 seconds only, then stop for 10 seconds, then record again. 10 seconds doesn't seem like a lot but it is when you want everything recorded when someone is there.<br/>**You cannot zoom in. When it records there is no zoom setting to hone in.<br/>**Yes they are wireless but you can only set them so far away before the signal is too weak from the hub inside house. I have a canine home so the walls are very thick so I couldn't place the cameras too far away. The internet speed at cabin is DSL and not super fast but these cameras do not need super fast internet.<br/>**The sensitivity is not the best. BUT the app does have a Activity Zone so you can block out trees for example that are close to camera so it wont set it off.<br/>**Delay in notifications. When a camera detects the motion it will notify you after it is recorded. You do not get a notification right when the camera detects it so there is a 10 to 60 second delay depending how long you setup the recording for.<br/>**You cannot talk in camera so if someone is there, you can say something through the camera.
 Set up went well.  Range is at least 25 meters.  Battery life is OK, it depends on how many times it is activated.  I have had three batteries that lasted over for months (so far) and two that failed after about three months.  I will say, however, that the two that failed were getting activated upwards of twenty times a day due to deer, cats, foxes etc.  One of my units failed outright due to water inundation.  Be advised that the manufacturer treats this as physical damage and will not replace it under warranty.  What they will do is give you a 50% credit toward purchase of a replacement.  All in all, I am fairly pleased with the system performance and functionality.  I also have some great wildlife videos now!
 I had a Samsung wireless camera for my apartment that I had purchased about 6 years ago. It worked fine for a majority of that time but once I moved into a house, it started having issues. Randomly disconnecting, IR not turning on at night etc...<br/><br/>I decided it was time to get something new. I looked at so many different cameras, trying to put at least two up, one in my living room and one outside to watch the front door.<br/><br/>The main problem I was having was running wires since I don't have an attic, it's just a tiny crawl space so it seemed almost impossible to get what I wanted done. Until I saw these Blink cameras that apparently could run off two lithium AA batteries for two years.<br/><br/>They were a little pricey compared to some other WiFi cameras, but I decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did so far.<br/><br/>The quality is great. Some people were complaining about picture quality but maybe their WiFi isn't giving them the best connection or something but mine look so crisp no matter when I look at them or at what time. I work at night so my house is occupied while it's dark outside and having these gives me so much peace of mind now. I have one mounted high up in a tree outside and it's been for over a week now despite rain and wind.<br/><br/>These are missing some features and I'm really hoping that they add them soon. One important one to me that is missing is audio detection alerts instead of just motion as it is now. Also the ability to live stream your camera to your phone and record clips manually.<br/><br/>Just a heads up too, these cameras state they last 2 years on 2 AA lithium batteries but that's only if you use the default recording / detection settings. Which I believe is 5 second clips with a 30 second reset time. To me that seems like too long to wait to start recording such a short clip.<br/><br/>Even if it only lasts 1 year on a pair of batteries, I'll be happy to spend a few bucks and swap out the batteries since that is easy to do.<br/><br/>These aren't for everyone, I'd do some more research first but overall I am extremely satisfied with how these have been working so far.
 First, it should be noted that after you purchase this product Blink will send you an email asking for your review. If you click anything less than 4 stars in that email, it directs you to customer service, if you click 4 or 5 stars, it sends you to Amazon for review. This is important because the company is funneling positive experiences to Amazon, which is likely tainting the objectivity of the reviews here.<br/><br/>The cameras were easy to connect to my Wi-Fi system and work well through the app. The reason I am giving 3 stars is that the lenses are too exposed to the weather, and the mounting brackets are very poor.<br/><br/>I purchased 2 cameras to monitor the outside of my home. One camera was setup at my front porch, and the other looking at my side yard. The one on the porch has been fine, but it is covered by the roof. The one at the side yard is fully exposed. The camera at the side yard is constantly fogged up because of moisture and in the rain gets completely unusable because the lens gets wet. The front of the camera is completely flat, so there is nothing protecting the lens and sensors from weather. Given how easily it was to pop off the back of the camera to insert the batteries, I am skeptical it will even hold up through the winter and expect the electronics to corrode rather quickly. Time will tell.<br/><br/>The other major issue is the mounting. The cameras come with a small clip that screws into the wall with a single center mounted screw. This is adequate given the weight of the camera, but the camera snaps into the mount very lightly. It takes almost no pressure for it to pop off. I've had the camera pop off its mount a few times already because a cat brushed into it. There is no way to screw it on. Despite these cameras being at the low end, they are still over $100 and its not something you want to fall off into a puddle or easily snatched by a thief.<br/><br/>With a few small design tweaks, and a more ethical review process and this could be a 5 star product.
 After spending MANY times more than what you can buy a three camera Blink system for, we are THRILLED with our Blink systems.  We have two- each with  5 cameras - so we "added" on cameras.  They work seamlessly... effortlessly.  They COME WITH lithium batteries.  Honestly, if my husband and I can figure this out.. ANYONE can.  I love that we don't have to "buy" anything else... cloud space.. or monthly rental fee of any kind.  As long as you have wifi... it works.  One way sound - (so no two way talking - but we find we don't need that) - cameras are night vision at night and are perfectly clear.  The system we paid so much more for doesn't work even 1/2 as well.  *sigh*  Live and learn.  Just wish we would have had Blink first.  Note:  we have our wifi system on a battery back up to help with power outs.. but if your wifi goes down, so do your cameras.. just want to be fair and honest... So far, that has not been an issue.  They just work flawlessly.  Could not be happier with how they work or how easy they are to set up and install.  Also Note:  We purchased the upgraded mount - it is worth the few extra dollars to get the most out of your camera position.  Having said all that... I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.  And I really hope my review was helpful to you some way!
 So I LOVE the camera but... The hinge is weak and I had to rig it up to keep it from allowing the camera to reposition with gravity.<br/>The sound and image is clear and it works well with IFTTP so I can use other smart apps when the camera triggers.  I have the Lutron Caseta system so when the motion detection triggers, the lights come up.  Another layer of security.<br/>These cameras are really a good deal.  You can't beat the price and options that come with it.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the hinge issue.  All it caught the day the neighbors contractor used our power outlet was his drop cord and shoe.  Had the hinges heldfast, we could have seen who was in our yard.<br/>I'm thinking about a second camera in another location. I have one indoor camera and I love it too. Even with the hinge issue I recommend this product.
 Bought this set early October and installed it outdoors, one camera above the garage for the drive way and one facing my door steps.<br/>The garage camera did work for maybe a week or two, then went out. They replaced it within a week or so. The new one now, about 1 1/2 - 2 month in service, is again not working. I contacted them and wait now for response. It is said the battery to last a year at least, but this is now the second camera that had a very short battery life. The other camera, the one overseeing the front door is still fine and never had an issue.<br/>Make sure to careful place them when installing. I had a problem with too sensitive settings and pointing it too far out, every car driving by set it off.<br/>After some adjustments to camera position and sensitivity they do what they supposed to do.<br/><br/>If the one camera would have been fine, I would give this 5 stars, however one of the cameras failing twice within a three month period, its only three stars. They should include an extra set of batteries.
 So.. I have mixed thoughts on these cameras. I bought these to replace cheaper outdoor cams we use in our duck house. I liked that there was 5 in a pack, that means I could set up a few to point out into the woods as well as in the house/run itself. Seemed great! However....<br/><br/>First, the Pros: The setup itself was really easy. Much easier than the cheap cameras I have now. I set up all 5 in probably under 30 minutes. Being completely wireless is another huge bonus. They're easy to mount, however, the bracket that comes with each camera is pretty flimsy, and they pop off pretty easily.<br/><br/>The biggest con is the wifi range was too short, and the signal was too weak to show the live feed. I moved the little sync module around in different areas, and nothing worked. When the cameras were close, it worked great!  If you want these set up at your front door or back porch I am sure they will work perfectly fine. Our duck house is 100' from the house itself, and that was too far for these little boogers.<br/><br/>All in all, I still think they're good cameras, if you want them for close range to the router.
 I cant believe that in this day and age, a product would limit your access. Back in the nineties companies would say Your have to use IE, or you have to use Mozellia browser to see this web page.  Then they all woke up and figured out that people use different tools and things became accessible everywhere, IOS, Android, whatever browser.  This company has decided to NOT make their product available everywhere.  No browser access.
 I did a lot of shopping around for a simple home security setup that doesn't require a lot of installation or ongoing costs. This is, as far as I can tell, the best solution. Being battery-powered, it is truly wireless, so you really just need to tack these up wherever you want them. The app is solid and easy to use.<br/>If you want a robust security system, this is probably not in the league you should be looking. But for a cheap, easy, low-hanging-fruit solution, you won't do much better.<br/><br/>PS: Also worth noting that the wirelessness and modularity can make this especially flexible. For example, we could easily move a camera inside to keep an eye on a babysitter, monitor for rats, etc. Your mileage may vary, but it's worth noting that the system could be useful for lots of little things
 I purchased this camera because I had seen it mentioned on a Facebook neighborhood watch group post.  I was already an owner of 7 Wyze cams and 4 Momentum cameras.  I decided to order it when I saw the price drop to $80 on Amazon from it's original $129.  I will explain what I like and don't like about this compared to the other cameras I own.  First it is much better then the Momentum cameras.  I've owned the Momentum for several years primarily to keep an eye on our pets when we are not at home.  The Momentum cameras serve their purpose when they work, but they seem to connect and disconnect from the wifi with no known reason.  They may work for weeks, then stop, then start up again without being touched. Currently only 2 of my 4 are working, and I cannot get the other 2 to reset.  I use them for live viewing only because you have to pay for the cloud.  The Blink Camera was very easy to hook up and sync'd right away with my wifi.  The app was also very easy to navigate.  Once it was on, it stayed on meaning it didn't lose the wifi connection (I have cable internet and a wifi extender).  What I liked best about the Blink Camera is the ease of hookup, the app settings, the notifications, the free cloud service, and most especially that they are small and battery operated.  I also like the idea of the temperature sensor, and being able to set activity zones to avoid a lot of unnecessary notifications.  What I don't like is that I don't feel the camera works consistently.  Sometimes the video clip plays longer, and other times it plays a few seconds and just freezes.  I've also noticed that it doesn't pick up all motion.  I have it set on our front door, and there are times when I know someone opened the door, but yet I didn't receive a notification on the app.  I've played around with the settings, but I'm not sure why I have the inconsistency.<br/>I also own the Wyze brand cameras, which I also found advertised on Facebook.  Wyze has two different types of cameras, a Wyze Cam which sells for about $25 with shipping, and a Wyze Pan Cam which sells for about $38 with shipping.  I purchased one Wyze cam and got addicted, I currently own 5 cams and 2 Pan cams (the Pan cams allow you to rotate the actual camera 360 degrees, and tilt up/down.  The Wyze cams are not weatherproof and not designed for outdoor use, but I did find a forum where many customers still used them outdoors using an aftermarket silicone covering $15 on Amazon.  I have had 5 cameras mounted outdoors (with the silicone cases) in the heat, the rain, the snow and have not had an issue with any of them.  I know others have placed them on window sills and just turned off the night vision which works well if you have enough light outside (flood lighting, or street lighting).  The Wzye cams offer personalized notifications, free cloud storage (you can also install a $10 micro sd card), 2 way intercom, ability to capture a still shot or a video during live viewing or playback, and an alarm settings to alert you if your smoke detector or CO detector go off.  The only drawback I have for the Wzye cam is they need to be plugged into an outlet to be installed, where the Blink system can go anywhere because it is battery operated.  If I hadn't already purchased the Wyze cams, I probably would have liked the Blink much more, but you get way more bang for you buck with the Wzye cams.  I just think the Blink camera is way over priced.
 I like everything about this surveillance system EXCEPT... the mounting unit included is SUPER janky and I would never mount this camera on it and expect it to survive ANY length of time. Its always a major disappointment when you buy something and there's one SIMPLE improvement that would make the system great. I highly advise spending the extra $11 on an upgraded camera mount. Its really a 5 star system (if you only have one camera, see other reviews regarding the potential and actual issues with multiple cameras) but the annoyance of having to upgrade to a reliable mount for outdoor use is enough for this consumer to knock off 2 stars. k. bye.... we are watching you....
 I watched so much youtube videos before buying this but I sent it back the same day. My main gripes; there is a long delay between what is shown and what is actually happening - The video quality is very bad - Blink pulled suppport for Smartthings so I could not integrate with my other devices. What is liked; it is small, battery operated and easy to setup. Hopefully Blink make a better camera and in the next version. I went ahead and bought the arlo. Arlo also have a delay but it is overall much better. Although Blink is one hundred dollars less than the Arlo, I prefer to pay more to get a better product than to pay less and not be satisfied with the product.
 UPDATE: After 4 months the batteries are starting to die. I have lithium batteries in them and use the cameras somewhat often. I do occasionally check the cameras maybe once a day or at least about twice a week. I have them on a motion schedule at night and when im at work. when they work they work great. However there are times when a bird or tree branch moving will set it off and then other times when UPS will drop off a package or the trash will get picked up and somehow that did not trigger it to record. So it can be hit and miss. I've played with the motion sensitivity but have yet to find a good setting that wont create a ton of clips and wont miss important events. Im kinda on the fence about these cameras.<br/><br/>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Below is my original review after having them for about a week&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/><br/>The cameras work great so far and i like how easy it is to set up and move the cameras if needed. The quality of the video from cameras is great and so is the sound quality. You will get a washed out image at night if a light is shining at it though.<br/><br/>The main reason i gave it only 3 stars is for the hassle if you want to expand. Its easy to add more cameras, thats not the issue. Its the price to add more. I got the 5 camera bundle. I like the cameras and might want to add more at some point. However if you buy say one camera with a Sync Module it will cost $129.99. If you buy just a Sync Module its $49.99. So you would think for a customer that already has a Sync Module and just wants to add a camera it would be about $80, but its not. Its $119.95. They only give you $10 off for buying the camera without the Sync Module yet charge $49.99 for the Sync Module when you buy it by on its own. Im not sure if ill ever expand past the 5 I have as long as its at that price.
 Because of the price we were able to put several of these up on our home and outside. The only issue is that they don't pan but they do have a wide angle. The software is easy to use and you can set up alerts for when you're not at home. It's great to monitor solicitors, package arrivals and your kids if they're home alone. We used to have foscam but the software was glitchy. These network well. The response time from trying to view the system remotely is quick and there's little lag. I can watch my daughter sneak in some Fortnite when she should be doing homework and yell at her from upstairs.
 I am pleasantly surprised with the camera. Clear picture and stays safe from the elements. It is installed outside the garage and has so far been through, snow, rain, wind and temperatures in the teens. And still works perfect. The only complaint (although minor), is the field of vision. It is a tad bit limited. That said, the software side of it could see some improvements. Specifically as it relates to the motion detection functionality. Which is basically what I would assume most people buy these for. Currently, the options are limited in regards to how long the recording loop is when it detects (60 seconds). And you can't set any timing parameters around when the motion detection is on. Basically it is on or off. You can't for instance say set it to have motion on overnight and not during the day. Or something similar. Also, the night vision can be a bit tough to tweak depending on light sources near the camera.  But I am pretty confident that they'll eventually get these things worked out.

He came two days in a row and the second day he walked up to my gate and started discussing something. The audio is here and there, but it was pretty clear he wanted what wasn't his. See footage attached.<br/><br/>Immediately submitted a police report and camera footage was provided to them. Then when the perp came around later that day, the entire neighborhood was on watch and confronted the guy! He hasn't come back since, hoping that scared him off, but you bet your aunt fanny I'm keeping an eye for his vehicle and any one that walks up to my gate.<br/><br/>Going to order more for the back half of the property, because I like having the piece of mind these cameras give me.  Being a single woman living alone, you can never be too careful!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Night vision isn't ideal, but I'm not sure of a cam at this price that has better<br/>Day vision, couldn't read the license plate on either cam footage.
 The granularity of the motion detection sensitivity settings on these cameras is really just not good in my experience.  I have two cameras, one pointing at the front door from the front porch railing and another facing outward through the glass windows on the side of the door.  I can have people walk on to the porch to the front door and quickly leave without ever being detected, while, meanwhile getting constant clip uploads because a bush in the landscaping blows in the wind every now and again.  I have tried various combinations of settings and using the image zones / masking to limit what will trigger a clip and ensure that a person stepping on the porch is captured.  But I have dozens and dozens of clips of nothing happening at all even though UPS walked up in full view of the camera and left a package on the porch.<br/><br/>I love the design of the system and that remote access is automatic.  But if I can't trust it to capture human events happening at the front door, the system has very limited utility.  At this point I plan to move the cameras to a less sensitive area (back yard maybe) and find an alternative to deploy in this more critical environment.  Really disappointing, honestly.
 For the price, this is a great little system. My only complaint is the sensitivity is a little wonky. Sometimes a skittering leaf will set it off... other times it doesn’t start recording until someone is already walking away from the front door. But mostly it’s good. I get notifications on my phone with each motion detection, and I can open the app to see what it just captured. It also has a live view option, records sound, and has adjustable settings, like length of recording, etc. We just had the coldest temps in the history of Chicago this winter, and somehow the batteries still survived!
 I have both the inside and these outside blink cameras throughout my home.  Because of the affordable price and super easy set up I’m able to have one in each room as well as every side of the house.  My only major issue is the delay in playback of a video at times since it’s in the cloud so to speak and the delay in live video at times as well as the inability to see live when it’s recording and the inability of it to record while you are live.  But over all for the price and the easy set up I can’t complain.  The batteries would probably last two years if no action ever triggers the motion recording.  My inside ones never need batteries changed but the outside ones with the coyotes and neighbors dogs and cats as well as the delivery guys my cameras are always going off and need battery replacement.  I would love for these simple wireless cameras to offer two way audio communication but obviously that feature only comes with its hard wired competitor.  Overall I am very pleased with the quality and ease of use.
 I ordered on Tuesday, had them Wednesday and installed them Wednesday afternoon.  Left home Thursday for extended trip. A week and two days later my home was burglarized, Blink caught the activity, notified me and I contacted my home Dispatch center. Deputies arrived within 8 minutes and caught three thieves and got all our property back!  I am thrilled and my husband is convinced we need security.  Make sure your area has lighting if you want to catch night time intruders!
 A basic product, but I would not use this system as my main source of security at all. First, it's great this is wireless and that is probably the only pro. The issues with this system is it really is not to survey in real time, as the camera takes forever and often will not show real time footage- it will say system busy 90 percent of the time. This system mostly depends and relies on recorded footage stored in the "cloud". I use this to see if there are packages at the door as delivery folks do not like to knock in 2018. I also use it when I travel to see who has come by the house. Other than that, I recommend Nest, a much better real time system.
 For the price (I got it on sale for $80), it's a decent little system. No storage fees, easy to set up, and smartphone notifications. The picture is really clear. The con is the camera's inconsistency. I keep it on a setting or 8 or 9 for sensitivity. Sometimes a movement from a shadow will trigger the motion sensor, other times not even a person will trigger it. I've had packages dropped off that were in clear sight and no clip was recorded. When I look at the feed, just a package appears. I've swung optn the door and picked up the package and walked back inside, though none of it triggers the motion sensor at times. Overall, I'd give this about a 6/10 because it works most of the time. That being said, I wouldn't pay full price for this.
 This is not worth the time or money.  Motion detection is horrible.  Lag is ridiculous.  Notifications are too flaky to be trusted.  This is my fourth wireless system i tried... Hopefully in the future they fix all the major flaws.  I'm going wired..  I live in a row home with a powerful wireless router.  The distance from the router to the sync module was less than 25 feet direct line.. and to the camera maybe less than 30.  Still would have horrible connection.  I placed both right on top of the router as a test.. the lag was still almost 30 seconds.  NOT WORTH THE INVESTMENT!
 Over the years I've had three generations of cameras for security.  The Blink cameras are my latest and are a magnitude better than anything to date.  Easy setup, easy installation, and easy to use.  Really like the completely wireless installation.  Battery operated, so no power cord.  Placed the sync unit near my wi-fi router on the second floor of my house. Then one camera at the front door and one camera at the rear door and still get good signals and operation.  The video image is very clear, in color and there is sound.  The instructions with the system are very basic, but the app downloaded to my phone guided me through it and made it really easy.  Also, the Blink website has very good detail, instructions, and video.  You just can't go wrong.  Blink really set this up well from the website to the app to the camera system.  The app makes arming or disarming the cameras  and viewing camera clips super easy.  You can also change camera settings (like extended the clip length from the default 5 secs. to something longer).  I am very impressed with this security camera system and would recommend it to everyone.
 I bought this camera over a year ago after someone stole one of my deliveries. The camera worked well for the first few months that I had it. Installation was fast and simple. However, fast forward to now, the camera eats up the batteries. I have had to install new batteries in the camera every two weeks. It's motion detector has been failing. The area where the camera is located is on the front porch of my home, with a unobstructed view of my mailbox. Unfortunately, this side also faces the street and there is a lot of regular traffic and foot traffic. One would think that the motion detector would pick up the foot traffic. Well it doesn't. It will record the person at the last moment before they step out of the frame and have already passed the front of my home. However, it will pick up random movement in homes across the street, as well as, some random cars that pass, but not all.<br/><br/>There was even an instance where the mailman brought into my yard, right next to my mailbox, three large packages. The camera only recorded before the mailman got there and after the mailman had already dropped off the packages. It did not record anything from when the mailman dropped off the packages. Recently any videos that are recorded are shown with a pinkish fuchsia tint to them.<br/><br/>I have tried moving and working with the settings that are offered in the app, to no avail. I really wanted this camera to work out for me and my home since it is nice and compact. However, it has not and I will have to replace it with one that will do a better job and has a better battery life.
 pros: good price, easy install, nice looking, battery powered.<br/>cons: slow to react to start recording video (about 3-5 seconds are lost after motion detected),<br/><br/>things to improve. possibly continuous recording so as soon as motion detected it will actually add 3-5 seconds of video before motion detected. send notification right away as soon as motion detected to a phone instead of after video is recorded (which delays notification by how long your video clip is). enable cameras to record in its own memory if the wifi is weak and then upload to cloud (possibly build in micro sd card slot for users to add memory)
 Firstly, I am very pleased with the performance of this product.<br/>Things that I like; The price was good. There are no subscription fees for file storage. The product has great motion detection. IR images are strong, meaning records in dark well. Sounds record as well. Was easy to connect and setup. The phone app is easy to use and intuitive.<br/>Things I do not like; 1. The mounting bracket included with this product is cheap and flimsy. You must purchase an additional mount. The aftermarket mount was $10 and easy to install. 2. They say battery life is two years. Let’s get real here. If you get 6 months out of your batteries then you are doing good. If you set everything to the lowest sensitivity, lowest quality, and shortest record time then you may get a year or two. Low sensitivity and short video times defeat the purpose of why I got this. Just purchase batteries to have on hand when they go flat.<br/>Blink is a good system and I have recommended Blink to my curious neighbors who have noticed the camera.
 The set up on this was easy. The mounting bracket that comes with the Blink XT is not adequate and is the big reason why I cannot give it 5 stars. The default sensitivity is '5' on the app. I bumped it up to '6' and things were fine. At '7' however, it was too sensitivr so I went back to '6'. I have my Blink XT placed on my back porch so there is little traffic and I have not experienced an excessive number of false trips. Don't place it anyplace that has a lot of movement ot it will trip all the time. After one month, battery life is fine. The clips I get are clear and the night vision is adequate. If you're looking for something basic, low-cost and of good quality, this might be what you're looking for. I just wish the bracket was better!
 It was was a little frustrating getting the module connected to my home network and the camera connected to the module but I eventually got it working after a many tries.  Three months later it began making strange clicking sounds and stopped working altogether.  I tried restarting it, replacing the batteries, connecting to AC power cord, resetting via paper clip, deleting and re-adding the camera in the software app but nothing I tried worked.  So I finally opened a service ticket on the Blink website and they responded within a few hours and apparently pushed a firmware update to the camera and then emailed me back to delete and re-add the camera one more time so it would install updated.  It's been working fine since then, but I did knock a star off my review due to all these issues.<br/><br/>I would also like to see them add a web interface so I can view the camera on my home computer.  Currently, the only method available to view the cameras is via the cell phone app.
 I bought this for my son-in-law because my daughter and he had a break in at their home. Well I did not waste much time in looking around at different systems and I did not want them to have to pay a fee each month.  Bought this for his birthday and he is thrilled with the system. If someone comes up around their home, the camera immediately notifies his  cell phone and the live picture is right there for him to see who it is. The system sends the live video to the cloud so he has it later to look at. You can put up 10 cameras with one system and he is excited about adding more around his home. Very sensibly priced to.
 This is exactly what I needed, an affordable way to monitor the house that is easy to setup and has no cloud storage fees!<br/><br/>Since the batteries don't last long, I ordered a solar panel for the camera mounted on the front of the house.  I have this camera aimed so that it will record anyone getting into our mailbox but unfortunately that means a lot of recordings of passing cars, sharply reducing battery life.  But no problem, the solar panels are cheap and have their own battery to power the camera at night.<br/><br/>The video quality is very good.  The audio quality is spectacular.<br/><br/>The batteries for the outside cameras won’t last two years.  I really don’t know why they advertise that.  But again, having solar will mitigate the cost.  I also for now am using 2800mah rechargeables even though the owners manual says only to use lithium batteries.  But the camera works fine.<br/><br/>I looked at most all the current offerings and this system made the most sense for my needs.  It also looks like more components are arriving soon to make it a full spectrum home security product vs. just cameras and cloud storage.
 First let me say that these are nice cameras. I am not at all sorry for my purchase.  The photo quality is excellent in day light and acceptable at night.  Having the videos stored on the cloud AT NO COST is HUGE!  That being said, there are a few features somewhat lacking:<br/>1.  The mount.  The camera snaps onto the mount; it is not held by screws or threads.  Anyone with a long stick could knock the camera off the mount.  A half-screw fastening would be more secure.<br/>2.  The alarm tone.  There is no separate distinct alarm or alert tone if used with an iPad or iPhone.  The stock alert I get is the same as my  mail, so it's really not an "alert."<br/>3.  Lag time.  The camera must finish recording before an alert is sent to ipad or phone.  In order to get a decent video, I have mine set for15 seconds recording.  Therefore, it's not really practical to prevent a snatch-and-run of a package from my front door.  Hopefully, it will at least catch a photo of the perp.<br/><br/>I would not hesitate to recommend this camera to a friend.  I'll do an update when I have to change batteries.  The two year life is based on taking 10 5-second videos a day.  Like I said, mine are set for 15 seconds, so I suspect a shorter battery life.
 I gave a five-star rating since Blink XT is the only cam out there fulfilling the four requirements below in a budget of $130.<br/><br/>Here is what I need:<br/><br/>1. outdoor device having a weather proof design<br/>2. battery powered with at least one year running time (blink claims two years running time)<br/>3. PIR motion sensor for reliant motion sensing<br/>4. free clip storage - no monthly subscription fee<br/>You may not want<br/>a. continuous video streaming<br/>b. browser based interaction and configuration<br/>Blink XT is perfectly running on batteries since months and I got zero false alarms. The recorded video clips are according to my needs. The video quality is decent and I can take real-time photo shoots which I can’t store. And I can run a short real-time video sequences which I can’t store either. Since Blink XT has a small housing with no cords attached I can place it everywhere on the yard. There is no subscription fee. Subscriptions with other brands can cost you $10 a month or even more. One final word on the battery that came with the Bilk XT: it’s the only one providing the proposed two years of power. So, if you take a different one lifetime will be shorter.<br/>There are some minor flaws with Blink XT. The plastic mounting brackets are designed for indoor use and may be destroyed by stronger wind force. I don’t use the Blink brackets I am using metal brackets instead. The app is OK but if I could take photo and store it right from the app would be great. There is no tablet mode for the app which would be nice. There is no browser interface to access the clips or Blink XT with no app. I am OK with all the minor limitation since Blink XT is to my current understanding the only cam out there meeting my need to have requirements 1 to 4 as above.<br/>If you are looking of an indoor cam there are better corded systems available for a bargain price such as the Foscam C1.<br/>But if you need a battery powered weather proof cam there is no completion to the Blink XT, according to my todays knowledge (prove me if I am wrong in a budget of $130).
 So these cameras have some neat features going for them. They’re super easy to set up, you can turn individual cameras on or off, see live feeds, take snapshots, and they’re wireless. There are no monthly fees, which is huge.<br/>However, they also lack some key features and have some serious issues. While you can see live feeds, you can only do so for short periods of time before the feed is interrupted as the system asks you if you want to continue the feed. Also, you can only view live one camera at a time, and you can’t save snapshots or clips to your phone or other device; you can only view the clips in the app.<br/>Most importantly to me, they almost become useless if there are any trees or plants in the “scene”. Wind will set the motion detection off very easily, and the only way around that is to set the sensitivity of the sensor so low that then anyone can walk past them and they motion detector won’t be activated. Even movement of shadows as the day goes by will trigger them, and you’ll be receiving a bunch of false alarms during the day. Because you can’t designate zones within the “scene”, this problem is pretty much unavoidable.<br/>I hope the engineers are working on a solution and they find a fix soon.
 I’m truly amazed at the ease of installation. It was so simple. The picture quality is far better than any security camera I’ve ever seen. The cameras come with two lithium 1.5v aa cells. They’re supposed to last two years. I changed some of the parameters of the recording and was warned that it could shorten the battery life. I ordered a supply of rechargeable lithium batteries and a charger to have back-up.<br/>The app I downloaded walked me through the entire installation process. It couldn’t have been easier. The app will let you remotely turn on or off the system. It will let you monitor a particular camera including sound. Excellent sound quality. It will let you check battery health so you will know if battery power is getting low.<br/>I can’t speak enough about how much I love this system. I bought the five camera system but I’m thinking of buying more for indoor use to monitor my pets. The biggest drawback is the cost of the cameras to add on. The system will handle up to ten cameras and I could easily find a use for ten cameras. But at $120 each, it’s a bit steep. Seems they could offer add on’s at a better price for existing system owners.<br/><br/>Big plus is no monthly monitoring fees. Big minus is it depends on your internet service. During power outage or internet service outage you have no security cameras.<br/>Overall I’d give it a 6 star. I’d buy again. Thinking of buying another package for my 84 year old mother so I can monitor her.<br/><br/>Note to Blink:  please work on a pricing break for multiple camera buyers.
 Would never sync to my wifi network.  The troubleshooting information did not help either.  I am pretty tech savvy but this thing would never connect no matter how many times I tried.  Will return and get something of better quality.
 I am a very critical reviewer (read my reviews) but I think Amazon understands how a product should work and they designed this simple yet very powerful security system. The system is powered with batteries so there is no need for a electrical outlet to power the unit. Very easy to set up and good enough pictures. It ias very reasonably priced at $78 for the set of an XT outdoor camera and a wifi base unit. Plus free cloud storage! I bought another set and connected the camera only, keeping base unit as a spare. Overall, I tell people to buy and install Blink system. I still kept ADT security system just in case the intruder disguises and makes face unrecognizable.
 Have had the set for only about two weeks, but it has been working fine.  Set up was easy.  Fine tuning and adjusting the camera's are simple through the settings or manually adjusting them.<br/>Blink needs to develop a more versitile camera Bracket that can adjust the camera view from side to side easier, in addition to up and down.<br/><br/>Received my order quicker through Amazon after waiting for and them cancelling a order through Blink.
 The ONLY reason I do not give a 5 star is because I keep hearing that the batteries last 2 years on their site.  I have heard up to two years and I have heard for a year.  They do not last anywhere near that.  The batteries that came with the initial order lasted a month maybe.  The energizer Ultimate Lithium that I got to replace them with, about 2 months.  After 2 emails to blink on their site about the batteries still no response or offer to at least send another set for my 2 cameras.  I do like it though and have ordered another on here at the Zon.  Worth the money, look for the promo's and make sure they are really good promotions.  If it wasn't for the lack of at least a response from blink about the batteries I would 5 star it.  Yes, the sensitivity as to how often it comes on and how long it records and if you use the light will affect the longevity of the battery.  Light only comes on in near total darkness though.  Not often.  I don't have high sensitivity because I don't want all of the notifications and battery using recordings.  I want a recording of 5 to 15 seconds depending on the area and a notification for me to look to see if anything is amiss.  Test it for in house dogs and you going thru and set it to where it would come on soon enough and record long enough if some one were to enter the zone.  I have a long reset on that because I don't want it coming back on as soon as it goes off.  I just need a recording of who set it off and a notification that I may need to turn the cam on from my phone and have a look.  Also set sensitivity to not come on with the squirrels but for when you walk into the viewing area.  I have a longer recording time for my out door cams.  All in all this is the system for me vs others on the market though I may look at something similar that does something this one does not like ring so that I also can speak to the potential perpetrator to enhance my overall security.  The sound recording from blink is good on the recording, I just can't speak, I can just hear.  The recording pick up sounds fine.
 So far, I've only had this product about a week. It may be too early for a review, but I'll list some things I've noticed. I bought this product primarily because I wanted something truly wireless. I own a concrete home. The idea of buying / renting an SDS drill to drill holes in my house, run wiring and trying to conceal everything is daunting to say the least. I wanted something more plug and play.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Very easy to setup (I was up and running in around 20 min)<br/>- Snap shots or live video feed help to mount cameras and show positioning on your phone while doing so.<br/>- Battery powered makes it more efficient to mount if you have a concrete house and hate the idea of running a bunch of wiring.<br/>- Can mount literally anywhere within wifi / sync distance without having to deal with hiding wires.<br/>- It connects with my Amazon fire stick so I can view live feeds from my TV just through asking Alexa.<br/>- Can watch live feed or clips from your phone while you're away.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Connectivity is a constant issue. I have wifi repeaters through my house to boost signal, but you cannot boost signal on the sync device.<br/>- The cameras further away from the sync device are always timing out when you try to snapshot or livefeed.<br/>- Video recording doesn't start sometimes until whatever it was trying to capture is out of frame.<br/>- IR picture quality is not the best. Daytime seems ok though.<br/><br/>Overall, I can't say whether I recommend this product or not. I'd say it highly depends on your needs. At this point in time, it seems there is a very limited number of home surveillance systems that are truly wireless, each with their own discrepancies. If you can afford the patience and time to run a wired system, I'd recommend going that route. If you want a wireless system, this works decent enough. Maybe in the future, Blink will have all these things worked out through software updates. The only comparable item I've seen on the market is the Arlo system. From reading its reviews, it seems to have its own issues and costs nearly twice the price of this one.<br/><br/>Will Update if anything changes.
 The cameras are decent. Easy to setup and not too bad picture quality. What is lacking is knowledgeable customer support. I had an issue with one of two cameras. I posted to support what was not happening and asked for help. Six hours and Jennifer answers me and obviously never read my question. She just starts reading to me on how to setup the cameras. Wait, one works perfect so I'm guessing I set it up right. I paid $250 for this setup. I expect support to at least read my question fully. Time to return these before my 30 days are up and go another brand like the arlo.
 I owned 2 Dropcam and 1 Nest Cam (same company, now). So I'm very familiar with those type of cameras. I decided to give it a try because their claim to run for over 1 year on batteries, so not need to run a power cable, and they say they don't need a contract in order to record and review your footage, slam dunk, right?  Not so fast.<br/><br/>So far I spent about 1 hour of my life I'll never get back and it just won't record anything, It will stream but it won't record, of course I opened a ticket with tech support, but  I don't have unlimited time to coax every new device to work.  If you want something that does what it claims to do the first time out the box without babysitting it or becoming a part time job, just get a Nest Cam.
 I bought this 5-camera set after reviewing many options. This one fit the bill - multiple indoor/outdoor cameras, day/night, motion sensor, didn't need to hook up to power, wireless with an app. So far this set has exceeded my expectations. I already had a standard alarm system for the interior, but no cameras for the exterior. I did make the point of installing on wood frames around doors with the screw, which wasn't hard at all. If you don't want to use a drill, just get the point of the screw going and enough pressure let's you finish the job. The pictures are clear and the recordings capture sound. They are even clearer at night than I expected. You can dial up or down the sensitivity which is good. One of my front door cameras kept getting all the cars driving by the house even 75 feet away. The cameras run on 2 AA batteries which will need to be replaced periodically. But the app shows the battery life and will let me know when I need to replace them. I personally like this because in a power outage my cameras will still function. I have my wireless router and the XT Control Unit on a backup battery (UPS) so I don't have to worry about this. When I save up another $500 I plan to get the next 5 cameras to cover more areas of the yard and house, and not just entry ways. My XT Control Unit goes up to 10 cameras so this should do it
 I would say this system is just ok.  The price is good and My husband wanted it because it’s wireless which is nice but other then that I’m disappointed in several things. I thought I read that it had two way audio but it does not. You can only listen. The wall mounts that come with it are pretty much just cheap plastic that you mount flat against the wall. No tilting or angling to get a better view.  The camera itself has no pan or tilt capabilities. I have baby monitors that do a much better job then these. You have to buy separate wall mounts if you want the camera to get a different view then just straight ahead. The picture quality isn’t great. The motion sensing is hit and miss. And the adjustment for length of recording and retrigger are confusing. If we could’ve tried these somehow before installation I doubt we’d have kept them. Also I would suggest getting a camera that is the same manufacturer of your security system. We made the mistake of getting the ring security system with the blink cameras so now we have two apps to monitor and get notifications from.
 I was in the market for an outdoor camera system and saw an ad for a one day sale on the Blink system. One of the things that made me choose Blink was no subscription fee for storage of video archive footage.<br/><br/>Setup was a breeze and only took a couple of minutes to get the positioning dialed in.<br/><br/>They advertise a years worth of battery life, this is for areas with less traffic, if you are getting a lot of motion captures battery life will be considerably less.<br/><br/>This system is pretty basic, but what it does, it does it well. Video and picture quality is good and adjustable to save battery life. From some of the emails I've received from Blink it sounds like they are adding some functionality in the future.<br/><br/>IR illumination is pretty good amplifying the smallest light sources.<br/>Motion capture is a little hit or miss, you can adjust the sensitivity of each camera so you might need some time to get this feature to work the way you need it, however you can adjust on the fly with the mobile app.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Fast setup<br/>Good IR illumination<br/>Free storage<br/>Expandable<br/>Great advertised battery life<br/>Water resistant<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Additional cameras are expensive<br/>As of May 2018 there's no browser support although this might change.
 Good product, sees in the dark and takes clear pictures/video. I have 4 of these now and I like them. Easy to use, custom settings available in app, and works with Alexa and the app.<br/><br/> You can tell your Echo dot to show me the front door and boom it's on your TV if you have fire TV. That's cool. No set up to do that, that's why I use the Amazon stuff. The Dot sees the Fire TV and it just works, the Dot sees the Blink camera and it just works. It just works.<br/><br/> Garage doors. Now there is a problem. The camera registers side to side movement or body heat not up and down movement. So your garage camera won't tell you your door has malfunctioned and opened. However the second somebody walks in it will trigger. I tested this. We need a sticker or something to put on our garage doors that the Blink camera looks for and when it moves it triggers the camera. That's my only complaint. Highly recommend this product.
 Wow. These are really bad. They worked pretty well for a couple weeks and then the picture quality rapidly degraded to being unusable, and then the cameras stopped recording despite still having power.<br/><br/>On October 21st, 2018, I purchased a Blink XT Home Security Camera System 2-Camera Kit on Amazon, for $229.99.<br/><br/>I have the 2 cameras mounted on the front and back of my property underneath structural overhangs so they are protected from moisture and even direct sunlight. I opened my Blink app today and realized that the cameras haven’t recorded any activity for a week and have become unresponsive to motion, and for the weeks prior to ceasing function also began to show extremely blurry, discolored, and pixelated images. If it were one camera I’d think that it was just an error, but because it’s both cameras I do not believe that these are quality devices worth the money I paid for them and would like to return for a refund.<br/><br/>I've just reached out to customer service and will update my review based on my experience.
 I love the concept but this thing is full of bugs. After setting the camera it up it worked fairly well, quite a few false alarms but once setting up zones and adjusting sensitivity it was triggering well. Typically 5-6 times/day. Then it activated on motion and only recorded a 1 second clip and would no longer trigger (to make things worse while it was in its dormant state my wife disturbed a wreath on our door and a moth flew into her hair and she went nuts. Thanks Blink for saving her dignity but what is the point of a camera that can't even capture good blackmail). Live view was then unavailable even though the camera and link showed 5 bars of connection and good battery. Disabling the camera and reenabling would then allow access to the video feed but it would trigger once and then not reset and recorded clips less than the set time. Digging through the forums others have been having this issue since 2017.<br/><br/>I also find it crazy this is an Amazon product but doesn't work well with voice versions of Alexa at all. Ideally Alexa could give an alert if motion is activated in real-time. I had to use IFTTT to get this functionality but Alexa will only let you know if one happened in the past when you ask. Seems like a pretty obvious feature people would want.<br/><br/>Long story short this device is much to be buggy to be considered an effective security option. I have no confidence the device would operate properly when needed. I hope they continue to work on fixing this but given the issues I'm having have existed for well over a year I have my doubts. Typical story of a product brought to market too early.
 When I first got the camera I loved everything about it until a week went by and the batteries are dead.... The camera says with normal use it should last two years.... I guess normal use means no video recordings...<br/><br/>I don't think I did anything special with it but the batteries only lasted a week! I specifically got this camera because it was battery operated and  it says with normal use it should last two years.... now I have to replace the batteries every week???<br/><br/>I reached out to the company and I was informed that the camera recorded a lot of video in this one week and that's the battery is dead.... I guess their idea of normal use isn't my idea of normal use
 I ordered 5 cameras and I am giving the reviews based on how many cameras are functioning after 5 days.<br/><br/>One camera from the get go only showed pink images.<br/><br/>Originally all cameras showed an image and worked fine (one camera only showed pink images) for 1 day.<br/><br/>From time to time each camera would give a “thumbnail failed” message when I checked the camera on my phone.<br/><br/>I am now 100 miles away from my vacation house, so I can not; get out the ladder, climb the ladder and get the camera down. Fiddle with the batteries. See the images when I am physically holding the camera, climb back up the ladder, reinstall, see the clear image, drive back to my permanent residence and while at home see that only 2 out of 5 cameras are working<br/><br/>Aarggghh!!<br/><br/>Can I please pay for only 2 cameras and get a repayments worth 5 camera levels of frustration!!!<br/><br/>It’s a great concept if they actually worked!
 Easy setup and installation. Night vision seems to be decent. My 2 main complaints are the storage and sensitivity. With the 5 camera system at just about a week I'm at almost 30% storage used, so I will only get 3-4 weeks of recording at most. I wish the larger camera systems came with more storage than the single camera as with 5 cameras I will easily have at least 5 times more captures than if I just had the single camera, yet the cloud storage is the same.. The motion detection sensitivity seems to be a little off, at first i was having to adjust it from picking up cars going by on the street, yet halfway down my driveway the camera wont pickup me walking by, but picks up a car that would be 10+ feet farther away. Overall I still think this is a good setup. It's very simple with no wires needed. I think the app is great especially with the notifications, though I wish we had the option to get the notification as soon as motion is detected vs. just after the recording has uploaded.
 We've had this product at least a year and love it.  We can clearly see who is at our door from a video on our phone. Birds and wasps and neighbor dogs do set it off..but I'd rather it catch everything so I'm good with that.  I like that I can take a picture wherever I am to see my front porch.  Humorous to watch my husband mow the lawn from my office, as he sets it off with every pass.
 The Good:<br/>The cameras and sync unit are ever so easy to set up.  Best I've seen yet in terms of quick, easy to use cameras and the software is simple to load and configure.  They've got it right from the start.<br/>The Bad:<br/>I do wish the field of view was a bit better in terms of distance and clarity.  If you want to see faces and details the camera is going to have to be closer than one might want, close enough for someone to easily remove.  Also no support for PC/Laptop as yet.  That needs to happen soon.<br/>The Ugly:<br/>The mounts for the cameras are simple to set, but they are a snap compression fit and they're weak.  I mounted mine high where no-one could possibly reach them, however a quick throw of a stick, hard shake of the building or anything larger than a 1" rock could dismount the camera sending it to the ground to smash into little bits of techno jet trash.  I put Gorilla tape on the back side in the hopes of them not falling off the mounts or being removed intentionally by the "bad" people.  The designers need to take time to develop a mounting system that is much more secure.
 So far so good. Wish it fastened better and not just clipped on attachment. Afraid someone will just grab one day. Battery last 2 years also if u set at minimal settings will see how long it lasts at med settings and report back.<br/><br/>Update 12-29-18<br/><br/>Had camera up since 12-16 20 13 days. Batteries are already low and say need to be replaced. System is great but there is no way this will last 2 years on even the best lithium batteries. I was hoping for it to last at least 3 months, then it wouldn't be so bad at worth it still. Bit not even a month? Not even 20 days??? Come on. What's the point? Even at it's lowest setting wont last. I have settings in the middle. Dissapotined. Again great system works well battery life sucks.<br/><br/>Update 1-29-19<br/>Battery life is terrible. Using lithium Energizer same as this comes with. Changing atleast 3 times a month. This time batteries didn't even last a week. What's the point if you have to change expensive batteries all the time. Now 2 stars.
 Had these for several months now and they worked great for me. There is a delay from when the camera turns on and when it actually starts filming, which sometimes the event has already happened or you see the final frame of someone walking passed it.<br/><br/>I noticed battery life is not what is advertised, I keep my settings on close to a power saving mode and the most I got was 2mo on one of my camera, otherwise my other camera is a once every 3 weeks swap.... that was until the cold came.<br/><br/>My batteries do not last long at all according to the app. Within 2 days my low battery icon is showing and the camera just flickers on and off and you can audibly here it as you walk passed it.<br/><br/>They say they are rated for low weather, but anything below 30 degrees, and you may start seeing performance issues. With it being close to 10 degrees or lower in the midwest. These cameras have become essentially useless for me.
 I purchased the white blink cameras this summer and after moving them around multiple times decided that where I really wanted cameras was outside pointing at my front and back doors.  The location I chose was under cover and the white cameras did fine but I thought the xt cameras would be an upgrade.  I am actually extremely unhappy with the image quality from the xt cameras.  I am most disappointed with the images at night.  They are not nearly be as clear.  I also feel like the white light on the standard cameras is a better security feature to let anyone coming to my door at night know that they are on camera.
 I would use this camera only for a low traffic areas. We thought we could use this for a front porch...front walk area. We were very very wrong. This camera does an extremely poor job of picking up individuals walking towards the camera. Sometimes it will only pick up a person walking towards the camera when they get less than 2 feet away. Sometimes it doesn’t even do that. But it will pick up trucks or vans moving across the field of vision as opposed to directly towards it....sometimes 40 feet away. If you adjust the sensitivity to pick up people walking TOWARDS the house ....you will get tons of false alarms. And with all those false alarms...there is no way those batteries will last two years. Bottom line...it really depends on where you place this camera. Until they upgrade their motion detection, this is a marginal system that requires too much work.....has limited placement....has too many problems with sensitivity adjustments.....and causes too many false alerts.
 Key points<br/>-Selective on what triggers motion<br/>-Limited scope of use<br/>-Basic programming available<br/>-Great picture quality<br/>-Poor motion detection at greater than 10ft<br/>-only records clips triggered by motion, not a 24/7 recording system<br/><br/>Main use I got this 5 camera system for was monitor my front door, second door with mailbox, driveway, garage and shed.<br/><br/>Battery life- 4/5. they claim 2 years.  I have had for 2 months as of 1/20/19 so I can’t attest to that.  They should put disclaimer that 2 year life would be in a seldomly used area.  If it is used more that 3x a day you get a notification stating it lowers battery life. Basically telling me battery life will be significantly less than 2 years.<br/><br/>Scheduling-  0/5. you can’t schedule cameras separately, they all have to be on the same schedule.  Big drawback. Instead of doing the programming to make this possible, blink’s solution is for you to buy a module for each camera to enable a schedule for each camera ( more $$$ for blink instead of fixing a problem).<br/><br/>Picture quality-  great 5/5. Night and day.<br/><br/>Detection-  2/5.  Biggest tip is set camera perpendicular to the path you expect the motion to be.  I can drive 3/4 up my driveway and it won’t trigger the camera, but a leaf blowing or reflection off my truck will trigger it.<br/><br/>Mounting bracket- 1/5.  Cheap and flimsy. I bought different brackets from a different company.<br/><br/>Overall it works well but for very specific, limited use.
 Supposedly worked with SmartThings then after I got it found out it doesn't work with Smartthings.  sent back

They are easy to install and the app is very user friendly.  These cameras also work on Echo Show and Echo spot.  The Live Preview is a great feature.  I am happy that the videos are hosted on Amazon Cloud.
 This is a pricey little camera, it has major issues with sensitivity and area designation. False video captures all day long even with lower sensitivity set, and in turn does not capture the regular person walking up to my door so whats the point. Im even getting notifications from BLINK stating that the battery will not last as per their claim of two years because the camera is taking too much video, what!?
 My 10 year old daughter had "something" making noise in the attic above her room, specifically after 1am, almost nightly. From the sounds below, we assumed a large animal of some type. Called a pest control company and paid over $100 for them to tell me I had a bat living there. Really?!?! All that noise from ONE bat? Another $1200 to remove. Took sometime to think about it and then it struck me I could re-purpose my XT camera from outside and place it in the attic to capture any activity and at least figure out how many I had. Closed up some entry points and waited for some alerts to see if the bat was gone or still around as it got quiet after capping the chimneys. Great price and functionality for a simple, wireless and fee-free system!
 I was very excited when I got these, even though it felt pricey. A home camera security system on a battery that last 2 years, plus no fee cloud recording, sounds unbelievable. Turns out it is unbelievable and doesn't last. The setup was super-easy. One of the easiest camera setups I've even done. I was happy then kids getting candy. I set one at the front door, three inside and one in my garage.<br/>Resutls: The one at the front door, provided many false positives. Lowered the sensitivity, and several times it didn't detect when people where at the door, Raise the sensitivity one more notch and it captured moving cars. My house sits 50 ft from the road. Battery died in 4 months. Need to replace with Lithium Ion AA batteries which cost $2-$3 each if you buy a multipack.<br/>For the indoor cameras, sometimes you want to watch a feed. Well, the camera is not designed for continuous feed as it uses a battery. On the app, it will ask you ever 30 seconds if you want to continue.<br/>The cameras will also only record for a set amount of time up to 60 seconds. So if something is detected, you get only 60 seconds of recording. If something occurs after that you won't capture it. The retrigger time is set between 10-60 seconds.<br/>You are not able to arm individual cameras via a schedule. You either arm all or none, then you can manually turn off motion detection on the cameras. So let's say you want outside on all the time, but inside from midnight to 6 am, then 9 am -5 pm. No can do.<br/><br/>The cameras are neat, simple and easy to setup and install, but fall flat with feature and capabilities.
 I’ve only had it set up for several hours so if anything changes I will definitely update my review. So far - pretty easy set up. I like that you can easily disable it in the app - my husband and I don’t have set work schedules so the schedule to record doesn’t help us much. We tested it once it got dark out and unfortunately the range indeed only seemed to be about 20ft which is unfortunate for us; after what appears to be vandalism to our pool we purchased this - only our pool is 33ft long, so although we can see the full pool in live view, where we can mount the camera on the house makes the end of the pool out of range for the motion sensor. If we end up liking the camera we will purchase more in the hopes of getting any blind spots<br/>Update: customer service phone line is a joke. The guy was clearly reading off a promoter, telling me to do things I already said I did. My problem is nighttime vision is TERRIBLE. My husband was within a few feet of the camera, looking directly at it and his face was a huge white blob. The next day I emailed and they offered to replace it. Now, after over a week and a half on the same sensitivity setting it’s starting to pick up bugs flying by and sometimes I’m seeing nothing at all.
 For a while this system was heading for a 5-star review.  Then... the Sync Module started going offline. Checked with Help and they pointed out this happens with either/or a power outage or a problem with the wifi system.  The immediate fix is to unplug the module, then plug it back in.  Voila, on-line again.  But... this offline problem happens when we're away from home and there is no way to re-set it.  That means this system is absolutely useless. We have had no power  outages and there is nothing wrong with the wifi (xfinity).<br/>On a positive note, the system was east to set up, adequate, quality, range issue is under control, etc., agree with all the good things said about this.<br/>But, this system now goes offline at least once a day and, again - makes it useless.  Have to return and find something reliable.
 Very poorly constructed. and problems from beginning to end.  Couldn't connect to our WIFI.  All components were cheaply constructed along with the website.  Attempted to contact tech support and got the opportunity to leave a voice mail.  Most of the links did not work.<br/><br/>I'm an extra class amateur radio operator and teach robotics.  If I can't get this to work, no one can.
 I'll start off by mentioning that I've installed many network cameras over the years. The newest network cameras on the market have outstanding quality, however for the average person they are extremely difficult to install (think running cat-5 through walls) and require port forwarding and other router-tweaking knowledge.<br/><br/>This is where Blink comes in- the engineers at Amazon created the perfect security camera system for the average homeowner. The cameras are a breeze to set up for anyone, the resolution is good, and the fact the cameras are wireless is a major bonus. No messing with your router, simply log into the Blink app to change camera settings and view the cameras.<br/><br/>The only con I ran into when setting up the cameras is that the mounting system is a major weak point. The mounting bracket is flimsy and the way it snaps into the back of the camera is not very secure. My camera fell off the mount while installing the bracket to the wall. I had to shell out an additional $20 for wall mount brackets.
 Bought a 2 camera system XT indoor/outdoor. Both cameras work well during daylight hours, not including all the false notifications.  At night there useless. Every single human face shows up as a big solid white blob. No way to get conviction against someone. Chews through Energizer Ultimate Lithium Ion batteries like they've got nothing better to do and as everyone knows these specific batteries are NOT cheap! I've had the cameras for 5 weeks now and have had to replace the batteries in 1 of them every 4 days.  Called customer service to report that 1 of the 2 cameras is faulty and asked for a replacement camera (by the way I also purchased the additional warranty which they have just proven to me was a waste of money).  There solution: there going to send out a new pair of batteries! Are you kidding me?! Customer service woman told me "it's our policy".  I guess it's there policy to give customers the standard run around instead of either fixing their product bugs or doing the right thing. Sending these back, too much of a hassle.
 I purchased 2 of these and absolutely love them! Took all of 5 minutes to connect/set up, I find the picture quality is excellent and love all the features (everything from scheduling to using the grid to black out certain areas of the viewing area, such as a tree that would move in the wind and set off the motion detector). Some people have mentioned a "lag" in the video, I experienced that as well, but simply adjusted the sensitivity setting and no more lag. I do recommend getting separate mounting brackets so you can position the camera for more angles. I did have a question about adding an additional phone to the system (yes, I realize this would have been easy for some people, but I'm rather illiterate when it comes to technology). I emailed Blink, and a representative responded within a few hours and was very helpful. I looked at other cameras that were more expensive, and feel Blink has really created a camera more worthy of the price they charge.
 The problem with Blink: 1)Cannot schedule arming/disarming of individual cameras. 2) If you buy a second sync module to solve problem one, you have to have two disconnected “modules” and can’t move cameras between modules in app, must physically remove from one module, then add to the next. 3) if you do get the cameras on the right modules, your two systems are based on geo location, eg. Back of house. If you wanted “one” system/module for outside, you have issues connecting both sides  to the one module.  4)  IR night vision does not work well, if there is the tiniest bit of light shining near it(neighbors light through window) completely obstructs.<br/><br/>6 months of dedicated development to these issues would probably fix and I would rate 4.5 stars.<br/><br/>The modules should act as repeaters where you can have 1 system with (n) sync modules to support your cameras and you need to be able to create better schedules, eg- camera 1 at 9 am, Group “outside”(cameras 2 &amp;3) from 6-6. Camera 4 always...
 These things cannot be relied upon for consistency. Most of the time I try and check areas of our brewery and the cameras don't work. I have two of them working off of one hub. Sometimes they work most of the time they don't. One is outside under cover looking over our beer garden and the other is inside looking down at a cash drawer. I don't recommend them.
 Great product. User friendly and easy to set up, I like the ability to schedule arm and disarm. You can also disarm each camera individually remotely like if you have birds or bees causing a lot of clips and notifications. You can also raise and lower the sensitivity all from your phone. Battery life of my first cameras is still good after about 8 months, they predict 2 yrs, we’ll see. It takes some patience. Put your cameras where you want them then adjust the location of the control module to get a useable signal strength. It helps if your WiFi is centrally located.<br/>I highly recommend.
 Pros:<br/>Very easy to install, set up and use<br/>App is very user friendly, lots of settings.<br/>Price is great<br/>I've read some complaints about when in live view mode you have to keep hitting continue, yes this is true but it pops up about every minute which I<br/>  see as a feature because if you put your phone down and forget your in live view mode it will shut off and not drain the batteries.<br/>Completely wireless<br/>Great picture, very clear<br/>No monthly fee<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The mounting kind of sucks, this camera would be super easy to steal if someone wanted<br/>Wish there was an option to record while in live view mode, otherwise the camera must be triggered to record, there is an option to take a snapshot<br/><br/>so far I'm happy with this purchase but going to wait before I add anymore cameras to the system
 I got this because I live in an apartment so first: I couldn’t get a device that needed to be hardwired, and battery operated options are fairly limited. Second, I’ve been having issues with packages disappearing from my porch and unwanted guests. I was looking at the more expensive doorbell type options, but I couldn’t bring myself to shell out that much money and have to pay for cloud storage. So here’s my little list of pros and cons:<br/><br/>Pros: extremely easy assembly. Installation was fairly simple and would have been simpler if we’d had a normal screwdriver. Picture quality is really good for such a tiny camera. The motion sensor detects from a decent range as well. It only requires AA batteries! The cloud service is free, so there isn’t a hidden monthly charge. I feel safer.<br/><br/>Cons: the pamphlet of instructions leaves much to be desired. You have to install the app first and the app doesn’t cover what’s going on in the app very well. No SIM card slot, which is somewhat offset by the free cloud storage. The mount is wimpy, and I wish it was either metal or was able to secure the camera better because my biggest fear right now is that someone will take the camera off the mount. Don’t quote me but I don’t think there’s a computer app either.<br/><br/>So far everything is running very smoothly and I’ve had no issues with the camera disconnecting like I’ve seen some reviews say.
 In general, it is a great product for its price.<br/><br/>But I m a bit disappointed by the mount base that comes with it. The mount base cannot turn in all six-axis so it gave me hard time to figure out a good position to mount and fix the camera. And the mount is made of plastic that looks very easy to break. I do hope the company can make a better mount base that can move in all six axis so that we can point the camera to where we want, and in that case we can also avoid a lot more false-positive detection.<br/><br/>I also hope that geo-fencing would be supported.<br/><br/>EDIT after 2 months of usage:<br/>1. battery is less than 2 months for ours pointing towards street. It is not a busy street and I have tried hard to adjust the camera's position to avoid the detection of any running cars.<br/>2. sometimes it records the video but not audio.<br/>3. the timer for the scheduler may shift. We have set it to arm at 9:00 but it gradually shifts to 9:03 when it really arms and sens us notification.<br/>4. please make a better mount base!<br/>5. please geo-fencing!!
 ok if you want something with no energy to set up ...this is it...literally like ten minutes...the sign on is easy...takes about a day figuring out web app but once you do its easy and it stores stuff for you for free...the camera itself sees quite well...i have a small front yard and it captures everything...i have a flag that waves in the wind and it doesn't set off the motion on it and i have cats that stroll by no motion...you can adjust the motion sensor and so on...i have to say probably best 100 spent on amazon in a while...got a white cover for it so it kind of disappears on my window sill...i don't even have it outside it sits in my window...and i put tint on my window so no glare...as for license plates from the street...you could probably get it if it caught it but the motion is kind of slow so someone could like run by hit your car and you wouldn't see it but you could assume that since most action happens in the frame...hard to explain until you have one...but best one for price and free storage
 Easy camera to set up if you don't want any additional features.  For the price you pay for these cameras you should be able to have a lot more features than what is available.  It is a good camera but not for the price.  In my opinion, buying a unlocked phone and using "Alfred" camera system app is still the best way to go.<br/><br/>Pros:. Easy to set up<br/>  Easy camera placement<br/>  Small size<br/>  Decent video quality<br/>  Battery operated<br/><br/>Cons:. You can only watch one camera at a<br/>  time.<br/>  Price is not justified for what you<br/>  receive.<br/>  Having to push continue to watch live<br/>  video is very annoying.  I can't<br/>  continuously watch a live video feed<br/>  Unable to watch video on PC<br/>  Minimal functions<br/>  Only one way audio<br/>  Poor sound quality<br/>  do not have the choice of having<br/>  external lights of camera on or off.<br/>  Camera field of view is not the greatest
 Wanted to love it...but...Due to the style of my house, I can't see if anyone is in the driveway. I bought this camera so I would be alerted if someone had pulled into the driveway. The sensitivity is almost impossible to get right. The camera picks up a leaf blowing by but not a car pulling in..It has recorded every 3 minutes for an hour for no apparent reason. For that reason, in order to conserve the battery, I have turned off motion detection and just use the live view when I think someone is here. Kind of defeats the purpose, but I can see where I want to when I want to. I like the fact that it is wire free allowing me to install it in a tree.I haven't had it long enough to comment on battery life.I don't hate it, but I don't love it either....and I really wanted to.
 I wanted to like this system however it was disappointing. Constant messages like 'camera busy', 'no signal', 'no connection to cloud' as well as other error messages became annoying. Recording starts late only capturing half of an event. Picture quality and narrow field of view was another concern. Subjects were dark and difficult to recognize in lightly shaded parts of the driveway.. Night vision images were washed out and not useful. Alerts were not being sent for much of the time. Took almost 2 hours to set up because of what it called 'low signal strength' even when within 15' of the Wi-Fi router. Range is short and signal easily weakened by house walls and common obstructions. Mounting bracket should be what they sell as an upgrade being the upgraded bracket can swivel to more angles than the one provided. A budget camera system at best don't expect much performance.  Others found this camera to operate with little issue, mine was not the case. Maybe you will have better luck.
 The Blink is ok for an inexpensive wireless security camera, but it does seem to have one very major issue that I didn't see listed in the other reviews.  If you do not have good cell service, the images that are captured from the camera are not recorded and can't be viewed.  We were recently out of town in an area with spotty cell service.  I would receive alerts and be able to view the videos when cell service was good, but during times that cell service was bad or non-existent, there are no videos.  In other words, it's like the camera doesn't even work if you don't have cell service (I realize the camera was probably working, but the videos are not available in the app).  I assumed I would see the videos after cell service was restored but instead would have absolutely nothing - there would be gaps of hours with no video (and yes, there should have been activity).  That is a huge limitation and I'm hopeful it will be addressed soon.
 We've had this camera up and running on the front porch for about a week and eveything so far is as described. I don't have another exterior camera brand to compare this to except the Reolink Arugus 2 which we couldn't get to connect to our WiFi so we returned it. The daytime video feed is good and clear, we had to adjust the sensitivity setting from standard setting of 5 to 7. The motion sensor was not picking anyone up until they were literally almost at the door. We know have video of them walking up to the front porch. The live feed looks pretty clear at night. The setup was easy and quick. I did take 1 star off for two things - 1) the camera bracket is pretty flimsy and poorly made and 2) the bracket comes in 2 pieces and it's somewhat easy to figure out how to use it by trial and error but there's no explaination in the instructions. It doesn't even list the part.

This guy has never came onto our property that we know of but he’s always digging through trash and acting wild. So we got this camera and caught him the FIRST night. I’m not including actual footage of the idiot but instead his dog since we have a case pending against him. But if you’re looking for a way to secure your residence then these cameras could be a good way to do so.<br/><br/>I will say that if you decide to get these cameras it will help police to better identify someone if you have a well lit area. The IR makes the clothing black and white.<br/><br/>We bought lights today that go on which makes the IR turn off and gives it a better feed.<br/><br/>Well worth the money we’ve spent! We also bought the suction cups which we prefer for our RV.
 The system is compromised of a sync module and camera.  Each device in the system has a QR code.  The QR code affixed to the back of the module encodes vital information such as the device's SSID (wifi name) and Password for the device.  The manufacturing and the QA failed so hard that they affixed the WRONG QR code, Serial Number, SSID, and Password that didn't match the actual device.  For example, the QR code for the sync module defines its SSID as BLINK-5198 where as the actual SSID broadcasted by the device was BLINK-3456.  Similarly the password and serial numbers failed to match.  This resulted in a broken setup.  We tried to manually connect to the correct BLINK SSID during setup but this resulted in red blinking light when we tried to connect it to our home's wifi.<br/><br/>The customer support at Blink wasn't very helpful.  They asked me to do two things.  1. Hard reset of the device and 2. firmware update.  Neither helped.
 This is my first security camera. Easy setup, clear picture, low-cost battery replacement. Does everything I want and meets my needs. There is nothing out there for the same price they will do with this system does and provide great customer service. If you really need something more spend more. But don't try comparing a $250.00 system to a $500.00 system. Dollar-for-dollar it can't be beat. If your wondering why I put a cover over the top of the camera. It was not for water proofing but to protect it from some of the Oklahoma's hail storms we get.
 The camera works as inteded although there is some lag but not a big deal. Would have loved more if this had two-way audio functionality. All this is fine but the battery life they claim is definitely a lie. I bought this based on two factors. 1st was that there was free cloud storage and 2nd was 2yrs battery life claim which is not true.<br/><br/>I had to replace the batteries after just 2 months. And I dont even keep the camera Armed 24hrs. The camera is armed only for 11hrs out of 24hrs and even in that may be 1-2 times the camera must be recording video as I have to take my dog out. So even with just that small use I have to change batteries every 2 months. Cost of batteries annual is going to be $16 per year per camera.<br/>So factor in $16 per year per camera if you are purchasing this camera. If you are purchasing more more cameras then cost of batteries will be more.
 Video quality is pretty good.  It's nice not to run a power cable to the unit.  Great concept, but not execution.<br/><br/>•  The motion detection doesn't work though glass (this is normal for PIR motion sensors).  Sometimes it does though.<br/>•  The motion detection doesn't work at all a certain percentage of the time.<br/>•  Sometimes the camera picks up motion 5 feet away and at others 45 feet away, but not 5 feet away.<br/>•  There is a significant lag between when the camera detects motion and when it starts to record, even with the delay set to the lowest.  This means it may start to record only after someone has passed or stolen your Amazon package.<br/>•  There is a significant delay after an event occurs and when you receive an alert or can watch the video.  Sometimes it's up to several minutes.<br/>•  Can't record any video in Live View. It only records when it detects motion.  I also wasn't able to use Live View about 20% of the time, because it told me "camera busy".
 Started with a two camera system, added a third and considering adding more (max 5).<br/>Quality of the image recorded is good.<br/>Settings are controlled through the app, we have the sensitivity turned down on our cameras out in yard.  Daytime wind blowing fall leaves and bird feeders made the cameras go off too frequently.  Turned the sensitivity down to a 3, catch people along with critters walking across the yard.<br/>Through trial and error I’ve found that the system works better if the Sync model is located near the WiFi<br/>No monthly contract storing your videos.
 I like the ease and affordability of this device. Video / audio (when used) quality is good. It's nice that there is an option for the audio, even though it is only one way, to be monitored.<br/>I did NOT like the lack of force needed to detatch the camera from the included mount. There should be a tighter fit. In my case it works because the unit is sheltered and has not been exposed to wind gusts or any movement from structures that might bump it loose. I still plan to shop for alternative threaded type mounts that would encapsulate the camera body because they seem to be more secure.
 I have a two camera setup with these, while they seemed to work decent at first, they have progressively gotten worse. When I have the system armed, I can walk in front of the camera and get nothing, if I want to check on my house by viewing an updated thumbnail or live video it fails 80% of the time. These are way overpriced for what they offer, the sync module aspect is definitely a drawback, it seems to make requested actions slow.<br/><br/>When working with support, they blamed by router and said to contact my ISP. Well I own my router, its a Google Wifi and Google doesn't let me make the changes that are required for this system to work. They said because the 2.4 and 5ghz bands have the same SSID it is confusing the modules.<br/><br/>I have a $20 Wyze camera indoors that has been solid as a rock, it does require a power source, and I will have to protect it from the elements, but I'm going to go that route instead.
 We absolutely love our Blink system. The camera quality is fantastic. Set up is a breeze. We followed the included instructions and had it up and working in about a half hour. We especially love that we get updates sent straight to our phones and can view live feeds at any time through the app. The customizable settings are simple and very convenient depending on what we need the cameras to do. It's also great that it just takes 2 AA batteries.  I don't think you can get a better set up for the price. We plan to add more cameras to our system. Definitely recommend this for anyone in need of a simple, easy to use, but high quality security system. The only thing that could possibly make it better would be two way audio, but that's not a *need* for us.
 Video quality is really good. Make sure you are placing it in a low traffic area so the batteries last longer. Many mounting options. Notices motion and starts recording in about 1 second. Many configuration options. Audio is very good as well as the night vision. The module can be connected directly to the camera which then you don't need the batteries but then it is not weatherproof. Overall this is a very versatile camera. Be sure you know what you are wanting to monitor before you buy a camera. I also have a Ring camera which has its advantages but the video quality is lacking unlike the Blink camera.<br/>Update: 2 months later the microphone stopped working. Am sending it back.
 Perfect for my home... We get a lot of packages delivered and it’s perfect for our needs the set up was fast and easy.  the resolution is great. plan to buy a few more cameras. I hope the battery life lasts one year. Two years would be amazing but one you would be acceptable. Free cloud storage what is what made the deal over the top for me plus I got a free Echo. I figured for an $80 investment I had nothing to lose and I am quite happy with the purchase! I also love the fact that Amazon owns the company which means this product will be around and future proof for a long time
 I have lots of problems with this camera ,low signal.not recording ,live view not responding,clips if recording have different length<br/>I have to reset several times even called support ,then woks for little bit and fail again .i have excellent internet  srvice so the issue is not internet  as customer support said,<br/>NOT RECOMENDED
 when we first got these, I was excited because they are small and easy to install.<br/>our internet is very good, but since these are wifi cameras they would keep glitching.<br/>we had them for about 3 weeks, and then we got so sick and tired of the fact that the service would cut out and not record.<br/>I would never buy these again. not worth $500, when you can buy a way cheaper and better camera package.<br/>Do not buy!
 Seems to get offline often. My sync module is located 10’ from my WiFi. Well within stated limits. I have 3 cameras all with 20’ of the sync module and well within limits. Batteries less than 6 months old. Camera will often not take a picture or send an alert when something passes in front of it. If I go to my app and do a test picture it times out before the picture is taken. I will say when I put these cameras (3) in they worked well but that only lasted about 3 months.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R3SOV7MED8NGE7"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ev9hGdMLS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vIBkCvjJS.png"/> I already have 3 Blink indoor cameras, so I decided to add an XT.<br/>First off, the set up was a breeze. Adding the camera and set up took less than 5 minutes.<br/>I purchased an additional mounting arm and drilled it into the exterior stucco using wall anchors. That took another 10 minutes.<br/>The sync module is about 25ft from the XT but there are also a few walls.<br/>Going through the app, when I select the XT for a live view there is always a lag of 5-10 seconds. Once it a while I get an error message telling me live view is not available.<br/>There is a noticeable lag in the recording. If a bad guy was running fast across the frame it’s very likely the camera would not catch a good shot.<br/>The day time resolution is okay. The night vision is pretty bad.  See sample video. It’s useless.<br/>I’m keeping it for now since it’s already up.
 Good camera concept. Pros: Easy setup, small, compact. Cons: battery life is too short. Mine last about 1 month, supposed to last 2 years? doubtful. I wish they came with bigger lithium ion battery that could be interchanged. When it messes up you have to take the camera down and re-sync, unless you took pictures of the camera serial numbers before you put them up. Would be nice to have access on desktop PC's as well. Overall happy with the camera, just hate changing the battery. For low traffic area would be great.
 I bought this for my mom so she could keep an eye on her porch and patio area -- she's had some unwanted visitors in the past (the four-legged and two-legged kind) and I liked the fact that the footage is stored in the Amazon cloud. It didn't take long for us to set it up and install. You connect it to your router as you would any wireless device, and you also download the app to your device that links to the camera. You can change the recording time on the device, bearing in mind that anything sent to your phone will be using up data anytime you access it to see what just pinged an alert. The images are clear, and I like that you can hear sound, too. After you view them, you can save the videos or delete them from your phone, but it's nice that there's a backup in case something happens to it.<br/><br/>I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it.
 We purchased these stick up cams due to our lack of outlets outside and a lack of electrical knowledge on our part. They work well for their intended purpose. They have motion zones, settings for recording length and other various settings. I deducted 1 star because they often fog up to the point that they are completely useless at night (we live by the ocean) and also they do not record continuously (though this is understandable because it is battery operated). I deducted anoter star because the battery life is claimed to be at 2 years, but with consistent use or motion, two of our 4 cameras died within the first month of use. When the battery starts to go the status is not quite so helpful - it shows "OK" then seemingly out of nowhere it will say that the battery is going to die, with no warning. At this point night vision ceases to work and it rarely catches motion or records it.
 Fairly useless. I got the two-camera set, and neither camera does what it's supposed to do. If I set the sensitivity on high, one camera records every movement caused by every little breeze, so I end up with hundreds of clips of nothing. If I set the sensitivity any lower it records nothing, no matter how obvious the motion (I set it up in my driveway, and it doesn't even sense my car going by five feet away). The other camera never records anything no matter what the sensitivity setting. I can see through the live view, which is somewhat helpful if I want to view something when I know someone's there, but as a security system it's a complete bust.
 Batteries lasted 6 weeks not even close to 2 years. System worked for 2 months then sync module dropped off the wifi and won't reconnect after hours of trying everything. Totally not worth the stress.
 The system itself is sub par.  Slow response to motion (footage starts too late). Despite being an outdoor camera, constantly picks up slight grass / bush movement (not talking about windy days).<br/><br/>The real kicker, though, is the HORRIBLE support. Putting aside the constant contradictions, vague answers, and lazy reading... It takes multiple days between each response.  And the ticketing system is the only form of support.<br/><br/>Basically... Blink XT isn't ready and neither is the company behind it.
 I've owned the cameras for only a few hours now.  Here are my current views.<br/><br/>The 5 camera kit came very well packaged.<br/><br/>The initial setup of the hub and cameras was very easy to do on my Android.<br/><br/>The included mounting hardware is simple and effective.  However, due to my installation needs, I had purchased separate mounting hardware and can't comment.<br/><br/>Everything above would normally lead to me leaving a 5 star review.  However, I had to lower my rating due to the software and storage.  The export options are limited and the cloud storage only stores 2 hours.  This looks like it can go a long way at the default settings.  However, the settings I need would be a bit more aggressive then the default.<br/><br/>It's disappointing that that these nice cameras and software come back with such a large limitation.  If it could integrate with something like Amazon videos, it would solve my issue.
 after spending the better part of the afternoon mounting cameras...5 of them in my case...and tweaking them for optimal viewing, the cameras once setup pretty  much run themselves.  there are a few things one needs to realize though, the most important being the placement of the control module.  it needs wireless access to the internet via  your router, and it wirelessly needs to communicate directly with each camera.  secondly, the mounting bracket is a rather lightweight piece of plastic so one needs to be careful.  the placement of the camera would be easier if the mounting bracket had a ball mount.  there are such brackets available on amazon via third parties.  the whole system is controlled from your cell phone via an app.  I've one camera mounted on the garage facing the driveway, and it is very quick to activate once motion is detected, such as when my wife backs her car out of the garage when the system is armed.  it also performs well in the dark thanks to its infrared abilities.  I haven't had the system long enough to say how long the batteries last, but my neighbor swears his blink system batteries last a good long time.
 I've already contacted CS with Blink to see about getting a RMA number to return. I cannot believe they would without notice stop my services from working and yes, I am talking about the Smartthings work around for integration. VERY DISAPPOINTED...
 Not worth the money. We are having issues with our camera recording short bursts of video without any movement to trigger it. The other day it was almost 100 clips. The solution from blink was to turn down the sensitivity, so now it doesn’t record things until people are almost on top of the camera, and records nothing at night. Poor customer service from blink, and I’m on my 2nd unreturned message to amazon about this
 Don't bother with these cameras. 200.00 bucks and you can't see anything in the dark on them and all day my alert goes off for nothing. Not what company claims they are. They are useless
 I bought a two camera set.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, one will not stay locked in place. Any  breezy day and it's down on the ground (detaches from the piece holding it on the wall).<br/><br/>The other has issues with picking up motion especially after dark.  I know these aren't great with motion coming straight at them, but this camera fails to pick up motion walking across the camera's view.<br/><br/>I bought these because the neighborhood seems to have a problem with teens taking anything that's not secured/coming into yards to check sheds, etc.<br/>The cameras seem to keep the neighborhood kids from gathering in front of the house or coming through the gate based on just being visible, but I feel if it really came down to it, these cameras are useless to catch someone in the act of breaking in.
 A great solution for outdoor locations that do not have an external power source. I placed one on a shed that faces the back of my house, and it is about 200 feet from the router. You have to play with the sensitivity levels in the Blink app to make it trigger, particularly motion that is more than 20 feet from the camera. It works well day and night, and I get notifications to my iPhone and Apple Watch. It records audio, but does not allow two-way audio (which I knew upon purchase). My only complaint revolves around the cheap and perilous mounting brackets that come with the cameras. They disengage from the mount way too easily, and the camera mounted to the front of my house gave-way twice. The camera still works, but it has a crack in two corners, and I’m not confident that it will not fall off again. My lawn guy used his leaf blower near the camera, and it went sailing. I invested another $26 on heavy duty mounts, hoping that it solves the problem.
 The unit was on sale for a good price. It is battery powered. The batteries were advertised to last two years, but they lasted for 3 months. Batteries are easy to change. I have it placed above my garage door. The camera should record when my car leaves and arrives. Sometimes it does not record the event. When the camera records you get a notification from my smart phone. Quality of recording is color and of good quality. The camera is connected wirelessly to my internet router and is easy to set up.
 Great camera and very easy to setup. There is one screw to put in and you are all set. Setup on the app is simple and does not take long at all which is great. The app is easy to use and straightforward. you can adjust when the camera will work and even set a sensitivity level to determine what triggers it to start recording. There is cloud storage for free but I can't say for how much as I do not know. I have mine set to delete old videos first once its no space left. I like this overall, Let me also say that is small enough to set the camera anywhere with  no issuesIt is simple enough to use and has great features. I am able to video files at  time even when I am not how and every time it makes a video I have  my setting set to notify me which is great.
 Got this when it was on sale and chose it after extensive research and a consultation with ADT. I picked this one mainly due to the fact that it didn’t have any monthly subscription and the reviews were more positive than others. At full price it may have deterre me from ever buying it but the deal at the time was too good and figured if it didn’t work well I could return it within the return window. I have terrible internet speeds due to where I live and figured I’d at least try it. It does have a bit of lag, between 3-5 seconds, but the video and nightvision and sound quality is way better than I was expecting. It’s suoer sharp on the motion too, a little too good sometimes. I do also enjoy the feature I didn’t know before buying that it had where you can chose sections of the video to not register movement of, comes in handy for 2 long bushes off to the side that was triggering it. You can also chose the record duration. I only wish I woulda bout another one during the sale but I’m very happy with it. Oh and the storage I had a ton of videos saved and I don’t think I got past 16% of the space used.
 The setup is clear, results exactly what I wanted - to monitor inside the house during a section of time - but without having a security system my Father couldn't operate.  This is perfect.  Mine has a good image in darkness, and you pretty much can set it down anywhere you want As long as it's within range of the main hub.  I put it next to my router and the cameras are on separate floors in the house - no problem or degradation of signal at all.  I would start with the XT 2 camera set like I did.
 I'm in the process of installing and read the first page of the manual (see picture). Note that it states 2Mbps as minimum upload speed requirement. A lot of people confuse Mbps with MB/sec. It takes 8 bits to make 1 byte. So Mbps is normally used as a bandwidth (speed) designation and MB (and the current and correct MiB) is used as size designation.<br/><br/>My internet happens to be 150/5Mbps - well within the requirement. When people complain about techs stating that you need 2 MB/sec - push back. Don't let them roll you over - MB/sec is not the same as Mbps - and if the manual is stating the requirement wrongly, well, that's false advertisement and subject to unconditional money back.<br/><br/>After then install and some additional testing I'll update my review with more findings.
 It's an easy system to get up and working - minimal reading of instructions needed. Does a great job indoors and where lighting is adequate outside for night vision. Even though it's 1080p you won't be able to see faces clearly from much of a distance.<br/><br/>Primary reasons for a 2-star review:<br/><br/>1. The Blink alerts to your device cannot be customized to be any different than other notifications. If you're in a meeting, away from home, etc., you may not notice that the alert came through.<br/><br/>2. The camera mounts are flimsy - there's a 1-2mm circular connector that holds the camera to the mount - if you're mounting it over a hard surface high off the ground, it's prone to breaking if the camera separates from the connector (seems easy to do).<br/><br/>3. The 2 year battery life it not backed up with any fact-based info. It's most likely means that the cameras will work in 2 years indoors if they aren't used or checked.<br/><br/>4. Only handles cameras - no support for lights, 2-way audio, IFTT, etc.<br/><br/>5. I have camera's in the house and outside the house. I want the cameras outside the house activated when I'm home. However, there's no way to easily disable the indoor cameras without clicking on each of them and disarming one-at-a-time. What a pain!!<br/><br/>There isn't any new info from prior reviews. I'd suggest waiting for version 2 of the system. Also, the price for the 5 camera system soared from $399 to $499. This feels like a $199 system for 5 cameras.
 I had a few wrinkles trying to set it up- youtube took care of that for me :) Otherwise easy to install.  I am using them for  a triplex I own.  I have been waiting for a solar, wireless and cost effective system to become available (or down in price to buy) this has audio too.  Solar was important as the other alternative was to pay the electrician to run electrical  and then deal with all the camera wires.  The quality of the video, both night and day, is very clear. The things that can be improved on, and hoping Blink will with time-  1) be able to view cameras on your computer (not just the phone app) 2) be able to see all cameras at once- in a grind instead of one at a time. 3) add multiple users with their own un and pw so they can view but not change the settings.  My QT does all of the above - but not solar.  It would be nice to let tenants monitor the cameras  Currently i would have to give them my un and pw and they could change the settings in the network or camera.  The camera mounts only let you move the camera up or down (or right to left if you install sideways)  being able to swivel on an angle would be nice too.
 Disclaimer: I have no IT or technical background.<br/><br/>When it comes to technology, admittedly, I am a novice, yet I was able install the Blink XT camera and integrate it with my iPhone and Amazon Echo Spot all within an hour, it was that easy! I was able to set the camera sensitivity to ensure that it only records people walking to the front door and not passing by on the sidewalk. I also set the retention date to delete old videos on the free cloud storage all from my smartphone.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Easy to set up and integrate<br/> - The picture quality is fantastic.<br/>-  Free cloud storage.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- The only drawback is that the mount that it comes with is a bit limiting, that said, there are plenty of third party mounts available.<br/><br/>I cannot wait for the Blink doorbell to be released so that I can integrate that as well. Overall 10/10, I fully intend to purchase additional Blink cameras for my home to build a complete security monitoring system.
 for those tl:dr folks -  the cameras were intermittent, decent picture, overall didnt work.<br/><br/>so. as the headline states, I really did want these to work ( who doesn't right? )  I waited.. and read the mixed bag of reviews. and waited.. and waited.. however, a coworker has the set up - and his works as intended. He couldn't be happier.  I finally pulled the trigger and ordered.<br/><br/>Pros - amazons flawless return policy.<br/>  - Picture quality on "best" was really good, I would've been happy had they actually both work as intended.<br/>  - set up wasn't bad, pop in the batteries , dl the app, add the cameras,  not terrible<br/><br/>cons - I bought the two camera set. one worked as intended, the other would barely connect.<br/>the mounts, as stated in other reviews, could use a little adjusting.. in order for me to set where I wanted, the camera would mount crooked.<br/><br/>testing:  I dl the app and added both cameras. I could see both cameras would connect.  once mounted, one outside my door pointing at my door ( connected fine ) the other at the garage point at my driveway. ( would not connect )<br/><br/>I moved the base closer to the camera over the garage - would not stay connected.<br/>I swapped camera locations to where the base was basically on the other side of the wall of the camera - would not stay connected.<br/>I swapped camera's knowing the one in front was working - once relocated - would not connect.<br/>its not my wireless / too much troubleshooting for something that should essentially be plug and play.<br/>I think I got a shady set of cameras.<br/><br/>I may attempt at giving them a 2nd chance when they go back on sale, but for $200+ this set was a dud.
 Did not capture video of the thieves that stole the camera. Blink did nothing to help. Didn't even offer a discount on a new one.
 Too much lag between motion and recording.  When walking to a door you totally miss the person.  Also, one quit working totally after only 2 days.  Also, the mount does not allow you to angle the camera in a good position.
 I like the convenience of a no wire installation. The resolution and overall picture quality is very nice. There are some negative points though.<br/>Battery life: it advertises 2 year battery life but that is under minimal usage. If there is high activity where the camera is mounted it will significantly decrease battery life. I don’t know the extent yet, but it is a little upsetting.<br/>WiFi connection: you need a very strong signal for these units to work properly. Setup is a pain. You must be very patient during the setup process. Don’t try to access it too quickly or it will not respond. Also, I jut had to reset the gateway because all my cameras were only recording 3 seconds and I couldn’t access the live view feature.<br/>Overall I like it but I expected more for my money.
 I want to say the Blink cameras give you are clear picture and the hardware works very well. The two stars are not for the cameras. I would not give  any stars for the software of the app itself. So far, there has been damage caused  to my property twice and the Blink cameras was not recording. For the first couple months they worked flawlessly. The image and sound quality are great. Now they will just stop recording randomly. It is a software issue with the app. The cameras when the app is working is fine. But, if the app is not working it makes  a great security camera useless!
 These cameras provide high quality video indoors and out.  I recommend buying a 5-pack of the black ones and a 5-pack of the white ones.  The white ones only work indoors; the black ones work indoors and outdoors, but you can run 10 cameras off of one module (either black or white).  They are not difficult to set up, but don't look for printed directions in the box.  Everything is on-line.  There are good directions on-line with links to multiple You-tube videos so even an analogue dinosaur like me can figure it out, but I wasted 10 minutes staring at the box wondering why there were no printed directions.
 Been using Blink for about 3 months. Overall I'm very happy for the overall cost. Biggest benefit is the fact that it doesn't require wiring, so the cameras can be placed anywhere as long as there's Wi-Fi access.<br/><br/>You'll want to spend some time experimenting with camera placement to get the best viewing angle. Also, setting the sensitivity and recording triggers takes some trial and error, but its not bad since everything is accessed via the app (you don't need to touch the camera). I've gotten 3 months so far on the batteries and still going strong. Don't think it will get to 2 years, but even 6 months would be reasonable since the AA batteries are readily available and reasonably priced.<br/><br/>The app on the iPhone is easy to use
 I liked how affordable this camera was so I decided to try it. I like the cloud storage. It even tells you the temperature of wherever your camera is. The only problem with this is it lags a bit. It’ll pick up motion but records 2-3 seconds after the motion starts. If someone is walking by, it’ll record after the person is almost gone. The notification to your phone is a few seconds behind when it records. I have other cameras that are faster to record and notify me. It’s a clear picture and audio and easy to use on the app. I used the mount that came with it and haven’t had problems even though it is slightly flimsy. If someone wanted to pull the camera down off the mount, they could. The camera is not screwed into the mount, only pops in. It’s a good outdoor camera for the price. I just wish it were less laggy and the camera actually screwed into the mount.
 I installed 2 Blink XT cameras outside of our home.  It took about 30 minutes to install them with the bulk of the time drilling into the concrete walls.  One camera synced right away but the other one would not operate.  I contacted Blink and they checked the camera by WI FI and tried to a few online fixes which did not work.  I had a new camera in 2 days and it works fine.  We have cats that spend a great deal of time on our back lanai and I was concerned that they would set off the motion detectors all day long.  This was easily addressed by adjusting the sensitivity on the camera.  One thing I did change was the wall mounts.  I bought a set of wall mounted swivel brackets from Amazon that give me more adjustability.  I am happy with the Blink XT's and would recommend them to anyone wanting a reliable easy to install and setup system.
 For the price and the simple installation these are a good option for simple monitoring around my house.  I have been purchasing them one or two at a time and am up to 7.  Motion detection is good - it takes some experimenting and patience as far as positioning the cameras to avoid collateral triggering by cars on the road etc.  The new feature which allows you to block areas from triggering has helped with this as well.  The infrared clarity is okay - not excellent but ok.  I have set several of the cameras adjacent to motion sensitive floodlights up  that they will trigger together which improves the quality at night.  Battery life seems to be on track ... the first units I bought are about nine months old and they are still going strong.  The system arms exterior cameras and inside the garage every night and we can turn it on when we leave during the day by asking Alexa to arm or with smartphones.<br/><br/>With the Exho Show we can view through a selected camera but not constant - as it will burn through the battery.  For simplicity it’s great.  Only thing TBD is how durable they are and expected life cycle.<br/><br/>When I purchase the company said that they would have a doorbell with ala Ring ... for what was a much lower price ... not sure what the story is with that.<br/><br/>Also - initially they sold an audible alarm you could trigger remotely which does no seem to be available anymore .  Here is an easy fix for that however -!which is to purchase a siren for 120 colds an use a plug module.<br/><br/>Happy with this product.
 For the price, it's a bargain. It can hold 72k seconds of video which is 20 hrs for free. The sensitivity lags if it's below setting eight. If it's inside your home, setting nine is fine. Outside, it will pick up cars, etc., but level seven still misses things through a window. That isn't good. The video resolution under saver mode is 380p, best 720p, and enhanced 1080p. Saver seems alright, but 720p is great too. The illuminator light on/off switch is cheap and broke when I moved it. All else was ok, and no monthly contracts.
 Adding camera to app was quick. 10 minutes and 5 minutes to mount camera. In. The daytime, camera is great. Nice and clear. Night vision not so good. Keep in mind that it is infra red. Black and white fuzzy clips unless you are within 5 feet. Thinking about adding a light with motion detector on it to aid the camera. I have a light 5 feet from the camera and it helps. Just don't want to leave it on all the time.<br/>The mounting bracket design could use an upgrade.<br/>Over all. For the price it's a good system.<br/><br/>Now. The app to get the system going went well up to the point of receiving motion notifications. Customer Service said I could only get them on my phone if I was connected to the WiFi the camera was on. They sent me a link for instructions on permissions to set my phone to. That's when I started getting notifications on WiFi only. If I was away from the house.... No notifications. This can't be right.<br/>Took me 2 days of searching ALL settings to figure it out. 1 setting not on the list. Access to the phone.<br/><br/>Good system for the price and I will be adding more camera's in the near future.
 Nothing warms my heart more than seeing all my neighbors come together in a social media forum to scour their mundane front yard video feeds to racially profile every person of color who happens to innocently walk in front of their house.  I bought this camera so that I can share video feeds of my privileged neighbors walking past my house, and make irrational assumptions of their intentions. Like, "Look at this 'Brenda' and her stupid dog. She looks really suspicious. Keep an eye out for her and lock your car doors if you park outside."
 Not really too crazy about these blink cameras.  They claim 2 year battery life, but I get 2 weeks instead.  I wanted longer recording times which sacrifices battery life. I ended up running a usb cable plugged into a usb charger in order to bypass replacing batteries so often. I don't like that there is no Windows 10 App available for this system. I do like the free cloud storage, and I do like how well these cameras respond to movement.
 I love my Blink security cameras, they are wireless and easy to install.  The run on two AA batteries that last up to 2 years.  The picture quality is excellent and the motion detection provides a sense of security.  The install options will benefit will satisfy anyone's security camera requirements.  Blink cameras and the Android app provide a better option then my Zmodo 8 camera hard wired system.  Blink is so much easier to install and operate and is so easy to use when a security breach is detected.  The system also has two way audio to communicate your demandes. It even has an outdoor temperature display (although acquired to get to, should display on camera view). Im planning on deploying this cameras throughout my property, pasture, barn, storage shed, south entrance gate. They are fun to have.
 I was so excited to love this, but here's the problems.  1.  The 2 batteries lasted 1 week.  2.  The back door will not close properly.  3.  Video quality is sub par  4.  Only records short bursts  5.  Application is weak, not smooth.  I also have a nest cam which I've wanted to ditch because I hate paying the $10 a month, but I just spent $15 on batteries...

 My first days review and reason for only three stars for now...<br/>As many others have said, the live video is hit and miss despite full bar signals. For an out door camera it seems to not really have the range it needs to be a camera that needs some space. So far very difficult and multiple starting all over and trying to find a place I can get a live view or anything but the camera stolen???<br/>On the bright side it has a pretty nice picture. Not real clear if you want to zoom in but this is true of a few cameras I know of..<br/>I thought I saw you could plug a external hard drive to the USB and record local but have not tried that yet. I'll give it a chance and see how it does and will change my opinion accordingly. So far, for a single indoor camera anyway the arlo is hard to beat so I probably will not switch over inside due to these issues?
 Way too expensive for what it does.  Cheap mount that will blow off a tree in a strong wind.  The range on the motion detection doesn’t allow enough range to put it in a tree out of range of thieves and burglars.  WiFi range isn’t very good either.  I have a few Sdeter cameras and they are better for a lot less money.<br/><br/>Update: Did a trial of max range that I could get the camera away from the Verizon Hot spot and still get 3 bars with the hotspot inside and the camera outside.  10 yards max.  If you use one of the protective cases, even less. This makes it essentially useless as a security device.  You can’t put it high enough in a tree that it won’t get stolen.  And you can’t really buy more than 1 and mount them outside with a 10 yard range.  Pretty disappointing product amazon revised to 1 star from 3.
 We hooked this up to our front door. In order to get it to catch someone delivering a package before they turn around, we had to have the sensitivity at an 8 or 9. Unfortunately, when it is that sensitive, it also gets triggered because a leaf is moving on a plant 15 ft away. or a bug flies by. I set one of the two cameras in the house, just to figure out the delay in recording time. When the dog sitter came, she walked right by and it never caught her on camera. I could hear her, but it didn't catch her walking by and this is in the "ideal" set up with someone coming in from the side of the camera, not walking towards it. I will find a use for these cameras, but they will have to be in the back of the house under a deck where wind won't trigger them. The app was easy to use, but if you are wanting to be able to catch someone trying to steal a package, they will have to be a sloth in order to catch their face.
 Works just as expected.  Smart/clean iOS app design/functionality.  Quick enough response when trying to view live, battery life as expected and depends on usage/settings. Would certainly buy again. Cheaper than those name brands but just as good.  Only gripe is it could be a little more active/intelligent with evaluating changing lighting conditions.  Like it it were an iPhone I would click the image and it would adjust for a clearer picture depending on where the light is coming from.  Be nice for future units to be smarter/automatic with adjusting for changing lighting conditions.  Have not reached out to vendor about this so it’s possible I’m missing something but don’t see a setting to control this anywhere.  Definitely not a show-stopper just a suggestion to make it perfect
 This product is fickle. When it’s working the quality is nice. However, it will randomly stop making clips and you will need to pull the back off to reset it. This doesn’t help at all when the whole reason is to monitor when you aren’t there and clearly can’t hit reset from work. I was stuck all weekend without being able motitor anything because it kicked itself off on Thursday. In addition If you are relying on that video to be there, don’t hold your breath.  It doesn’t have a continuous record. Overall other than being weather resistant and wireless (which was great).. I’ve been 10 times happier with my much cheaper Wyze ($25) that seems to do everything I could want. I also bought the pan cam but found the noise of it rotating and the movement a little distracting.
 I bought this around the holidays for a second home when an item on my patio disappeared.  The set up was easy, pictures and notifications on the phone were great.  This morning I get a beep the system is offline.  I called Blink and the lady kept repeating the system went offline and to have someone go in my house to unplug the unit and plug it back in and see if that helps and it if does not I need a new module.  Now how is that suppose to help me 800 miles away with nobody to send to go walking thru my house and try fixing this?  So now my new Blink system is useless until I go to this house in a few months to see what is up.  I guess for the three weeks I had it working it was good but now it is not.  If anyone buys it now be prepared to have it fail and no way of testing anything unless you are there.
 I am a very technical person and I have setup hundreds of gadgets with ease, including routers, switches, smart devices, etc. The main issue with this security camera (Blink XT) is the motion sensor. Despite changing the sensitivity all the way up, ensuring excellent wifi and sync module signal strength, resetting the  camera and sync module, still could not get the motion sensor to work consistently. I tried triggering it and close range but still no luck. I ensured the motion-detect icon is enabled (a running man icon in upper right of app), and verified "armed" was toggled on to activate the system. I performed several resets and retraced my steps to ensure I set everything up as instructed.  I have thoroughly researched and applied the solutions found in Blink community  for this product but it still did not work as expected.
 I already have a home security system with a very loud alarm, but without any video options.  I saw the Blink monitoring system as "today's special value" on a television network and it looked impressive.  After researching and reading reviews, I bought the system.  Since I already have a monitored security system, I don't need a "security system"', but the peace of mind that video monitoring offers is comforting.<br/>The system is installed and running for over a week.  Here are my thoughts:<br/><br/>--the installation was very easy.<br/>--the cameras are totally mobile<br/>--the picture quality is really clear<br/>--I like the fact that the video clips, sensitivity, and retriggering can be adjusted<br/>--the video clips are sent to my phone quickly and the clips can be saved or deleted (to save space)<br/><br/>I am curious about the battery life.  Blink says the batteries can last up to two years (we'll see).  I just purchased the outdoor Blink XT outdoor camera for one of my porches hoping that the infrared camera lives up to the hype.<br/><br/>Time will tell if the system meets my expectations, but for now I am very pleased.
 I am very pleased I bought this so far.  Set it up with no issue at all.  Biggest surprise was fact it only works on 2.4 Ghz frequency.  I had to log onto my router and make two distinct router names, one for 2.4 and one for 5 Ghz to make choosing easier so I could ensure I got ONLY the 2.4 Ghz per set up instructions.  That was the longest part of the set-up was to reprogram my router first.  Cameras work great.  Instructions for set-up are great.  Biggest weakness I found is for using it.  There is no User Manual.  You have to log onto their site and hit the FAQs to learn.  If it had a user manual that was as good as the set up manual, this would be a 5 star product.  Why do they leave owners with NO user manual, even if I had to download a pdf, it is better than none.
 It only records when the motion sensor activates the camera. It does not let you watch a live view and record the live view at the same time.
 Great little camera! It’s easy to setup: you download the app, create a free account, scan the QR codes on the back of the camera and receiver, connect to WiFi, &amp; voila. I liked it so much I just bought an add on camera. The cloud storage is free, but if you mess up and leave an oscillating fan on in the cameras view you will wake up to a full cloud storage that you have to individually delete. There is no delete all option. Lesson learned. All in all it’s worth it if you find it on sale. (Currently $77.99 w/ free echo dot).
 I have these cameras all over the outside of the house.<br/>The good:<br/>They are wireless and with a good and decent outdoor WiFi range<br/>They are battery operated and can also be plugged in via micro usb connectors for power.<br/>It has night vision<br/><br/>The bad:<br/>Video recording is not the best. It sometimes takes too much time to record first movement and can be very troublesome to catch someone walking fast or running as it will not be activated for that.<br/>The camera cannot zoom<br/>It is not user friendly to save the video. You must forward it to an email or text then download it to save it. (it is stored on blinks servers up to 14 days also)<br/><br/>Overall, for all outdoor cameras, it is a good camera to have for basic outdoor surveillance and especially if you do not want to have wiring done as compared to conventional cameras.  However, it by far is not the best camera.<br/>Honestly, it is very overpriced for the camera and service and I feel it should be around 49.00 at most per camera.<br/><br/>I have seen better wifi outdoor game cameras that work better and are less in cost than this camera.
 I have another product for my front door camera which is the best!  Blink promoted as working with Alexa which is cool.. I can see the camera on my TV's.  Unfortunately these are battery operated.  They claim to last 2 YEARS!!  Mine lasted about 2 weeks.  I replaced the batteries, 1 week!!  I have done everything to LIMIT it recording as often but to no avail.  It says on the app "HIGH USAGE".  As I said I changed the trigger area, clip length, cutting clip early on motion stop etc.  Batteries still die.<br/><br/>This would be fine maybe for an alley with little traffic, but is a complete waste of money for a busy area.  They recommend only turning on when you are gone.  People around here don't care if you are home or away to commit a crime.  I was trying to get an affordable solution, this is not it.
 These cameras work great and are easy to install. Enjoyed not having to a drill holes in my house. so far so good on battery, be interesting to see if the battery last 2 years<br/>Negative: there's no option yet to view multiple cameras at one time on a screen. Would like to see that change
 The setup when exactly as the instructions said.  That was the easy part.  Playing around with the application is easy and straight forward as well.<br/>The hard part... I have two BlinkXTs and get good pictures for the camera price and having no auto-zoom on motion feature.  Now I'm still fighting with camera placement/aiming.  I want to capture motion in certain areas, but without Zone control in the totally wireless mode, I either give up the "big" picture (i.e. aim to stay off sidewalks and roads, or accept regular pics/notifications on all the walkers, vehicles, pictures to go through, and reduced life of the batteries.  If I try to aim so the street is out of the picture, then the motion detection doesn't pick up on motion on the edges when my target area then sets...frustrating.  Maybe a Motion Zone update in the future?
 I would definitely recommend blink to anyone in search of a super user-friendly security system. I love that it has its own storage that you don’t have to pay extra for. Video quality is great!<br/><br/>The reason for 4 stars is this:<br/><br/>The delay is 20-30 seconds. I have it on my front door since the door is set back in a deep entry way. There’s no way to see who’s at the door unless you open it. Well if someone rings my doorbell, it takes at least 20-30 seconds before an alert will come to my phone. If you try to do a live view, it’ll say the camera is busy or just not load at all. It can get frustrating sometimes especially when it’ll pick up on the wind blowing a bush but not two adults on my porch. We did change its location to where it is located in the entry way area so it’s cut down on random objects tripping the motion sensor. Hasn’t helped with the delay time or “camera is busy” message.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a good camera. Video and sound quality is amazing. I will be ordering more Blink brand in the future.
 I received my first 2 camera system as a Christmas present.  It was easy to set up and install and performed well for the first 2 months.  I decided to add on 2 more expansion cameras to increase my coverage area.  Along about the same time I started experiencing problems related to software.  I have contacted technical service more than 3 times and have not been able to get the problem resolved.  My phone stopped getting "Notifications" of clips being taken.  It had been working perfectly up to this point.  Notification are important to let you know that something is going on wherever your phones are installed.  Technical Service seems to have been working diligently on the problem and always promises to e-mail or telephone me about a resolution in about 24-48 hrs.  They never do contact me.  This time it's been over a week. I'll call them again, and they'll test my phone out a zillion times and again promise to fix the problem.  It's getting frustrating.
 I bought one then bought two and now the third in two weeks.  I am very satisfied.  They are easy to install and have better picture quality than most banks.  I recently had an incident at a second home.  The mgt company rolled back my other brand camera and unplugged it.  It didn’t have a feed to a separate storage like a cloud and the other brand camera needed electricity.  My condo was heavily damaged but no footage.  I thought I had insurance for the property thru fees I pay to my condo association.  I found out the hard way that I am not insured or a claimant.  The Condo Board had no damage but can keep any funds from insurance that you pay fees for.  Protect yourself-no one values your home as much as you do.  These cameras cost so little especially when compared to the cost of damages.
 Setup was fairly easy, took maybe 15 minutes total. Most of the time was spent adjusting the mount as it kept coming apart.<br/><br/>The biggest issue with it is the connectivity.  I installed a wifi access via ethernet cable to give this camera better coverage. The module is plugged in approx. 25 feet from the camera and the module is about 25 feet from the wifi access point. Basically the  odile is directly between the camera and access point. At random times while connecting to view live, it gives an error code, camera busy, or something similar.<br/><br/>The other issue is connecting remotely to the Blink app. While at home or virtually anywhere else I can connect. But if I'm on the wifi at work it will not. I'm sure it's an IT block but it would be nice if Blink could somehow change something to be viewed everywhere.<br/><br/>Also, please design a module that is safe to be installed outside.
 I bought this in November 2018. 2 cameras that set up easily and worked perfectly for a month. Then 1 kept losing signal so I couldnt get live view or motion detection. I moved the base in hopes that it was an interference issue. It wasn't, I still get No Live View notification and the other camera has now started going offline, it does this at least once a week now. I have to climb up on my ladder and take the battery out to reset it.<br/>Its just not worth the money to me.
 The camera has a poor design as it doesn’t allow the user too much control. For example, the camera will not allow you control while events are underway or are they just happening, so there is no way you can see what is going on “live”. You have to wait until the event has ended. Under these circumstances you are nothing but a spectator of a post recorded event. The video feature has similar design flaws. There is no feature allowing you to record uninterrupted and / or continuous events despite pluging the device to the electrical outlet. There is no option allowing you to record on something else but Amazon’s cloud, such as Google Drive. I am more than sure that the design team behind this camera has the proper financial backing to rectify this shortcomings. This camera is useless virtually in any real circumstances.

I call it my Critter Cam. I've caught quite an amazing number of critters with this camera.<br/><br/>At my other residence I use it inside to catch other kinds of "2 legged critters" should they manage to get in my home. I use SimpliSafe as my burglar alarm and my Blink cameras for the security cameras. Nice to have 2 levels of security and a lot cheaper than paying a monthly premium to SimpliSafe for cameras. Also, if one system fails, I always have the 2nd to fall back on.<br/><br/>I can't say enough about how easy these cameras are to set up and use. Believe me, I am very technically challenged, and if I can set it up, just about anyone can.
 Maybe I didn't look hard enough, but I had a hard time finding a camera system with battery powered outdoor cameras that didn't require a monthly subscription. This system fits my life perfectly! I ordered the one camera XT system to try it out...ordered another the next day so I could add a second camera. Camera sensor and video clip times for each camera are stupid easy to configure. I get notifications on my Android app within seconds of a camera triggering.<br/>Day one with this system I caught clear video of someone stealing a bicycle from my driveway...BUSTED!!<br/>I have recommended this system to my friends.
 This is a very simply setup.  I installed my first 2 cameras yesterday, and the entire process took less than an hour.  This included finding a ladder and figuring out where I wanted the cameras.  This took most of the time.  I ordered a third camera and it arrived the next day.  Today, I setup the new camera and had everything working in 15 minutes.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the bracket that comes with these cameras.  The camera pops off very easily.  I presume this is to make it easy to change the battery.  But it really needs to be more secure.  I've placed an order for 3rd party brackets on Amazon and expect them in a few days.  Until then, the one that can with the cameras will have to do.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good buy and perfect solution for monitoring outside areas.<br/><br/>Be aware:<br/>1. This is low-end.  Don't expect all the bells and whistles.<br/>2. Only one person or device can view from the cameras.  If my wife is looking at a camera from her phone, I can't also view it on Alexa device.  The 2nd person sees "Camera Busy" message.<br/>3. Cloud recording is short bursts only when it sees motion.<br/><br/>Just set your expectations right and read other reviews.  I did.  So, I am happy.
 I’ve got a pretty well connected smart home. Alexa is the brains behind the operation, with Nest doorbell and indoor cams, and Sengled brand smart lights. I figured I’d take advantage of Black Friday deals and try the Blink XT outdoor cams. Unfortunately, they’re pretty weak compared to the Nest cams I have. They were pretty easy to set up, but the ease ended there. The cameras were so laggy, they were near impossible to use. I checked my Blink hub and it had excellent WiFi signal, and apparently so did the cams. In addition, after I armed the system, the cams never triggered to record activity. Long story short, I have Nest, am very happy with their cams, and will likely shell out the extra $$ for their outdoor cams.
 These cameras work fine, the wifi setup is easy, but....and this is a BIG but...the cameras do not last 2 years on the battery life. They last 6 months max. We are having to buy the batteries every 3 months and the batteries cost $8.00 for 2 batteries.<br/><br/>Blink and Amazon are  not honest when they promise and promote a 2 year battery life.
 I am very disappointed in my new Blink camera. Being an owner of Arlo cameras already, I know the downside to some of these camera systems. I thought I was making an upgrade to Blink but that turned out not to be the case. In a nutshell, my Blink camera only works when it wants to and there is no telling when that might be. I have it running on a schedule and that works perfectly! It turns on and off precisely at its scheduled times (at least that's what the app is telling me). The camera has gone entire days of recording no activity when I know for certain there has been plenty of activity and then it'll notify me that it is shutting off as per the schedule. The live camera view fails 80 percent of the time and the live pic view fails 50 percent of the time. I've tried resetting the module numerous times and that hasn't helped. I have a good WIFI signal to the camera and it has a good signal to the module so that isn't the issue. I've recalibrated the camera's sensitivity to no avail. Had I not thrown out my packaging in a post Christmas haste, I would definitely return. My only saving grace is that I didn't pay full price. Although with its performance, free is too much for a camera that doesn't live up to its hype. I've heard good things about Ring cameras. Perhaps I'll try them next
 First of all. Why provide batteries for one camera when I purchasees a two camera kit? That does not make any sense. The mount is a joke. A good wind will blow it right off the cheesey clip. One of the cameras is not working correctly. It failed to record anything at first. I re-sync the camera and then it stated working. After a few hours. The battery indicator reads low and needs replacement. I just put brand new identical battery I recently purchase and next day shipped it. I had to break open a case I just purchase to replace the battery then found out that the fully charged battery i just put in is giving low battery reading as well. Wtflying duck.<br/><br/>2 stars for functionality and ease of app operation. Even if it is super buggy still.
 Pro:<br/>`easy to install<br/>`great value for the price, at the time $300 for 5 units plus 1 console<br/>`app easy to use<br/>`sensor sensitivity accurate<br/>`range from console to cameras is great (console at 3rd fl level and cameras at top 1st fl level)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>`only records 2hrs worth of video<br/>`batteries will last a month with a busy house (alarm goes off every 45min avg.)-  i get 10 battery a month  ($0.25/Alkaline batteries)<br/>`schedule time is for all cameras, wish they be per camera<br/>`when doing an editing thumbnail, can't do other things<br/>`only 30secs view time per camera at any time
 I bought two of the Blink XT cameras to use externally with the intent of receiving recordings when there’s movement outside my house. I’ve been waiting for a product that didn’t require hard wiring as running electricity and cables to them would have been a huge job. Thus, I was happy to find these.<br/><br/>Setup - 5 stars<br/>Downloading the blink app and syncing the two cameras was a breeze. Fantastic support documentation on the blink website for every facet of setup and camera settings; I could tell Blink spent a lot of effort there.<br/><br/>Installation - 4 stars<br/>The cameras are lightweight so only a single screw and a drywall anchor (in my case) were needed to secure each camera. You hold your smart phone in one hand to check the placement of the camera and then tighten the screw once you have the camera in place. Minus a star as it takes the app about 20 seconds to take a picture after you’ve pressed the button on your cell phone to check the placement, which feels like a long time while you’re on the ladder holding the camera above your head and holding your cell phone with the other hand, taking multiple pictures to get the placement you want.<br/><br/>Video Quality - 5 stars<br/>There’s 3 settings for video quality - Saver, Best (the default), and Enhanced. Even the Saver setting seems like decent quality, which I use to save on battery life.<br/><br/>Usability - 3 stars<br/>I knew I would get extra recordings from my driveway camera as it’s impossible to not see some cars driving past triggering recordings; I accept that, and am not faulting the system for that. However, the recordings are very inconsistent, even though the camera placement is per recommendations to position it so the movement actions are perpendicular to the camera’s line of sight. For instance, the camera may trigger a notification on a car leaving the garage, but not entering the garage; and sometimes not at all even though the camera settings haven’t changed. Some days I’ll get a couple dozen recordings due to cars driving past, and other times, some recordings without any movement in the video. And if the camera detects cars driving past, it doesn’t detect a car stopping in front of the house. Other days, no recordings at all, which defies logic; the traffic doesn’t vary from one day to another.<br/><br/>My front door camera is much better at not missing movement. It will trigger movement from someone walking to the door, even though the garage camera won’t catch it.<br/><br/>After about a week, I got a notification that my batteries wouldn’t last the 2 years due to usage. That’s a bit of a letdown.<br/><br/>Summary - 3 1/2 stars<br/>I like what Blink is trying to do here, and the ease of setup is a delight. But if it’s absolutely essential you receive recordings of movement, you may want a more robust system. I’m rounding my 3 1/2 star rating up 4 stars on the review page.
 Look elsewhere. This is not a home security camera. It will record activity, with great custom sensitivity and length settings. You will not see a motion alert and video of the action until the individuals are LONG gone. This is meant to leave a trail of activity for you to view. The Live View exists here, but it takes forever to open. I’ve had Japanese brand cams that rotate 350° and they had more functionality at a fraction of the cost.<br/>I’m giving 2 stars because it is truly portable/wireless and easy to get running. But damn is it frustrating. Also, if there’s ANYTHING the camera wants to do, it takes priority over your ability to view the live stream. So if someone walks up while you’re home, don’t expect a live view. Expect to wait for the recorded video once they’re gone. Trying to open live view is a futile effort and will tell you “Not Available Camera Working” ...like hell its working.<br/>Like I said try another brand. Spend more money on Arlo.
 I have owned the Blink XT system for over a year now. I purchased this system because I needed a camera system that was wireless, didn't need a hardwired power supply and FREE storage. I liked that it was advsertised as only needing a battery every two years (I later learned that it was 2 weeks when positioned in an area with heavy traffic).<br/><br/>Easy to install but camera mount is somewhat limited in how you can angle the camera. I purchased and additional mount that allowed me to position the camera at any angle I desired. Without this added mount you are somewhat limited once mounted. (See photos).<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>-Simple set up.<br/>-Affordable.<br/>-Free storage<br/>-View live feed<br/>-Wireless<br/>-No hardwire power supply<br/>-Nice user friendly app. Can view on phone or tablet.<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>-Batteries need frequent replacement in area with alot of traffic (front of home).<br/>Mount has limited angles once mounted.<br/>-If your internet goes down so does your cameras.<br/><br/>I bought the additional mounts from Amazon: "Security Wall Mount for Oculus Sensor Arlo, Arlo Pro,SERMICLE Metal Security Camera Bracket Outdoor Indoor Oculus Rift Mount Bracket 360° Rotation 1/4" Screw Camera Wall Mounts CCD CCTV" $10<br/><br/>Thank you
 This was one of the easiest devices to set up. It took me all of about 10 minutes to set it up and getting it working properly. That includes installing the app on 2 phones and a tablet. The camera works great and what I am really impressed with is the motion detection feature it works really well. A note about the company, Blink, I kept reading that a mount came with the camera and I did not have a mount. I asked Blink about this and they immediately sent me a mount. Great customer service. I will be buying another camera.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Blink-XT-Home-Security-Camera-System-for-Your-Smartphone-with-Motion-Detection-Wall-Mount-HD-Video-2-Year-Battery-and-Cloud-Storage-Included-1-Camera-Kit/dp/B06XZWHBJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Blink XT Home Security Camera System for Your Smartphone with Motion Detection, Wall Mount, HD Video, 2-Year Battery and Cloud Storage Included - 1 Camera Kit</a>
 Cameras were very easy to setup.  The picture and night vision is good.  However the motion detector is much to be desired.  They give you an option to block out certain areas, the problem is, it doesn't really work.  I have these on the front of my house and it picks up almost every car and goes off.  Even though the street is grayed out. It picks up cars, but the motion detector sometimes doesn't pick up people walking to my front door.  Probably the most important thing.  If you don't mind your phone going off every 5 minutes that your camera went off than this is a very good camera.  Unfortunately, as many messages that go off, it's hard to rely on it.  It's so bad that I received a message from Blink that I have high activity on this one camera and the battery will not last that long.
 The system works well as far as sending video clips to your cell phone quickly.  However, it does not do well at night if you do not have some type of outside lighting.  Otherwise the resolution is great.  It has limited audio in that you can hear what's going on in the area you are monitoring but you are unable to respond back.  I also understand that while the system cannot currently be used on a computer, they are working on upgrades that would allow you to do so.  One of the better features is that you are not required to subscribe to a monitoring service, which can become costly.
 This is a cool product and has a really nice app.<br/>Pros: Wireless and easy to setup. Android app is nicely design and works well. Allows you to see the temperature and set high low alerts which is a valuable feature in that it could let you know if there was fire or if your heating system stopped working. Mobile app sends you alerts when motion is detected (notification and sound which is configurable). No monthly / recurring costs.<br/><br/>Cons: Camera unit requires connection to both the base station and your wireless network which is not clear in product description or intuitive. Has a weak connection to my wifi network even though its only about 25 feet away (though outside/through walls). The system is completely dependent on wifi internet access  as the video / audio it captures is sent to and accessed from the companies storage. Which means if they went out of business your security system would no longer work....seems a odd business model because you pay one upfront purchase price and then they have to pay the ongoing cost for the network infrastructure/ data storage part of the system in perpetuity. Makes me think this is not a product that is going to last for say 10 years...I'm betting it will last for less then 5 but just my opinion.
 Decent camera, but I think you get what you pay for.  The mounting hardware is poor.  The battery lasted 5 days on the middle quality video setting just looking at my driveway.  It maybe had 1-2 cars drive by per hour.  The mount cannot sustain the weight of the camera and it droops, so be prepared to find tertiary support for this thing.  The motion detector is finicky at times.  The onboard thermometer is a pretty cool feature.  Overall it almost gets the job done.  I will be looking to replace this in the future.<br/><br/>I changed the quality setting to the lowest quality and still the battery life lasted 4 days.  This is not the product I expected.  The camera also shutdown without a low battery alarm.<br/><br/> Look somewhere else for your home security needs.<br/><br/>EDIT:  device bricked, no longer functional in any capacity @ 31 days.  Tech support left me on read after changing the batteries and deleting / adding the camera back didn’t fix the problem.
 Super frustrating. Detecting movement constantly even when there is nothing. Even after turning the sensitivity down it still was detecting movement when there wasn't and wasn't detecting movement when I was directly in front of the camera.  Not even a month old and the battery died because it was constantly logging clips of nothing at all.<br/><br/>**Update - contacted customer service and they sent me a "new" unit to replace the defective camera. This obviously was not a new unit and showed signs of wear which was disappointing but acceptable. Thankfully though I set up the replacement unit and it works as I expected it should have in the first place. Was one star, now raised to four stars. Still can't give it five stars as this was an extremely frustrating process.
 I am accustomed to normal surveillance system that you can check footage for a selected time duration and live feed.<br/><br/>This is not it. To save battery.<br/>-It has no local storage.<br/>-Slow connecting speed. It takes 30 secs to connect to camera when you are away from the house.<br/>-Limited live feed (shows few seconds at a time).<br/>-Unreliable motion sensing recording ~10% failure of not detecting motion.<br/>-No way to download all recordings (have to do it one at a time)<br/>-IFTTT delay is far too long to be useful - 30 minutes!!<br/><br/>But I am keep it. No wires!! The 1 battery is still kicking after 2 months and I am pointing it at my front door. It will not last 2 years but a few months is good enough for the hard to wired places.
 Camera isn't as nice as others but that's the price you pay for the excellent batter life, however one of my cameras, after a couple months, is distorting the picture and changing colors. It's under an overhang and I have the blink rubber camera cover on it so I don't know why it would do this
 This cameras motion detection can take upwards of 5-10 seconds to respond making it impossible to catch someone in the act of stealing a package unless they are taking their time for some reason. I've tried playing with the settings but it seems to be a hardware limitation of the camera itself, with all the resources of amazon you would think they could make a camera capable of capturing video within a second or faster, if you plan on using this for any security purposes at all save yourself the money and go with something else.
 These cameras are extremely user friendly and easy to set up.<br/><br/>Would I buy these cameras again? No, for a few reasons, but the MAIN reason is that there is no way to set up devices that can view the account with limited permissions.<br/><br/>This means that anyone with access to view the account has to log in with the main users info, and has full access to the account. With this access, anyone with the ability to view the account has the ability to edit it, (IE: delete videos).<br/><br/>There needs to be an added function to the app that give guest viewing permissions without giving full access to the account.<br/><br/>I scoured the Blink website and support pages to no resolution. There is a forum where many people talk about this issue, dating back to 2017. However, nothing has happened to implement a feature that would fix this issue. (See thread here: https://community.blinkforhome.com/t/access-to-view-only-to-selected-users-needed/208)<br/><br/>An account owner feature is a basic security feature that many of the competing security camera companies have, and blink should offer as well, being an Amazon company.<br/><br/>Other issues that I am less concerned about but could be addressed: There is no way to record live feed while viewing and there is no way to watch live feed from a computer.
 Blink is indeed the next evolution of DIY security cameras. The set up is quite simple; it took me all of 30 minutes and that included looking for my drill bits, drilling machine and deciding the ideal location to mount the camera.<br/><br/>The setup of the camera itself from un-boxing to activating is probably around 5 minutes.<br/><br/>I am a fan of DIY security cameras and have purchased 4/5 of the Amcrest 1080P Wifi Cameras 4 years ago. What these cameras were missing to make them perfect Blink now comes packed with. For example:<br/><br/>- I always wished I could Arm my Amcrest camera from the App. Instead, I have to unplug and plug it back in to dis-arm/arm. With Blink, that can be done at home, or remotely from any where in the world, via the mobile app.<br/><br/>- Activity zones. Again, can also be adjusted via the Blink app while Amcrest require you to log in to the camera via its I.P address. Which is easy and fine if you are tech savy. For the average user who is unaware of what an I.P address is and where you even enter it, then Amcrest will require a tech friend to set it up.<br/><br/>-This is the advantage Blink has, everything is easily done via the app. Amcrest is a great camera with powerful settings and a vast array of impressive options via its IP Configure page, but it is not a simple camera. This is where Blink wins, for its simplicity.<br/><br/>I gave it 4/5 stars because of pricing. Currently (Dec 28th, 2018), Blink is retailing on Amazon for $119.99 US a single stand-alone camera (no hub). The Amcrest 1080P is retailing at $59.98 while there is a newer Ultra HD 2K retailing at $79.98.<br/><br/>Would recommend Blink as the preferred choice if it suits your budget.
 The camera set up is quite easy and once you've installed the brackets attaching the cameras is quick as well.  The app is user friendly and easy to navigate.  The step by step instructions ensure a quick set up.  The module works with both indoor and out door cameras.  The brackets are not the best yet Amazon has plenty of options to upgrade for a reasonable price.  The night vision has a good picture making it easy to make out images.  Overall a great product at a great price.  Would recommend to anyone that is interested in stepping up their home security.
 Could not get ‘sync module’ to hook up with my wifi (even after many tries). Contacted “support” team &amp; (at first) they were attempting to be helpful, although I was treated as an idiot (VERY tech savvy), then totally ignored. I am bedridden &amp; got this to identify who/what is outside my home - cost $100 to have a guy install cams, help trouble shoot, and will be more to un-install -  but they don’t seem to care. Didn’t even blink about it !<br/><br/>Returning asap
 I am happy with this system so far. It was set up within minutes and seems do do an adequate job of capturing quality video of anything that moves within it's field of view. It can be a bit slow to begin recording once in a while, but I think it'll be fine for my needs. The only difficulty I had was in setting it up on my home computer. Iphone setup was a breeze, but I had to download an Android emulator to connect it to my desktop computer. All in all, I am glad I chose this system over the others.
 I bought this product last month to monitor the back of my house. I travel a lot and I was hoping this would be a cost effective solution to protect my house. There are two major issues:<br/>i) It relies on wifi. Theoretically, it should not be a problem as I have the highest speed plan through Xfinity. The reality as we all know is that devices occasionally drop wifi. I faced this issue this week while on travel. The camera got disconnected from wifi, which I only discovered when I got home. Restarted the router which fixed the issue, but makes me wonder how much I can rely on it.<br/>ii) Second issue is the sync module. Earlier today, the sync module got disconnected from wifi. I had the camera activated by mistake and every time I walked to the back room, I got a notification on my cell phone. Because the module was not online, I could not disable the camera....a big pain.
 So far an excellent system. It's the first type of security type system I've owned and I've found this system to be very intuitive and user friendly. I use it as an indoor security camera so I don't know about its weather resistance or camera to central module signal strength. Not having to run on batteries is a great addition. It's also great that the camera and central module automatically reconnect to the internet in case of a power outage or even a lapse in internet availability which happened once while I was away from home. Internet connection was lost for about an hour, none of my smart devices were online, but as soon as internet was restored, everything reconnected and I was able to survey my home through the live feed on the app to make sure everything was okay.
 Battery worked for 2days not 2years
 i bought a 1 camera/ 1 sync combo and had quite a bit of trouble setting it up, but after numerous permutations and many tries i eventually got it working.  I went ahead and bought the 5 pack and have had nothing but problems with it.  the company apparently sells units with versions of firmware that do not connect to home wifi networks without major changes to those home networks.  i think this bug probably arouse from attempts at over-streamlining the set ease of the setup process, which in many cases i've heard simply prevents the module from connecting at all.<br/><br/>Customer support is basically what you'd expect, some non-native english speaker copy pasting irrelevant troubleshooting paragraphs that are immediately available via google.  they ignore your report on details.<br/><br/>basically bad job blink people.  you saved the 50 cents per sync module that would be required to make your product dependable by shipping bricked firmware.<br/><br/>for context, i've worked in IT/tech for 25 years.  they sell broken shit.
 I started off with one camera to see how useful the camera is and how functional the system will actually be. I'm no security export, but wanted the ability to login to the system to see a live view of my front door when the bell rings, as well as let me know when someone is approaching (instant notification on my iPhone. Installation was very EASY, and had the system up and running in under 15 minutes. For $99 all included, I am quite surprised at the quality of the video and audio. I already ordered a second individual camera to add. i can't mention anything about battery life, but with a 6ft ladder, I can change the batteries without a hassle.
 We recently moved to an area where it is very quiet.  My wife has been hesitant about security in the past but with all the porch pirates and such asked me to look into something for the house.  The Blink was priced right so we took a chance on it.  Great product.  Easy to set up.  Basically, plug in the module, download the app, and then scan the bar codes and the cameras are good to go.  We did have problems with one camera losing signal.  I called the 800 and got a live rep on the second ring.  They tested the camera and found an error code.  A new one was sent in less than a day and so far the system has been flawless.  Now we want to add additional cameras to the system.  Can't wait until they go back on sale.
 I got this so I could keep an eye on my front door and confirm when packages are delivered, which it works ok for. The picture quality is quite good during the day, not great at night but my street is very quiet so we don't worry about stuff at night too much. My only complaint is the retrigger time is wayyyyyyyy too long. I'll get a video of the guy walking up, but it ends even if motion is still happening, and then it doesn't retrigger fast enough for me to get him throwing the package. Please allow for a 5 second or shorter retrigger time!! I do like how streamlined and unobtrusive the camera is.
 Somewhere between 3 and 4 star review. These are great camera and system. Very easy set up. Very good easy use app. Fair to good picture quality. I don't notice a difference in the three levels of recording quality settings offered 3.<br/>Cons:1. a short delay when activated, abut 4 to 5 seconds. So , really a person can run by camera and never be in the video capture. The only solution is have multiple cameras to cover the area. 2. Angle of view limited, could be a wider viewing area.3.recording time very short,,10 second to 30 seconds.<br/>But, easy to mount and set up. No electricity needed, batterise used 2 AA. Camera itself is good quality, made well, has a really neat simple mount that rotates and swivels, takes just one single screw to mount,or you can use double side tape. Overall a pretty neat system,and I'll continue to use,and purchase a few more cameras.<br/>I'm really not using for security, but more to watch my yard and dog when she's outside and I'm in.
 Tried SO hard to love these cameras, but 1 thing prevented that. The motion detection delay renders them completely useless for my purpose. We got these for our house, we have been having people mess with our mailbox and mail. These wouldn't catch anyway before they left. Here was a regular scenario, while using these cameras: Amazon truck pulls up to deliver, walks 20 feet to my door, walks back to their car and the camera starts recording as they hit the sidewalk on the way back to their car.
 I used to love these cameras, but something has changed in the last few months. The software is glitchy, the cameras don’t react like they used to and now I see things “Leaving” frame instead of “Entering” and it will take minutes and sometime multiple quoting of the app to get the video to show up. I bought a total of 3 outdoor and 4 indoor and will not be buying more but will be looking for a better system
 Pros<br/>The quality of the camera case and clarity was really good. The case does have a seal to prevent water entering the case. The mount that comes with it is little disappointing. It easily falls off so if you are going to put it somewhere where there is vibration or weather, look to get a better mount.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>No local storage. The USB port on the base unit apparently isn’t for anything. Talked to support and the plans they had a year ago to add it apparently is no longer in their future.
 Getting the right Wi-Fi installed had to come first. You can’t use cell phone Wi-Fi or others that come from wireless sort.Ext find Blink<br/>App. In Apple Store for your iPhne or IPad. The rest is easy. My neighbor help me put up the cameras.Make sure you write down number from back of each camera and put in batteries,and turn it on been for you put them up. They are working fine for me.
 These little cameras are fantastic. I wanted a small, completely wireless, battery powered camera (i.e. no need for a power adaptor) to put in elevated locations around the house. They work really well. That said, the software is quite inadequate as has been discussed in other reviews. The main issue is that the files that are generated do not have time/date stamps, nor can they be monitored by others without giving them control access. Also, the activity monitor led can not be shut off on the indoor versions (although the outdoor versions can be put in stealth mode). There are many other software limitations to this system that you should be aware of before investing especially given the relatively high costs.
 You can set the sensitivity of motion detection, video length, and re-set time.  They come from the factory with video length at 5 seconds, and the minimum for re-set is 10 sec.  So, by the time something triggers the camera you will get 5 seconds every 15 seconds, or in the course of a minute you will get 20 seconds of video.  This would be fine if the camera kept videoing as long as there was motion, but it doesn't.  These are the settings that get you 2 year battery life.  IF YOU WANT CONSISTENT VIDEO OF AN AREA AS LONG AS THERE IS MOTION, GET ANOTHER SYSTEM.  IN THAT CASE YOU PROBABLY WANT HARD WIRED OR AT LEAST A CAMERA THAT DOESN'T RUN ON BATTERIES.  I adjusted my camera for 20 sec. video and increased the sensitivity and the batteries were dead in two days.  Would I buy them again?  yes, they are quite versatile, but NOT in a high traffic area.  I wish the trigger time was less than 10 seconds.  By the time the camera triggers, the mail man has put the mail in my door and is heading down the steps..... maybe I need to re position the camera.....
 I bought 4 of these. 2 indoor and 2 outdoor. These are for home security. I absolutely loved the fact they are completely wireless and only need a quality lithium battery to run. I had all 4 cameras setup and synced in about 20 minutes. The pairing was simple and the mounting was as well. Video is good enough for the price point and very clear. Audio is very good as well. Once you download the app you customize each camera individually as needed. The notifications when movement is seen are great and the cameras don’t seem to be over sensitive to picking up “nothing”. All and all a very good system for the money. With spending less then $200 on a security system I’m very happy and may purchase more cameras in the future.
 Easy to install and setup. The mounting brackets are very flexible. Great job.  It’s a little challenging to get the Blink Hub and WiFi to have sufficiently strong signal at cameras on opposite sides of a large house. But since the Hub is WiFi and can be located anywhere in the house instead of only by a wired internet connection, it gives you some flexibility.<br/>The motion sensing distance is not very far, even at Max sensitivity (9).  However at max sensitivity, you also get many many false triggers, which is very annoying and quickly consumes storage space. Therefore, I had to back off to a setting of 6. Not the best. Also, here’s no ability to define motion “areas”, or more importantly, motion-exclusion areas that won’t trigger the sensor (I.e., a plant moving in the wind).  This needs to be added to make this an effective solution like Ring and other security camera systems provide.
 Some cons:<br/>1. Slow response time...oftentimes I get the end of the movement as it’s leaving the frame.<br/>2. Video doesn’t continue if movement is detected. The clip stops at the preset time.<br/>3. The sensitivity is hard to figure out. If I set it too low I don’t get many recordings. If I set it just one higher than that, I get everything. I had a friend pick up something from my mail box and it never made it in a clip, but I get light glares pick up video at night.<br/>4. There is no angle so it doesn’t cover my entire driveway. A slight angle would be nice to cover a wider area.<br/>5. Quality of video is not the best<br/><br/>Pros<br/>1. Easy set up<br/>2. App is user friendly<br/>3. Fairly low cost
 These are pretty cheap and work well. You just don't have a lot of flexibility in recording. Only records when motion is detected, which does not have a huge range. You can block out certain areas if they are frequent triggers. I did this for the neighborhood cat who kept walking by. He still managed to trip it once though (see pic)<br/>You can save any recorded clips easily from your phone. I wish there was a desktop app to view the feed. The more you watch the feed or have clips recording, the faster the battery is used, as it is only doing anything when it detects motion or you manually view the feed. All in all, worth it at the black Friday price I paid. I would probably get a couple more next year.
 I really like the simplicity of this system.  No obligations or fees for home security.  My main complaint is that it does poorly at night or when it’s foggy and raining.  I would recommend this to a friend but I would also add that night vision is poor.  My lighting at home is decent but not directly on our cars.  I’m sure if the lighting was better we could see more clearly at night.  But if that were the case the burglar wouldn’t break into my car when it’s well lit.  I purchased this as some punks were breaking into my car in my driveway at night.  Even if we captured the person in action I don’t think we would be able to identify the person clearly at night or raining weather.
 It's neat that it doesn't need wires and works via lithium batteries but I found that the novelty ended there.  No time-lapse,  no record to SD, no motion sensing thru a window and the App leaves much to be desired.  When you combine that with the fact that it costs 5 times that of a WyzeCam (which does all of the above and more), it's a no-brainier - unless the wireless aspect is worth the extra cost to you.  I returned mine and bought 4 more WyzeCams and couldn't be happier.
 I love my in home blink cameras but don't waste your time on this one for the outside.  I had it just about on top of the adapter and everything was steady and still no live feed.  Go to somebody else for outside cameras.
 Overall i like this camera. I bought the 5 cameras on sale but I'm not sure it's worth it's full price.<br/>Pros<br/>Cameras are small and neat and instructions are clear.<br/>You can literally put these cameras anywhere i used professional 2 sided tape to install mine and it's holding pretty well... which is why i bought it standard cameras just couldn't go where i needed it to.<br/>The viewing angle is very wide and good quality.<br/>The camera sends you clips when there is motion which is quite nice and you can change the length if you want.<br/>You can add more cameras easily.<br/>Cons<br/>Only 1 account can be linked to the cameras so when i had to share it with other people in my house i had to give them my username and password.<br/>You can't see more than one camera at a time.<br/>It is slow. To load live view takes some time my dogs were barking and i pulled up the camera to see what they were barking at and the live view was still loading when they stopped barking.<br/>The live view shows for only a few seconds and asks if you want to continue i don't like this if i wanted to stop live view i would come out of it.<br/>There is about a 5sec delay when viewing live which is not that bad but you should know.<br/>Conclusion<br/>Overall once you understand the cons of this system which i have listed it's easy to love these cameras.<br/>And i do understand that a lot of the cons are there to preserve battery life but i think it should be an option rather the norm. Or add another battery.<br/>I do plan to add at least 2 more cameras for greater coverage cause I'm use to the quirks now although i wish there could be an upgrade.
 Used this for a few weeks and not bad. This requires you to buy a separate mount which sucks and why it got 1 star deduction. Also the price on the unit it self seems expensive after getting it. There is no tough waterproofing, no way to mount it without a housing, and it works like a trail cam, capturing clips and not full sessions. But it does have decent picture, an ambient temp warning I have not tested yet and free cloud to hold your clips for a little bit. Which you can save to your phone and be transferred to a larger cloud storage after that. In all if it was cheaper or on sale, I would get more. For the price now, it would have to be to fill that niche situation. Could have been better.
 Great camera!! Absolutely simple and efficient to set up and use. If you are debating between this and the doorbell camera, hands down buy this! I get alerts on phone with any motion around front of house which can be adjusted if u want more or less sensitivity.  There are no fees associated with this camera either.  Also it has a microphone that works great. I have a surveillance system that is wired and am now eliminating that save one camera as this is way simpler and wife can view on her phone as well!
 This was VERY easy to set up and install. Love the black cameras and that they are so small and not obvious. We needed a system on our acreage that has buildings and is a mile from where we reside. We used a jetpack to access wifi as this is a rural area with no internet. My husband and I both have access to the cameras on our iphones. The price was just what we could afford. The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is the alert sound cannot be changed and it is very hard to hear a small bleep while in a dead sleep even if your phone is on high volume near your bed.
 I've been using the 5 camera system for about a month now and am very happy so far. The system is super easy to setup. The hardest thing about installing the system is deciding where to install them.<br/>Pros:<br/>Fast install<br/>Small size<br/>Wireless (you can hardwire them though)<br/>Good picture<br/>Lots of video options<br/>Ability to set zones to ignore so you don't get false notifications (new feature)<br/>Free included web storage<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Live camera viewing constantly asks if you want to keep watching. I'm sure that this is to maintain battery life but it's slightly frustrating when initially installing the cameras. This is really a minor con in all honesty.
 I added one more Blink Camera to the five I had already installed to give me an additional view of the front door area.  The camera was delivered on the second day after ordering, I installed the Lithium batteries, then made note of the camera serial number and used my smart phone to install the camera to my system.  Using a stepladder, I installed the mounting bracket (one screw) and then mounted the phone.  After checking the picture on my smart phone, I adjusted the camera angle and the job was done.  Very easy, no wiring, no holes to drill, just one screw for the mounting bracket and I was ready to go.  The picture from the Blink camera was excellent, and I am very happy with the product.
 It's not a perfect security solution, but it's probably the best for the money. I purchased the 5 camera system, and it's been very helpful for monitoring my house, front and back. The video quality is very good to excellent, as is the sound quality, and the night vision images are quite good as well. The one thing that absolutely stinks is the mounting bracket design, which is flimsy and cheap. I ordered a better set of mounts for $40, but really the system should come with decent mounts even if it cost a bit more.
 1. Recorded a lot no moves.<br/>2. Not recorded my kids come back from school.<br/>3. If close to wall(part the view on well), the night mode can not see anything.<br/>4. Stop recorded when event still move.<br/>5. Wi-Fi break sometime.<br/><br/>For all of it, you may use it for something, but can not use it for security system.<br/><br/>The only good things is, it's wi-fi and battery.<br/><br/>Received it before a trip, very disappointed about it, can not return it after come back.<br/><br/>I really wish I can still return it.
 Love that install doesn't require wiring.  Also that they are not that noticeable.  Alerts work well and battery life has been  surprising given that we check them pretty often for package deliveries and also to check on pets.  Video during the day is pretty good.  Nighttime not as good but usable as an overview.  Overall we give them a B+ to A-.<br/><br/>PROS: Easy to install and Android App works well.  Battery life great.  Daytime video pretty good.<br/>CONS: No 2 way audio, no tilt/pan/zoom.  Night video not that clear.  Biggest CON is the price of these cameras.  It has stopped me from expanding the system. Will wait and see what pricing does or if sales pop up.
 I've had this about 2 weeks now. On the plus side, it's very easy to setup. The down side would be A) the video quality, especially the IR/night quality. It's so blurry at more than 4 - 5 feet out from the camera as to be pretty much useless and B) Some of the advertised features - including the ability to set the clip length (mine won't record for more than 5 seconds unless there's motion again), and the ability to stop recording once motion stops aren't working. This appears to be a common problem if you look at the Blink Support Page, and has been going on for along time without the issue being addressed by Blink. For some people it works fine, others not at all. So it's sporadic at best. At this stage, I'd be hard pressed to actually recommend it over another system. Maybe that will change over time if the functionality gets fixed.
 I received the cameras and one was green. After some hassle I finally received a box and new camera in the mail with a pre-paid shipping return label to send the old one back. So it was somewhat easy to return but had some issues with customer service not listening to me. New camera worked so I mounted it like the others. They take about 4 seconds or so to turn on so if a vehicle drives by I glimpse the back of it just barely before it is out of the shot, sometimes no vehicle at all. The batteries lasted a month instead of 2 years, that's just ridiculous. Even if it was using 2x the amount they say the batteries should still last a year. Then one camera started clicking between ir on/off till it's battery went dead. The motion detection is a joke, I will have a person 8 feet in front of the camera moving and it will shut off at 5 seconds when I have it set to 60. Sometimes it will turn on and not turn off for 60 seconds and nothing will be in the shot. Horrible cameras, quality is not 1080 as described, etc. Good luck if you bought these. Don't buy if you are considering it.
 Less than four months and the battery is done. We don’t use it unless we are home.. it catches people after they’ve been in the camera view.. so we get the tail end of someone walking by or driving away. (Yes we changed sensitivity and tit didn’t make a difference). THe picture is pretty clear. Just not recommended if you can afford to pay for something more effective.
 Very clear daytime images, wireless, very easy to setup outside, compact design, and I like that the sync module does most of the heavy lifting in transmitting information to the cloud. The sync module probably is the reason the Blink XT has such great battery life.  However I returned this product due to A) trees in front of our house kept triggering the camera. Even on a low sensitivity setting the trees would still set it off recording hundreds of clips per day and  B) this camera lacks people detection, and C) bad night vision video quality
 Arrived on time.  Very good quality.  Easily installed in minutes with a screwdriver and ladder.  I have purchased seven of these cameras and all work fantastic inside and outside of our home.  We are currently on vacation in the Caribbean and access them via our cell phones.  Storage is through iCloud.  These cameras can be set at different sensitivities and record times.  No drilling for wires and no messy wires coming out of the wall.  Simply install the Lithium batteries with a two year life span, load the information from the camera onto your iPhone or android and you are ready to use them.  Pictures are very good quality and you have the ability to enlarge the images on your phone.
 My first camera was inoperable, the motion sensor didn't work unless I touched it.  Returned it, received a new one about 5 days later.  The 2nd unit worked, although I never could get the sensitivity set to my liking.  At 5 I would not get an alert unless something was moving left to right or right to left but it wouldn't trigger if I was walking towards it until I was right up on it.  At 6 it would send non stop stream of alerts if it was raining, or about every 20 minutes during "bug" hours/activity.  Also, regardless if it was at 5 or 6, it would for some reason pick up the mail truck 20 meters from my house, but it would not pick up me leaving or entering my driveway, which was only a couple of feet difference from the path the mail truck took.  This was inconvenient as I had to put up with a bit of interrogation from the wife, "I thought you said you got home at 6?" kind of stuff.<br/><br/>I will look into the higher end devices, I think you probably get what you pay for in this instance.
 It works fine.  Quality is good, and I will let you read other reviews for details.  I have some suggestions to make this a better product.  First, making changes to the settings is very slow to update.  It takes about 15 second before you can go turn on the camera.  Not a huge deal but frustrating when you are testing your settings.  Second, the thumbnail you can take does not work in landscape mode.  I wish the thumbnail (snapshots) would be saved to the cloud like the video so you could go back and look at previous thumbnails.  While you can take a thumbnail anytime, you can not start the recorder anytime you want.  There has to be a trigger (movement of some kind) before recording begins.  I would like to just be able to turn it on and record. Again, important during testing, but also triggers can be sensitive, so when I am looking in, when the system is not armed or not, I would like to be able to record.  Oh, and audio is very clear.  I recommend to my friends, it just has a few minor issues.
 These are great security cameras!  They are easy to setup.  Just download the app on your tablet and/or phone, connect to your wireless internet and add each camera one at a time. Then you mount them wherever you want.  We bought additional mounting brackets which made it easier to get the angle we want in each place.  We bought the system with 5 cameras and realized we needed a couple more.  It was easy to do.  Now we can see all around the house day and night. The night vision is great! Nice and clear.  We can also hear what is going on.  We do not have Alexa, so we can not talk to people through the system. But it is good to have a recording of what is happening.
 Not a fan. Doesn't pick up motion unless someone walks within 3 feet. Night picture is completely blurry no matter where it's located. Can be placed at 6 feet up or 1 foot off the ground. I attached a picture of what I see at night.
 Very poor design. Returned it.<br/>The cheap plastic mounts disengage from camera very easily
 Will not connect to my Internet, which I have no other problems with. I have excellent wifi and it’s never slow with anything. I believe this is just a hit or miss piece of junk. At the tech’s suggestion, I only got it to connect by using my iPhone data as a hotspot for my ipad. Obviously not practical. This proved the camera works. The system will not run on a good wi-fi signal though.  Good luck if you decide to buy this just because you’re hoping for the best. Now I have to hassle with UPS to return it. At my own expense. I was really excited about this system too. I wanted it to work.
 I love the cameras. They were easy to install and work well. The only issue I have is finding the right sensitivity for them. The one on my front door picks up lots of road traffic and alerts me. If I turn the sensitivity down it won’t pick up people at my door.<br/>I saw there was an update to block out areas, like the road, but that update hasn’t appeared yet.
 Received the kit and immediately was surprised at how small the cameras and sync module were! Very straightforward and simple<br/>Instructions made it a breeze to install (I install surveillance systems professionally). Loading the software app on your android or iOS phone first then setting up the sync module and adding devices was easy, however placement was a little challenging as each camera must have adequate signal strength not only from your WiFi access point/router , but the sync module as well. I found it easier to add a camera then use it to determine signals a a desired location using the device settings on the app which shows sync and WiFi signal strengths.<br/>Another area for focus is Motion Sensitivity , which drives notifications. There is no way to zone motion activity on each camera, so placement away for traffic areas or blowing leaves/branches is essential. The only way to adjust is through sensitivity adjustment.<br/>Lastly, no easy way to just monitor cameras (mounted tv or monitor), only viewable by mobile/tablet device.<br/>My customer wanted to place a XT camera on a tree , about 30 meters behind the home, works like a charm! Place the sync module in the center of the home for best range.<br/>Overall, if battery life meets expectations, a great home system, though limited use in high traffic areas.
 These cameras are very inconsistent in picking up motion and recording.  They will pick up a car driving by from 40 feet away or a wasp flying around, but they won't pick up a person walking 5-10 feet in front.  Every day we have adjusted position and sensitivity trying to get them to work properly, but so far we never know when or if they will record.
 We got the Blink XT to have wireless video coverage of our backdoor, back porch and back yard.  We are very satisfied with how well the system works.  So far the only feature I wish worked differently is the notification of activity that is sent to my smartphone and tablet.  The notification is sent only after the motion activated video recording is completed.  I would prefer that the notification be sent when the motion activated video recording begins.  I highly recommend the Blink XT system.
 Quality-it’s ok.  Not very heavy duty construction and certainly not worth what it’s advertised for. It just doesn’t have the quality feel to it-plastic is cheaply made.<br/>I feel a company as large as Amazon has an opportunity to blow competitors out of the water with this product.  It has so much potential!!!<br/>Listen to me Amazon!<br/>Price-<br/>I would be willing to pay what you want for it if you make it a bit sturdier construction, beef up the image quality a bit, and improve the mounting bracket a bit.<br/>The free storage is fantastic, and it does what it is advertised to do.<br/>Features in the menu are easy to use and set.  My main complaint is the quality of the video at night.  It’s “ok” but if you want to identify your intruder I don’t think it’s possible.<br/>Overall I am very pleased with the product though.  Really cool!!!!<br/>Video quality needs a bit of help at night.<br/>Thank you for listening!!! Work on the items I described and your competitors will no longer be “competitors”....<br/>You will have the corner of the market.
 I bought one system with two cameras to secure an apartment I am not currently living at. Very, very simple to set up. If you have wifi and your password you will have it up and running in under 5 minutes. You download the Blink app for your phone. Instructions that are included or from the app on your phone are simple. You take a picture from each camera and name the area you are looking at. From the app on your phone you can get notifications if something triggers the motion sensor in the camera. I tripped my cameras and the notification came within 5 seconds. You get a video clip and audio. You can delete or save these. You can arm and disarm the system from your phone when it's not connected to wifi. Make sure you allow this in cellular data (iPhone). You can get temperature notifications if it becomes too hot or cold.<br/>I waited to see how I like the system before I bought the same setup for where I currently reside. Simple to add an additional location. I bought the model for outdoors because they are waterproof and I thought I might place one outside. They also have the night vision. A little more money but worth it for the capabilities.<br/>For a relatively small investment I now monitor two locations and have a lot more peace of mind.
 I purchased a single camera system to put over the door on my front porch. I have had a few instances where packages were noted as being delivered but were never on the porch when I checked. Even when I was home. This camera does a great job, day or night, and I have been very pleased with it so far.<br/>  The only problem I have with the unit is the mount for the camera. It is very thin and flimsy and the camera just snaps onto it. The camera was constantly popping off the mount when trying to adjust the angle and it feels like a heavy wind will pop it right off. A ball mount or even some kind of bayonet style would be much better. I'm going to try and 3d print a better mount and if I have any luck, I'll update this with the info to get it on Thingiverse.
 I purchased this because we were not totally pleased with the responsiveness of our Ring Stick up Cam.  After installing the Blink XT I have decided I prefer the Ring.  I like the Ring app better.  The major thing I liked about the Blink XT is that it uses batteries that are supposed to last two years.  We purchased a solar panel to keep the Ring batteries charged and it worked great for about 10 months.  Then we started the periodic taking the camera down to recharge.  I wonder if the batteries in the Blink will really last two years.  Also had problems positioning the Blink module so it could communicate with both the WiFi and camera.<br/>Update.  I’ve been had this camera several days and have decided it is superior to the Ring Stick Up cam.  It is more responsive, it starts filming sooner.  Not sure about battery life at this point.  Located a WiFi extender near the camera and plugged in the module in the same outlet, problem solved.
 I purchased a XT on Dec 27th. After having time to test it out I would like to say the camera works well, easy to install and has good picture quality. Now for the down side, Functionality with echo is very limited. I bought it hoping once motion was detected by Alexa the it would trigger a light of my choosing to come on, It doesn't. All I can do is arm/disarm blink. The other downside is lack of speaker, if Ring can do it for a doorbell then this shouldn't be that hard. Lastly the prices have went up way to much. I paid $77 and got a free Echo dot with my Blink XT, now the camera alone is $100 to $130. Its just not worth it at that price point.
 Camera is busy. Wifi strength is excellent between the cam and the device, as well as between the device and the router. Camera can see and pickup audio, but refuses to record anything. Same result after multiple resets and configurations. 90% I cannot even see the stream because "Camera is busy." Do not buy this!
 Great camera but very temperature sensitive. They work well when the temp range is above 40 degrees but below that it shuts down until the temp rises to 40 degrees. Living here on the east coast during winter that’s not a good thing for an outdoor security cam. I like the idea of battery powered and cordless but cold and useless is more the truth of this device. During the summer I am sure it will be fine, maybe I will put them on the boats, but for home security I’m sticking with WiFi cams with ac support. I use a lot of amazon devices but truth be told, this one needs to be re-engineered and tested before it’s rolled out as an all weather cam.
 I had high hopes for the blink camera. I purchased one and was pretty happy with it. Decided to order another one 2 days later.  During the day the new one looks great, however, the night vision is terribly foggy. I immediately contacted Blink support via email. They wanted motion clips and snap shots which I provided. They then told me its probably where I have it located...hmmm.  Ok, its on a shelf in the dining/family room. How can that be an issue? So I moved it to another wall, same issue. Again was told to send more video and photos. No more responses from Blink, I guess they don't stand behind their products. Really disappointed, guess I will purchase a different brand and send this back to Amazon.
 I've spent far too much money over the past several years on "budget" or "entry level" security cameras, trying to get just the most basic monitoring of driveway and exterior. All of these cameras/systems were more trouble than they were worth. The designers of the Blink XT system have obviously listened to frustrated consumers. The Blink system is simple and quick to install. It accomplishes basic motion-activated video security monitoring tasks with no fuss. The included cloud based video storage is a great solution. I unboxed the system, followed the instructions and had a working internet connected camera with motion detection and cloud-based video clip storage in about 20 minutes. I believe the system is capable of audio monitoring but I have not used that feature. The free iPhone app is relatively feature-rich and intuitive. Note that the system requires your wireless internet connection, your creation of a free cloud-storage account, and your smartphone. Virtually all setup and control of the system is through the smartphone app. Don't expect high-end security camera features for this price. But for just the basics - it works better than anything I've tried before.<br/><br/>Update:  After living with the Blink xt for a while, I’m still very pleased with the system. It doesn’t promise all the high end features - and it performs well as an entry level motion detecting camera. Still very satisfied with the purchase. Easy to install and easy to use. Cloud storage works well. And I’m  still running on the original batteries. Lots of capability for the price.
 Worst thing I have literally ever bought on Amazon horribly unreliable not working as described I got it to watch over my cars and I  can literally get in and drive away in my car or park where the camera is looking directly and it will not even trigger the motion activity please stay away!!!
 Really liking the cameras so far. I was recently burglarized in a new home id inly been living at for a couple weeks . now im at a new place and i bought these. Its been snowing so it is weather proof for cold. I have this in my front door and patio. I did forget that they are not 2 way radio like ring but thats ok. I was all about the battery life and night vision and no cost for storage. Since i live in a complex it gets alot if motion in the front door area. The patio is quiet . my bf and i are still livinf in fear mode even though we have adt home security plus the cameras. It makes him feel better when he can check in on the house. We plan on getting more soon. Would recommend .
 The good: simple to install, decent video and audio, decent range on the wireless<br/><br/>The bad: has bugs, limited storage, limited features, I don’t like their support.<br/><br/>Motion area is buggy. I contacted their support and was told that this is a “beta” feature. This is a table steak of all security systems. Without this, the product is basically useless as a home security system. I spent a lot of time dealing with support, their solution is to take them down, remove the batteries and a reboot may fix it. I have a 2 story home, taking down these cameras is a pain and time consuming, also the absence of this “feature” being fully functional puts my home safety at risk. This seems like it will be a great product but right now it appears to be immature and buggy.
 I ordered these when something was stolen off my front porch (the stolen item came from Amazon and they were great in replacing it).  The cameras are great.  I think even the sight of them makes the bad guys disappear.  The only problem I have is to make the sensitive enough to pick up what is going on in the front yard, the wind makes them go off.  Of course we have had a lot of wind lately, stronger than normal. Sometimes I would like to turn off one camera, and don't think I can do it unless I climb the tree and turn it off at the camera.  I can shut down all three via the bluetooth, but that isn't what I want to do.<br/>Our four legged escape artist appeared on the front porch camera when we were out of town.  The camera told me he was not in the yard and i was able to contact a family member to go get him instead of his running around in the neighborhood of a day or two.  Yeah!
 I just received the Blink XT Home Security 2 Camera System and have been using it for a couple of days, I'll be sure to update my review after more extensive use of the system, but my initial impressions are very positive.<br/><br/>First, the system was an absolute breeze to set up; just plug in the sync module to a power supply and use the Blink App (for both Android and iOS) to connect the sync module to your router. Once you have connected the sync module to your router, just insert the provided AA batteries into the actual cameras and follow the instructions in the app to connect your cameras (up to 10 per sync module) to the sync module and your router; all this really entailed was using the Blink app to scan the QR code on inside of each camera, which made set up even easier. Side note: if you would like to turn off the blue recording light on the camera, then be sure to flip the switch on the inside of camera while you are putting in the batteries (turning off the blue light is only on the XT models, I believe).<br/><br/>The picture quality on the cameras is very clear and the night vision works well too. From the instances thus far that the motion detection has been triggered it seems to be working accordingly as well. I will say though that when I increased the sensitivity of the motion detection from a 5 to a 7 (out of 10) that I did get a few false alerts, but lowering the sensitivity back down to 5 seemed to remedy that issue and any motion that was caught there after was accurate.<br/><br/>As far as the user interface of the app, it is pretty intuitive; viewing your various cameras and changing the settings is not difficult and straightforward. Being able to view the cameras temperature (and set when to be alerted if that temperature gets too high or too low) as well as the battery is nice feature. I do wish there was a setting to turn on and off the blue recording light on the cameras within the app as well as a native ability to set a schedule for when motion detection is to be enabled.<br/><br/>The build quality of the cameras and the sync modules are fine, nothing lacking, but there is certainly room for improvement when it comes to the housing of the camera and the latch to remove the battery cover.<br/><br/>The reason I am only giving the system 4 stars is primarily do to the fact that the cameras lack 2-way audio (you can only listen in to the video clips that recorded, 2-way audio is something I expect on a system of this price) and that the system does not provide true live viewing functionality, as in you can only view clips of the past 5 - 30 seconds rather than just viewing a constant stream of what is happening that very moment. Also, the mounts that come with the cameras are very limited, I would recommend purchasing these mounts to supplement:<br/><br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Blink-XT-Camera-Wall-Mount-Bracket-Weather-Proof-360-Degree-Protective-Adjustable-Indoor-Outdoor-Mount-and-Cover-for-Blink-XT-Outdoor-Camera-Security-System-AntiSun-Glare-UV-Protection-Black-3-Pack/dp/B07CNZ2TQT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Blink XT Camera Wall Mount Bracket ,Weather Proof 360 Degree Protective Adjustable Indoor Outdoor Mount and Cover for Blink XT Outdoor Camera Security System AntiSun Glare UV Protection(Black(3 Pack))</a><br/><br/>I'll be sure to update my review in a month or so when I have had more time with the system and can speak more to the battery and reliability of the cameras. For now though, overall this is a great security camera system (with room for improvement) that I would recommend considering to anyone who is looking to add a little extra security to their home.
 After much research, I chose Blink and I am so glad I did.  Super easy to install and use with my phone.  I have also integrated with my Amazon TV (firestick).  The images are so clear and detailed.  I like the ability to customize each camera's recording time and sensitivity (I bought 5 camera system).  The infrared night vision is crystal clear also!  I have been able to view the wildlife visiting my yard at night. The only complaint I have is that the images will cloud up when the weather conditions are such that water condenses on the lens.  That is no fault of the system...its a weather thing.  You can also capture sound if you desire which is also impeccable.  You may turn off this option if you like as well.  Overall, great security accessory!  Love it and have recommended to many friends.
 I'm 76 years old. I took the courage to install the two-camera system myself. In a short period I had it up and running. It is that easy. The system works as expected. Although I have some remarks. The adjustable wall_ mount bracket is flimsy. The camera moves in the wind. And I wonder how long it will hold in harsh tropical weather. The other remark is about the video recording. There is  about one second delay between the detection of motion and the recording. Specially if the subject is moving fast you'll miss some footage. Although the cameras are built for outside use, I fitted them with protective silicone skins. I'm happy with this system but I realize that I should have ordered the three camera system. I will purchase the third camera soon.
 The Blink XT outdoor camera is so versatile seeing as it runs on 2 lithium AA batteries. I bought mine to monitor the front door for porch pirates. The video is great, it has a lot of features including choosing zones for the motion detection. The night vision is fantastic as well. The only gripe I have with this camera is how long it takes to send a notification to my phone that there is motion. It seems to notify me after it has taken video, but it would be nice to have it instantly tell me so I can watch in real time. This is of course not a doorbell camera, so I can let that go.<br/>Bottom line, these cameras are great and when on sale they are really worth it, but I think they are a bit overpriced at their regular price of $130. If Wyzecam can make an amazing camera that has a better picture and includes free cloud clips as well for $20, then Blink can bring the price down a bit to make these really worth it.
 Good Motion Detect Cameras. Awesome price. Pros: light and compact, uses lithium AA batteries you can get anywhere. No cloud storage charges unlike Nest and Ring products that charges for access to your videos. Live view option a plus. Cons: Video quality is average for these compact cameras, they say 1080p it’s false marketing more like 720p In enchanted mode. Mounts are flimsy and shake on windy days, uncomfortably easy to pull off mount making theft very very easy. App often takes a while to load live view and watch recordings, which matters when you get an alert and need to watch what’s happening, waiting a few minutes to get live view or recorded events is really annoying. No two way audio or CVR (continues video recording) modes.
 Camera system is easy to setup and use, even for someone with limited computer/internet/cloud skills like me.  Works great during the day, average quality at night.  The blue light coming on when motion is detected will probably be enough to deter most criminals.  The blue light can be deactivated with the flip of a switch if you want to take video without it coming on.  I do not like the flimsy camera mounts.  They will work fine indoors but suggest purchasing the aftermarket mounts for outdoor use, especially in areas outside of covered porches or areas where the camera could be easily bumped while cleaning the surrounding area.  I put the 5 pack XT system in my Wish List and a week later it was on sale for $100 off.  Glad I waited to make the purchase.
 Great system. Easy to install and the system does what they advertise. I have heard  of challenges with the battery life. I have not had that issue. If taken into account that the system is motion activated and the cameras are set up accordingly, the battery life has not been an issue for me at all. I think the system is great and I am not easy to plz. Easy set up, easy access on the app, I can see and hear what I need, when I need. The quality of the camera is good. The video quality is decent. The free video clip storage is sufficient for my needs. It doesn't record the live feeds, just the motion activated, but that works for me. I have the XT system. It has great night vision and I use them indoor and outside..I reccomend you buy the seperate heavy duty wall mounts that they sell for better mobility in angles and just better mounting quality in general. I have two of the main hubs ( 1 is required for every 10 cams. You can mix and match the XT or the basic white cam within that 10 for each hub. I can access both hubs on the same app. I have 10 cameras currently and will add 10 more. I just had twins and added a nanny to the household. So far it has given me peace of mind for that reason alone... thanks to Blink! It is worth the money in my opinion and is an excellent, immediate affordable security camera system for the average Joe like me.
 Most make you pay monthly for service. I love that you don't with this one. The quality is pretty good and you get sound. You can store videos for up to a year and view/delete at your own convenience. Downside is you can't talk to someone at your door. I mostly like it for the video/sound. I can see when mail is delivered and anytime someone is at my door. It's not overly sensitive to animals, though I know it has adjustments that can make it more or less sensitive. I haven't adjusted it apart from factory settings because I like where it's at. I have my front door cam pointed out at my front door and facing our street and it only picks up cars that actually stop at our house, not everyone that just passes by. It also has pretty good night vision. Overall, love.
 Absolutely love my Blink XT exterior camera system. Incredibly easy to install and set-up. So far they've been rock solid in both dry and wet condition  with high and  low temperatures. Battery life seems good. Video quality is good. The software is evolving and needs too. Overall, in spite of the recent price increases, I consider these Blink XT units to be a good value for a DIY home monitoring camera system.
 This was my first sorry system. It was easy to set up, and was initially working well. About 6 months into use, I added a second camera. Again, simple. But then I started getting periods of the sync module not working. I would reset the module and it would work for about a week then stop again. Contacted Blink support and they were helpful and eventually they determined that the issue was that both my 2.4 and 5 mHz networks had the same name, and my Eero network could not be configured that way. Just to help Blink sent me a new sync module, hooked it up and it stopped working after a month. Completely dead. Nothing. So now my investment in Blink is gone and I have to find a new system.
 I love these things. Sends you a text within 3 seconds normally. I had Foscam system before and it was just too hard with the with the blue iris software to keep going. Always something wrong but with the Blink system, fast to set up. Just no issues with it at all. I liked it so much I bought one for my business also. NO I am not paid to advertise for Blink. Just that relieved to find something that works and easily.
 First of all, I got the 1-camera kit AND a FREE amazon echo dot.... for $77, so CLEARLY a great deal.... For the camera and system, VERY easy to setup and operate. I have 3 outdoor nest cameras and I actually think the UI for the Blinks is better.  The video quality is decent and the system is fairly responsive. Just have to see how long the batteries<br/>last. I would probably only by these cameras when they are on SALE and not pay full price.
 Update at 90 days:<br/>Camera has been working good, but the lithium batteries only lasted 82 days. Unit would not work at all with alkaline batteries. Camera is currently down while waiting for an order of new batteries.<br/>I have both a Ring and a Blink camera. The Ring is dependable around 50% of the time. The Blink has been dependable 100% of the time.<br/><br/>Super easy to install and set up. Good quality video and not having to pay a monthly fee for storage is very much appreciated.<br/>I took off a star off for the Android Blink app. The app is on the very lower end of quality, and it could really use some re-designing.<br/>Other than the app, this product is great.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R3B5VIAJ9Z5JCF"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812QJZt9XpS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1y3lZq610S.png"/> Ordered this item to replace a hodge-podge of old D-Link camera's.  D-Link's app was a mess and connection to camera's was spotty at best (not to mention that only half of them worked with Amazon Alexa).<br/><br/>The cameras were a breeze to setup, both connecting them to the Sync module and our WiFi network.  In total, took about 20 minutes to get all camera's configured and ready to be mounted.  The app is simple and easy to use, and most importantly, it responds quickly every time.  Setup of each device, from sensitivity to IR intensity to motion detection was intuitive.  Since purchase, they've also added a beta feature to allow you to set Active Zones for each camera's motion detection.<br/><br/>The camera's supposedly capable of 1080 HD resolution if you set the quality to enhanced.  I'm not sure if it really is 1080, but it's much better than the 720 HD quality from the old D-Link systems.  Quality in the day time is excellent, but at night, especially with just the IR illumination, the pictures and video can be a bit fuzzy and items too close to the camera can tend to be oversaturated and washed out by the IR.<br/><br/>I was a little worried about the signal from the Sync Module to each of the 5 cameras, especially since 3 were going to be outside (front and back) and up to 30 feet or more away (going through several walls and brick).  So far, there has been no issues and the camera farthest away (watching our driveway) maintains a 4 out of 5 bars signal to the Sync Module.<br/><br/>It's too early to tell if the battery lie is really going to be 2 years (best guess, upping the video quality, length of recording time, sensitivity of the motion detector plus the number of times we use the Live Mode view will greatly reduce this).  The good new is, these devices can be powered by a Micro USB cable, indoors or outdoors.  For the outside, we ordered 2 16' cables plus a solar powered unit.  So far that all seems to be working great!<br/><br/>Lastly, notifications have tended to be within seconds of the activity happening, and being able to view the recorded clip by just responding to the alert (iOS) opens the app and plays the clip within a few seconds.  And right now, we are at about 21% of the free storage within a week's worth of usage (close to 100 clips, ranging from 5 to 10 seconds).  Your usage will of course vary depending on your own settings.  We had a break-in last year, so I'm super paranoid about security (why we initially got the D-Link camera's from a friend), and we have a dog that suffers from seizures, so I have the camera's set to capture motion more than most people might.<br/><br/>Integration with Alexa has been a breeze so far.  We have an Echo Show, plus several Fire HD's setup in dock mode, and being able to say, "Alexa, show me the front door" when the bell rings has been a blast, especially when we are at the back of the house.  It can take 6 to 7 seconds for it to display the live feed, but that has been more than enough time to see who is at the door before opening it.<br/><br/>I had considered going with an Arlo system, as many were on sale for Black Friday, but as of right now, I have no regrets (higher picture quality, more cameras for less money).  All in all, I'm super happy with this purchase!!!
 So, easy to set up, it took me about 15 minutes including updating the firmware. I only purchase one camera with the base unit, as I wanted to try it out for quality and usability before making a big investment. So, far very unpressed. The video quality appears to be good. I turned off the sound as it was annoying. I have not found a permanent location yet, but seems to work well in its temporary home on the front of the bird house. I tested it by walking towards the camera and immediately received an alert. I still need to play around with the settings as although I could be identified, my face was not clear. Once I have a little more experience with Blink I will probably get more cameras.
 First off the set up is pretty simple and the camera quality is good even at night in the dark. Blink however has a major shortcoming when compared to the competitors like Nest and Ring. You cannot view the camera on your computer (MAC or Windows). This is a major deficiency and the Blink developers response to 100's of request for this feature is pretty dismal. I would not have bought the Blink had a known this but that is my fault for not doing my homework on the product before buying.<br/>Update January 9<br/>My link has been installed for less than 2 weeks and I am getting the message that the battery that is supposed to last 2 years needs to be replaced
 I will be doing an update on this cam after having used it and unable to return it. I'm very impressed with the technologies used and absolutely upset over poor design features such as echo dot or Alexa. Keep an eye out.<br/><br/>Excellent camera. BUT THIS PRODUCT IS NOT ALEXA COMPATIBLE AS stated in the ad page. There definition of compatibility with Alexa means :Give Alexa a command to view previous recorded video.  NOW if an individual is purchasing this for protection I would expect an intrusion detected on camera to immediately show on ECHO SHOW. What kind of security would this device provide if you never k ow there was an intrusion.
 They revoked SmartThings support with 0 days notice. Terrible company and now the product overall is fairly useless in a smart home setup.
 My camera lasted 3 months before it started to fail to trigger, false trigger and I one day just started to wig out!! It’s pathetic Amazon doesn’t have its own company’s phone number, so you have to google it on your own. Customer service fights you with everything in their power to try to convince you the camera is not at fault. So be prepared to spend an hour of arguing to try to prove your case!! They said battery was dead!!! So don’t believe the hype of the 2 year battery life b.s. I only owned it for months and already had problems. The main reason I bought this camera was because it is backed by amazon. What I had to go through to get a replacement was incredibly difficult and went beyond amazons smile from A to Z. The service they gave me was from F to U!!

The second picture uploaded is of the in Blink App what you’ll see if you purchase one, that is the home screen. Once you download the Blink App you can set your sensitivity levels at various positions from high to low as well as recording time from 5 sec. to 60 sec. I definitely recommend if your on a budget and don’t want to spend a lot of money on a camera. I got some good compliments. The notifications alerts ate pretty fast. Everything is wireless, use 2x AA batteries. It’s convenient and not as expensive as other cameras on the market.
 It works good for what it is when the camera is armed all that means is it records any motion it does not offer  continuous recording  And when you  actually are watching the camera live on your phone a blue light comes on the camera which will give it away or let people aware it’s there if it’s dark I don’t like that and  I would like to be able to view the camera continuously on a TV or monitor in my house but you can’t  you can only watch it through the app and you can only watch it for a minute or two at a time and it cuts off  i’m a little disappointed  thanking about returning
 On the positive side the camera is wireless so I didn't have to run any electrical and it does work fairly well but not as well as some of my other cameras. The picture is clear day or night.<br/><br/>On the negative side the 1st set of batteries only lasted me 3 months. Also on the negative side is it has a main base that does need AC and both have to have a good Wi-Fi connection as well as be able to connect to each other. Additionally, the audio isn't that good .
 The camera is set so I can see people approaching my door. I live in a condominium community of duplexes where the front door of one condo is directly opposite the front door of the next building -- our front doors are actually on the sides. I was going nuts because the neighbor whose door I face is in and out at least eight times a day and each time I would look on the phone to see what the camera saw. Then I discovered that I could block out part of the view and that solved the problem with an occasional lapse. The lapses which occur maybe twice a week are completely random and self correcting.<br/><br/>It was easy to set up and I am very glad to have it.
 XT is not any better than original one.<br/><br/>Comparison says night vision, and that's full false advertisement. It is simply comparably larger in size, looks like better insulated from rain/moist; that's what you pay additional. Nothing interesting about its night time vision, and detection; or its software capabilities. Battery is one thing that makes it powerful, but that's where it shines.. nothing else.
 I received this as a Christmas gift and it works well and is good quality. The video picture is very good in the day with nice color and the picture at night is pretty good but not as good as the day. We can hear the volume pretty good but wish it was a bit louder.  I get the alert that someone was in the camera view pretty quickly also. We like this security camera and as a matter of fact we bought another one. (I just wanted another camera to add but saw we could buy the whole outfit again for just another $8.00 so we bought another whole system instead of just another camera.)<br/>I would recommend this product as a quality product for what it does.
 These work alright, I bought them for my Cabin. Since there is not as much movementaround the Cabin, I opted for these. But I also have the Arlo Pro 2 at my house, those work much better in all aspects. However if you just need occasional peeks at your property these are fine.
 I've got two XTs installed, one for the front yard and one for the back yard. Good quality, except the night vision you can't make out detail.  One frustration I have is the motion sensing ability.  Most motion sensing happens at the periphery, so it picks up best at the sides or the bottom.  I wanted to get a head on motion detection, but had to fiddle with the positioning to get acceptable pictures when triggered.  This beats the Foscam I have installed inside the house.  Easy to set up and the masking feature works.
 Just go my blink xt today.  Took about 1 hr to set and a lot of that trying to figure out the best location to hang the camera for my front door.  You need to get low enough to get a good angle if you want to get a face picture but high enough so it won’t get stolen.  I didn’t want to pick up everyone walking on the sidewalk so I chose a side angle of my door that videos the front door area and my garage door.  I did many tests of walking up and each time it worked perfectly. I am going to try it after dark tonight to see how that works.  I was expecting to get an email as well as a screen notification on my phone but it seems to only send a screen notification.  But that should work just wasn’t what I was expecting.  If all goes well I will purchase another unit for my back yard. You can follow the app for easy setup.  But before you put the batteries in and close the unit be sure to write down the serial number located inside because you will need it during setup.  I didn’t do that and had to open the unit back up.  You will also need your WiFi password and the serial number from the base unit but that is easy to find.
 I ordered the outdoor camera and used it for a few weeks. I liked it so much I ordered a second one. Things I like: the video quality is good, setup is easy, it's wireless, the cameras are small and sleek looking enough that nobody notices them. The two things I don't like: the scheduling feature is a little clunky in that the camera doesn't always come on if I override the schedule. That's no big deal for me. I just manually turn them off and on via the phone app. The other feature I wish they had is two way audio. I would like to be able to talk to someone who's at the door. Also not a big deal but it would be a bonus. Overall I'm very satisfied and will probably buy a third camera.
 I bought this camera because one morning I found that several of the mailboxes on my street had been destroyed overnight and I wanted to be able to see and identify the culprit(s) if it were to happen again. Setup for this system was a breeze. It seems to have fairly decent night vision. I can see while testing the general body features of a person at night, but it seems the face features even close to the camera at night aren't distinguishable (just all really white). This cameras motion sensitivity seemed to work pretty well. It is triggered by small animals going across my yard and cars going down the street, but somehow it missed a person walking into the middle of my yard and stealing a Christmas light projector after 1am. Very odd.
 Personally I really like Amazon's Blink camera system. Yes, the camera's are not the most expensive and perform an adequate job if not very good job of picking up motion. It integrates easily with the Alexa app where you can view real-time footage from your phone using the blink app. Also, you can view real-time footage from an echo spot or echo show.<br/><br/>Getting a camera up and running is really simple and quick once it's in place and when you've got the blink and<br/>Amazon Alexa apps on your phone.<br/><br/>Resolution is good for 720p and works best during the day. Night vision clarity isn't quite there unless you're using it with a motion sensor light.<br/><br/>I could have purchased a more expensive system but I didn't want to drill holes in walls for the wiring.<br/>Also, I decided on this system because there was no monthly cloud storage fee. The 2 year battery life was<br/>also a consideration over the Arlo system. If a camera is no longer functions the cost of a replacement isn't too expensive.<br/><br/>The camera mounts that came with the cameras are plastic and because these cameras were going to be used outdoors it was a no brainer that I needed to purchase after market metal mounts for the cameras.<br/><br/>It's best to install the cameras where it can get some benefit from a sheltered location from the elements<br/>such as under an eave.<br/><br/>Using the blink app, each camera can be tuned for clip length, sensitivity, retrigger time, and other specifics....<br/><br/>* * * The entire system of cameras can be armed or disable although I wish they had a feature to disable or enable<br/>a specific camera. I'd prefer the ability to disable specific cameras because I have one camera pointed along side the driveway where people can also walk up to the house. Every time I leave my home I get a recorded clip of myself leaving unless I disable the system before I leave then arm it once I'm on the street.<br/><br/>Durability is still to be determined. I'm in So Cal where winters are mild, but I'll eventually find out how durable the cameras really are when they have to deal with the blistering summer heat.<br/><br/>I would readily recommend and repurchase the Blink XT camera system for someone who wants some sense of reassurance and to be able to view whats going on from afar.
 It is set to record for 60 seconds and NOT to stop recording when motion stops. A single blade of grass will set it off and it will record for 1 minute, a person walks in front of it and it will stop recording after 7 seconds or so with the person being in full frame even though its set not to stop (doesn't happen all the time)<br/><br/>After owning it about a month the battery is almost dead, it goes off about 8 times a day on average.<br/><br/>Sync module is 20 feet away and is showing 1 bar on signal strength, only 1 wall is between the units.<br/><br/>Video quality is average, you won't make out many details unless the subject is about 10 feet from the camera.
 I got this blink camera jusy monitor the house and a couple of my fish tanks away from home. Honestly its a great camera i got it on sale, the quality isn't too bad at all.  You do have to make sure you have strong wifi connection, sense they recommend you set it up near your wifi router. Kinda a bummer i decided to take the camera downstairs, and when i tried to reconnect it, the delay was 30 seconds. Same thing decided to put it on alert mode and again that same delay on multiple occasions. That's not mentioning the 10 second live feed delay. So pretty much took a while just to see something i wanted to see then and now. If you dont mind the delay go for it.
 Works well, easy to set up.  First batteries are still in the units 6 months later so definitely not a battery drainer.  No, you can't talk to people on the other end but I just want video of who is coming and going (and them knowing they are on camera via the blue light turning on).  Free storage makes it a win - I never keep clips so to not be paying to have clips is great.  I guess if you piled on clip after clip eventually you would pay but I don't ever use more than 1-2% of the allowance given I delete as I go.  I do find it is a bit slow to get video/upload to cloud/ get to my phone but admittedly I am using this overseas so I think it goes to the US first and then back to my country making for a long round trip.
 I've had this for maybe 5 months.  It connected easily.  It is battery and have yet to change it.  It's picture is nice outdoor.  I tested it first indoors in the dark.  Very grainy.  Sorta ghosting type picture without light.  I assume there's enough light outdoors to make a difference?  The picture outdoors is much better.  It seems to be dealing with lower 40 degree temps with no issues.  I was really between 4 and 5 stars.  I gave cameras I like more 5 stars, so I didn't see how I could give this camera the same 5 stars.  So I gave it 4 stars.  I can see me buying more Blink XT cameras, depending on application and price.
 The cameras just don't work well.<br/><br/>No zones so they always trigger due events I don't care about.<br/>The cameras often fail to sync with the system when taking a picture or they take half a picture.<br/>They also trigger due to wind even on lower sensitivity.<br/>You can't view cameras live without a long delay.
 Let me explain...<br/>They work best when you set them up with Motion Detected recordings.  They will record clips in great quality and store them in the app.  Unfortunately, while they're recording motion you can't access the live view as they've give a 'Busy' message.  So if there is constant activity being recorded, you have to stop the Motion Recording to pull up the live view.  The live view also constantly asks if you still want to watch the live view while it is up, this is probably to conserve battery life.  Other than this, they're a great product for seeing what has occurred recently, but is clearly not meant for active monitoring of an area.
 As stated previously by other users, it can only connect to one phone. Contacted Blink and waiting for response. Only connected one of the 2 cameras so far. It is truly wireless - does not need to be plugged into outlet but anyone can walk up to it and take it off the door. Have not found another wireless unit at this price but I consider this a costly unit. Would be great if I could connect to 2 or 3 phones but just cannot log in. You are stuck on log in screen on any phone but the one where the unit was set up. Buy another unit.
 This is probable one of the best wireless cameras i have used so far. However, it did not leave to the expectation, and the reason for that is the motion detection feature which is pretty much the one and only useful feature. After using this camera for sometime, i have noticed that at a number of events it failed to capture the motion and report it to the application which is extremely disappointing. I can't say whether this is due to a malfunction or something else.
 I had been wanting to install outdoor security cameras, but everything I looked at required a power source. These battery-operated units were the perfect solution. Installation and setup are easy, and the video quality excellent. The one area where they disappoint is their inability to be viewed on a computer. I would recommend purchasing the optional brackets for outdoor mounts, as the included brackets appear to be a bit vulnerable, but would be adequate for indoor cameras.
 TL;DR: system has a bunch of issues with wifi. it may work one moment and stop working another. Support will claim that you have network problems. If you bought it and it doesn't work (either sync module or any of cameras in live view or otherwise) - return while you can because there is no solutions. Also, first few seconds after motion detected there is no recording.<br/>This is copy of the post from blink forums that I posted in hope of attracting some attention from company in order to solve problems (no luck)<br/><br/>At this point of time I am not completely sure what is my biggest issue with Blink XT, wifi issues or support provided. Each one deserves it’s own chapter.<br/><br/>But lets begin with Wifi. I have 5 blink xt cameras with full wifi bars. Also excellent connectivity to sync module.<br/>Once in a while cameras unable to live stream (or to make recording after motion detection). Later (maybe next click, maybe 5 minutes later) they will work. At any given time some cameras are working and some might not.<br/><br/>As background for this: networking is my job for past 20 years. Systems that I wrote run in telecom operators. I have at home network setup that works perfectly for other 50 devices, out of which 35 are wireless and include not only “usual” stuff but also a few ip cameras that more then half a decade old, robot vacuums, sensors, terrarium (it can stream video from inside without problems) and automatic cat toilet (no video streaming in this one, if you wonder).<br/><br/>Out of all this zoo of devices the only thing that doesn’t work it’s security cameras by Blink. Kinda ironic, ain’t ?<br/>As support (both phone and email) was less then helpful I decided to try to figure out issue myself. It looks like sometimes, from some reason Blink cameras can’t complete three way handshake. In other words it wont answer to SYN-ACK sent by blink server and will just keep on sending SYN till it gives up.<br/><br/>Is there any chance that there is anybody in Blink support (or maybe engineering) who knows what is three way handshake and interested in troubleshooting the issue ? I guess I am not the only one with random wifi issues based on reviews or community boards.<br/>As of now I am trying to decide, should I go and buy cc3100r1 evaluation board upon which Blink XT is built and debug issue myself and then send solution to Blink R&amp;D or go and buy Arlo setup, because I kinda gave up on support.<br/><br/>Which brings me to support issue: it’s worst support that I ever had. I am not sure if they are told to lie to the clients by generic script or they improvise on spot, but such amount of nonsense i didn’t receive even from comcast.<br/>I went through few “troubleshooting” processes which included installing app on my phone that made network tests and some that wasn’t including it. Feedback that i got is that I have multitude of issues in my networking including<br/><br/>it seems that the device is trying to connect to a mesh or merged network which may or may not work. If you are connected to a merge network then it has to be split (what is meged network ? and i dont have mesh at home)<br/>extreme amount of access points showing on that may cause the signal to get lost in all that translation ( what ? translation ?)<br/>Based on the traffic dump you send us, we do see the looping. (i did sent traffic dump displaying error, but “looping” ?)<br/>Based on the dump files you send, that identifies that this is likely either firewall or some type of IP filtering causing the system to time out ( I dont have firewall/filtering blocking camera. also why it wont work now but will work in 5 sec if there is firewall that blocks.)<br/>We’ve also check the status of the camera and it does not show any indication or even an error code that would lead us to identify that it is a device issue. (now, this is just lie. camera couldnt sent anything outside when it was sent to me)<br/>This has been also escalated to our server team and that is what they see as well. (server team cant see issue that happens ON camera)<br/>Something to be aware is it is indicating network command issues coming from the sync module and the wireless router. (can somebody translate it to english ? what is “network command issues”)<br/>It is indicating network command concerns. I would recommend reaching out to your local service provider as a next step due to this concern. (network command concerns ?)<br/>You are receiving DNS issues Debug wifi configuration multiple times. Debug WiFi configuration. (nope. no dns issues unless all of sudden google dns and cloudflare dnses started to fail. And yes, i’ll debug wifi configuration multiple times. with debugger).<br/>Maybe this kind of random mix of words acceptable for somebody who has no clue how things are working but the assumption that it’s possible to communicate to client in such way is frankly insulting.
 This is an excellent product at a very reasonable price.  Blink is continually improving its features.<br/>Installation was 5 minutes.  The module connects very quickly and the cameras recognize the network immediately.  Very good video clarity.  The night vision is particularly clear.  The app is pretty easy to learn.  Works with Alexa.  I ended up buying two more cameras for more outside coverage.<br/><br/>I highly recommend.
 My fiancé and I were out of town and we got a notification that there was motion by our back door. I checked the cameras and there was a lady trying to break into my car!! My heart sunk. We called the police department in the city that we live in and they were there in minutes and CAUGHT HER!! This is all a true story. I can’t make this up... I’m so happy we purchased these! They have given me a peace of mind and I just can’t imagine what would’ve happened if we didn’t have the cameras. And the video is so easy to save to your camera roll. The cops are needing this video and said she broke into our neighbors cars as well. I recommend these cameras 1000000 times!!
 I love the whole package. Ordered several months ago and it finally arrived! The camera and iPhone controls work fantastic!  The software is easy to use and setup. Free uploads to Amazon cloud!  WhooHoo!  Space is limited.....Easy to delete and save and send the pictures you need.  The mounting bracket is a bit flimsy, in fact if you mount it anywhere someone can take it .....there is no security feature in someone just stealing the camera.  Which brings me to my next point...if the person slowly takes the camera you might be able to get a picture of them doing so, however if they are fast the camera will be gone and all you have is a picture of a hand snatching it away. The delay in getting the pictures seems to be long.  I even moved my WiFi Access point to make sure it was not the network.  Other than that its a great way to monitor if your kids get home from school people delivering packages or some lazy burglar is casing your house!  Maybe a view more but it definitely has its drawbacks as a true security device.  The last drwaback is the fact you cannot manipulate the images or files on you desktop machine or save them off to a third party as the unit is very proprietary to Amazon!  I would buy again if I had the money but there are probably better security systems on the market
 If you want to use the motion detection and want these for outside, don’t plan on pointing them anywhere where cars or people frequently walk by because you cannot specify motion zones at all. Kind of defeats the purpose of security. I also purchased the ring doorbell which lets you customize motion zones. If you want to use these inside then obviously the motion problem won’t be a problem. Also the push notifications stick, you can’t disable motion detection from the lock screen like you can with ring. I have one blink camera but threw it in the drawer and bought 4 rings for the outer perimeter of my house. Much better overall system.
 I rarely have been this excited about a piece of technology. Blink simply works very well, installation was breeze, and although my internet connection isn’t always the greatest I always get my alerts.<br/>Delivery was fast<br/>Installation was under 30 mins<br/>Image quality day and night pretty decent (I can easily see object 20-40 feet away)<br/>Microphone picks up sound very well<br/>Very well built and quite robust, the lousy mounting clip made one of my cameras fall from about a height of 8 feet and the camera survived.<br/><br/>The one thing I hated was the mounting clips they are complete rubbish. I had to make a couple of alterations to ensure a super tight fix.<br/><br/>That said I plan to buy a couple more for a couple of friends who I know would need it.
 Exactly what I needed! Very user friendly...easy to set up.  Works great with my Echo Show.  I also like being able to check in on my dogs while at work, which is the main reason I got it.  That...and to get notified when my kid comes over and "borrows" stuff :) Notifications work great with my Apple Watch as well!  The only thing, is this is probably my fault and just needs some tweeking, is when I set the picture, and gray out the areas I don't want detected...it still does.  But other than that, very happy with it.  I've already bought 3 more add on cameras.  I would highly recommend these.
 I purchased these expecting a high quality video, but was quickly disappointed.  Initially it looked OK but I quickly realized that you can barely recognize a persons face from across the room. Really blurry and bad.  I tried the enhanced mode for video but  this caused the cameras to be "busy", and so I had to revert to "good".  This was supposed to be an upgrade from much cheaper ZMODO cameras, which only cost $49 for two, but the Zmodos actually have much better video quality.  I have one Blink XT camera setup on my patio and it alerted to an animal.  I could not make out the kind of animal about 10 feet away at night, so I checked with my cheaper camera and it was clearly and unmistakably a cat.  Very disappointed with the picture quality, but the app works well and at least I could be alerted to a car or a  person approaching my doors.  Also no web access!  At less than ten feet the quality is just OK so it will work as a doorbell.  Best thing is no wires.
 We just installed a Blink camera outside and we've had issues with it not capturing correctly, sometimes it doesn't record movement at all.  Seems like it's a hit or miss with recording,  which is not good and not what we were looking for.  I also don't like that it will only record up to a minute,  we had a recording where it captured someone on camera,  recorded for 30 seconds (our settings are set for 60 seconds) but never started recording again after that even though we have the settings set up right to record again after 10 seconds.  My husband and I both have the app on our phone,  we have great WIFI &amp; cell phone service yet the recordings are extremely delayed and are sent minutes later with the wrong times on them (ie videos are sent with current time vs the time of the actual recording).  We were looking for a security camera and with this not picking up all movement it isn't doing a good job at all.  I will say that the video quality during the day and night are good when it actually does pick people up.
 It took a little tinkering, and moving the cameras to get things as I wanted them, but I am SO happy with my Blink system!  I can see someone coming up my entire walk, so I can get a good look at who they are.  The picture is so clear!  I have one at the front and back door, and am no longer worried about what goes on outside.  A minor kink I wish they would work out would be the distance between when the camera takes a video, and when it notifies me on my phone.  I wish it was a shorter time period--like seconds rather than a few minutes!  Otherwise--PERFECT, and the price was really good compared to other systems.
 So far works great good picture good sensor good alerts just got it so I dont know how long the battery will last it  says more then a year will see.<br/>It also  tells you the temperature which is nice  very easy to install except getting the back off to put in the battery in  the first time was tuff .<br/>But I guess it has to be that way to make it weatherproof took a star off  for that  and the mount which seems a little on the  weak side and does not have a full 360 rotation and it does not come with  plastic inserts to use in concrete or cement  or brick walls<br/>If not those little things this is 5 star product the coverage is about 150 feet more if you have less walls less maybe if you have more walls in between where you put it .
 For the first three or four months, this camera was great and reliable. A very good, inexpensive security camera that quietly captured movements from folks in front of my house. I loved it. I've been through a few lithium batteries, but certainly nothing excessive given the settings I use and frequency of vehicles in my court.  However in the last few months it has become increasingly unreliable. Only responds about a third of the time, even when I test it up close.  Started making a loud clicking noise when it's recording do it's not as stealthy to delivery drivers or intruders in my driveway.  Was a good three month device but has really become too unreliable to recommend.  I can't trust that it will turn on when there's a crime in progress, which was the whole point.
 I really like blink products. They are affordable cameras that don't require a storage subscription. Only negative I have is they don't allow you to set zones for the areas you want to monitor. It limits the placement of the devices so you don't get false alerts.<br/>Update;<br/>You can now set zones on Android and it is in beta. Still can't do it on iOS but great progress. Thanks Amazon for not abandoning the product after you bought the company!
 I have been looking for security cameras for my property.  I was dreading running wiring up under the eaves of the house.  Stumbled across these cameras by Blink and decided to give them a try.  I am very pleased so far.  They run on batteries so you can put them anywhere.  So far, after a couple months use, no issues with battery strength.  The included free cloud storage has worked out for me.  I have the alert level set pretty low to make sure I don't get many false triggers.  Like this so much I purchased a second camera.
 It took several times just to connect the camera to the base.  The base is 3 feet away from the camera!  After that, very spotty on connecting, all. Keeps giving me failures. Complete disappointment.  Now, I have to figure out something else to buy and send this back.  Alexa works so great, I figured this from the same company would be great, as well. I couldn’t have been more wrong.
 Quick shipping, product arrived in great quality and was easy to set up. Daytime the quality of the picture is decent. Night quality leaves me needing to see an eye doctor. If it isn't directly perfect center in front of the camera, then the picture is blurry. Motion capture on both day and night works pretty much the same, which to my opinion is well enough for my application. Battery life is....non existent. 2 years? Read the fine print on that one. We have dogs, therefore movement 100% of the day. Batteries lasted about 24 hrs. Plugged it into a charging station and removed the batteries and it worked fine for the next 24 hours.
 5 XT cameras - work well, but after only 16 days one of them gave me a message to replace the batteries. Called customer support to have them ship me new batteries or a new unit with batteries. It took 29 minutes to get this completed. Very disappointed in the customer support that they offer.<br/><br/>The reason I bought these were for the 2 year battery life - fully aware that usage will dictate how long they will last, but 16 days means a defective camera or defective/old batteries.<br/><br/>The quality of the picture more than meets my needs - the activity zone feature is nice so that you can tell the camera not to activate if a flag is blowing in the wind for example. Live view works well. Being able to watch the video clips on a computer is a nice new addition.
 I had it up and running in less than 15 minutes. Super easy installation with the included bracket. The software was also easy to download and set up. The resolution was not quite as high as I had expected but is certainly more than enough to suit it's purpose. The motion sensor works very well. Adjust accordingly if you live in a windy area. The night time images with the infrared light are also very clear. And having batteries that last 2 years (we'll see) is fantastic. Especially if you have installed the camera in a less than easily accessible location. A solid camera at a reasonable price.
 This works really well. Very easy to set up since it is battery operated.  I get notices on my phone when people are at the door. Cloud storage is free, and although not unlimited, appears to be more than enough since you can delete recordings easily and old ones scroll off if storage gets full. Two complaints: First, there is no ability to talk to the people you see like Ring has. It would be nice to be able to warn people off if you see someone stealing a package, tell people what to do, etc. Second, there is abut a 5-second delay in seeing the video if you are watching it live, and even longer delay in getting the alert on the phone. This makes it hard to respond in real time.
 This camera has one thing going for it and that is that it works with two batteries and can be put almost anywhere. I do not like that I can mot record live video from it if i need too and am limited to the short motion activated clips. Which often times dont catch everything you may want. I was going to order 3-5 of these but thought id try just 1 and see how it went and I am completely disappointed and will not be getting more at this time. I also do not like that the live view is limited to approximately 20 seconds before it ask if you want to continue and if you dont click the button in time it kicks you out and you miss what you were looking at. Also in the live view the camera overheats. I have a similar security cam that is hi def and i can move the camera with an app plus live record or view. It was way cheaper and its only downside is that it isnt battery powered.
 works wonderfully. I didn’t need to hide unsightly wires, or drill and patch holes through the walls of my home. The camera location isn’t confined or determined by the length of any attached wires. With the Sync Module placed in the center of my home, the 5 outdoor XT cameras cover every angle of my property.<br/>I have a SkyBell system for my entrance doors, but find the Blink system faster and easier to use. The SkyBell needed to be hardwired to my electric system, and an electrician was required. The Blink system only required a screwdriver to install and be functional.<br/>The Blink system sends notices to my IPhone and my IWatch whenever it senses motion and starts recording. I can easily and quickly change individual cameras sensitivity to motion, infrared illumination, clip length and quality, retrigger time and audio recording capabilities.<br/>I’ve added two photos from my system showing the quality of the Blink cameras when set on mid-level quality. The pictures and videos were uploaded to my phone’s camera roll to save system memory space.
 We have it on our front porch, setup was easy. It’s cold here, and the battery is holding up so far. My problem is that while it worked great in the beginning, it only works sometimes now, and not in the way that it should. All day long I get motion alerts and it’s just barely the shadow of a car driving by on the street. But it won’t record you when you actually walk up onto the porch. I was out front with a snowblower and shovel for like 10 minutes yesterday and it didn’t even get me one time. I’m really disappointed and I don’t know how to fix it. At this time, it’s pretty pointless for us to have.
 Cameras work well thus far- I own several. In an active area like the front door the batteries don't last as long as advertised though. Mine had to be replaced after 3.5 months. Also, when they die you don't receive a proper advanced warning. You get a notification that the battery is low and then the camera stops working. That would not be acceptable if you were out of town and unable to immediately replace the batteries. Also there is no bar indicator of how much battery life you have left it just says "OK"
 I will say that I was really impressed on how easy it was to connect to my WiFi network right out of the box.....That's where the warm fuzzies ended.  It worked without issue for 10 days, then kept going offline.  I've spent hours and hours of the last 2 weeks trying to figure out what was going on.  Tech support was no help whatsoever, they just repeat the FAQ information that is available to anyone.  The bottom line is that the sync module that controls everything has a firmware flaw that interferes with WiFi connection if your WiFi password happens to have a special character like @,#,$,%,&amp;, ! etc. then it will not stay connected.  The instruction that came with the system states that this problem exists (which means they were aware of it) and that you may need to temporarily change your password to allow for a firmware upgrade to happen and then everything will be fine...…..well that is not the case and according to the customer rep that I was working with, their engineering department is still working on it.....so unless you feel like permanently changing your WiFi password and all the time it takes to update all other devices on your network, I would hold off until they have a proven system that doesn't require so much special attention. I gave it 2 stars because of the 10 days it actually worked and made me happy otherwise it would have been a 1 star.
 I've had these for four months now. They seemed ok in the beginning but ultimately they aren't great. I have one in the backyard and one in the front, by the front door. The front door obviously sees the most activity. It has line of sight for about 30 feet but the camera doesn't trigger until someone is about six or seven feet away which isn't horrible, except the quality is poor despite full bars on camera to WiFi and camera to sync module. Basically, I can identify a blurry person walking toward the front door, rendering the camera practically pointless.<br/><br/>Also, and this is unrelated to the star rating, these things really anger birds and I don't know why. They come at them at least once a day.
 I held out against wireless cameras for a long time, and I'm glad Blink was the first brand I tried.  The smartphone app could use a little polish, but it is simple and easy to use.  The cameras are surprisingly easy to mount and setup.  I was worried about the quality and reliability of wireless recording, but after a week of testing I've found no problems, and the camera quality is very good, especially for the price.
 I love how easy this system was so to set up and program. Wish I had bought these much sooner! I love these cameras but the plastic swivel mounts are poorly designed, its very easy to knock the camera off when its snapped into the stock plastic mount. I recommend that you add a small security chain to catch the camera if it falls (sold on amazon), or upgrade to a more secure mount altogether. Blink should really mold a hole into the case and include a small chain (like you find on a ceiling fan) that you can secure to the mounting surface, then it would be a perfect product!
 Blink XT catches me coming and going about half the time.  I thought it was doing really well until I left for a week and had a neighbor come in and water my plants.  She had to unlock two locks and open two doors that are in direct view of the Blink XT and it didn't catch her entering OR exiting and re-locking doors.  If she hadn't picked up a bowl I'd left for her next to the plants she was watering, I'd have wondered if she was really there.  Since I've been back, it catches my comings and goings about half the time.  Very disappointed to have spent money on something I now have to wonder about all the time.
 This is a great product with the most hassle free design but I had couple of teething setup issues with the product. The setup was not a breeze as I'd expected it to be. It took me some time to get this working and at one point when I contacted customer support, they asked to get in touch with my ISP to open a port which was never going to happen. But when I restarted my router things were fine. I've been using the product for a week now and it has already failed once where sync module went offline and I had to again delete the device and add it again from start.<br/>But I'd say the product meets my needs well so far. It needs to cables for power or anything else and it records videos and uploads it to the cloud automatically. My suggestion to the app development team is to allow admins to create users who can view the video even though they don't own the camera,.
 I currently have 3 cameras and 2 hubs.  I could have only used 1 hub for the 3 cameras but with 1 camera being in the basement and far away from the router, I opted to try and have the hub halfway between the camera and router.  I feel immensely safer at home.  I have yet to find any suspicious activity but knowing that I can monitor the house when I am on nightshift makes me and my wife feel better.  I have them sitting outside here in Kentucky.  The lower limit for these cameras is reported as -4° and there is also a warning to alert you of temperature changes.  The motion sensing does not work well through windows so make sure you don't make the mistake that I did and walk outside and wave your arms trying to trigger it and just look like an idiot.  I wish I had more areas to set these cameras up but unfortunately I can not think of any other places.  Lastly, I read that they are going to introduce a feature that allows you to ignore certain parts of the view of the camera which will be great at stopping the false alarms of the 1 or 2 birds that sometimes land in the bush next to the camera.
 Great product.  Exactly what I wanted.  Good cameras without the need of bunches of wiring.  Very good resolution even at a decent distance.  Only Cons are no 2 way audio and  at times weak connection between cameras and the sync module.  The motion detection is fine for me (at times too sensitive) but I would rather get a notification because of a bird, bugs or wind blowing trees then nothing :-) .
 Several problems so far. Lots of technical glitches in the system freezing up off and on. Clips taking a long time to process and view. 720  on the camera is not quite sufficient to get good facial recognition on a subject in the clip. Needs two way audible. Needs a better way to replace the camera batteries without having to completely remove the camera from the mounting clip and then have to totally re-position again.<br/>Only positive so far, excellent and swift tech support.
 Works great, the fisheye lense creates a wide view and the video is great quality. I am not having any trouble with the app on my android like other reviews. Wifi signal from the sync module is strong to the camera which is about 15 yards and through a wall away. Infared works well but can over expose faces I highly recommend this for the budget minded person looking for some home security.<br/>Missing one star because my lamppost light creates an overexposure washout on the side of the camera picture.. but its out of the way and doesnt hinder ability the see faces clearly.
 Like the outside edition but has some drawbacks living in the Northeast.  Temperature range is the biggest as it gets down below zero often and its only rated to 4 degrees which is a big wait and see here in NH.  Very touchy getting a good wifi signal and had to buy a wifi extender which helped.  Also had to invest in a better mounting bracket since the one it comes with is a bit flimsy.  I do notice a bit of a delay picking up on the motion sensor before recording an image and played with the sensitivity ranges as well.  Like the unit and have a few but like I said it has its flaws.  Would still recommend it however.
 These are easy to set up and easy to use, yes there are a few cons but if you dont want to run wires all over the house and cut holes in the walls this is the best option for the money in my opinion.<br/>You do have some limitations with distance to the sync module and the router but i overcame this by placing the sync module upstairs near a wi-fi repeater and have no issues with losing connection.<br/>They appear to be working on upgrades to the software and additional ad-on's to the available devices so i'll be looking for a doorbell and possibly the siren when it's available.
 Update:<br/>Technical support went back and forth with me over several emails before pushing out a firmware update that solved the problem. So far, the picture is crisp even if the app responds rather slowly. I will update this review when I have used the product for longer.<br/><br/>It arrived today. I have spent three hours trying to get this to connect and it still won’t. It doesn’t blink as it should during set up. I can connect to device, connect to my WiFi, but it won’t connect to the blink servers. I had high hopes because of the positive reviews. Now I have not even a paper weight since the device weighs practically nothing.
 Easy to install and configure.  Night vision is acceptable.  It is however slow for the time between detecting and turning on the camera to take picture.  If some one comes within the detection range and moves out of the detection range fast, it is unable to capture it in the video. No internal storage so Internet should always working otherwise you loose the events during this time.
 The camera seems to catch things just in time for them to move out of the shot. The interface is pretty bad too. Often the “arm/disarm” function gets stuck; when his happens, you have to restart the app and it’s a pain. Also, the idea of a two year battery is just false. I have had mine for about six months and I am already buying a new batteries, I just can’t see where someone would actually get two years of use. If you do go with this set up, and place it outside, be ready to always be told it’s getting too hot. Every day, without fail, if it’s over 75 degrees outside, you will be told it’s too hot. I can only imagine what winter will bring.<br/><br/>On the brightside, the quality is good, the install easy and it is wireless. If you are looking for a very basic set-up that is easy, this is fine. Not bad but there are better units out there for sure at a very similar price point.
 These are the first cameras I’ve installed at my own home, but have had experience with Nest cams (indoor &amp; outdoor) as well.<br/><br/>I love the battery only operation as it doesn’t require a plug or electric to be run where you want to install the camera. The other nice thing is scheduling the cameras through the app. You can also manually arm/disarm them OR use IFTTT to have them arm/disarm whenever you’re home or away. Pretty awesome!<br/><br/>I’ve only had them up for about two weeks but so far have no complaints. The only issue I’ve noticed (if you want to call it an issue) is that occasionnally the cameras will start recording later than I’d expect but they still capture the movement. That being said, I’m still impressed with how simple these are to setup and use.
 Motion sensor functionality is terrible.  Records when trucks go by in the street even though they are not in the field of view at all - or sometimes just the bottom of their tires are barely in the field of view.  However, only records about 1/2 the time when I walk into my house at night even though I'm right in the middle of the field of view.  But, if I stand in the lower left quadrant where I can hardly be seen it will record.  The motion detection is complete junk.  Wish I could return this garbage.  Total waste of money.
 Do NOT buy this camera.<br/>The motion sensor is so bad... so when the time that u really need that camera to work and record.... nothing happens. If u don’t dance in front of the lance... it won’t feel something moving at all.<br/>I’m so disappointed from this perches.
 The camera works great, I get alerts when leaves are blowing and the dogs are walking across the driveway.  I really don't want to have to zoom in to see someones face or read their license plate.  But it will capture that if I need to.<br/><br/>What you really need to  make this work is a 3rd party mount.  There are several out there and they allow you to make your camera more secure and capture the angle you want.  The included "mounting kit" is hardly worthwhile.  The good news is there are several designs for mounting kits and some are pretty secure and most are flexible in their angling.
 A very good  reasonably priced camera system that does exactly what I was looking to do.  Took me less than a half hour to sync the cameras and install with a screwdriver.  I did order different mounting brackets ($15) to allow for more flexibility in angling the cameras to the right spot, though the brackets included are probably good enough.<br/><br/>I get notices- day or night- of who is coming and going at the house, and I feel like the control I have over notices is more than adequate.  Two weeks in and I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase.
 Like the fact that they were wireless and could connect to a solar panel (NO NEED FOR BATTERIES).  After testing them for about 3 weeks here's my opinion:<br/>PROS:<br/>* Wireless<br/>* Can connect to a solar panel eliminating the need for batteries<br/>* Free Cloud storage<br/>* Easy installation and setup<br/>* Alexa and FireStick compatible (Loved the fact I can view cameras thru FireStick)<br/>CONS:<br/>* The need for Sync Module<br/>* Response time to view LIVE FEED appears in about 6-8 seconds.  Much slower than a Yi camera I have<br/>* Needs a better mount included with camera.  Mount include not flexible enough for various types/positions<br/><br/>Hoping upgrades can solve slow "LIVE FEED" showing.
 I have 3 Arlo 2 pros and I THOUGHT those were great until I bought a Blink XT for my mother. The video quality is way better on the XT. The range is insane, I can’t stress this enough. I literally walked around 50 yards from the base, which was indoors, and couldn’t get it to lose connection, speed, quality. The real time view is roughly 1 second delay whereas arlo 2 pros are around 5 seconds while viewing. It takes about 2 seconds to get connected to a blink XT in real time and around 10 seconds on the Arlo 2 pros even when they are beside the base.  Blink XT has free cloud storage, way way way better battery. Motion zones without the need to hook up a power cable. No brainer here, Blink XT is better
 THIS IS A GREAT LITTLE CAMERA AND TAKES GREAT MOVIES.  VERY EASY TO SET UP AND INSTALL.  TINY FOOTPRINT MAKES INSTALLATION EVEN EASIER.  TWO ITEMS OF IMPROVEMENT I FEEL COULD BENEFIT USERS.  ONE IS A MICROPHONE FEATURE THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO COMMUNICATE WITH SOMEONE BEING WATCHED ON THE CAMERA.  IT WOULD ALSO BE NICE TO SCHEDULE EACH CAMERA SEPARATELY SO YOU COULD COME IN AND OUT OF A DOOR OR ROOM WHILE THE OTHER CAMERA(S) ARE ACTIVATED BY MOTION.  RIGHT NOW YOU WOULD HAVE TO PURCHASE SEPARATE CONTROL UNITS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS.  IT SEEMS LIKE AN EASY SOFTWARE FIX.  OVERALL VERY PLEASED WITH THE SYSTEM.
 Installation took less than 1/2 hour.<br/>Don’t forget to YouTube for recommended, tested &amp; verified settings &amp; user/installer reviews.<br/><br/>Oh! Almost forgot!!: don’t forget to “ARM” the camera’s as well in the App.
 Easy to mount single screw.  Works right away no trouble setting it up.  Immediately starts sensing motion and recording video or snapshots as soon as you choose to arm the system.  Good visibility.  Motion sensing range may be smaller than I would ideally hope for but I like the reliability and enjoy the peace of mind of being able to see what my dogs are barking at even if most of the videos are of my dogs running around barking at stuff in the distance.  I haven't tried the Ring models but these are quite good enough so I may never try Ring and just stick with my BLINKS now to wait for a sale on more cameras (two just isn't enough!)
 I am going to be too positive because  I bought this to replace the crappy Guardzilla outdoor camera. Finally, I have a wireless camera that works! The BlinkXT is everything that Guardzilla is not! The BlinkXT wifi setup could hardly be easier, motion detection works, alerts come through reliably, all your captured clips are stored reliably, and the app has lots of settings that work!  What a joy after months of trying to use Guardzilla! And with the very generous settings I am using, it is projected that the batts will last two years! There is really no other option for a wireless, motion-detecting camera!
 2 out of 3 were defective within 2 weeks of putting them up.<br/>Easy install and good camera video but the cameras are just too cheap and 2 out of 3 defective is unacceptable.<br/>Do you want to roll the dice on a 66% defective product?
 This is perfect if you don't want to run cables and wiring.<br/>Pros: Great field of view and clarity,  set up is easy and quick, small and blends in with our dark trim, real time video and alerts (optional), smartphone like software<br/><br/>Cons: Haven't found any yet.<br/><br/>The free storage size is not an issue for me. I review it in about every day (why have a camera if you don't see whats happening when you're not around) and delete the videos you don't need and forward the ones you want to keep to email or message. Its like reviewing and deleting videos on your smartphone.
 This was very easy to get setup and working. The only issue I had was the cost of purchasing additional cameras compared to an original purchase. They work very well and after having them installed for about a month I have no complaints. I did purchase mounts for them and if anyone is interested in a good mount make sure you do your research. I purchased and returned 2 before I found one that had the maximum flexibility I was looking for. The mount I settled on is sold by Aotnex US. If you do a search for Blink XT mounts you will probably be able to find it.
 Installed batteries and no indicator lights showing that it's working! Plugged in and nothing!! Did a reset and nothing!!  Attempted to put in the serial number on the APP and got, "invalid" number!! WHF!!, I'm standing 2' from my router!!!<br/>DISAPPOINTED!
 At the time I was looking, I found this to be the easiest and most affordable option.  The setup is easy, no wires are required.  I had the whole thing up and running in 5-10 minutes.  The video is good and the cloud storage is free.  The camera is very sensitive to movement if you choose to set it that way.  I experienced a 20-30 second lag between the time the camera activated and I received a notification.  All things considered, I find that lag time acceptable for this product.  The only down fall is that purchasing additional cameras is a little pricey.
 Purchased this camera to keep an eye on packages. It was easy to install and set up, and the app is easy to work, although I had to google what a couple of the functions were. The instructions could have been a bit more clear. Overall I like this system a lot and will probably purchase more cameras for it. The only major issue, and this is explained in the booklet that comes with it, is it does not pick up movement coming directly at it. It works great detecting side to side movement, but I’d look elsewhere if you’re looking to catch someone walking directly up towards the camera.
 I bought a pair of exterior cameras for the front and back of my house. It was extremely easy to set up and easy to use. The app is intuitive, giving lots of options to change settings on the camera. I wish there was a way to arm / disarm the system automatically based on when my phone is in the area. The IFTTT app says that it works with Blink and your phone's location to do this, but I have not been able to get it to work. The scheduling feature on the Blink app does work, however.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is great value for the money. The cameras provide a good quality image. I'm very happy with this purchase.
 We bought this system to use at an empty rental as we needed some form of surveillance since we had a break in.  They are very easy to use, simple to install and reliable. Clear view and works great with my iPhone and Ipad.  The settings are easy to control and the updates for the software are very good, it works over Wifi and the sync module is very easy to set up.  The sound is very good and so far I am very happy with my purchase.  I purchased an additional camera and it is very simple to add another device to the network.  I love these cameras.
 Easy install. Good picture and decent enough controls for it. Have had it up for about 3 or so months now, set to motion activate 24 hrs a day, not that it gets a lot of action like that, but the batteries are doing fine so far. The black colour suits me nicely as I've set it up to next to black lights and window frames, so it's not even very visible unless you are staring at it.<br/>I would like, as others have said, the ability to view it on my home computer. I can currently download a video to my phone then manually transfer that across, but frankly that is a massive pain in the ass!<br/>Also I'd love to know how I can have it de-activate when it knows I'm within range of the house. If anyone can explain that to a noob like me I'd be very grateful!
 Just received my Blink XT One Camera-system today.  As all the reviews say and all the videos show, it is a very easy system to set up and get operational. It took several tries and a reset of the module to get the live camera view working.  I have 30 feet of sidewalk coming up to my front door. I have set the sensitivity level at 5 and 6 and 7 and 8 and the camera is very slow to pick up me walking up the walk to the front door. It doesn’t start recording until I have walked 20 of the 30 feet.  However, any motion going across the cameras view is picked up almost immediately.  Granted, I just received and installed this today. I’m hoping the front on motion detection improves.<br/>As an added note, I installed the app before I received my equipment. I’m giving the unit 5 stars but it is really 4.5.  For the price and no wires and ease of installing....pretty darn good!
 Unfortunately, it only captures 5 second clips. For example, we stood/moved in front of the camera for a good 2 to 3 minutes. It picked up the initial 5 seconds of motion, but it takes awhile to pick up additional movement. In the case of a real burglary, you miss a great deal of footage. We had the Ring doorbell in the past, and you get 20 seconds of footage. Would buy again, but we're now in an apartment and the specific setup is not conducive to having it. Also, I didn't realize when purchasing, but there is no 2-way audio. If it does catch a potential burglar, there is no way of talking to them to let them know they've been spotted. For us, it makes it pointless to have. Some pros-the black camera is indoor or outdoor, so the versatility is a plus. Also, it sent motion alerts to my phone very quickly.
 I bought one,so I can see if I like it,and I do. Customer support recommends that you keep the modem and the module very close,what I did after suggesting to do that,I have my modem in the back of the house in my kitchen and the cameras are in front of the house, so I moved the module device itself to the front guest bedroom of the house, where is closer to the cameras. My live feed connects really fast, and I do not have any interruptions between the module and internet modem, since they’re connected with WiFi. Also, if you instal the camera near a light witch I did because it hides the camera a little for me, I turned off the IR Illuminator in the camera settings, this keeps the camera focused better without lots of light coming in and making the video,or picture a blur, or having a white spot in focus. I Hope this was helpful. finally, I will buy a pack of three or five when I see consistentancy with this one camera.
 I’ll give these 4 stars because they do everything they advertise very well.. Battery life is great after first two months, and motion detection works good as well. I even upload the captured videos to Dropbox very easily. I use them with the IFTT App and arm them at night or whenever I leave home. The motion detector gets annoying as heck when my dogs are on my back patio so I have to go to the app and turn off motion.. don’t forget to turn back on or your camera will be useless for the security type features and may as well be a camera just to check in on real time.<br/><br/>Great product, app needs work for sure, but it’s a great security cam backup system for those of us who check on our pets when we are gone.
 It’s just OK... you either get recordings every time the wind blows or it misses 50%. A change in sensitivity, so the camera doesn’t record every time the wind blows, means I can pull into my driveway and walk in the house without any recording.... so do you want a ton of useage video to sift through or so you want to miss things when they are happening? I only bought it cause it was on sale Black Friday. Im sure if you buy multiple of these and place them every 15-20 ft along the front of ur house, they wouldn’t be as bad. The night vision is just OK as well, our landscape lighting causes a large white spot so you can see anything at those areas. Over the summer I plan to get a true POE cane system with an NVR.
 The price is quite nice, but I am pretty unhappy with the sensitivity and responsiveness. The sensitivity setting for how easily it triggers to begin recording is very touchy. It either turns on too easily or too late. At sensitivity 5, it picks up every swaying  branch in frame, and at a 4, doesn't turn on until someone already walks out of frame!<br/><br/>Obviously, that low setting does me no good, so I'm left with 10 recordings a day of shifting shadows and swaying trees. I had to turn off the false alarm notifications, as they were a waste of attention. Not a very secure habit!
 Good concept! Just not worthy of being a home security system.<br/>Pros: Can view live video. Nice design. Dual power option. Cheap.<br/>CONS: Batteries don’t last. Sync module has an extra USB port that can be used for something but it’s a waste as of now.<br/>Cloud storage sucks. Other camera systems has at least 7 days cloud storage. Blink only has 200 minutes max.<br/>Can’t record on demand and can’t record while on live video. No local storage.<br/>When motion is set, camera doesn’t record right away, you lose several seconds by the time you see the recording.<br/>Notifications come after it finishes recording which is the dumbest feature ever. Why would we not get notified right away. The crime will be done by the time we get to see the video. This feature should be fixed.<br/>Y’all need an upgrade or really think of losing all your customers!!!<br/>I DONT RECOMEND ANYONE BUYING THE CAMERA SYSTEM.<br/>Get the ARLO or RING systems. They are way better. Traditional wire CCTV systems are also way better. ZMODO camera systems are also better.<br/>DONT WASTE MONEY ON BLINK CAMERA SYSTEM.
 Easy to install, can't fault it there. However, the brackets feel like they are easy to break so I am not sure how long they will hold up. "2-Year Battery Life" is a joke. Already into my 2nd set of batteries for most of the cameras. They will last 2 years if the camera gets used next to never. Delay between motion detection and recording is bad. Get the back of someone's head instead of the face 90% of the time. Night vision works well. Android app works well. No PC application available. Over all I feel they were over priced for what I got.
 The cameras and sync module are easy to setup. They capture images well. However, the software is poor. They can’t get the camera motion detecting zone beta software to work. And more problematic, if you use an iOS device you can not send the clips in iMessage or email. Looking at the forum for users this has been a problem for a while now. So hardware is good, software is poor.
 Excellent picture and sound quality and so far, has survived outdoor life in the country (lots of wind, rain and freezing temperatures). Highly affordable, user-friendly, easy install, and compact (you can hide it basically anywhere), I cannot see myself needing any other system (but I can see myself buying several more in the near future).
 They’re pretty decent cameras, I have had one outside for a few months now and haven’t had any issues. We had a few days last week that hit -30 and the camera continued to work perfectly fine. Sometimes it can be a pain to get the recording settings perfect but it does pretty good for a lower priced camera. It doesn’t always get 100% of everything so it would be a good idea to have multiple cameras covering zones just Incase one camera hits the designated recording time and has to reset. I set the camera for a long recording time and the shortest reset time. Using more lithium AA batteries is a small price compared to missing someone breaking into your house because you want to save battery life on the camera.
 Pros: Easy setup, great picture quality, and works on slow network speeds. I currently have it running on a 6Mbps/768kbps dsl connection and get immediate updates. Still using same batteries it came with on June 12th 2018.<br/><br/>Cons: Lack of live recording, and the poor design of the app. Downloading videos to your phone and then transferring to your PC is a PIA.<br/><br/>As another review noted, it sometimes looses connectivity due to network issues at site, etc. You'll get a message that the module has lost connectivity on the app. Just wait an hour or two and it will reconnect.<br/><br/>Using continuously since June 10th with zero issues. Way better than DNR/NVR solutions!
 The installation took less than an hour. The instructions were moderately easy to follow. The only issue was when I separated the stand from its mooring. It never did go back together. I used super glue to hold the two pieces together. One of the good things about the Blink XT is that it works with wifi. I like the images to appear on my I Pad. The fact that I didn't have to hook it up to my doorbell made it fit right with my Simplisafe Security System. . The quality of the  video is excellent. I recommend it for people who want a simple system.
 I just LOVE this camera.  I live by myself and feel safer with the added security. I have one trained on my front door and one on my back door. Picks up motion at night.  When I have packages delivered to my front door, I can keep an eye on them until I get home.  I can also see some of my neighbors and anyone who drives into our community. Camera is sensitive to motion, adjustable to your preferred angle.  Not that expensive considering what theft would cost a person, especially around the holidays when some people 'shop' on other's doorsteps.  Highly recommend.
 Brought the two blink cam for my house .Mount 1 cam in front entrance and at rear house facing  car garage.Sych both cams no problem.Now  here the problem my front is connecting to a weak WiFi signal I've a very good router but stil having WiFi connectivity to the front camera so brought a WiFi extender still have the problem when i want to take a live look with the front cam  from my mobile phone screen through its blink app I get camera is busy or having problem syching to module or it just keeps buffering.The rear camera no problem.
 we received the 3 camera indoor system for Christmas and liked the performance, video quality, ability to vastly alter the sensitivity of the motion sensor, and easily turn off the motion sensors on individual cameras without disabling the whole system.  However, we needed an outdoor camera for the front porch.  We ordered the XT add on and it seamlessly interfaced with our existing system.  The motion sensor has the same wide range of sensitivity as the indoor cameras.  The video quality is incredible: we can easily see and read logos on the clothing of people at the front door.  If we turn the camera to face the driveway, we can read a license plate clearly from about 80 feet.  The only real problem was that we had to download an Android emulator to use the system on our laptops, otherwise we were limited to our phones.  This is not a huge problem, but it is slightly inconvenient.  There is plenty of cloud storage with the device and the individual cameras give warning if they are being too highly used (which can lower the two year battery life).  Obviously, if the wifi is out in at our house, these cameras will be useless, but we knew that when we purchased them.  We had to call customer support to understand what we needed to do to have an outside camera and the customer support was wonderful.  I reserve the right to edit my review if problems arise, however, the product functions better than advertised and everything seems solid.
 I have been using Arlo which are okay cameras but I have experienced some mechanical malfunctions that have led me to try Blink.  After reading the various VERIFIED customer reviews, I became interested - especially with those that commented on their great customer service.  In my opinion, Arlo has terrible customer service - when I contacted them about my camera malfunctions they issued me a case number but there was no followup.<br/><br/>I received my camera yesterday - very easy to setup.  I am impressed with the quality of the picture and audio.  I agree with the one reviewer - the only negative is that there is not a way to view on your pc.
 The sync module does not have enough range for my 3000 sq ft house.  Also, the motion detector feature rarely works.  The literature states the motion detector will not work through windows, but because the sync module doesn't have enough range, I need to put my cameras inside the windows.  I would not recommend this system unless you have all cameras close to the sync module.
 These cameras are awesome. Quality of videos and picture are great. Sound works great.<br/>Mounting brackets leave a lot to be desired. To easy to remove cameras and limited angle mounting.<br/>Batteries on back porch dead after 6 weeks due to settings and constantly recording. Bought new batteries and changed settings to get better life. Front porch batteries still good after 8 weeks.<br/>Love the fact that I can check the cameras at any time.<br/>Best of all no monthly fees for cloud storage and you can download any video needed.<br/>You can't go wrong for the price.
 Really like this system. So simple. I get a chime on my phone when it records a video to look at. You can setup your times to cut on and off. It is easy to edit the videos and clear them out. Units work well and are discrete. I cut the blue recording light off so no one would be tipped off it was there. Battery has held up for months now. My only complaint is that you can't use a different setting on each camera or cut off one camera and leave the next one on. This is minor I know but when something works so well you just want it to be perfect! Will buy another camera soon to put outside in another location.
 We bought this for my mom for Christmas so she could see who was at her door without opening it.  After reading the wifi requirements, we were concerned, because it says you need at least 2 hz to work and, being out in the country, she has satellite wifi and it wavers between 1 and 2 hz.  We hooked it up to try it out and it works great!  She gets notifications and video when someone goes to her home when she's not there, and she can look to see who is at her door before opening it when she's home alone.  It keeps her safe and that makes us happy.  My only suggestions would be to attach the camera to the mount with something stronger, as a bird landed on it and it fell, but it still works perfectly.
 Bought one of these cameras for my parents to replace a dead Logitech camera. Hooking it up was a bit of a pain, and I could not get the synch module to function properly. Had to use a paper clip to reset it and that fixed the problem. Camera was then up and running and recording to their tablet. Fast forward a week later and I learn that they had not received any notifications of new recordings in all that time. I confirm that nothing is being recorded so I rebooted the synch module and played with the app for awhile. Got it running again for now. Time will tell.
 It works as well as I expected. Low price, incredibly simple set up and free cloud storage sold me on Blink. There is a bit of a delay (1 to 2 seconds) from the time it detects motion and when it records, but image and sound quality is good even at night. Plenty of options for scheduling and recently added "activity zones" help cut down on false alarms. I haven't set up a ton of IFTTT functions yet, but I'm glad it's an option. Have yet to see how long batteries actually last. Two years is a hefty claim. I was worried with Amazon owning the company that customer service might suffer, but I have been pleasantly surprised. Had a few technical problems and each time I've emailed their help desk they have responded in under 6 hours even on a Saturday night. They were able to push firmware updates to my camera fixing a few things. Awesome customer service for a subscription free service. Will definitely get more cameras next time they're on sale.
 OK, I'll say I love it for now, although I only have it up for a couple weeks but I also have an Intelligent Home System with 6 cameras for many years, so I have something to compare against.<br/><br/>2 of my Intelligent Home cams record 24/7 to the cloud with cloud-based motion. The motion detection is so-so but it is 24/7 for 10 days before an overwrite, so if something happens I can always see it, the other Intelligent Home cams are triggered by custom rules you set, as if whenever a door opens, cam "a" takes a pic or video and emails you or not, whether the system is armed or not, very versatile system, it is also maxed out with the 6 cams and only 2 can stream to the cloud and it is 10 dollars more a month for that, (5 dollars each) plus 45 a month monitoring... And all these cams are day/night and they are powered by 120V, so they need to be wired to an outlet. This system also has separate motion detectors and door/windows sensors and all work together with custom rules you set. It is a very different system that the Blink<br/><br/>But enough of that system and on to the Blink. The Blink cams work differently, they are on battery power so they are much better suited to detect infrequent motion to maximize battery life, however, they would do just fine with frequent motion detection, you will just be changing the batteries often. The picture is HD and wide angle, better than the Intelligent Home cams I have. The motion detection seems to work well, very well and these cams are dependant upon the motion to work, because they don't record until they detect motion.<br/><br/>I have no use for the Blink indoor model, it is not a day/night cam but instead has an LED it powers up if the cam detects motion in low-light or no light and records a clip. Obviously that LED will alert to the cams presence, that may or may not be a concern, I prefer the outdoor model that is IR equipped and with the internal toggle switch set, has no light indicator to call attention to itself. The app alerts happen very fast and you can see the clip on your phone or tablet, (I tried my Android tablet and it works, as well as my I-Phone).<br/><br/>I am intrigued by the coming door and window sensors, glass break sensors, other sensors and the monitoring packages as it gives me some flexibility to augment or get out of my current system and layered security is also a good thing. If you are redundant on anything, redundant security is good.<br/><br/>Currently I have one of these cams outside under a 1st story eave, it catches the back door and the shed. I have one in the garage pointing toward the door and of course it goes off if the door opens. I just ordered another and the postman just now left it. I haven't yet decided where I will mount it but again, I want to have it in a place where *motion is not expected when the cam is armed* so I don't get a slew of alerts and clips I have to view, I look at these units as more a motion detector with camera function than a camera with motion detection as motion is going to drive the camera, as well as your decision on where to mount it. You don't want it going off when car goes by or ordinary, everyday human or pet movements but they are Very useful in the right place and provide you with excellent monitoring and alerts.<br/><br/>I'll see how it goes with third cam and update the review in a couple months. I already like this system so I may have added additional cams as I determine where they can be most useful and for me, that process sometimes takes a little while to become clear.<br/><br/>Good product and 12 month warranty. Would buy again and just did by golly....
 I am fairly surprised by how security cameras have changed in the last few years. Of the six of these I own all but one function perfectly. The one that doesnt has a weird red dot permanently when in the dark, presumably something is wrong with the infrared emitter for night vision but who knows. I would suggest them for people who want a simple system to use, however storage space is pretty small so that may be an issue. If you want 24/7 recording you will still have to do a wired system though which is a little unfortunate, but understandable.
 This camera is easy to set up if you read the instructions carefully. The audio is clear. The camera records moving shadows and passing cats. During the day the video is clear, but at night it is sort of murky or blurry but definitely, the night video is clear enough to see what is going on and who is there. The biggest fault was instructions not mentioning the hinge can be tightened or loosened as needed. The other problem I had was snapping the arm to the mount; it was difficult to do and will come apart of not done correctly. No extra fees, plenty of storage, and the phone app is very easy to navigate.
 I purchased one single unit when it was on sale and to be honest I didn’t think I’d like it. But wow am I surprised and pleased! Not only was it simple to setup and install, but the app is so simple and straight forward. I have it at the front door and it do what I need it to do. I do not need anything fancy so this is perfect. Sound and visuals are great! Not one complaint. Not to mention there is no fee - bonus yippie.<br/>I also have Nest Cams and Arlo and hands down would recommend these.  My Nest and Arlo both have gone offline numerous times while the Blink has never lost video.
 Bettery life is super short, only one and half month. I already replaced the batteries twice since purchased last Dec, while it advertized 2 years. I’m sure it was misspelled of 2 months.<br/>When you leave home for a long, be careful there will be high chance of not working after short period. Not appropriate for a security camera.
 I have a camera system in my home and the reason I got these was because of the free storage and weatherproof abilities, even in cold weather!<br/>I’ve noticed when it’s super cold out, the battery life lessens. My guess is if you are in very cold areas, the battery won’t last the two years it claims, but I love these cameras! Great quality and can’t beat free storage. You can record anywhere from 5 seconds to 60 seconds. Of course battery life is affected when you record longer clips, but it’s ocnvenient if you use on vacation vs being home.<br/>Love them!
 Purchased 3 camera system  in September '18, loved it so much I purchased 2 more cameras in October, and now with all the holiday sales I purchases 2 more for me and a camera set as a gift for my father in law whom also liked how this little camera works.  I also showed 4 of my co-workers this camera system and now they to all own the Blink camera system.  They too are adding camera to their systems as well.  They thank me for intoducing them to these cameras. Whats not to like: Cameras are easy to set up install, and use.  Family and home is protected .
 I went out of town and the module stopped working. So neither camera was working when I wanted it most. I have one plugged in inside and one operating off of batteries outside. It's a high traffic area, but I tried to use activity zones. It is hit or miss whether the device records motion or not. It has also drained through both sets of batteries in the one camera already. I wish I wasn't outside the return window or these would be going back.
 I got the two-camera set.  I am happy with the picture and video quality.  Good color and clarity.  Works very well at the front door and on the parking pad where I have no view from a window.  Has been up for about two weeks, so I don't yet know about battery life.  Must have good wifi signal at the place where the camera is mounted.  I had to add a wifi extender near a front window in my log house to get the wifi signal out.  It would be better if the sync module also communicated with the cameras by wifi because the sync signal does not seem to go through the log walls (I also have the sync unit in a window).  Be sure to mount the camera in a rock solid position - wind motion of the camera itself will send a video clip to the cloud.  I worry about how well the camera attaches to the mounting bracket, but we have had some high winds that have not dislodged either camera yet.  I will recommend the system to friends.
 I purchased a complete wired 4 camera system, with hard drive for storage, about a year ago. It is still in the box, as I have spent many a Saturday mapping out how I would crawl around in the attic and where I would drill holes for the cables and locate the base station, etc. It has never actually happened.<br/><br/>I bought two Blink systems, for outdoor and indoor. Based on the reviews, I wanted to be able to arm each sync module individually. From out of the box to fully installed and operational was less than half an hour. My wife and I both put the app on our phones and are able to check or arm the systems from anywhere. I can't say enough about how easy and effective the system is.<br/><br/>The only issues I discovered are these; I wanted to mount the cameras fairly high, to get them out of view. The hinged mounts they came with are very good at mounting and adjusting sideways, so you can pan them as you want. However, you can't mount them vertically and pan them downward. The easy solution was just mount them a little lower and them swing them to get the picture I want. The cameras are incredibly light, the mount needs only a single small screw in drywall, stucco or wood.  The other issue is that I learned exactly when my kids arrive home, which I didn't really want to know. Oh well.
 Close to perfect.<br/><br/>Bought this to catch unethical building managers sneaking into my apartment. Here's a list of the things I like in no particular order:<br/><br/>- Small size.<br/>- Wireless.<br/>- Cloud storage.<br/>- Mobile app with notifications.<br/>- Ability to email video clips to anyone, including the police.<br/>- Ability to email video clips to myself and watch them on my home PC. They play back perfectly with the free, open-source VLC Media Player.<br/>- No subscription fees.<br/>- Different color skins available from third parties.<br/>- Infrared night vision<br/>- Ability to plug the sync module into my computer's battery backup and put the camera absolutely anywhere within it's wireless range.<br/>- Signal strength displays in mobile app.<br/>- Ability to turn off the blue recording light to avoid drawing attention to the camera.<br/><br/>Here's a list of the minor improvements I would like:<br/><br/>- Add the ability to reduce the retrigger time to less than 10 seconds. A 10 second recording gap could miss the moment when the intruder looks right into the camera.<br/>- Add the ability to view snapshots in full resolution.<br/>- Eliminate the visible red light while recording in infrared.<br/><br/>I am very satisfied with this system!
 Not everyone has a couple up to a few hundred bucks to drop on a name brand security camera starter system such as the Arlo (an Arlo Pro 2 base station and two cameras will set you back a whopping $429.00!).  Blink represents an inexpensive alternative that accomplishes the same job but isn't quite ready what with a few bugs.  Blink accomplishes the job well enough but has a shortcoming in that it records up to one minute of video before resetting to be retriggered (Arlo only record up to two minutes, I checked, unless you have the camera hardwired and a monthly plan...).  There should be live recording available, battery life be damned, in case your camera alerts you and you spy someone doing something instead of being limited by how you have your selectors set for recording time and trigger time. Some local storage via a USB thumb drive or an SD card plugged into the Blink sync hub would be nice also.  Neither are a deal breaker for an otherwise inexpensive and capable system...<br/><br/>Blink is a good alternative for those seeking a low cost way to monitor the inside/outside of their home without shelling out the bucks for a name brand system or a system that's hard wired into their homes.  There are other alternatives out there but for the cost Blink has a lot going for it.
 I like the price and ease of setup. The concept is good. The best part is the lack of monthly fees. However, the cameras are pretty poor. I can’t imagine being able to actually recognize a person’s face at night in the video. You can make out shapes if there’s some light, but in the dark they’re pretty useless. Maybe as a motion sensor which turns on some lights? I haven’t tried this yet but that may work. I’m keeping them as a deterrent anyway. There’s nothing better on the market right now. But I doubt they’ll help catch any criminals, at least not at night.
 Got the 2 camera XT setup for outdoor use.  Snagged them on-sale in early December.  Had been doing my research and had my eye on this camera system for awhile.  Once the Amazon GREAT sale price came on...pulled the trigger on the item.  Easy installation, easy hookup to the home network.  The system pretty much automatically did all the firmware and operating system upgrades once internet access was gained.  The system works exactly how I want and is very easy to use.  I give the item 5 stars and am very happy with the purchase.  Can it get better?  Absolutely.  I'd like to see 2 way audio capability... but I knew this setup did not have it.  Perhaps a future update?  Great job Blink/Amazon on the product.  I will buy another 2 camera setup when the sale price comes back.
 I love those cameras... I tried a lot of security cameras like arlo and simular once and they all had something I didn't like for example arlos cameras would activate when a leaf blew by super annoying others had cables which required wholes in that wall and some of the were just big and ugly but blink is just simpler easy to use easy to install even tho I have to say the mounts that come with it suck and the best part is you have so many options in your setting... this is definitely a good purchase and you get a really good deal for this price
 5 stars hands down. Great product, easy setup, and installation. I get real time viewing, motion detection, and cloud storage for FREE. Yes I said FREE! Unlike other security product you have to pay monthly subscription fees and that was a turn off for us. Blink has free cloud storage with no monthly fees. Follow the directions and you will have these puppy’s up and running in no time. These units do have batteries. They claim 2 year life and honestly if I had to replace the batteries once a year, that’s a drop in the bucket compared to paying subscription services. I strongly recommend getting the wall mounted brackets for outdoor use. The factory mounts don’t cut the mustard and cannot turn 360. I will be purchasing one more for my backyard in the future.
 Nice clear picture.  It needs to start recording earlier, people and cars are often gone before it starts recording.  The phone alert comes so late there’s no way to see live action.  Stops working and has to be reset about once a month.  I had to hard wire it about one month after installation, one of the batteries was totally dead in the first month and I live on the end of a cul-de-sack with little traffic.  My neighbor has all the same issues
 Product seems okay, but I haven’t been able to set it up because the sync module I received did not function. I called their customer service and they offered to send a new one, 2 to 3 business days for shipping. That was fine but I had to call three times to correct the address they’re sending it to because they either couldn’t understand or couldn’t hear me on the phone. I’m just hoping it comes to the right address and that it actually works. Otherwise the whole system will be returned even though I was crazy excited about this system.
 So far so good. Its easy to set up and use. Well only time will tell if the battery holds up and overall durability. I just installed it an hour ago and it has been detecting my neighbor passing by our common walkway already, even without lighting it gives HD quality video. I currently am using industrial grade velcro to hold it up, lol.<br/>Amazon you nailed this!!
 I was skeptical of this camera based on the price but all the reviews were so positive I decided to give it a try.  I am pleasantly pleased.  The app is easy and quick to set up.  The camera itself was also easy to set up and everything worked as promised.  Video and sound quality are fantastic.  The notices on my phone are fast.  The only complaint I have is the included mounting bracket.  It's cheap and I worry about it eventually becoming loose and the camera falling .  So I purchased an after-market mounting bracket on Amazon, problem solved.
 I've had this only for a day as of right now. I'd have to say I'm impressed with the quality and the simplicity of setting these up. Work as stated so far. Of course it's a little early , but as of right now... Very impressive little cameras! Looking to add on more, well when they are available.<br/>After having this for over a week now I need to change my review. Their service has gone down twice within two days. Nothing to do with Wi-Fi or the cameras.  Just the service, without the service the cameras are worthless.
 i was trying to make this work and register the S/N that came on the device but the app doesn't take it well and declined it as Invalid. Tried good number of times and with QR code but didn't work . not sure if this is something common or am i missing anything here ? . had issue turning on the switch which is so small and inside the battery case and cant even see it clearly. with all this felt returning is easy way out
 I have 5 cameras and they work fine bit the battery in one of them has failed already and measures 0.41 V DC with my digital volt meter - so do not depend on long battery life if you are using the camera in a remote location for security -
 The camera is very limited, no PC or TV viewing, only your phone and that's clumsy at best. No 2-way conversation, alerts are always delayed by default. The camera mount provided is as flimsy as tissue paper...get out your super-glue. The camera is constantly off line and requiring attention. I have gigabyte speeds and the unit almost sits on top the modem that does a good job for the rest of my house but it doesn't want to connect...support says to check your modem. Thanks for that! This one isn't ready for prime time at any price. Mine is going back today. Sad.
 Really love the camera and setup was very easy.<br/>Got the App for my iPhone but my operating system will soon be obsolete and I am not buying a new phone.<br/>I just bought a Fire tablet but cannot get the Blink App for it. This is not right as Amazon now owns the company. I do not want to side load the App, but I will if the Amazon App Store doesn't add it.<br/>We plan on buying more of these cameras so we will see.
 I bought this system before I moved with my family to Kampala, Uganda for work. Kampala has a high crime rate so everyone takes security very seriously. My neighbor has a security camera system worth several thousand dollars installed on his property. I didn’t have that kind of money or the ability to install a massive setup in a rental house. So, I bought the Blink system. I was worried it might not work with the internet available in Kampala. I was wrong, it works great. I was also worried that the cameras might not hold up to the dirt, dust, smoke, and monsoon type rains that are frequent in our area. I was wrong, the cameras work great! So if you are planning on moving to Africa, or if you just plan on staying home, these cameras will serve you well.
 Three of 4 cameras work fine, 2 XT's and one indoor but my first XT camera has extremely poor sensitivity.  To get it to record you almost need to touch the camera even with the sensitivity set to max.  The other cameras are working great.  I noticed people had trouble getting a response from Blink so I just purchased extra cameras figuring it wasn't worth the hassle trying to get a replacement.  Now 2 month in have 5 cameras, the original is still the only one that doesn't work properly.  Still haven't contacted Blink, probably not worth the time.
 I love it so far. The first day I had to take it down and reinstall the camera on the app because the camera was not communicating with the base. I like being able to make the settings of the camera to my liking . I have had it for a little less than a week and the battery is already dead 💀 not so happy about that and it starts recording at random distances not sure why but I love being able to keep an eye on my AUDI s3 and know when someone is next to it I would recommend this product but recommend you have extra battery’s laying around
 Works well and i have had mine outside for over a month and it works very well. Plenty of battery life and records all movement.<br/>I like not having to purchase VDR time as i do with the Nest Cam. The idea of no 110v power needed lets u put this almost anywhere.<br/>NEGATIVE; When u take a photo to see what is happening the bottom 12% of picture is obscured by their logo and u can not use Landscape mode to enlarge pic or zoom.<br/>If u use the movie mode, then the logo goes away and u can use landscape and zoom features.
 What's good? The price. That's about it. The mount they come with is so cheesey that anyone can walk up, and pop the unit off and walk off with it or break it off they wanted. They also take a while to start. Most of the time the people are up to my camera, or past it's view by the time it turns on. The problem is when you couple those 2 problems what you get is a system that doesn't turn in until the person in question is already past the viewing range, and then they can pull it right off and smash it. After all those problems mine lasted 3 months. After 1 of the 2 died that sent me a refurbished one, that has problems with the range (that the new one did not) to the sync module that I'd need to spend more money to get to work. It is also nearly impossible to see the face of anymore at night, so what's the point? Save your money, and spend a little more.
 I've had these cameras for a month now and I hate them. They're hardly a security camera because they barely work half of the time, which doesn't very well embody the ideas of security. It takes forever for the app to load the feed, the thumbnail option doesn't work, the cloud doesn't work, it doesn't record anything, there's no segmentation in the screens for motion detection (which also doesn't work). My $20 Yi cameras shouldn't have better app features and work better than $100 cameras. Pretty disappointed, hope they can update!
 I love this Blink XT security camera system.  Super easy to set up.  I love that I get instant alerts on either my cell phone or tablet and I love that I can look at a live shot of the area no matter where I am.<br/><br/>I will add more cameras to this system......Excellent system
 I love everything about the camera except only ONE issue! I am having tons of trouble SENDING my recorded videos to other people including emails, text messages, and iMessages. I have contacted Blink through email customer support and they keep stating they are working on it but nothing has been done to correct the issue. Other than that I would recommend this camera to everybody especially due to the very EASY setup and great video/picture quality.
 We have four of these now, and they are great.  No monthly fees.  Excellent color picture.  Wide field of view.  Can turn the motion detector on or off from IPhone.  Records motion (you set the sensitivity) and puts it into a "folder" with a time/date stamp on it.  Or you turn off the motion and just turn them on individually to watch live.  You can also watch live motion while the recording function is on.  My son has a Ring doorbell camera and said he is getting one of these Blinks because of all of the above.
 The blink XT is an outdoor camera.  It should come with a plastic lip over the camera lens to keep rain drops from sitting on it.  This wouldn’t be a costly improvement to the design.  Literally every single outdoor camera is designed this way..  The second day after setting it up we had a rain storm.  The camera is mounted on a tree outside and is set at a slight angle pointing downward.  The camera has been useless for two days with rain sitting on the lens.  I’ve had to pay extra to order a quality mount with an overhang to correct this problem.  Minus two stars for the poor mount it comes with and the design not allowing use in the rain..
 The the price of the camera is cheap,the picture quality is decent and the setup was super easy. The only downside side is that around 10 seconds after the motion detection triggers you'll get the live feed. Which is an easy fit since you can set the video recording from 10-60secs. The motion sensor is too and at the same time not too sensitive. Cars, leafs, bugs anything that moves will be resulting in several notifications. Use it wisely and placed it at a place that you really need it. Remember, this is very affordable and convenient but is not perfect.
 Definitely not worth the price.  The camera worked just OK during warm weather, but the batteries drained within a day or two in sub zer weather.  This device really isn’t good for outdoor use.  I’m sure it would work fine for indoor use.
 We wanted a system to see who was at the front door. It works but has such a long delay as another reviewer said, If it were a burglar, he would be in my bedroom before the camera showed the picture. It does not have immediate picture. It did not meet our need and we returned it. Will read reviews closer for next purchase.
 This is a great product. It is very easy to install, gives excellent video, and has a very easy to use phone app. It works on wi-fi so no wires to run. The cameras work with two AA lithium batteries that last up to two years, which is amazing. The best part about this setup; there is no monthly fee and no false alarms going off. You control everything from your phone. It is an excellent surveillance system. BTW, I have had multiple hard-wired and monitored alarm systems over the past 30 years, which I was never happy with. The blink setup is really really good.
 I am already an early adopter of the original Blink cams. I have 4 of them. One thing I don't like about the original design is the LED light that turns on when the unit is armed and motion is detected. It's like saying to a would-be burglar-- "Hey! you're on camera!""<br/><br/>This latest iteration is a lot better. It's water proof and emits invisible IR rays when motion is detected (when armed) so that the recorded video is visible even when there is complete darkness in the place where you put it.<br/><br/>Since it is AA battery powered (you can also use a USB battery pack to power it but it no longer stays water proof), you can place it anywhere you want it to monitor. I just hope it would come at a lower price especially for existing customers.
 I am not sure what others spoke about, but the set up was as easy as pie...plugged in next to my router, loaded it up quickly...the sync module, no issues at all.  Then downloaded the app, and loaded my two cameras...again easy as can be.  Put up with our issue and all works great.  Only thing i do wish is there was audible...the app actually says audible, but know it does not have unless this is part of a firmware upgrade that i do not know about.  After some use i will come back and update.  Also the night vision is just fine without lighting and when I loaded up the units all updated with firmware..nice touch.
 My batteries certainly have drained out on me WAY BEFORE the 2 year mark... about 23 months too soon.. yup they literally only lasted less than a month.<br/><br/>But I do give it 4 stars because I’ve been researching and even purchased others including RING (love) I decided to keep blink XT ( perfect for my back door! not bad at all for the price, and being wireless I like it obviously you can’t make out license plates like on most home cameras, I do like this camera, I just WISH MY batteries would have LASTED!!!..<br/><br/>Also connection sometimes is laggy might be a WiFi thing? Idk<br/>Has night vision, sensitivity on motion detection, can choose to report for up to 60 Sec at a time and it’s great in the snow, cold, wind, and rain so far! (I purchased a wall mount for about $11)<br/><br/>Overall not bad at all, I’m keeping it.. but If you have money to spend it’s a good investment in something pricier ONLY IF ITS WORTH IT
 Cameras now working at night. Found Helpful Tech support person - Haitham<br/>---<br/>Blink XT works as expected during daylight hours. At night however, I can only see a big black patch.<br/>Bought 9 Cameras / 3 Systems.<br/>Camera is installed outdoor under eaves; 5 bars for Camera and System; latest firmware.<br/>Tried compensating via adjustments with no success.<br/>Contacted Tech Support - "we are currently seeing some issues with the IR night vision across the board", no follow-up.<br/>My WYZE cameras work as expected. At that price, if they were outdoor rated, definitely the way to go.
 As advertised and does everything its suppose to, however it drives me nuts that I can't personalize the notification sound on the app.  IMHO an email vs home intruder warrant different notification sound.
 Nice product, all is as advertised but I would make a few changes. First I agree with most others that there should be recording during live view. The other thing is the app. I don’t know how many other people have tried viewing the app on a tv/standard screen monitor but it is horrible. Now in all fairness, the app says it may not work with devices that are not phones. And also it never states anywhere that it can be used properly on a tv (through fire stick or something). My wish is that the app could be used on both device types. Fix these issues/ add these features and I believe this system could very easily become the standard for lower budget surveillance systems when ease of installation is also taken into account (it’s not bad to set up).
 Pros: Camera worked great.  Install was really easy.  App was easy to use.<br/><br/>Cons: Battery life was terrible.  I don't know what assumptions they make to get to 2 years of battery life, but they aren't realistic.  The app told me camera was in a "high traffic area" and the battery would die quickly.  It was on the front of my house, watching the front lawn area (which is in the middle of a low traffic suburb).  After I got the notification, I adjusted it because occasionally a car going by would set it off.  It would still frequently get set off because of the noise of a car going by (no motion from cars).  It was probably 20ft back from the street.  Even after I corrected it again, and made it less optimal for my use, but no longer picked up any car movement or noise, it still said it was in a "high traffic area."  All it was picking up was my family going in and out of the house.  This to me completely defeats the purpose of having a camera like this.  Of course I want it in an area where people are frequently walking.  That is the point of a security camera.  Battery died after 1 month.  Super disappointed and ended up returning it.
 I installed two Blink XT cameras to monitor the front yard and walkways. I got the two camera kit and free Echo Dot special deal for $142 bucks. The results are fairly impressive for a very inexpensive setup. Hopefully now I will identify the culprit not picking up after their dog.<br/>The quality of the video is more than acceptable. The night vision is not the greatest but easily good enough to recognize people’s faces and type of cars that drive by.<br/>Overall I think it is a great product and performs as advertised. I especially like that there are no ongoing fees of any kind.
 We own a vacation condo. Some times of year, it may be a couple of months between visits. I put this camera by the door, and I know anytime someone comes near it. The motion detector and smart phone app alert is great. A friend owns units on the same floor which he rents. He has one camera at each door, and knows when his renters come and go. He also had an interesting show recently when a young lady went running the length of the hallway in her birthday suit. I'm thinking that was quite a party! But if you're looking for this kind of device, I highly recommend this model.
 This is a good option for a very low traffic area. Somewhere to alarm you if in case some activity is happening. This is NOT for an office, public, or any traffic area, as it drains the battery in a week or two.<br/>If you set the sensitivity too low, it may not record anything.<br/>That's why no one has come out with a cordless camera yet that can be used in a normal traffic area.<br/>I have Nest cameras which need a power source and they work like a charm. Again if you don't need this camera in a traffic area,  it is a great camera.
 Got it all setup, played around with settings, worked fine. Woke up this morning to see a blinking (?) red light on the sync box. Unplugged it and moved it closer to the router, same light. Re-set it up 2x and still doesn't work. Online it says that some boxes within a certain sn range couldn't use wifi passwords with a special character(!). I don't think this applies to me since a) I got it working for a while, and b) my sn is newer then the specified range. Not sure what else to try short of exchanging it for a different one.
 We installed these with ease, they are super easy to set up.  There are some glitches in the system such as not starting to record until after the movement has left the sight of the camera.  We also had to adjust the sensitivity due to traffic in the distance setting them off, but this causes recording after the source is out of sight of the camera.  So far we have only had 1 video that was questionable,  I would have attached it, but I cannot seem to send the video via email from my phone (probably due to my lack of knowledge in getting it sent) we still don't know what set it off.<br/><br/>Please be aware that the more a specific camera gets used the more it will drain the batteries.  We have had these installed for a couple of weeks now and have gotten notice that a certain camera is being used more than normal.  I expect to have to change the batteries within the next couple of weeks.  That would make the battery life half of what is advertised.<br/><br/>I love the option of viewing a camera live, however I do wish that I was able to record live.  The night vision is questionable.  If we have a back porch light on, you can make out what is setting the camera off at night.  If you don't have a light on, forget knowing what may be lurking out there.<br/><br/>If you live in an area prone to a lot of crime, I would not recommend them.  Your dollars would be much better spent on a much more sophisticated system.  If you are in a lower crime area, these will work fine.  We live in a quiet neighborhood where a few shenanigans go on every once in a while like a kid in the neighborhood decides to turn on outside spigots for fun.  We installed these to catch the little guy doing it.  I doubt that these will pick him up, the batteries will have died first.  For now, they allow me to see how many times a day that our dogs go outside and I am fine with that.
 Really laggy, connection is not good either, motion detector does not work well either, I was walking in the room a few times no alert is triggered, not reliable for a security system. I will go with traditional security system instead that’s way more sensitive and connected with police calls
 I have three of these cameras and the claim that they work with alexa is true but worthless. I have an Echo Show and you would think that you should be able to view a camera clip on the show but NO. Doesnt work like that. They are quick to say that it works with alexa but never say what doesnt work.. the important stuff! Actually, I'm changing this to two stars because of the mis-information
 Worked great for about 2 months. Had to replace batteries after 2 months, then it was dead again after 2 days.<br/>This is nowhere near "2 years", I assume I got a defective camera. Amazon doesnt seem to care to help a long time Prime member who spends a decent amount of money here every year.
 Pros: Easy to install. Video quality is fantastic. Notifications are sent to smartphone in relatively short amount of time, within seconds. Lots of mounting options with hardware included in package, or supplemental camera mounts sold separately. You can easily adjust motion detection sensitivity from the app. App is laid-out nicely, and allows easy navigation between cameras and settings.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Web access is still unavailable. I've heard they're working on adding it.<br/>Video recording time is limited to 60 seconds max, then the camera needs to cycle for 10-seconds before recording resumes.<br/><br/>Limited cloud storage. I'd estimate it at about 100 minutes, (but hey, it's free) so unless you can transfer the video file before it's automatically deleted, it's gone. Unfortunately, there's no other way to maintain long-term storage on the video for review, posterity, or to show to law enforcement, so I'm hoping their geeks can resolve the email/text transfer issue. (One reason for 4-stars instead of 5) You are, however, able to upload your video via text or email and send it to yourself for permanent storage. Cumbersome, but possible.<br/><br/>You also can't pick and choose which cameras you'd like turned off/on around the house from a single sync unit. It appears this can be achieved if you buy an additional sync unit, you can achieve this by toggling between the two sync units in the app. So, it's doable, but in that regard, it takes a little extra effort and money, and makes it somewhat clunky.<br/>The unit also does now allow recording on an SD card. It's all cloud storage. (The other reason I didn't give it 5-stars.<br/><br/>All-in-all, for the price, it seems to be a great, portable system that lets you easily move camera locations. It will be interesting to see if the batteries and individual units last as long as advertised. So far, I'm extremely comfortable with the purchase and have no regrets.
 We've been using our two camera system for a few weeks, during which time we've had to establish settings to fit our situation. We have a front door and a back door deck and can activate either or both to record any movements. You will likely find that you can overdo it overusing the clips and batteries. My one disappointment is the poor mounting system, which is weak and needed an aftermarket mount for adjustability. It also needed a drop of thin CA ahesive to hold together well enough to get it secured to the house.
 Purchased to watch over my remote vacation home. I wanted an inexpensive monitoring system for the times we are away from the house. Camera works perfectly for this application. Clear pictures, good video, easy setup. I doubt I will get many triggers when we are not there, but I used it for a week while we were and it readily picks up motion. I like that I can turn it on anytime and peek in the house to make sure everything is ok. Also, the temperature sensor is great so I can remotely make sure the Hvac unit is working.
 **UPDATE 8/30/18 - the battery in the same camera is dead, again. There are other cameras that get a lot more use than this one.  We ordered a 3 camera set and I put one of the new cameras in it's place.  I'm pretty sure there is something wrong with this camera since I've had to change the battery every 2 months.<br/><br/>The batteries in one of the cameras only lasted 2 months,  not 2 years and the mount doesn't hold the camera in place. The rest of them appear to be fine at this time.
 Very easy to install. Easy to set up. Good quality video. Only gave a four star because of the mounting. The mounting bracket just snaps into the camera. Bracket is plastic but has not given problems as of yet. I live on a hill and wind blows very hard. Worried the cameras may snap off the mounting bracket. Also wish they would come out with a tilt and pan feature that would connect to these cameras. I purchased seven cameras and would like a couple of them to be able to pan and tilt to be able to monitor a wider area. All in all a very good system and would recommend it to anyone.
 I love the picture quality, the motion detection seems a bit long.  (Takes a bit of movement in order for them to start recording)  Blinking light gives the cameras location away pronto (Black Tape fix).  Phone alert that the system is functioning is enough.  Overall it's a very good quality detection system.
 I bought 5 Blink XTs. There are a lot of false alarms with these, I can overlook this because of their price and no subscription fee for storage.  However, this is not an outdoor camera.  The cameras that are not physically attached to my house have been eaten by squirrels.  I've moved them around, and the squirrels follow them.  I've had these for less than a year and 2 have been eaten.  To me, an outdoor camera should not attract wildlife, and should be able to withstand damage from wildlife.  After several back and forths with customer service, they offered me a 50% discount to buy replacements.  There is no way I'm going to purchase these again.  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.  Had high hopes.  Disappointed.
 Camera works pretty good and if you don't want a camera that has chords than this is the one to get my only problem is that it gets triggered by wind and the site is sounds cars driving by on the front Road so sometimes it goes off randomly like every 5 Seconds and even if I turn down the sensitivity setting it just seems to get stuck on a loop of going off and I've had to replace the batteries twice now and I've only had the camera for a month. Besides that it seems like a fairly good camera you can hear people on it and you can see pretty well as well as the night vision is pretty good. You will want to put it up in a pretty high place because it pops right off the bracket someone could just walk right off with it. I did have a little issue with getting it set up to my Wi-Fi but not that bad overall it was pretty easy to get started and set up.
 I currently have a couple of YI cameras and was looking for a possible alternative.<br/>This camera was garbage.  It's a wireless camera but you need to have a sync module plugged in.  I set this up to monitor packages when they were delivered and had no notifications when packages were delivered.  When I did get notifications, there wasn't anything moving in the video.  Thinking that it was bad connection to the sync module, I tried resyncing the camera to the module. Unfortunately, the camera will not sync with the module anymore.  Garbage.  Also, I was able to view the line feed with no issues, so that told me the setup/ sync was fine.<br/>I would not recommend this camera at all
 Facing my low-traffic street, I'm getting about a month on a set of batteries.<br/>faces and license plates are only readable in the center of the picture.<br/>Minimum of 10 seconds between retriggers - you have to choose to use a lot of battery with long captures every time or the chance of missing something important.<br/><br/>Probably good to have at your front of back door.

I did have to call a couple of times and my response was usually "that's it?" I kept trying to make it harder than it was!!!!!!!!!  We got one for wildlife in the back yard and the second day we got a hawk on the hummingbird feeder next to the house peering into the enclosed patio. Was still trying to learn two cameras and accidentally deleted before saving! I called and they got it back for me. They can within a certain window if you know the time. So cool!
 I love these cameras. They provide better coverage than my expensive wired cameras. They do have a few quirks that I hope will be addressed in the future.<br/>  You cannot individually arm/disarm cameras.<br/>  Each hub is a separate system and you have to change systems to view cameras on more than on hub.<br/>  No two-way audio—just listen only.<br/>  The XT is heavier than the indoor cameras and must be hung with screws—I use Command Adhesive Velcro on my indoor cameras.<br/>  The Amazon Echo skills are buggy and useless! Blink being owned by Amazon should work better together.<br/><br/>Overall, I’m very pleased.
 abslutley one of the amazing home security cameras in market.<br/><br/>1-Easy to install as on Blink app will walk you through all the steps.<br/><br/>2-Motion sensor work great to catch up each little things.<br/><br/>3-Blink wireless networks work perfect in average range with 7000 sq.ft.<br/><br/>4-High quality videos and photos so you can see morning clear and night capture too.<br/><br/>5-You have the option zoom in and out available.<br/><br/>6-Affordable price for our community.<br/><br/>But the only 3 things need improvement:<br/><br/>1- No futures to see multiply video live cameras on your device.<br/><br/>2- No futures to see same video live cameras on multiply device.<br/><br/>3- Customer service not answering right away as you will wait long time of period to get someone help you.
 I already have an arlo system at another location, I wanted to try Blink XT to see if it rank better than Arlo. So far the install and APP are superior compared to arlo. I really want to see if the battery life exceeds what I get with Arlo, since I'm always recharging the arlo camera. Another great improvement is sound I didnt even notice that the blink system also records sound. I installed and ran several test with great results. The night vision is better than my arlo system. Lastly even though shown in beta the active grid is a great upgrade.
 I placed both Blink and Nest cameras at my front door and Blink was a total failure. It did not perform well without strong light. When the delivery man came, all I could see was a black figure moving. But Nest gave me a video with face identifiable.
 So far so good. Although I've had to replace the battery on one camera far ahead of the estimated two-year life span. The cameras also do not alert when the batteries are low, which would be great to minimize the chance of them dying if you are away. My camera settings are mid-range, with not much traffic to set off motion sensor, so the battery should have lasted longer than it did (replaced battery on one after 3 months use)
 Great cameras with very clear video. Night vision works well. Easy to set up/connect to home network. Only issue I have is with the motion detection distance. I attempted to mount camera on eve above my driveway (~20 ft) but the camera did not pick up motion of bodies moving up/down driveway (increased sensitivity but then motion of tree branches triggered video).
 I've got 5 blink xt cameras around the outside of my house. They've been up for about 2 weeks. So far, I can't be happier with the way they work.<br/><br/>Setup and installation was a breeze. Connected the wifi module and the 5 cameras in less than 1 hour. Attaching the cameras just means screwing in a single screw to your wall (one extremely minor inconvenience is that the cameras don't include a wall anchor for the screw), so I had all 5 up in about 30  minutes.<br/><br/>The software works well. I have a Samsung Note 8 phone - but I've tested it on an iPhone X too. Able to get live video and/or a snapshot of any camera quickly. There are settings for motion sensitivity, motion zones, rettigger time, length of video clip, IR control, and video quality. The videos look great on my phone's screen.<br/><br/>If there's enough light, the videos are in full color. If not, then they are in black &amp; white. I just bought some solar powered led lights to place near the camera in order to get color videos at night.
 The response time is much slower than the Ring doorbell. I think Blink is okay to fill in a few blind spots but I won't use it for anything critical (doors). On the plus side the cloud is free....
 Easy set up. Great quality video! I bought the package with two cameras and will definitely add more cameras.<br/><br/>I live out in the country and I am on the verizon wifi. My signal is not that strong but I managed to set both cameras where I wanted them. They both work great. Letting you know because you need to make sure where you place your camera, you check in the setting to make sure your wifi signal to the camera is good or it will be difficult to get a video or picture. Once I moved it closer to my router, it worked great. Sadly we dont have any of the major internet providers out here.<br/><br/>I am quite happy with my purchase. 😁
 This product has great night vision and I love the whole product. I've had it for about a month and haven't had any problems. You can change sensitivity so it doesn't pick up cars driving by. I give this 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons. First, I wish the actual device could somehow be secured better to my home instead of just the clip on the back. I would feel MUCH better if I could somehow screw the device into my siding than just the holder. Second, I wish I could angle my camera. However, I just found out that you can purchase an attachment so you can have it angled however you would like (which I will probably be purchasing soon). Super easy installation and very user friendly. Would buy again!
 The system is very easy to setup, the camera video looks crisp and has a wide view, the audio catch almost every sound around it. Also the cameras have an option to either use batteries or power up thru a micro usb that is very convenient. The disappointment is that I can further use the settings like specify the areas to detect motion or use the system on a computer. Ultimately this camera system deserve a 5 stars just because I can install them everywhere without the worry of running cables throughout the house that is the reason I bought them.
 Not sure about the units low temperature operation.  I was apprehensive about weather it would operate in extreme low temps.  I recorded -12 degrees with -35 wind chill.  I have two units installed.  One faces the sun, the other no sun.  The unit not facing the sun stopped communicating with the bridge for about a week then started up again and has worked since.  Hopefully the deep freeze here in northern NH has passed.  Will see how well it operated during the coming seasons.
 It seems great at first, but it doesn't last.<br/><br/>My first set of batteries lasted three months, tops. The second set and further have been lasting one week. Total garbage. Not to mention every now and then it freaks out and starts recording and then shutting off ten times a second, and blows up your phone with notifications. Complete garbage at this point.<br/><br/>I contacted the manufacturer for a refund. No help whatsoever. One month return window, regardless of manufacturer defect. They literally will only guarantee that these will work for a month!<br/><br/>I spent over $500 on this system and now it is literally no more useful than garbage.
 This is the second set of cameras that I purchased from BLINK.<br/>The lense angle is not wide enough to cover larger areas and having that flimsy mounting fixture makes it very diffcult to align the camera unsless you pay another $15 to buy an after market mounting fixture. I tried some wide angle lense adapter used for iPhine, but it didn't work<br/>The notifications are prompt, but retriving a clip is a disaster and times impossible, when using cellular data.<br/>I am not sure why the manufacturers don't us memory cards to store video clips the cards don't draw current when not used
 This was expensive and I nearly didn't get it.  However, once it came I found setup to be very easy and performance to be excellent.  I mounted this about 10' from my front door.  Motion detection is excellent - no false alarms yet and no missed alarms either.  Exceptionally nice to see who has been at the door.  One gripe (minor) I wish the video recording would start 5 or 10 seconds BEFORE the motion sensor detection event.  That would use a lot more power than regular mode....but it just might be worth it.<br/><br/>Good purchase.... recommended.
 Looks nice, setup is easy, good video and app.  The sync and WiFi status goes in and out despite the sync module being close by to camera and next to my modem, so sometimes doesn’t record a video when motion is near. UPDATE:  my router is connected to phone landline, so I couldn’t move very far, but I moved it and the sync module about 4 feet across the room and now it works.  It was and still is only 10’ from camera, so maybe it was the wall interference.
 I am absolutely OBSESSED! Super easy to install, and I get the motion detected feed right away, so I know who's coming and going. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because now that I want to purchase another I have to pay full price. I should have the same discount that I had for the first one being that I am a returning customer.
 PROS:<br/>The image is great for both day and night videos.<br/>The sound is clear in the videos.<br/>Great price.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>Motion detection range is pretty short.<br/>It was hard to find a place in my house to put the receiver because the cameras could not be more than about 30 feet from the receiver to have decent signal strength.
 I'm not sure what application this would be good for other than maybe the front and rear door of your house.. You could see who is there.  You can't watch or record much as you would normally.. I waited to long to install it to send it back for a refund.  Spend your money on a real security camera system.

It states "camera is busy"<br/>- Unable to record or snap a photo while watching a LIVE feed.<br/>- Motion detection is extremely delayed (shows animals or persons walking away from the front door but not when they got there or what direction they came from. "view recording"<br/>- Audio chips in and out.<br/>- If the sensitivity goes over 5, any and everything triggers the motion detection.<br/><br/>Overall this product SUCKS!. I have an indoor TENVISTY camera and I LOVE everything about it. I just wish they also sold an outdoor waterproof wireless cam.
 Car was stolen didn't capture them getting into car due to lapse time in video batteries are dead less than 2 months later. Save your money, maybe not time and get wired connected security for full streams of everything. Otherwise someone steals you just got video of them driving off in it and nothing else!
 We now have four cameras outside and two inside.  They work perfectly as advertised.  However the software has two obvious deficiencies.  First, you can't save snapshots to your phone.  And second, you can't schedule arming and disarming.  I would love to schedule the outside cameras to be armed at 10:00 PM when we normally retire, and disarm at 7:00 AM when we are up and about.  But, the software does not have these functions.  It seems pretty obvious and simple to do, but missing!
 I have a 3-camera Blink system: two XT cameras and one indoor camera.  I'm very satisfied with this as an out-of-the-box solution.  The wireless aspect allows placement anywhere so its important that it has long battery life which is TBD.  The photo and video  and sound quality are good.  My wish list: (1) individual arm/disarm schedules for each camera on a single Sync module; (2) capture 1-2 seconds of video prior to the trigger.  I initially bought two XT cameras and liked it a lot that I bought a third camera.
 If you have a house with aluminum siding do not purchase!!!! I have an interior system and was setting up an XT system for exterior. I got the Xt system running in the house and moved the camera outside. Luckily I tested before drilling holes. No matter where I move the camera and hub I cannot connect to the camera. Bring the camera in and it immediately connects. In multiple locations I put the hub against the wall and put the camera on the other side trying wall thickness only. No dice. Nothing. Tried 3 cameras doing this. All work through interior walls flawlessly. After 5 hours and even trying to mount the sync hub in th attic I am regretfully sending the 5 camera system back. 😒😒😒😒😔
 I had a bad module after a year and I bought a new one and now I cannot reconnect my old cameras to my new module. I have gone round and round with customer service they have no excuses they have no answers and now I’m sitting here with four cameras that I can’t use. They lie about what could be causing it or they simply don’t know. Today they’re telling me is the module I said I bought that yesterday so it’s pretty hard to believe a brand new one wouldn’t work but no one can tell me what I should do to get my old cameras to connect

In the pic supplied cars coming from left to right doesnt register on camera until it hits the trashcan but coming from right to left it somehow manages to get the whole car until it gets out of sight all the way down the road all while not managing to get my wife walking out the front door. (Sensitivity 4 doesnt pick up the cars or people but 5+ send an alert for every car)<br/><br/>In the rear my wife parks at the crack lined up with the gutter. At sensitivity 6 it did not pick up her getting in her car and leaving but last night at sensitivity 7 it was going off because of the neighbors rotating christmas lights across the street.<br/><br/>I bought these because of the "ACTIVITY GRID" but it's not available even though it says 2 weeks ago on their page that the activity grid will be rolled out for everyone withing the week.<br/><br/>I will gladly fix my review if things get better but as for how it will stay a 2 star
 Just returned this system. I bought it because I wanted something easy for me to set up and was battery operated so i didn't have to run any wires or cut any holes in my house.  It worked sometimes but for the most part the video and photo quality was awful. Worked with the Blink Tech Support but that was a waste. Felt like a guinea pig as they tried to get me to test new unreleased firmware. I gave up because I was running into a scenario where I wouldn't have been able to get a refund.  I'll keep shopping around.
 It doesn’t have the total functionality of other security systems but it sure is an added measure of comfort if you are looking for something simple and easy to use that can keep an eye on whatever you need. I wish the red lights wouldn’t turn on when recording st night cuz it makes them obvious and it also clicks when the camera is activated which is annoying. I have the switch turned to off for the red recording light but it still turns on. Maybe it’s needed for the night vision but wish it wasn’t right on the face of the camera if possible.
 Let me down completely when I needed it most. Leaving on a trip in a few hours. As soon as I put the Blink app on my wife's phone,nothing works. Contact "technical support". Waste of 45 minutes. Deleted my account and I tried to get back up with a new account. The new account shows, but won't let me connect with router. I wish I could give these negative stars for the stress I'm having leaving the house with a bunch of non-working cameras. Shouldn't have cheaper out with this system and went with Ring.
 These cameras are great! Nice resolution, great audio. My only reason for missing a star is that the motion sensor isn't as quick as I'd like it to be. If someone grabs a package off your porch very quickly, these will catch his or her back's as he or she runs away.
 This has got to be one of the worst products out there. I usually dont do reviews but my constant battle with this system has prompted this negative review. It does not record the preset clip length times programed, well sometimes it does... ive got it set to 60 sec most of the clips i get are 3-6 sec long, despite movement going on. I went put to my truck today, got into the tailgate got out so ie tools and the camera recorded none of it. I got this system due to 3 vandelization evens ive had at my house. 1 tagging on my fence. My teuck window shot out and then my truck broke into and my stereo and custom gauges stolen out of the cab. Cops say. Do you have camera footage. No, sorry cant help ya!... so i got this system, buuuut its worthless... oh and it will burn up all kinds of storage space on getting triggered by air i guess because nothing else is there...  i tried setting the cameras to full sensitivity the other night and i acted like i was trying to bek into both my suvs in my driveway at night. Yeah no camera activation or recording!  Once again good for nothing, but catching cars drive by and neighbors walking their dogs!
 I am very impressed with this security camera system! It is extremely simple to set up the apps and sync the cameras to my phone. Picture quality is clear, color accurate, and detailed. Even the sound that the cameras detect is sensitive and not garbled. However, this is not a two-way audio system. You can only hear sound but not transmitted out through a speaker. The only tricky part is setting the camera's motion sensitivity level. Once I got that down, it was perfect. I absolutely recommend this product and would buy again based on my experience.
 I purchased this particular camera as I have an older home with limited outlets and none outside so the wireless and battery features were a must for me.  It was easy to connect to wifi and the mobile app for my phone was very intuitive to use.  It doesn't have an app for my laptop but I really don't see this as a problem as if I'm using my laptop I'm at home and can get up and see for myself what's going on.<br/>This wasn't so much a security issue for me but a way to keep and eye on my animals to make sure they're the ones getting fed throughout the day and not every other woodland creature in my neighborhood.  Works great for that and the motion sensors are a great way to alert me when I've had packages delivered.  For the price point it's a great value, I like it so much I've ordered another camera so I'll have 3 and be able to monitor front back and side of my house.  I had it up and operational in a few minutes.
 These cameras are amazing for the price.<br/>They are truly wireless. The only electrical plug you need is for the sync module (the "brain" responsible for up to 10 cameras).<br/>Camera itself, powered by 2 AA Lithium batteries. I've only had my 3 cameras for for a couple of months. And I did have to replace one set of batteries already. But, I must take responsibility for the short life of that set. Like most new toys, I Had to keep playing around with it, constantly checking my live feed. (And I DO mean constantly).<br/>Wifi range is quite good. When I have lost wifi at home, they cameras have always been able to sync back up to the wifi &amp; sync module.<br/>Try one, I think you'll like it.
 I LOVE my Blink cameras.  It is so reassuring when I go out of town to be able to monitor my home and set up alerts without having to pay a monthly monitoring fee.  I have 5 of these cameras in all and a lot of my coworkers have them installed as well.  The pictures and videos are clear and very sensitive to movement.  Glad I saw these on sale.<br/><br/>I was able to very easily sync with a module that I already have.<br/><br/>GREAT product.
 Love these cameras! We installed 4 around the exterior of our home, and have have been very happy. The app is great and easy to use. And best of all, it’s really free. The picture and sound are very good, especially given how small the cameras are. Installation couldn’t be any easier, you just screw the mount where you want it, and the camera easily pops on. It moves fairly easily as well to get the angle you want. They haven’t migrated on their own, but a bird landed on one and wiggled it down a tad, otherwise no issues with movement. The app gives me notifications when the sensor goes off so I can check out the clip right away. I can also log in and live stream any time. You can change the sensitivity of the sensor as well, which was nice (birds chirping close enough makes them go off). I’ve had them for about 2 months so haven’t had to change the batteries at all, but don’t think it will be an issue when that happens.
 Where have these been all my life?  No wires, easy app to maneuver.  So adjustable.  Added a third camera after my daughter got me these for a gift and will be getting more.  My kids are adding to our camera coverage as gifts for us.  I can keep an eye on things while at work, and shut them off, or adjust their auto recording as well as audio coverage.  These are great.  Love that there are NO wires.  Installed in minutes.  One screw, a screw driver and ladder to get them out of reach.  I check their adjustment and coverage from my iPhone while I'm still on the ladder before coming down.
 This is an excellent camera.  I found it easy to set up, place in my home and view the saved clips.  I had a small glitch with clip length at first, but got that sorted out with a phone call to customer service.  Note, this is NOT an infrared capable camera, although it does make videos in the dark using the installed light when motion is detected.  My camera did not ship with a manual, but I found one on line. It was useful in setting up the camera. I highly recommend it this camera to anyone wishing to take videos around their home either inside or out. I liked it so much that I bought a second one.
 If I could make a review with less stars than 1 star I would. I purchased the 2 camera package and I have had this setup for less than 2 months when I first started having problems. Unless your going to hardwire the power cord into these cameras dont bother using the AA batteries. After reading the community review forums on the blink system the cameras pull power off of only 1 battery so when changing batteries only 1 is dead but the others still fully charged. Both of my cameras went full purple on me for 2 weeks on all my photos/videos. Another common problem if you read the forums. I have lost power at my house recently for a few hours and my cameras will not reconnect to the blink router anymore. I have tried everything. Do not buy this camera if you dont want problems. If you do buy it good luck. Customer service with amazon is good.
 While the image/ movie/ audio quality is excellent, in daytime and nighttime unfortunately the camera's sensitivity makes it useless.  It takes too long to activate to view someone walking up the steps to either of our entrances (we have a 2 camera setup) but yet will send an alert every time a car passes by it's view (which only takes a second, yet a delivery person or mailman walking up our steps does not get triggered?!).  I have tried troubleshooting each camera through the available settings but to no avail.  As far as I can tell the only difference is less false positives (lowest sensitivity) versus more false positives (highest sensitivity).  Troubleshooting has made no difference in trying to see who's actually coming and going to our home.<br/><br/>If you want a camera to see who just rung the doorbell and you'd like to look through the app on your phone before answering this is fine, but if it's for security forget it.
 Do not buy this system if you want to actually view the activity the camera is capturing. It has a terrible design flaw that does not allow you to watch as it is recording. If you get a notification that the camera has detected activity it will give you a “system is busy” message. It will then record a clip based on how long you have it set for. If someone does not leave let’s say your porch it will keep recoding clips. Great in theory however while it’s recording those segments you can’t watch in real time. So, if you are on a 911 call trying to describe someone, you can’t because the system is busy. Granted... it was Easy to set up, it had a low cost point, but I got what I paid for. Unfortunately ...
 Got these last week as a quick way to put up some security cameras before we headed out on vacation.  Extremely simple to set up, picture quality is good,  I like they way you can set the motion sensor timer for recording length.  My one question will be how long will the batteries last but time will tell - as long as it makes it a few months then changing them is a lot less hassle than having  to run wire in my older home that would be next to impossible to install at the locations I put these cameras.
 I’ve had these installed for several weeks so far. I researched a lot of battery operated security cameras before selecting these. They have a new beta feature in which you can select zones where you don’t want to detect motion. That new feature needs some help, but it looks like a promising addition. I like thay they continue to push firmware updates to the cameras.<br/> Set up was easy and only took a couple of minutes. I also like that they send you notifications if they detect too many alerts, letting you know that it will affect battery life.
 Motion sensing is slow to respond. I often get clips of the mail carrier that start after they're already walking away from the door.<br/><br/>The marketing claim of two year battery life is based on extremely low usage. In real life I get about 3-4 weeks from fresh batteries.<br/><br/>The mount is very flimsy. It's held by two plastic pieces that snap together, and after taking it down a couple times to change the batteries, it has become quite loose and feels like it may fall off at any moment.<br/><br/>On the plus side, video quality is decent, and it's nice that they provide free cloud storage.
 From a security stand point I was disappointed as to how easy a crook could just snatch it.  The  mount is made of plastic.  The motion detection is poor.  it only works about 20 feet away, so you have to have your camera close which means greater chance a crook will detect it and take it.  I love Amazon, but I can not understand, if Blink is an Amazon company, why does the Blink Security camera not work with Fire TV, or Fire tablets....very sad.  One last thing, the instruction manual is tiny...you better have some damn good eyesight to read it.  Batteries only lasted 2 months.  I also feel it's not worth the price, should be about 1/2 price.
 I did not realize after 5 feet away from the camera it is useless. My sidewalk is about 20 feet away and the camera does not recognize anything or anyone walking or driving by. The purpose I purchased this item was to see who is leaving their dog mess by our sidewalks and it does not even recognize anything over about 5 feet from garage. I am extremely disappointed with this product and will be sending back for a refund and purchasing something else .
 I have tried to view my "Front Door" camera with the Echo Spot but all it says is that it can't find the "Front Door"  I can view the camera with the Blink app, it shows up linked as a skill in the Alexa app, it shows up as listed as a device in the Alexa app, but refuses to find the camera no matter how I ask.  Amazon Customer service claims I need to contact "Creator of the Skill" Blink (an Amazon Company) and gave me a link to Blink<br/>Support.  I called Blink Support and after being on hold for 30 minutes, they could see that my Blink Camera was working fine (kinda interesting that they are able to access my camera whenever they want) and was unable to explain why it didn't work.  They said I was't the first today with that problem and they would email me with follow up; I haven't even received a confirmation that they opened a ticket about issue.<br/><br/>You would think that for two products that they claim you should buy together that they would work together.
 If you like lots of pics with nothing in them, this is for you! I bought this XT 1 Camera System  (weatherproof for outdoor or indoor use) on sale despite some of the reviews. Blink may work indoors, but this outdoor model is pretty useless. I tested it for several days and there was no consistency in how or why it would record. Most of the time when it did record, there was no one in the picture. And when someone should have been there, they weren't.  I returned it and got my money refunded.
 am adding star. found mount. yes its that small it almost got thrown out. a bit erratic but that could be learning curve or operator error. for the money ( free cloud storage ) a great deal. only major compliant so far is one way audio.<br/> recommend for anyone looking for inexpensive way to monitor exterior of home.
 Very inconsistent in recording.  I am aware of scheduled monitoring and armed switch.  Sometimes it records without reason and frequently at cetain times not able to record what its supposed to be recording.  Fully updated app.  I have a ring doorbell near one cam and the blink misses what the ring doorbell detects.  I will see what blink will have updates to correct these problems.
 The support team has been very responsive but am disappointed that one of my new XT cameras (just started using last week) is already acting up.  A few times the sound turned off (and then turned on again but not sure why).  Another time, it stopped recording for a whole day despite movements in the room (again not sure why but tech support said they did some trouble shooting and it got fixed). Lastly, the screen turned one color (green) which they say is a firmware issue and will be fixed.  The other camera has been awesome. The cameras have very clear images even with the lights turned off.  The sound is good.  The free storage is enough for one day (there is a lot of movement where the cameras are) but I delete them and it's fine. Still a great deal for having NO subscription fee !!
 It's a fun toy. It ended up being a cat monitor unintentionally. It does pick up people walking away but is inconsistent with people walking towards the camera. It also picks up a lot of my neighbors activity's which is unwanted. However for the price and the fact that there is no monthly fee and the fact that it was easy to set up, I will keep it. I do recommend it if you need some monitoring but aren't interested in clear facial recognition.
 For $100 this is a basic entry level camera. I am not sure the picture would actually be use full in actually identifying anyone, as the picture is just so grainy. the range without a wifi booster is maybe 50 feet. Even with a wifi booster  it still has a huge delay in taking pictures and receiving video clips. the camera attaches to the swivel mount via a horribly designed clip and sticky "o-ring". I ended of using some tear proof tape to attach the camera more securely.<br/>The camera for being wire free works. But for it being an Amazon product and it being 2018, I expect a bit more solid design work
 Easy to setup. Play with the settings a bit to adjust sensitivity. Things like the sound of the trash truck on the road would set off my front door camera even though it was out of sight. Do yourself a favor and buy full casings with better mounts for $11 for 2. The included mounts won’t last/junky. Overall, not having to pay a subscription fee like Arlo is incredibly nice and the video quality is superb. Love the fact that the only wire needed for the entire setup is the power cable for the Blink Hub. If you’re stuck between the Arlo and Blink (like I was) choose the Blink.
 The first issue is that every camera has to have contact with a bkink hub. Rediculous since the hubs do not have a reasonable range. Second, the system does not allow individual notifications to be turned off. You can turn off all notifications by turning off the entire app notifications or tuen off each camera individually. I want all cameras running all of the time and notifications to be optional.
 Very easy to use.<br/>I bought the wall unit and camera mounts separately to give me some other options.<br/>They took less than 30 minutes to set up and install and obviously the neighbors kids have noticed them because all of a sudden we don't have any problems with them or their dogs.<br/>Battery life and notifications all seem good so far.<br/>I so wish that you could order/buy an extra two cameras for less than it costs to just buy another whole unit.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R3TFTYQIF5BG6E"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Hh-zae7jS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CLSITsd-S.png"/> Unfortunately, the product may be no use for you if you wanted a security cam demonstrated as below:<br/>- it will detect the motion and start recording right after object goes off the zone, so you will end up with the tail of that object. What’s the use then.<br/>- Sometime it doesn’t detect the motion at all, my brother parks his car at front of it yet when i check the video I don’t see it among others.<br/>- On night mode, even after manipulating the intensity of the IR, you cannot recognize faces out of the brightness.<br/>- The application was crappy, they started to enhance it lately for the past couple of months.<br/><br/>Finally, I’m sharing a video that the camera captured. The guy is walking across the camera it dedicated him and started recording while leaving the frame. Daah!
 I've had this camera for about 10 days. I set it up inside just to test it out. It was easy to setup and get working, but the motion detection is not working consistently. I can stand right in front of the camera waving my hands with no motion triggering. Sometimes, for no obvious reason, the motion detection will work for a few minutes. Currently, I have my camera in a high traffic area, and it has not triggered in about 24 hours.<br/><br/>I have had many IP cams - from Panasonic, D-Link, Foscam, etc. I also have an Amazon Cloud Cam. This camera is easier to set up than all except the Amazon Cloud Cam. I am hoping I can get the motion detection working correctly because otherwise this seems like a great camera.
 Camera worked for less than six months before failing. Customer service wasted my time for 14 days with emails asking me to try various fixes. Then asked me for a series of serial numbers. Then a separate email asking for my shipping address for a replacement camera. Then after two weeks of frustrating, confusing and contradictory messages an email telling me that  they are “aware of my problem and that my existing camera should be fixed in a week”  no explanation as to how this is going to happen, no information as to why they are no longer replacing the defective unit. Useless. Pathetic. I’m done. Keep your garbage camera.
 The quality of the product is good.  My complaint is due to the seller.  I clearly received a used unit but paid full price. The camera was scratched up. The sync module had to be reset due to previous use. The box had to be taped shut due to the contents of the box being in complete disarray.  The box is torn on one side.  The camera and sync module work but I shouldn't pay full price.<br/><br/>A feature I would like is the ability to create a screecher based on camera.  I have several Blink XT cameras and would love to create a schedule for a particular camera inside based on motion detection while another camera is always armed outside with motion detection.
 I've used the white Blink for over a year with no problems.  Now I've added on the outdoor blink, but this one is very unreliable. Some days, it will not record at all.  Some times it stops recording when there is still motion.  Then other times it records every few minutes when there isn't any motion.  I turned off the phone notifications.  I'm going to try relocating the camera to the other side of the driveway but I think that might be worse.
 If you lose internet connection, you have to manually reset the box. This is a problem if you aren't home away on vacation, etc. I'm past my return window, Buy something else if you need good security.
 Recent purchase so far so good. Took the time read the reviews and directions carefully. Lots of complaints about sensitivity setting. Applying some of the knowledge of other reviews  I set up the camera so (targets) have to cut across field of view. Using that technique I  was able to back down the sensitivity to 3 and the  camera works well. Some gaps still noted with capturing first couple of seconds when camera is activated. But for system cost and what I want it to do. I am happy. I will update in a month or so with further review.
 After installing, it worked ok for a couple of months then it would no longer sync with my wi-fi. Just kept blinking "red" and the only help you get when you look online is that "the most common reason is that you entered the wrong wifi password".  So what do you do when you entered the correct password (5 times) and it still won't sync?? DON'T WASTE $200 LIKE I DID.
 Installed on dec 7. Easy to setup and good connection 30’ from base. Nice functionality. Easy to view remotely and nice sensitivity. Saw a person walk in front of house about 20’ from camera. Can’t make out the face but gives a good idea of who it was. I will comment more as I get more experience with it.<br/>The camera is exposed to the elements and raindrops on the camera lens cause it to not activate.<br/>Update feb 1 - dead battery already. Only 2 months on factory provided battery.
 I bought this camera on a whim, not expecting to be happy with the results since I have crummy rural DSL and the specs for this camera say that a 2MB upload speed is required. I have had ZERO issues with this little camera and I honestly can say the live feed and quality are better than either of the other systems I have in my home currently (iSmartAlarm and Wyze cam). I get a notification within 10 seconds of the camera detecting motion, and the clip (I have it set for a 10 second recording time) is viewable within 30 seconds. My only complaint, if I had to make one, is that you cannot select alert areas. This can lead to false alarms since my camera is on the front porch pointing towards the road. I have eliminated most of them by turning down the sensitivity though. The camera isn’t as impressive at night unless you are only looking for alarms in a 25’ radius. I wasn’t looking for long range protection though, and for watching the porch, it is great. In Highly recommend!
 These cameras are great when they work, I purchased 1 then liked it so much I purchased 3 more, all 4 cameras worked fine for the first two weeks then one camera went dead, I checked and the batteries had died, hmm weird batteries last 2 years? so I purchased energizer lithium ion batteries and replaced them, grrrreat!!! back in business, maybe just bad batteries... two weeks later same problem same camera... since then 4 sets of batteries same camera, other three are great, I've been exchanging emails back and forth with someone names HAYLEE at there customer service dept, she or whomever this really is (not from this country due to grammar) just keeps giving me the same run around and will not replace the camera. Amazon was nice enough to credit my account and send me a replacement, still cost me $50.00, if you read other reviews on facebook, amazon, etc. you will see there are quite a few people with this same problem, when you buy, you roll the dice and at $129 for 1 camera, its not worth it.
 Didn't want to believe some reviews regarding these issues till I come to realize it my self. Battery died within two months. I only activated the camera a few nights a week after 10 pm and switched it offline in the morning. The two years battery life is a flat out lie. The base station has to be fairly close to the camera. I the two cameras about 100 feet apart and with the base station right in the middle still it want pick up but both cameras report excellent Wi-Fi signals. Poor product all together.
 2 camera system.<br/>Incredibly easy to set up. I think it took me about 10 minutes. Physical installation was a breeze. Took me longer to look at my house and figure out just where I wanted them, than to actually mount them. Picture quality seems to be very good, though, I haven't had to try to identify anyone yet. Sensitivity settings are my only gripe. Set to a 4...barely triggers, set to a 6...I get every car driving by. That is literally the only aspect -so far- which has bothered me.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R1607HQUN1HDB9"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tKhNpjhXS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713temFWJeS.png"/> I installed my Blink camera at the front door. I love the picture quality, timely notifications and easy installation of this product. See the attached video where the camera caught what looks to be a deer at my doorstep at 4:40 am. I do have a motion light there which is causing the slight glare. I will certainly purchase more of these.
 Just received this item an hour ago, had it up and running in less than ten minutes, and maybe another twenty minutes to mount it in the tree outside my front door. Incredible picture quality, and actually works beautifully with my Echo Spot, as opposed to my previous Amcrest camera. I bought this on faith, hoping for both decent battery life, and the eventual ability to view it on my Fire tablet. The latter feature is not yet available, but as this company is owned by Amazon, one can hope.<br/>If any issues pop up, I'll come back and edit this post.
 It claims 2 years of battery life, more like 2 months. States that you should get 40,000 seconds of video recording for each set of batteries, actually usage is more like 2000 seconds of recording. 11.11 hrs of recording according to amazon but in reality it's 55 minutes. Also the motion sensor zones do not work. To conserve battery life I shut of zones in the motion sensor to reduce false triggers and it still picks up motion in the disabled zones.
 Little disappointed in this camera. It's easy to set up and<br/>I like the battery operation but it does miss many events for whatever reason. Sometimes it gets everything and other times misses people as they come to the door. I have one Zamodo and one Blink on the same area. Neither one gets everything but between them I get most everything. the Zamodo gets many more false triggers from wind and weather.<br/>I like the control options on the Blink much better.
 This is a great video surveillance system. I can't say enough good things about the Blink system. The cameras work great in all types of daylight, even low light. It is easy to program and can be customized to fit anyone's needs. If you can buy a better system, you need too. I bought the five camera outdoor system for $500.00. A small price to pay. You can view your cameras anywhere go with your smartphone. Did I mention you get audio too?  I so happy that I purchased this security system. Best that I've ever seen!
 This was by far the easiest setup I've experienced with security cameras.  I'm using 2 camera's outdoor, have the larger brackets which were very easy to install and get the right angle view attached to the house.  I also like the free video's in the cloud.<br/><br/>What I think needs improved:<br/>1) The range of the coverage (picture)<br/>2) Night vision is very lacking (fuzzy) even with "enhanced" video setting<br/>3) Software to delete the video's - I don't want to have to select each video to delete, let me pick many and have a delete button.<br/>4) Need software from my Mac to view video's (very small on IPhone and from a IPad<br/><br/>I will probably be bringing both of these cameras into the house and looking for a better camera for outdoors
 Very happy with the purchase. Two things that might be an issue.  The supplied mount is a bit wimpy but the camera will fit in a painted electrical box which I have used to mount by the front door. Also might experience some issues with the Blink App on older versions of Android such as KitKat 4.4.2 (notifications not working.) Good support. Found that apparently a Kiwi visits my front door around 4:30 am.  Or some other large flightless bird.
 After three months use, I can highly recommend the Blink Home Camera System as a reliable and easy one to use. Having no wiring makes these a breeze to set up.  The online site works well as do all the adjustments to the cameras, all this is done online through the mobile app.  The color Image Quality is very good (and adjustable to one of three levels of IQ) and the IR night vision works really well in total darkness.  They are a sensible alternative to subscription security systems.  The square shape also makes them less noticeable than the larger tube shaped cameras in other systems.
 Easy install, price is much better than others. But of course the cheaper price is with some limitations. So if you are looking for some peace of mind by having the video security camera then its a good one. For me it works perfectly. Only concern is battery life, till now all is good.
 It is easy to install, works very well. However, there is one aspect for which I have given it 3 stars instead of a 5 star. The time lag for start of recording is much higher than for a wired security system which has electric power supply all the time. In some instances I have had the delivery man going back. So if the Blink camera system team can reduce the time from trigger to start of recording, I would give it a 5 star. I am OK, if the 3 year battery life goes down from 3 to 2 if it would need more batter power.
 The item works as described and video has good quality.  It saved me the work to run a wire around the house.  I purchased it from Immedia Semiconductor LLC  and it was shipped by Amazon.  The seller nicely mailed me two replacement mounting brackets when I found there was a missing screw on the mounting bracket during the installation.<br/><br/>I am still playing around the sensitive of the motion trigger to fit my need.
 Camera set up is extremely easy,  the sync box seems to have good range and the picture quality is great.  Overall the system is good for the initial buy-in price with the cloud storage a perk.  There are two downfalls with the version I have, but if you can get passed these concerns, I would still recommend the system.<br/>1) The mounting bracket  range is limited at best, definitely not 360 range of motion.  But I see Blink has since released a new 360 mounting bracket, that's good.<br/>2) The lithium battery life is FAR FROM 2 years.  Motion frequency is mid-level at around 4-7 detection/day,  motion detection is set at 5, recording set to shutoff when motion stops and i have the audio shut off and still had replace the batteries after only 6 weeks.
 Pros: Easy installation. Free cloud storage. Motion detection works very well. App is easy to use. Long battery life (advertised, no chance to verify yet)<br/><br/>Cons: Easy to take off the camera after mounted, so mount it high. Back cover feels a little flimsy. Video quality is not that good.<br/><br/>Update: Batteries lasted only 2 months with clip length set to 10 seconds<br/><br/>The batteries included with the camera came almost dead, but it still passed the connection and the app showed the battery status OK. However the camera did not work at all. I have to replace the batteries to get it work.. Almost made me returned the product to Amazon.
 I am very satisfied with the lack of cables and the image quality. The motion detection is spotty. Sometimes it will detect motion, sometimes it will not. It seems to have something approaching a 50% success in detecting movement. This camera is mounted outside on my front porch - failure of detection might be related to the outside temperature, I'm not sure. I would like to have the ability to manually trigger an event to store a video to the cloud as if motion had been detected.
 These cameras are small and pack a punch!  The video and still pictures are so clear you'd never think it was 720p.  The system is simple to set up, battery powered-and-completely wireless.  Every camera comes with it's own mount, hardware and AA batteries.  The only item to plug in is the sync module which can control up to 10 cameras.  You can control zones if you add a second module, for example inside &amp; outside from the same app screen.  No switching or logging in and out. The clips are recorded for free in the cloud, no additional fees.  Notifications are sent right to my smart phone within seconds of being triggered.  I'm so glad I tried the Blink XT before spending double on an Arlo Pro2 system.
 I purchased this camera because it was truly wireless.  My application had no option to plug in a power supply so I needed a battery powered camera at a reasonable price.  This camera is designed well and easy to setup.  I am pleased with the video quality and motion alerts.  I was able to control motion triggering with he sensitivity setting.  This avoided false triggers from cars passing  by in the street.  An added feature is the temperature reading.  It would be a nice enhancement if the temp was displayed on the camera thumbnail screen.  Currently it is on the settings screen.
 BUYER BEWARE!<br/>After a significant amount of research I decided this was the best bang for my buck security camera and boy was I wrong. Not long after set up I started having issues with the camera sensing any motion and then sending freeze frames and unplayable video. After numerous attempts to get help with customer service I'm stuck with an unreliable system that works sometimes and just flat lines without notice. I wanted to bad to like this product, but sadly if it's too good to be true then it is. I tried to save money and get a 2-camera system and now I'm stuck since I'm 45 days from purchase and customer service won't refund my product since it's more than 30 days.<br/>BAD PRODUCT, BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, 100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEE MEANS NOTHING.<br/>Don't make the same mistake I did and just buy a Nest camera.
 Shut down unexpectedly on live view, drain batteries quick.  Bought 4 had to send 1 back, now 2 of the 3 i have left something is going on with them.  Looking into sending all back, would not recommend for the price you pay.
 Great camera for the money although I do not have anything comparable to review against. Setup was extremely easy and instructions were simple to follow. Video quality is fairly good for being outdoors, as others have stated the night vision is a little spotty as it is extremely hard to see at night and light will blind the camera out. Also I wish the base station had a little more range on it but all in all I am very pleased with this purchase.
 Blink randomly decided to discontinue SmartThings integration, which is the sole reason I purchased their products as their native app is very limited. I now have to manually arm/disarm when arriving/leaving my home.  SmartThings allowed all this automatically based on geofencing.  Time to look at other cameras.
 Pretty pleased with this little camera. It just watches my front porch &amp; keeps an eye on Amazon packages &amp; such.<br/>I'm running it on the AA batteries... it doesn't capture video all of the time. It notices motion well &amp; then captures a video clip. I have it getting 10 second clips (&amp; pausing for a few seconds before capturing another clip).<br/>It caught some kids ringing my doorbell when I was at work &amp; then running away (hilarious) &amp; I saw a little family of raccoons crossing my porch.<br/>I'm not handy but it was easy to mount (1 wood screw)<br/>You might want to pre-check to make sure you've got decent wifi strength where you're planning to put the camera
 Super easy to install, but the quality of the product is very low. One of the cameras started to show the video in purple after day two. Motion detection is horrible I'd see the last frame of the ups guy walking away from the house. It's hard to see any faces on this thing I could hardly recognize family members. Battery life seems fine but I only had it for two weeks. Overall feels like something you would get from china. I wouldn't pay more than a 100 bucks for this.
 Had no problem getting two cameras set up outdoors as was my goal.  One at the front entrance and one at the back patio/entrance area.  The front door camera works well as it is closest to the WiFi modem.  The back door camera shows a weak signal as it is further from the modem but still functions and reacts to movement.  So far, I am satisfied with my purchase.  This is my first experience with wireless cameras.  Picture quality is good.  Only complaint is that I wish that I could place camera further away in the back yard.  Back yard camera is about 50 feet from the modem.
 Wow. This is the best camera system that I have purchased so far. Easy to set up on your phone and install it on your front or back door/wall. The image quality is decent with audio recording. The only problem I have with this camera is the battery running out so quickly. I use the recommend mode to monitor my home. I have been using this camera in a non-traffic area for 2 months and the battery needs replacement already. I contacted the customer service yesterday and they claimed that the battery might be defective and credited back 15 dollar for new battery replacement. Without the battery issue, this camera is an user-friendly security camera for you to monitor your dogs and home.
 Opened the product to find the sync module dirty to include what appears to be dried grass on the case.<br/>So far I am unimpressed.
 Works good as long as you have good internet and wi-fi.
 If only there was a way for me to get a sound notification from the app while in Silent Mode on my iPhone it would be a five star review.<br/>The absence of this feature means I can’t know in real time at night if there is movement outside (The phone is on Silent during the night). Kind of takes away the whole point of this in my opinion.<br/>You can’t prevent anything during the night because you will only see the alerts in the morning after your cars are long gone
 It's a fantastic device when it works on high sensitivity. I primarily purchased the Blink XT to detect packages being stolen after an Amazon delivery has taken place, since the driver continually fails to give a courteous knock on the door/ring of the doorbell. However,  it recently only triggered video footage during the delivery process from the footage I viewed, but not a 2nd time to capture the thief. As a result, now I'm forced to travel to Best Buy and repurchase this Fitbit Charge 2 for my mom's Mother's Day gift  and wait for a refund from Amazon.
 Numerous alerts from wasps buzzing the camera. Tried to adjust sensitivity, if I set it too low, no motion alert. Also, cannot adjust recording duration from 5 sec to 10 sec. The slider in the App works, shows 10 sec, but recordings are all 5 sec. Little plastic hinge mount supplied is worthless.
 These would be great if you like being notified of movement anywhere from 2 to 15 minutes after the movement occurred.
 I wanted to love these, but I don't because they are as slow as a cold reptile.  We purchased these along side the echo show 2 so that when someone is at the door we could IMMEDIATELY see who was there before opening it.... well if door bell rings, and we shout to alexa to turn on the front door camera, it takes around 10-20 second to load, which is a VERY long time to wait before opening the door.<br/><br/>Was a lot cheaper and faster to just creepily look out the window before deciding whether to open the door. Disappointing due to the absurdly slow speed at which they turn on, and the system constantly being busy.<br/><br/>Other than that, they are good at recording when motion is detected, and the visuals are clear and crisp.
 When these cameras work they are great. My rating on this item is still up in the air at this time. I have had the Blink XT cameras for 3 weeks and have been having a few issues with the live view and thumbnail functions. The company is sending two new cameras to replace these. Hopefully that will fix my issues. I will come back in about a week after I receive the new cameras to give an updated review.
 AMAZING! I wanted something affordable that work pretty good and this was on the money. Easy to setup and install! I have a clear view through the cameras it’s way better than I expected! This was my first purchasing a security system and I’m so happy by how easy everything turned out! The app you use for you blink system is super easy to navigate and you can make adjustments for each camera. How long you want to record when you want “arm” or “disarm” right from your phone. The mounts for the camera weren’t that great, they face only forward, but still get the job done will be purchasing some other mounts but other than that highly recommend this system!!
 Set up was super easy, I had mine running in less than 10 minutes.  If you're looking for real time alerts, this camera won't fit the bill but if you keep the recording time short enough, you can have near real time updates of movement around your home.  I did have a camera go down today and had to do a reset which wasn't difficult but a pain in the butt since I had it mounted out of the way.  Once the reset was done, it was back to working like normal.
 I paid for same day delivery and it was delivered on time same day. The prize I think for such a unit should have been prize less, but still reasonable. Set up I did not time, but I estimate 15 to 20 minutes . Camera work well even do sometime it seem to detect motion slow. The Blink XT is in a low traffic area with sensitive set at 5 seem to work well for me as no animal passing by triggers it. It did not fail to capture any human movement, but as I did stated earlier, sometime detection is slow. Audio is fair replaying clip on my lap-top I had to put the volume all the way up to heart. If you have an area that is difficult to run security cameras in my case the wall was to tick to drill through and no existing hold with wires that you can use and the area do not have a lot of motion or human traffic this is a good good solution.<br/><br/>Con: the mounting is too flimsy and flexibility for setting angles.
 Very simple to install.  You just download the app then sink the device with your network then mount them, that's all.  It comes with live view and motion detection.  Great HD quality in the day and at night. The only drawback is the snap on mount that can be easily taken off. It's so bad that a neighbor's bouncy ball hit it and it fell off. I had to purchase the mounts that you can buy separately.  But overall great product even in the frigid temperatures.
 I received my camera Thursday and had problems right away. I was too tired to fool with it so I quit. I did not get back to it until Saturday and I continued to have problems. Saturday night I got online and did a support ticket. They got back to me in less than 30 minutes. They went through the usual tech things that I had already tried. Then shortly I was up and running! Very happy with camera and their tech support!! Would highly recommend.
 Works good. Make sure you point it away from reoccurring traffic or you will be replacing the batteries every month. Even the high capacity ones. The new feature that blanks out areas in the field of view do not work very well. Check the write up on how it works in the app Q&amp;A’s
 This is the second Blink system we've bought.  The first I bought about 6 months ago and installed on my daughter's house.  This second one I just bought and installed on my house.  I've installed all the cameras outside to monitor cars in the parking areas and doors around the houses.  I've set the cameras for 10 second record with the default 30 second hold to retrigger.  I didn't  have any issues setting up the first system, and the only issue I had with the second system was that I needed to place the Blink module in the middle of the house (as opposed to next to my wi-ri router), so that I could get the range to all the camera's.  Not a big deal.  Just needed to find the electrical outlet to plug it into.<br/>Pro:  Price, image quality, ease of use<br/>Cons: Cannot separate the two systems by phone apps.  I'd like to be able to have my daughter's phone app just to get notifications from her house, yet from my phone app, I would like to get notifications from both systems.  There doesn't appear to be a way to select which Blink systems a particular phone will get notifications from.
 Can't do the setup, 3 calls to the  support and nothing<br/><br/>I tried when I received, and leave it frustrated, tried again and nothing<br/><br/>I tried to return but can't return after 30 days<br/><br/>I bought because in the past was a very good product.
 In other words, the Amazon delivery man has ample time to come to my front porch, put the parcel down and leave the scene, before the Blink XT wakes up from its sleep and starts recording. All I get in my notification video is an empty scene. You would never identify a quick thief at your door with the Blink XT.  I also have a Wyze cam inside pointing at the  front porch thru a window and it always starts recording well before the delivery man reaches my porch. Granted the Wyze cam is hooked up to power. But I feel the Blink XT, even battery limited like it is, needs the wake up way faster than it presently does to be of any real value.
 Bought this for home. They work great. However i wish they offered upgradeable storage options for their cloud service.<br/><br/>I did run into a faulty sync unit on original order after it would only sit on red no matter how long or how many times i reset it. I ended up just buying a new sync and it all works great.
 Nice for cheap security. No way batteries last 2 years. I bought 2 , 1 over my front door and 1 over my garage. Lasted 6 months but no big deal. We camp all summer and it’s piece of mind seeing when the teenage kids get home. Just bought a 3rd camera for my backyard. Will install in spring for now placing near my sump pump so I can live view when at work during heavy rain to make sure no back up. Would recommend.
 After several months of using the Blink XT I’m pleased to share that I’m very satisfied with its functionality and video quality. Set up was easy too.<br/>I set it up by my front door to detect the comings and goings at my home and it does just that: tell me when somebody arrives or when somebody leaves with a notification and a clear continuous video.<br/>Blink has done a great job with sensitivity settings and with ensuring that the critical video of a security camera is clear and continuous.<br/>I’m ordering a second one to monitor my back door.
 I purchased my first one from best buy with the sync box. I really have not had issues with that one. This one even with sensitivity on high 90% of the time you can walk right past it. When I try to live view it always tells me it cant connect. Both units are mounted just about equal distance away from the sync box. I had someone twice try to break into my house which is why I got these. I've had multiple calls into blink. They verify connection is good. I reset the unit multiple times... nothing but a useless hassle.
 You won't regret buying this security camera. It captures motion quickly and the best thing is that it saves it to the cloud (that is until it gets full). But if you need to save a certain action captured by the camera, you can easily email it to store it. I have tried other security cameras before and it has a monthly fee to store it in cloud. I like that Blink stores it for free until it reaches full capacity and then a new video will override the oldest saved video.The night vision is excellent even when it's completely dark.
 I love my Blink cameras. They are easy to set up and notifications to your phone are very fast. The mounts that are included are not very good and you will need something else, especially if used outside. The optional Blink module mount should be part of the package as well because you will need it. Picture quality is good for the price and they do record sound, no talk through but that would be a nice feature in future models.
 We bought a set of the Blink cameras when we moved into an area that was experiencing a string of break-ins. It works so well, we've purchased 2 more for our new place since we moved away from that area. We like that we can select which cameras are on &amp; off, adjust the motion sensitivity, the re-trigger time, &amp; the clip length from our phones. The only thing I don't love is that if you select the live video feed, it doesn't record what's happening.
 We've reviewed many outdoor IP cameras including Ring (which we love the doorbell and wanted a fully integrated system), Arlo and others. The Blink XT has better price, quality and ease of use compared to the rest. We've been using the Blink system for over a year now and we're beyond satisfied with the product.
 It seemed to work fine for the first week. I then realized that even with the sensitivity and range turned up in the settings, people could walk by the front of my house and nothing would record. Even cars could pull up and leave without any recordings or notifications. I don’t want the camera to record most of the activity in front of my house. I was hoping to be able to see ALL ACTIVITY (when anyone/anything was in front of my house.) No sense of security with this security camera. Attempted to contact seller and email provided wasn’t accurate.
 These are awesome. We bought these for my mom for Christmas, and of course part of the present for her is that we set it up. They are so easy to set up! The instructions are easy to follow and there are no wires or complications - you just mount the lightweight cameras by a single screw and you're good to go! The camera feeds directly to your phone, and you get set up motion alerts, or turn them off if you want. So when she's not home, she has the opportunity to get an alert if someone is sneaking around her house, or just pull up one of the cameras if she wants to see what's going on. I also love that you can easily add additional cameras later, including the indoor ones, and view them all from the same place on your phone.

It is easy to setup the whole system. And the night vision quality is wonderful. I can recognize a raccoon trespassing my backyard in a cold winter night. It was on duty under the extreme condition.<br/>However, the software could be improved. It doesn't allow me to download the snapshots and the live videos. And it will good to have timestamp on the captured videos.
 Easy to setup,  great quality. Only thing is,  I highly recommend getting a different set of mounting brackets like the ones that encase the camera.
 Well, 2 to 3 stars...When you have to pull out your extension ladder and climb up to replace batteries every 2 months, you start to not like this product as much!  Plus it only records up to 15 sec video, and you can't use it to see who is there when it is recording.<br/>It's good for when you are away, with good video quality, to see who has been calling or on your property.  I did like the video quality, for the price!
 Worst product. Totally unreliable. Capture quality is good but camera hangs every now and then especially if its raining. Live load feed is terribly slow. Not sure how Amazon  is backing this product.
 Easy install clean video I would prefer a faster reset like a 1-2 second lag  current minimum 5 second u can adjust this in settings  5, 10, 15 seconds.  I like that it’s wireless taking AA batteries  The notifications through the app can be a little random inconsistent.  It’s a basic device that gives the user a snapshot of moment
 Bought 2 cameras for front door and back yard coverage. Easy to install and to synch with home wifi. Be sure to mount on a sturdy location, my first spot in the backyard was too flexible and on windy days it triggered too often based on the camera vibration and ran the battery down prematurely.  The second camera near the front door is doing fine.
 I just received this and installed the cameras.  The system is very easy to set up but I was limited in camera placement by the range of the sync module.  I know that you can buy additional modules but I'm not ready to do that yet.<br/><br/>Picture quality is decent in good lighting but shadow/sun contrasts make the picture unusable; either too dark or completely washed out.<br/><br/>For the cost of this system, you can buy a hardwired system with onsite storage but it requires a much more difficult installation.  If you need serious continual video recording, that's the way to go.<br/><br/>Bottom line, so far, is an easy to set up and use system with obvious limitations.  The motion detection and video capture will probably meet my needs.
 I would like to say first off that so far the cameras have been great. It took some experimenting to figure out how sensitive to set the motion. I got these cameras mainly for my toddlers room to watch him while napping. The additional camera went outside. My complaint and why I did not give 5 stars is that there is not continuous live view. My other camera I had before it broke, I was able to pull up the live view video and leave it up on my iPad. In order to continue viewing live mode with this camera you have to hit continue over and over. So I have had to resort to just the motion alert. But for the most part the cameras have been great. Can not speak yet on the battery life.
 Nothing I enjoy more than going around and around trouble shooting a new gadget's software for the developer. Count on calling CS and waste more of your time over and over again.
 I really hoped this system would work. I never leave bad reviews. I am not new to tech and know that some issues can occur.<br/><br/>I have two sync modules and 4 xt cameras.<br/>Here is the list of problems I’ve had with them since buying them in August and October: green pixelated videos, multiple cameras with the IR that stopped working, not capturing motion at all, false alerts, recording multiple one second video clips (100 clips at a time) (turning off the motion is the only way to get it to stop), recording false alerts after checking the live view, cameras not recording the full length of set time.<br/><br/>After calling and emailing tech support multiple times for multiple reoccurring issues over the past few months, I have decided it’s not worth it anymore. I asked for a refund so that I could purchase a working camera system that I don’t have to constantly troubleshoot to keep working.  They told me that it’s been over 30 days so they will not do that. So they basically will make you jump through hoops until the 30 days are up. Then you can no longer return them.  I really wanted to be able to use these cameras and gave them the benefit of the doubt whenever a problem occurred.  Now it’s too late to return them.
 Bought 1 camera for the front door. Super easy to mount and install. Just an app on ur phone and then connect it to your wi-fi. It gets a great image and super easy to adjust in the settings. The only reason it I didn’t give it 5 stars is the battery life. I’ve had it up about 3 weeks and battery’s are dead already. I adjusted the settings and hopefully it will help, but as I said it is on the front door so it gets a ton of action. Maybe in other locations the battery’s will last longer.
 I’ve had the two camera system for about two weeks now, so far, it’s been great. Excellent night vision, great video quality. I adjusted the sensitivity and it’s worked perfectly so far for me with no issues.  I also have the Arlo cameras, I decided to go with two different systems,  One wired and one wireless on two different recording platforms.  The blink cameras are easy to mount,  easy to set up and easy to use.

Motion detector must  be placed in low traffic area like away from roads with high traffic.
 This is very good product because it allows you to install cameras without wiring. I needs improvement in night vision and badly lacking a speaker for two way communication. Any improvement in  the camera mount will be great help. They should make the mount such a way that it will not be so easy for someone to detach the camera and take it away from other side. There are such mounts for this camera are available but then you have to buy them separately.
 We are very pleased with these cameras. Extremely easy to setup. Good quality picture. Motion detection is efficient, I was worried about a delay but the cameras start recording the moment something enters the frame. I got these on sale during the holidays and am very pleased with the value. I am able to keep an eye on my property for a fraction of the cost of most camera systems. I would definitely buy them again.
 Just bought two more of the XT’s.  For the most part I like the blink.  I have own only one for the previous summer and it was great for alerting for motion, even blowing leaves across the deck!  Would have gotten a five star but now that it is winter the battery went dead only after 1 summer an 4 weeks of winter weather.  The othe thing is that I wish it would have speaker capibilities.  Otherwise it is a great buy!<br/><br/>Adding, after receiving the two additional cameras the first one failed. Called customer service and is sending new one, asked for a deal on another or maybe a extra camera free for inconvenience, was told no absolutely not!<br/><br/>The two that I just bought, one is working fine, another after it picks up motion, it keeps alerting even when noting is there.  So moved location still same thing.  Went from 4 stars to a two star. Stay turned....
 Update 1-30-19<br/>Works at 23 below zero current temp.<br/><br/>Can't program a routine yet but the skills themselves are great. I simply tell Alexa to arm or disarm the cameras etc. Nice especially when you don't want to use your phone to do things. Camera and video quality is great for me. Bought a different mount and the other accessory for the base that plugs in. Also like the fact there is no storage fee. 2 camera system does what I need
 These cameras and the app that controls them are easy enough for a grandma to install. I am super happy with the video and still photo's of my front and back door. The hardest part was waiting for my drill to charge so I could use it to start the screw hole and then screw it into the house. The camera out back has gone through sleet, snow and torrential rain and wind. No problems at all. Would recommend to everyone.
 Just remember, they cant be placed too far from wireless router or they dont work. Maybe 50 yards max if that
 Very disappointed in this camera.  I have had it since October and have had to replace batteries about twice a month.  The detection is hard to set as the sensitivity goes from capturing a leaf across the street to walking past it before the camera comes on and capturing nothing on video.
 Good camera, super easy to set up and is great quality. But why did the supposed MIT engineers that designed it not think that it would be important for the camera to swivel from side to side if necesary it makes it very hard to position for maximum coverage. Maybe they want you to buy multiple so they did that on purpose so you’d buy more than one!
 Super easy to install (I have a very bad back). It took me about 10 minutes per camera.<br/>They sync to the module which is synced to the WiFi seamlessly. So even if you aren’t a tech guru, this won’t be a headache.<br/>As a single mom, this gives me major piece of mind. I love the option for alerts and clips it records when motion is detected.<br/>Also it’s neat that you can highlight which part of the grid in your camera frame to get notifications for movement so that you aren’t alerted every time a bird flies by.
 I was looking for a small camera to show me my front door entrance (outside).  The peephole in the door was not adequate.  I was lucky and able to purchase a deal that included two cameras so I was able to put one at my front door as well as in my courtyard.  It would have been nice to have a constant live view but that is not the case with these and I've grown to like what they do.  When they detect motion the camera records a very short clip which then notifies you on your phone there's been activity on one of the camera which you then can watch the video to see what it was.  I'm very pleased with this product and impressed with the quality.
 I’ve had mine set up for a week, it’s incredible how simple it is to use. So far I’ve had mostly good connectivity. I’m giving this product 4 out of 5 stars because it just lacks a few feature that I wish it had, such has two way audio, live recording, indicidual Camera scheduling, and better image quality. It would be really nice if Blink would release a button that you could place near your door that would arm and disarm your system without having to open the app. However, for the price point, no subscription service required, and ease of use it seems really terrrific so far. I hope the batteries will last as long as they say.
 If is could give zero stars I would.  The system worked fine for the 1st couple of months.  Then suddenly nothing.  No camera triggers at all.  Customer support does NOT exist.  I strongly encourage everyone to go spend your $400.00 plus dollars (if you have 4 cameras like us) on a better quality product from a company that actually cares about their customers.  Absolute waste of money and time.
 Recordings aren’t consistent. Settings for the cameras are not calibrated correctly. I use these for extra security added to my other camera system. The IR records from things blowing in the wind. I set up the cameras to stop recording when motion stops but it stops recording while people are standing in front of the camera. I had to change the settings so that it records for a set time due to the fact that this camera system is a piece of junk. Not worth the money!!!! There’s a lot of better cameras out there for a better price. Very disappointed in wasting hundreds of dollars on crappy cameras that don’t work right.
 Low battery alert came on after one month, with provided batteries. There is a significant delay from the time the camera is triggered and you’re notified on the app. The alerts on the app do not load quickly. I placed my camera under my carport and I’ve made it out of my car and inside and sat down before I ever got an alert. I definitely expected top of the line performance since this is an amazon product; this is a dud for sure.
 Have had this for about a week. I see what people mean about the few second delay, but then again, this isn’t a $1,000 system. Great for the value. We got a 2 pack. One for front and one for back. Had to contact Blink twice about a question and they follow up by the next day if not sooner. My WiFi modem was too far away from camera which I knew bc it’s in the basement. They wrote me back and sent me details about my WiFi bars. Like the times it was showing low etc. very helpful customer service and so far, cameras r great. Mount is not as strong as I would think clipping the camera on it, but it works at stays in place.
 Had this camera since around December 2018. I'm quite unsatisfied with the way it operates. It basically only works half to time. Some days it goes without recording an motion activated footage at all. Other times it records 10 clips in just a few minutes. Tried adjusting the settings many times but still having the same issues. I'd recommend spending a bit more and getting something better.
 Not impressed. I have a brand new WiFi router and gig fiber optic. I set this device about 40 feet from my router outside the house and could not get signal. The quality is also super poor. When I did move it closer I would walk in front of the camera and it wouldn’t trigger anything. Not sure where all the five star reviews come from but this is a terrible device. Would recommend going with a wired camera like Kuna
 I was disappointed at first  because the clip that was recorded often didn't capture what triggered the lense... if you go in your setting you can lengthen the time, also the retriggering and the sensitivity as well. One thing which would be great to have is the option to adjust how wide you want it....narrow to wide angle
 I've had these up and running since late March. No issues at all..captures all kinds of critters at night. Sometimes moths will give me false alarms at night but it never bothers me. If I wake up I just check the video, see what it was and go back to sleep.<br/>I have not had a battery issues and I record for 20 sec every occurrence instead of the 5 sec the company recommends. Buy these...get one more then you think you need.<br/><br/>Update: I ended up changing the batteries after 10 months. Also, it was well below zero degrees and the units still worked. I verified it at -20 below Fahrenheit.
 Easy to install and setup. I can view clips on my iPhone with the Blink app. The app warns me that the camera battery won't last 2 years (as originally claimed in the marketing materials) because of how much motion it detects. It suggests deactivating the camera on a schedule, but if I did that, it wouldn't capture what I need it to capture. I'll be satisfied with changing the battery more often, as it's in a location where running a wire is not feasible.  The fact that it doesn't need any wires (because it uses battery and Wi-Fi) is why I selected this camera in the first place.
 Just purchased this item a week or so ago and still trying to keep it on line.  Have to always reconnect and only stays active for a very short time.  Did get nice pictures for the few days it worked.  Tried everything:  moved the sync module to different places.  Put new batteries in camera.  Unplugged motem, unplugged sync module and still keeps crashing.  Tried going on line for help but want to charge fee so I hung up.  Very frustrating and I am not happy with product.
 These cameras were really easy to set up and use. The clarity is acceptable. I don’t use them for security, but more for monitoring my elderly mother. For that it’s petfect. I would only echo that the mounting is a bit on the cheap side.
 We bought this because my girlfriend had a stalker prowling around her workplace. She rents an office space in a business park. We asked the business park if they had their own camera system after she realized she was being stalked and they said no. They refused to accomodate her by installing cameras. Anyways we bought one of these for her office door which faces the common area shared by all renters. The stalker was caught when he triggered the blink camera by walking past her office door. The creep is now in jail and society is much safer. Thank you Blink! And to all you stalkers out there, think twice... It's 2019... You're on camera.
 I bought a 2 camera system and a 3 camera system for my two homes.  I like the ease of setting up the cameras.  They seems to catch the motion very well.<br/><br/>The mount that it comes with is only good for indoors..  I bought the outdoor case mount which works well.<br/><br/>I also closed off the blue light switch on the inside of the camera.  I put a piece of black electrical tape over the red infra red light that comes on at night when motion is detected.  I do not want to draw attention to the camera when we have guests or unexpected visitors.<br/><br/>One thing that I would like to see is a way to not get notifications on certain cameras.  I would still like it to record, but don't need to be notified all the time especially if I am just trying to keep track of my pets.<br/><br/>Also I would like to have the ability to view, without recording, for a longer period of time without having to press the "continue" button.<br/><br/>On the whole, the quality of the video is excellent and it does what I need it to do.
 I have had 3 of the XT’s for 10 months now. First of all they are very convenient, compact, easy to set up and are very good quality video. The major problem with these cameras are False Alerts! If your camera is looking down on your deck or yard and the wind is blowing trees that are casting shadows that are moving, that camera will go nuts. If there is a lot of wind noise the camera will keep triggering. Just like another reviewer said , if you set the sensitivity low it will pick up the back of the delivery mans head as he is leaving your porch. So you can only imagine what this does to the battery life. I got 8 months off the first set. While I have been writing this review, I have gotten 5 alerts because the wind is blowing outside. Very very annoying!
 After receiving the cameras I shortly installed them into the best locations I could find to offer maximum coverage.<br/>For the first few days they have worked perfectly. The one on my front porch is still going strong! The one I have installed in the back yard worked well for the first couple of days but it slowly went downhill. It’s been raining almost nonstop and an almost fog (condensation) has appeared on the camera. I spent about 15 minutes trying to wipe the lens, but the result was the same. The condensation appears to be inside the plastic covering the lens. I have included an attached image of what I can see from the app. I really like the cameras but it can’t sense motion and alert me if it’s unable to see anything at all. I wanted to reach out before I left a review on amazon because I’m hoping this is just a fluke in construction that can be easily remedied.<br/><br/>3 stars because the system works great for my front porch, but I am slightly disappointed about the other one.
 I have to say that at first I thought this product was very sleek in design and could be really good and satisfying my needs as a consumer. However, this premium product has been giving lots of problems. Firstly, the storage capacity for a two camera system gets used up very fast even with normal use. Secondly, one of the cameras in the system keeps shutting off and not come online unless I reopen the housing and readjustING the batteries. I am really unhappy with this purchase. I won't recommend this product
 I love this cameras, they work really good for what I need them.  I would like a new system from blink like a two way camera system for the front door and a siren that can be activated by the push of a button.  I also would like an option where I can live view on demand and it be recorded at the same time and not depend on the motion sensor to record the incident.  With this said, I can only give a 4 star rating but I have 6 cameras in total and like the new software updates they have come up with lately.
 These are nice cameras, I am surprised how mobile they are. The only issue I have with them is the wall mount they come with. You are better off getting the 3rd party mounts. The picture quality is outstanding and Alexa integration works pretty well but still more of a showing off feature. The application works well, I have DSL with 2Mbps upstream and I have no issues streaming these cameras.<br/><br/>Few things to note:<br/>1. Not enough of a price difference between the inside &amp; the outdoor cameras. You are better off getting all XT cameras<br/>2. The wall mount isn't the best quality
 I’m not very pleased with these cameras at all. Poor quality, all the way around. The only thing that is nice about these (why I bought them in the first place) is that the are truly wireless. No power cable. No internet cable. That’s why it gets two stars instead of one.<br/>Video quality is less than I hoped and camera doesn’t pick up much of anything. I had the Nest outdoor camera previous to this product, which I suppose is what I’m comparing this to. Only reason I switched was mine got intentionally damaged by someone I knew and I wanted wireless.<br/>The camera setup isn’t as easy as the Nest. The mounting system (which I review separately and gave one star) is absolutely the worst piece of equipment by far. It is not sturdy and a big wind could easily (and had already done so) knocked the camera off the mount.<br/>Night vision doesn’t work very well. Get anywhere near the camera (close enough to make out a face) and the camera white washes the picutre of whoever is standing in front of it.<br/>Honestly, until they improve the above mentioned, I’m going to try to get my money back. I don’t feel secure. Which is the whole point. I miss my Next cam.
 I had the Blink XT camera installed, setup and online within 10 minutes - install was a breeze.  Other than the 5-8 second delay before the app alerts, I like it so far.  You also need to verify that your camera has a decent signal to both your wireless network and its Sync module for it to work properly - the connectivity is shown in the app settings.<br/><br/>No monthly storage fees was the deciding factor for going with this unit over some of the others available on Amazon including the Ring.  I'm most likely going to add two additional cameras to this setup.
 Works great. Easy to use and easy to set up. Able to adjust the sensitivity and comes with a mounting bracket to place where you want. Recording time is adjustable. Notifications are sent to your phone with a slight delay of roughly 5 seconds. Alexa has not yet made it available to notify you when there is a motion, but you can turn on and off the system with alexa. Night vision works great. Picture quality is great. Able to take still images or watch a live feed (2-3 second delay). Fully adjustable automatic arming time or simple to use self arm/disarm.  Have not had it long enough to have a dead battery yet. I recommend spending the few extra bucks and getting the blink xt. works the same just with more options, like night vision and weather proof.
 Easy to install!!! Fast. Picture quality is great. The live view is a little slow, I almost want to say, a little too late. Other than that, these are great! The best ones so far. I have 4!!!!! I live in the country and I have one by the gate (100 ft), driveway, back patio and front door.<br/>When you are home you need to turn them off otherwise can drive you nuts!<br/>Battery life is greater when configuring the settings to different recording time.
 I have two outside (front porch, back porch) and two inside (garage and sump pump). They work great. Over two years on the same batteries. They alert me when my mail is delivered, when my garage door opens and I can check on my sump pump when I'm away during rain storms. They do catch the occasional squirrel and cat walking around, but I probably have them set at too high a sensitivity.
 I have three other cameras around the house from other manufacturers, and all three can pan rooms for a bigger picture of what's happening at any given time. Even the Yi camera, with its similar range, can pan a bit. Not so with Blink.  At the price of these Blink cameras, I am astonished that they are rigid and cannot pan even a few feet from one side to another. These must be placed absolutely perfectly to get the most picture from the small camera radius.  I am truly disappointed in this camera and will not consider buying another.
 I really wanted to like this system.  Easy to set up and get going.  However as a security system where I can view the feed from my phone it is almost useless.  From my iPhone 8, 90%+ of the time I want to see a live view, I get “live view failed”.  Cloud recording is nice, but you have to have WiFi to view the live feed.
 The camera is exactly what I wanted but the two year batteries last 3 months
 Took a star off for stability. I've had to reset my modem a few times when the camera won't arm but not a deal breaker. I like that it's wireless. The mounting system could be more sturdy, seems like it could break pretty easily. However, it's weathered several storms and stayed pretty stable. For the price, it's great! I never realized how much traffic goes thru my neighborhood while I'm at work! I bought it more for a deterrent as we've had several issues over the summer with petty crime.
 I do like this product the camera picture is very clear both at night and day  I have a bit of a delay time not too bad but sometimes is annoying.  I feel the set up instructions and the how to use instructions could be a little clearer.  I played around with and watched youtube videos  and got what I needed  I will no longer have to the uneasy feeling of opening the door to someone I do not know
 They work fine. Only problem I see is that even on low the night vision will wash out facial features.(reaon for 4 stars) Need to mount far enough away and still be able to zoom in. There is no way these have a two year battery life unless they get triggered once a month. Coworker uses his and says he gets six months which is not a deal breaker. I plan on putting usb power on these in the future. Will update.
 Love this little camera, I work outta town. It gives me a piece of mind for safety, while I'm away. You have to figure out your settings. You can drain battery real fast if indoor if kids or dogs back in forth all day. Still works but I don't believe you will get 2 years as advised.
 The motion detection only works when it "feels like it". I ended up having to buy an Arlo now because I could come and go a hundred times right in front of this thing and the motion detection is unaffected unless I physically pick it up and move it. And that's on the most sensitive setting! Ridiculous waste of money. Sigh.
 FYI... you cannot set this up without an iOS mobile device, software version 10 or higher or<br/>An Android mobile device, running software version 5.0 (Lollipop) or higher or<br/>A Fire OS mobile device, running software version 5.0 or higher.<br/>THEY HAVE NO APP FOR YOUR PC or LAPTOP!<br/> I will come back and give the cameras a reveiw after I go out and spend $800 on a new smartphone so I can set this up (my iPhone 4S is not iOS 10 or higher)
 I bought my Blink cameras to supplement my monitored alarm system and am very impressed with the quality of the video. So far I am finding the audio a bit noisy but I have not had the cameras up long and have not finished "tweaking" my settings. The cameras are well made, easy to install even for us "not so young" people. My "instant on" monitoring isn't quite that fast... yet... but I am in hopes of that being more a problem with my network than with the cameras. Yes, I will be adding more to cover more of my property. They are a good, solid product.
 We had ADT for over 15 years so I am very please with this alternative.  Easy to operate, easy to install and great video quality.  My only complaint is the range of the Wifi and a couple of the camera's.  Two of them out of five have occasional connection problems.  I'm not sure if it's a wifi issue or a Blink issue.  Either way, I'm happy overall and I don't miss the monthly bill from ADT.
 I hooked it up today. Fairly easy &amp; straightforward installation. I tested it out (day &amp; nighttime) inside my room, and it works like a charm. I armed the camera through the app and then went inside my room pretending to steal. After about 30 seconds to a 1 minute of entering the room, I received a notification on my phone along with a video clip of 30 seconds (30 seconds because that was the amount of time I chose in the settings) of me trying to steal. It has excellent audio and the infrared night vision is outstanding.<br/><br/>I think that people are having trouble because, perhaps, the Sync module is too far away from the router.<br/><br/>The only concern that I have is what if the WiFi is disabled. I won't receive notifications but will it still record?
 I got it on a discount for around $78 with a hub. For that price its amazing. Very easy to setup the hub, Battery life is the most impressive part, Its light and easy to mount. You have to find the right sensitivity setting though, if not it will keep sending false alerts. Once you have that, its very accurate and useful. The activity zones are a big plus. The only problem is that sometimes the clips start when a person is walking away from the camera and it misses out on a few vital seconds of footage. The other problem is the night vision, the subject is whitewashed when close to the camera.
 The setup is easy and the video is clear. The sensitivity has issues. It will trigger from small reflections off windows and other solid objects. It will not pick up the movement of a person until they are about 10 feet away even though it will occasionally set off vehicles over 30+ feet away.
 Do your research but this setup is very good. I purchased the two camera setup with the outdoor BT cameras. I have a remote vacation home and wanted to be able to monitor it as well as receive motion alerts. I placed 1 camera on the lake side of the house and one on the road side. Both work great and with the new activity zones I have been able to minimize the false alerts caused by wind and bush movements.  Setup was easy and I'm very happy with this solution.
 I tried to solve all the issues we faced with blink support. While some issues could be solved some major issues couldn’t be solved like delayed video start and real time video transmission. In my opinion a video security system that needs 5-7 sec. to start up and showing video 4-8 sec. delayed is not a true security. If those two issues are solved the blink system would make a superb security system for a fair price.
 The 2 year battery lasted for 2 days as I have too much activity in my cameras view, yes I live in a city.<br/>The free lifetime storage is limited to about 2 hours, having 5 cameras running I can go back to about a half an hour of recordings.
 Had high hopes with all the good reviews. Unfortunately its been problematic from the get go. 1 camera's IR doesnt work and it stopped working overnight. Cant get it to sync back up with my Wi-Fi or phone. Hasnt been 24 hrs yet so I'm just going to return it if after calling their helpdesk doesnt help.
 Positive:  Very easy setup and very good quality video.  Negative:  I have trouble with one camera not working properly.  (No night illumination - strictly black)  I've called and they updated it and it began working again, but is failing again.  (Ive had this system for two weeks)  Batteries are showing "failure" after two weeks and very little triggered activity.  That might be due to the frigid temps....currently 30 below and a windchill of 60 below.  Not sure if they will rebound after it warms up or if they just fail in prolonged temps this low.  I'm hoping to have the one camera warranted since it seems to be a recurring issue.
 Useless camera ever. Records motion whenever she wants. Take pictures whenever she wants. Did everything the web page recommended to fix the problem and nothing. I have high speed internet, so that was not the problem. Just bad quality camera.
 Outstanding camera system.  Easy setup.  Connected right away through Wifi.  XT working well at temp of - 16!  Sharp live video.  Motion detection works and transmits notice to my Android phone flawlessly.  I have tried many systems and this Blink XT is.grat.  Just showed it to two neighbors at a.gathering last night and they will be ordering.  Only.wish.Amazon would give a bigger discount on additional.cameras.
 This a pretty awesome camera. The app is used is a bit sluggish but that’s not the cameras fault. The picture is pretty darn clear with night vision. The size is great as it looked a lot bigger in the description and was hoping it wasn’t an eye sore. On top of it all, it saves my videos with no subscription being required. Of course you have a total overall size restriction, but you can set different days to keep the video and then delete after a period of time.  My only complaint is that they should redesign the mounting bracket. It’s a bit tricky, but it does work.  Other than that, I would definitely recommend this camera.
 Easy set-up.  Not very good for night time.  There is a glare making the face extremely hard to see at night.  Even turning down the sensitivity, this camera still picks up random things from the wind.  On the main page, there is a section stating "Alexa devices compatible with this item:" and included Amazon fire stick. THIS DEVICE DOES NOT WORK WITH THE FIRE STICK!  Hopefully they would add on this feature and also the capabilities to connect with smartthings.
 This was a good idea at the time because we did not have power for a door bell.  The 2 year battery life is only if you leave it at recording 5 second videos.  The motion detection didn't always work right.  I had someone drop off a package and all I saw was their back as they left, didn't see them drop it off.  The batteries died after 3 months with 30 second videos.  I recharged the batteries but 1 battery dies almost instantly after a day or so.  If possible I would suggest getting a hard wired door bell camera.
 I have two of these cameras, one for the front porch and one for the back.<br/><br/>I've had to turn down the sensitivity because the batteries will die quickly. It also picks up cars that drive past even though I have the motion areas greyed out.<br/><br/>So far they've survived the Midwest snow storm and temperatures around 4 degrees.<br/><br/>The picture and sound quality is good. I do recommend them.
 Edit: Nov 18. On a regular basis, the camera does not work for hours on end. I get the error codes of "live view failed" and "something unexpectedly went wrong". Customer service is terrible, havent actually tried to solve the issues, just repeatedly send me a link for troubleshooting tips. I had intentions of purchasing 5 add on cameras, but now will need to find a new surveillance camera company to buy. Total junk, sync module randomly went out, was issued a 24hr replacement 2 days ago and still havent received anything. Customer service hung up on me 3 times before I could talk to a manager that was reasonable, and that took me an hour
 Seems to work great for short periods of time and then had some issues. The first time the camera started rapidly taking video and wouldn't stop, so they sent me a replacement. That was about a month ago, and I've had to put batteries in the new one twice. I know a bunch of people that have them and say they work great, so maybe I got two duds in a row?
 I like ‘em BUT they really don’t respond well as I would like. I set the cameras to ON and leave my house but then I realized I forgot my car key on the night sand...so I open my door, enter my room &amp; grab my key but to my surprise, the camera doesn’t detect me what so ever. That incident was on my mind all day while I was at work. When I got home, I decided to test to see if I was in error or what.  But to my disappointment, the camera sensitivity is not what I would like or expect. It seems that the camera has to be very close to the activity or the motion has to be active for at least 5~10 seconds for the camera to respond.
 I bought this after having an Amazon package stolen from in front of my door. I really like having this camera. I’m able to see when packages are delivered and if someone were to steal another one I’ll have them on camera. I’m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 for the fact the mounting bracket it comes with is utter crap. If you’re going to mount this outdoors, definitely get you a swivel mount that is more durable.
 Bought 5 cameras, one was defective and sent back, and now after three weeks another one is. It working and will be returned. Also, have difficulty with other cameras getting them to take “thumbnails” and live video. Very disappointed that a company owned by Amazon produces such a poor product, expected more from them.
 I had been looking into security cameras for my home but was not sold on any of them. I bought the Blink XT Home Security Camera System after a coworker showed me the app and how crystal clear the pictures were of her house. I have have a non verbal 6 year old that has been known to leave the house on her own. I bought the 5 pack and placed a camera in the backyard, front yard, main part of the house, the basement, and her room. I now have a sense of security knowing what is going on at all times and that she is safe. I have set the front and backyard and the basement to alert me when there is motion. The others I can check as I like. They also tell you the temperature and have IR illumination. Set up is easy, the app is user friendly, and the pictures are amazing and I have had no wi-fi issues like I encountered with my camera doorbell. There is also no yearly fee for your recordings like the other guys charge. Love it!
 Video quality during day is okay.  Not good enough to catch details.  Night is crisp but everything glows white even on lowest ir setting.  Camera trigger speed is slow and videos don’t start recording until too late.  Alarms don’t reach phone until it is way too late.  Returning and buying anything else.
 I wanted to take a few months to use the product before making a review and I really am so impressed. If you research how to use the product and install it in a good area with good connection ( i know thats a given but some of the negative review are from people who dont even follow instructions). The alerts for the recordings and customization of such is so great! We have felt so much better with this in the house and love having great night views as well! We are purchasing another camera tonight!
 This product is terrible! It’s bulky, inconvenient shape, no option of adhering to surface besides mounting it with screw, makes a loud clicking noise whenever it takes video or photo. The indoor camera I also purchased, won’t even let me activate it because it says it’s an invalid number.  I’ve had it for 2 weeks and the batteries say they need replaced and just recently this morning, started making loud, non-stop rapid clicking noise. That does not really help when it’s meant to be a “hidden camera”.  Had to take the battery out for the clicking to stop. Always says “camera is busy”, does not record when there actually is motion but records when there is no motion at all. The obnoxious lights are also a dead giveaway. If you’re looking for a “Hey! I’m right here!” camera, this is a good choice. If you’re looking for an actual hidden, discreet camera, I’d keep searching. That’s what I’ll be doing.
 I ordered this camera twice, on the first one, it did not want to connect to my phone, and could not configure it and connect to the base and returned it and ordered another one since it was an Amazon brand, And after receiving the second one, it did connect to the phone but did not connect to my router. So returned again and never ordered again, received defective items twice. Needs better quality control.
 Love my Blink cameras,  but after adding my first outdoor camera, I have discovered a problem. I want the outdoor cameras on all the time, but to do that, all of the cameras, both indoors and out, must be on at the same time. I guess I need to add another sync module. I looked on their forums, and this seems to be a common complaint,  but it doesn’t appear that they plan on doing anything about it. They are doing some cool things at Blink, but this issue doesn't seem to be getting any attention.
 I waited weeks to order these cameras. Finally, black friday rolled around and the price dropped down substantially. Just a few days later and the price is now even lower AND you get a free Amazon Echo Dot with your order? Emailed Amazon customer service about seeing if I could take advantage of either offer (partial refund or receive the free Dot) and was told I would have to return the cameras and repurchase them :( Given that they are already mounted, I'm not going to waste my time.<br/><br/>In regards to the camera themselves, the setup was extremely straightforward and easy to integrate with IFTTT functionality. Once the sensitivity was adjusted, the system has worked well even with my dog running around. Moreover, they just released the Beta for specific area detection which is a nice touch. I will note, however, that the mounts that come with the cameras are extremely cheap and don't have much flexibility for making adjustments.
 Please improve the notifications. There should be the ability to change the alert notifications to a different sound and also control the volume of the alert to distinguish it from others on a phone.<br/><br/>Also, there is a signal loss way too often. Either it says it's busy or needs time to reconnect. Insufficient. There is way too much lag time between the motion and the alert.
 $120 of crap, the camera does not record anything ever, also if you want to view live footage on smartphone the live picture lasts about 10 sec and then you have to start process over.<br/>Do not buy
 Super happy with blink XT camera. Tried ring door bell but was terrible with the WiFi connection even with internet extender. I researched many outdoor cameras - Blink XT definitely exceeded my expectations, no extender required, installation hardly took 5 minutes. No lag what’s so ever - sends alerts instantly.  Video clips are high definition, crystal clear and uploaded to cloud seamlessly and importantly, easily accessible through super friendly app. Just love it!  Only complaints a) mounting hardware was useless - had to buy the one from hardware store b) little tricky to maneuver the camera(be careful, sometimes camera detaches from the mounting base) c) wish it had 2 way audio
 Easy to install and great potential but it’s only been about one month and the batteries on one camera needs to be replaced. There is no email or text notification when that happens (maybe there is a push notification that you can easily miss), so you have to always be checking it, which is a nuisance. The cameras work ok though sometimes they miss. Lastly, they don’t have a lot of storage capacity for the videos. Would be nice to have two weeks worth.
 I’m giving this camera 3 stars because it works great with the batteries but I made the mistake of getting cables afterwards.. well the cables worked fine untill it gets cold outside and when the night vision is needed. In September the  exterior usb mini cables  worked fine during the day or night but as October arrived and weather got cooler at night and the night vision was needed I had issues ... during the day if it was cold out they were fine ... only when when it was cold out and night vision was needed ... so I since returned the cables and using batteries again all cameras are working fine now.

I got this camera because it does motion sensing and audio. Put it on the fence post. I've been getting notifications throughout the day, mostly because it got windy. Was able to hear someone's rooster somewhere in the distance this morning, so the audio seems pretty decent. Got a notification right before leaving work for the day and jumped on to check the clip. My dog had found the camera and I got to watch her take it from the fence and off into the yard. Several more clips between then and the hour it took me to get home showed her further investigating and nibbling. I also checked in periodically to make sure the camera was still alive. It survived my ride home and is still working fine, although the mic may have some dust in it as it seems a bit choppy. It's definitely not as pretty as when I pulled it out of the box yesterday, but overall, I'm happy with the product so far. I plan to add several more to this network since I have a large yard to watch.
 The Camera only turns  on when movement happens and if there is constant movement the camera cuts off, eats up storage and also kills the battery.<br/><br/>One of my cameras is constantly saying out of battery when I've replaced it with fresh new batteries for the 3rd time.<br/><br/>We wanted to use this to monitor our baby but since our baby always moves the video is only partially useful since the video cuts off after a few seconds and we will miss some of our baby's activities.<br/><br/>This is only useful when there's limited activity.  It's mostly useful for our front door when the activity is minimal and it turns on to catch any intruder.
 Works well, good picture. I haven’t decided where I want to keep it long term yet so I just have it sitting on a table right now inside. The table reflects some light at night which effects the quality of the picture quite a bit unless all the lights are off. Very happy so far. My only complaints are if your WiFi goes down for any reason it hasn’t been automatically re-connecting. I have to go in and set up like to a new WiFi address which is aggravating and leaves some concern if the power glitches. Also sometimes when I try to pull it up if I close it out and try to open it back up right away it says “camera busy” and I have to wait a couple minutes before it will let me open live view back up. Does real well with motion dectection though, I haven’t had any issues with false motion alarms in the month I’ve been using it. Great camera over all and I love the free cloud storage
 Accurate description.  Good price.  Fast shipping. Product is of extremely good quality and super easy to set up. I would have given it 6 more or more points if possible. The reason for the 4 star is that the attachment between the mount and the camera is not good and with a little pressure the camera can come off. But still highly recommend as it is very cost effective for DIY project.
 Disappointing, 2 camera’s<br/> I continue to get “ unable to play this clip at this time” messages “ Your  cam2 camera is having upload issues”. Camera 2 is outside no building covering, it doesn’t work in the rain completely shuts down ! Camera 1 is under shelter but sometimes also says unable to play clop. And wouldn’t you know it, my return window is closed.
 So far everything is great! Easy to set up and install. This is affordable and a great starter to a home security system. It is basically an additional security I have to just the basic alarm and has been good for me to see who may be at either entrance. Notifications come through the app and easy to navigate and check feed. Has cloud storage w out fee and just requires deletion of footage as you run out.
 Everything about this camera is great except for one thing... and this is a DEAL BREAKER. The shutter is very loud! So when I walk into my kitchen at night, I can hear the shutter clicking open and closed multiple times. I hate this, but I cant even image how creeped out a guest would be if they heard the camera clicking away as they walked around. Definitely a deal breaker for me since I want these cameras out of sight and out of mind.
 I honestly wasn't expecting much, but these work really well. First set of batteries is still going strong after about 4 months. Range is good - I get full signal from the camera at a distance of 20 feet, through a brick wall. The motion sensor has a wider field of view than the camera, so the camera sometimes activates and you don't see anything on the video. Can't wait for the doorbell camera to come out. The iOS app works very well.
 This is a godsend if you live in the north and have pumps and other equipment in danger of freezing in places not easily accessible in below zero temps. It sets up easily and although the videos are motion activated you can take a photo to check for leaks or to make sure heat lamps are working etc. Because they don't require wiring it is easy to move them to any space you need to keep an eye on.
 Inside this worked great. Outside at night the quailty is bad. I can't even make out faces.<br/>And there is a lag. The camera goes on and all I see is a person walking at the very end of the camera view.  The camera triggers late at night.<br/>Good concept. Good app. Good during day 90% of the time.<br/>The unit is very close to my network hub as well. My ring is much further away and I dont have as many issues.
 Very easy to set up and good product.  Only reason I took a star off is (i) that there is still some functionality that other cheaper products have that the Blink XT system does not have yet (e.g. ability to identify zones that are excluded from motion sensor, ability to back-up video directly to hard drive, etc.) and (ii) when you request a live camera feed the relevant camera tends to detect motion and record multiple times after the video is obtained even though there is not motion captured in the clips.
 I am happy with this system so far except for the mounting system. To me it is definitely the weak part of the system and definitely needs to be improved. Mounts need to be much stronger and sturdier. These cameras are heavy and the mounts are just not up to handling the weight of the cameras.  If the mounts were better I would give the system a 4 or 5 rating, probably a 4.
 Blink claims that the batteries can last up to one year but my batteries on my outdoor camera last about 5 weeks using high quality lithium ion batteries as recommended by the manufacturer. This is ridiculous.  The camera is not being set off constantly so there is no reason for this to happen.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this product. False advertising.
 Product was bought with the intent to use with SmartThings. Now that it doesn't work with it, I can no longer suggest for others to buy this product.
 So this is the first security camera I bought ever. Being military I move houses a lot and this is probably the best product for my lifestyle since there is no drilling or wiring through the house required. Completely wireless and battery operated. It takes 2 AA for each camera so even if the batteries don’t last the 2 years, they’re easily replaceable. The camera is super sensitive depending on the sensitivity you put it on so I recommend pointing it somewhere where there is little to no traffic or kids walking around. Easy to set up the app, easy to set up module. The app is user friendly and clean. The picture quality is great and you don’t have to pay a yearly subscription for storage. Would definitely recommend to a friend and buy more cameras.
 Wanted an easy security system to use when away from home.  Super simple to set up and the app is just as user friendly.  Especially love that the cameras can be moved and set in different areas.  Have had no issue with camera picking up everything that passes.  Recent improvements include being able to fine tune motion areas.  The picture and sound is spectacular and I have no complaints.
 I have had camera 6 months and it is already starting to fail. Called blink customer service and had to argue with them before telling them I was going to contact Amazon. Once I told them I was going to contact Amazon, they decided to replace camera. My indoor camera has had no problems and great quality, only about a 2-3 second delay. This camera however needs improvement.
 great little camera, have only had a couple of days but it caught a few people and animals at my front door.<br/><br/>Pros:  very good video quality, completely wireless runs on two AA batteries so can be placed anywhere.  night vision is good<br/><br/>Cons:  still trying to adjust sensitivity to pick up movement a bit sooner then it does,  doesn't send you a notification until after video has stopped recording, app a bit buggy/slow to respond<br/><br/>conclusion:  I would totally buy this camera again.
 Bought these to cover my carport and alley. I live on a city lot, so not very big. Couldn't get the sync module to pick up WiFi and connect with cameras unless my module was right next to my router. Therefore, the cameras couldn't be placed past my front porch, i.e. in my carport or where I needed them to cover the alley.  They worked great for my front porch, but the sync module connection between WiFi and camera is weak.  Very disappointed because it's a great idea, in theory.
 Hurry up and try one.  I really love this camera.  Wasn't sure so only bought one.  Set up as easy, install was easy. Default settings are working great for me. I watched videos and heard about complaints of false triggering. I have absolutely no complaints.  And no false triggering.  I have it pointed at my front door and walkway.  Catches the motion just fine  and records a clip and alerts me. Free Cloud recording too. Who could ask for more at this price?  Not sure, but I think you can avoid false triggering by focusing it on a smaller area like a doorway instead of an open yard or something. It's only been one day, but I am extremely happy with it and will be adding more. It's not very often that something works this well for me and delivers what it promises right out of the box.
 Setting up the camera with the mobile app was very easy. The app was easy to use from my cell phone. Unfortunately the Blink XT camera transmits a poor picture. It is cut off at the top and bottom and only shows a narrow strip of video in the middle of the cell phone screen. What video is shown is dark and lacking much detail. I don't understand how this could ever be used to monitor anything!
 Every aspect of the setup was ridiculously simple, I had the cameras installed under 30 minutes. Now the down side NO WAY TO VIEW ON PC!!!! I am baffled why this is not possible every cam I have ever installed all have a way to view with a PC. I went to the Blink site to make sure I wasn't missing anything but all I found was endless reviews with people frustrated with the same thing. Very disappointing considering how much thought was out into everything else. Also a blue light comes on when viewing remotely I would like to have that as an option to turn off.
 Pros<br/><br/>Super easy to set up<br/>Small<br/>Easy to control from app (arming &amp; settings)<br/>Easy to mount<br/>FREE cloud for clips!<br/>Expandable! Inside or outside ones!<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>Enhanced doesn't seem 1080...<br/>The back is hard to get back on<br/>The mounting bracket is weak and someone could knock the camera off with a stick<br/><br/>TBD<br/><br/>Battery life...
 This camera looks and feels cheap especially the brackets that are included to attach it to the wall. The video quality is horrible especially at night and you cannot really tell if it is a person or a bear. The straw for me was the multiple errors you get whenever you want to access live view which is very annoying. The one star is because they do give you free access to the cloud storage a service others charge for.
 Great product, very easy to setup and begin monitoring house. A little on the motion detection but I'm able clearly see all motion in front of my house. Would like to see feature where you can set a range limit for motion detection but other than that the system works great. I plan on buying several more
 I have 4 of these cameras in my house because I have a sick pet and it allows me to keep an eye on her during the day.  I love these cameras.  I tend to blast through the batteries quicker than the 2 year shelf life because of all the movement, but I'm ok with that.  I just order the lithium batteries from Amazon and they're a quick and easy replace.  I highly recommend these cameras.  The picture quality is fantastic and you can save whatever video clips for eternity if you want.
 Terrible camera.<br/>1. Batteries died within a month<br/>2. Doesn’t record despite walking right in front of it at times.<br/>3. Forget weather...you won’t get a clear picture if it is foggy, rainy etc..<br/><br/>I have wired cameras and will buy them again from now on.
 Bought as gift for adult kids; they report it was a simple set-up and are amazed at the sensitivity and quality of the picture that they get on their cell phones. They have a middle-schooler who is home after school alone once in awhile and a front porch that is not visible from inside, so this was a good safety item. Happy with the purchase and the price compared to similar items.
 I have owned Blink for probably 2 years.I love the system and ease of setup.I have five indoor and xt outdoor cameras which I use when I travel.I use my xt cameras 24/7.I can check live anytime and also check indoor and outdoor temperatures of my home from anywhere.I don't think you can find a system anywhere with more features and ease of installation and operation for the value.
 These cameras are easy to install but the quality of video and performance of the blink system is poor. I have 5 total cameras around my home. The cameras do not record as they should. They stop recording during action in front of cameras... Good solution for one camera design that does not see much video interaction. Not good at all for overall home video solution.
 Once I had it all setup, so far (only been one day) everything works great. Day and night shots are clear and nice. Video has been working great. Have to do a little more testing for motion trigger but so far has worked good. I couldn't find how to arm the system and the vendor even replied back to my email at 9:30pm on Christmas eve. Now that's support. A notification in email would be a great addition.  So far looks to be a great product. Hope it keeps working. Will have to see if the battary's really last 2 years or not.
 i bought these cause i have other security cameras that are frustrating at best. they setup easy and have a pretty good view of the area you want covered . alarm settings are easy to set up and work without issue while we were away for the holidays. only issue was the mount which we have since changed out to a more secure one. will keep this  review updated as time goes by
 Cold weather performance is not capable @ 25 degrees F. It failed. Started throwing error messages. A hard wired system appears to be required in these climes. Reliability and weather resistance need some work. I payed around $75 on AMAZON ON-SALE  ...that is TOO much for the performance I experienced. CATV Tech. -W
 Purchased about a month ago. Configuration was fairly easy. The daylight pictures are very clear but the infrared pictures are grainy and do not go far. The other disappointment in our setup was that the motion sensor only works for about 20 feet. So we will need another camera to capture the wide view and one to capture the motion nearer the house.  The worse part is the back is a bugger to get off or to put back on. Also, the mount is pretty flimsy. We had to build enclosures to protect them from the wind.<br/><br/>We also got the indoor cameras. Love them.
 I so wanted to love this product!  I don't.  The live feeds, don't work, I can walk right in front of it with no activity recorded. It did record a squirrel tail quite well but that was inches from the lens. They install easy for what it is worth.<br/>For all the error messages I get, I wish it could tell me what is causing the live feed to fail - is it the app, is it Blink, is it my wifi, is it the batteries (they are no so I am guessing no) but some sort of direction would be nice or a click here to resolve. My xfinity system was so much better.
 Love the idea, think the camera works great.  BUT it is supposed to be a 2 year battery life and only 3 weeks since its been installed and the battery is already done.  I have emailed the company and got an email back saying the email wouldn't go through.  Will wait a couple days to see if I get a response and see if they fix the issue.  Otherwise, its being returned.  Will update again.
 This worked great for about 2 months.  Then it started doing a rapid clicking sound.  I removed batteries in an attempt to reset.  That worked for about an hour.  Then it went right back to clicking like crazy and did not provide any notification.  Then after a day the batteries were dead.  I replaced them and it worked again for an hour and then started the clicking and killed the second set of new batteries.  I have tried to get support thought their site but no response for about a week.  Very disappointed.
 I got one of these to replace an Amcrest that I could no longer connect to.  I liked the fact the batteries would last a long time and the size was nice.  It was extremely easy to set up compared to another I tried and gave up on.  The motion detection and free cloud service is also a big plus.  I liked it so much I got another for outside and that does really great too so I got another and then this one.  I am now up to 4 and have great coverage around the house.  The night vision is okay but you only can see shapes.  I have a motion detection flood light in the back of house to help that one to spot things.  I don't get the face recognition thing, don't know if there is such a thing with it.  I tried one other brand when I got my first Blink and it has died already while the Blink keeps on keeping on.
 They have worked well so far.. the only problem is that it doesn't automatically extend the recording if the activity continues..
 The Blink system is good because you get 1 week of free cloud storage, unlike most other companies that charge you monthly fees.<br/>The quality of the videos is good (4/5) - zoom is not that great (3/5) &amp; audio is decent 3.5/5.<br/>The battery life on this thing is amazing (5/5)! It's been on for over 6 months (with a ton of daily triggers) and it's still going!
 Did not like this product at all and actually returned it.<br/><br/>After all the work to install them, and then learn how it operates, I was very disappointed.<br/>At least this unit, I found that you install the 5 cameras and only one at a time will record. So if you are recording something in the front yard and somebody is breaking in through the back door, by the time your done recording in the front, the thief has come in and gone with the goods through the back door and we never got a picture of who, when, how,  .... Just Terrible!<br/><br/>Then the system also kept getting disconnected and would take a few minutes every time to connect again. And No, it was not Internet problems because after returning it, I purchased another a little better quality one and ALL works great!!<br/><br/>The only good thing for me on this deal buying it through Amazon who right away gave us back 100% credit...Thanks Amazon!!
 I purchased these Blink XT camera's to monitor my home in areas where I didn't have power supply. I am not terribly happy with their performance. There is a significant delay in detecting motion and then recording. Unless whatever creates the motion hangs around you will never know what it was that set it off.
 I bought the two camera package. I stalled them almost a week ago. One camera works well. The other, which gets much less activity, needed to have the batteries replaced after 4 days. I've read all the Blink information and reduced sensitivity and done all the other reccomended settings. I'm disappointed that after only 4 days I have to replace the batteries. I've yet to replace them, for fear it will continue to happen. The other camera is fine, and I'm happy with it. Just disappointed with the performance of the first.
 What can I say other then its the most frustrated I have been with an electronic item ever!  I bought it once and had major issues getting the module to sync or connect. Contacted customer service and they basically sent a new module. Then two days later I see the price for the system drop $90. I tried to get some money back and they would not do it.  So I returned the first one and bought the new one for $90 less.  SO just now I tried again to sync the module NOTHING!!!. I reset with paper clip nothing just sat there with the blue light.  So I tried unplugging and plugging back in like the instructions say to do. STILL NOTHING!!! So the new one is also getting returned. DO not waste your time.
 I purchased a 2 camera set primarily so I knew who was at the front door and if I should answer.  So far I have only set up one camera outside.  It was painless to install the app, get the system up and running then attach a camera to my siding to monitor my front entrance.  It did stop working after a night of freezing weather and snow.  But all I had to do was re enable and it started working again.  You can do a live stream, still picture and have on a continuous motion sensor.  There is sound and the picture is adequate.
 I had to return this item. It needs to be right next to the router to connect. If I walked into an adjacent room with the camera, it would lose internet connection/signal.
 I love the clarity of the cameras, the images are sharper than I would have suspected. The motion detection could use a little work, as there are times it doesn't pick p movements or misses segments of time where it should be picking something up. Would also like a better screen shot option. Overall the are a good value and work well. I am interested to see how long they will hold up.
 The “2-year life battery” died within 3 weeks and I didn’t even keep the camera on all day. If they send me new batteries would be great. I don’t mind getting it myself but If it won’t last a year, do not give a false statement about the batteries. One day I came back home after being out of town for 10 days and the camera was not on. Who knows how long it was off for
 Cameras work fine BUT batteries were done in one of them after 25 days of use. I read all the precautions and coaching about this issue. Usage was medium (quality + sensitivity) and camera is well within range of the pod thing. Once the temperature gets cold I hope it doesnt get evwn worse. Cannot plug into outlet bc no power where its mounted.
 Just purchased the Blink Camera system. So far, I have been impressed. I really love it. It has been raining like crazy and it has performed very well. I was very impressed with the sensitivity. You have so much flexibility with angles with the mounting bracket. I'm still learning about the features and capabilities. I have tried to wear out the battery. It still shows good. 2-year battery life is awesome. I intend to buy more after a 2-week trial. So far, I'm loving it and very impressed so far. It's so easy to install and monitor on your phone. You can hear sound and everything.﻿ I also love being able to adjust the sensitivity of the motion and/or sound alerts. That feature is huge. I can adjust the alerts to detect vehicles entering our street. Is that cool or what!
 Not sure where they are getting two years from when stating their battery life.  I used the included Lithium Ion batteries.  I am not recording in the enhanced mode, just the best mode (middle option).  Two months later I received a low battery indicator.  Two days later the camera was dead.
 Our reason for buying the Blink XT was the batteries. Hard to get outlets on outside of the brick house. So far very satisfied with unit and Blink. Like that I can turn off the blue video light if I want. Actually bought second XT unit to put in back room and turned the blue light off, which you can not with regular Blink.<br/>They catch motion well day or night and send clips to cellphones very fast, which is good when you live 1500' back from road in forest. Nice to know I can buy replacement batteries that are available every where. Very satisfied.
 No simple "playback" option to see what the motion detection failed to catch. For example: today is trash pick up. My trash cans had been emptied and were waiting for me to get home to store them in the backyard. Now, as I check the live feed. No trash cans in sight. TOTALLY failed at its whole reason for being. And no "playback" option for video that didnt trigger the motion detection. Cameras that cost $35 have a playback option but this one doesnt.
 If your mounting position is close to a street you will get false triggers from cars driving by that are not even in view of the cameras.  For some reason it is even worse when dark.  In order to eliminate the false triggers you have to turn the sensitivity down so low, the camera will not pick up a car in the driveway until within 3 feet of the camera.  I adjusted viewing angles, tried disabling the sound, and adjusted sensitivity levels many many times with unsatisfactory results.  I returned them today.
 These suck, no in the moment visuals, u only know after they ran off with ur stuff, great definition and sound pick up, picture quality amazing, but, cant zoom, batteries yeah dont last, lithium batteries ain't cheap, night vision ok, see really far, but again cant zoom, some great qualities,  but all in all soooooo not worth the $ I put out, not to mention batterie cost, I tried them for 3 weeks and I've thrown in the towel, just can't do it, getting something else.....
 This is probably one of the best amazon purchases I’ve made. Super clear picture, awesome app, very responsive. The instructions are incredibly easy. And I mean easy. I love this camera. We use it as a nanny cam and also as a security camera. Great purchase. We are buying 3 more add on cameras
 The product did not work.  After 45 minutes on the phone with the support team, it was determined that the unit was defective.  A new unit will be sent.....too bad our vacation starts tomorrow.  Bad first impression.
 SETUP IS SO EASY IF YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY. CAMERAS ARE CLEAR AND HIGH DEFINITION. HEARD ABOUT ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM A FRIEND. STARTED INVESTIGATING THAT PRODUCT AND OTHER SIMILARE PRODUCTS. BLINK WON OUT HANDS DOWN. WE COULD NOT BE HAPPIER WITH ITS SIMPLICITY AND PERFORMANCE. WE RECCOMMEND IT WITHOUT RESERVATIONS. WILL NOT HESITATE TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL CAMERAS IF WE WANT TO COVER SOME OTHER AREAS. IF I COULD I WOULD RATE BLINK WITH 10 STARS.
 I had high hopes for this, but it's a fail for me.  On the plus side, very easy to set up.  One the negative side, it seems to be extremely unreliable detecting motion.  I walked out and stood directly in front of it from less than 5 feet in daylight with out a trigger.  The product promo shows it being used as a baby cam, but I don't think this is practical.  When watching live video you are constantly prompted "continue"?  I assume to save battery life.  Better options exist for powered WiFi devices and if one is serious about security, you really need hard wired cameras with a DVR system.  When I got notifications, they only went to my phone and not my tablet.<br/><br/>My WiFi monitor shows decent WiFi strength where the cam was located, and the module has excellent signal strength
 Unreliable. Sometimes works, sometimes doesn’t. Very nice when it does, but as a security device i would say it’s not great.
 I install security systems for commercial property's. Decided to get this for my home. It is a very good product for the price. I am very impressed. If ppl are having problems with it..they dont have the individual camera setting correct. It even allows area masking.<br/>I would like to see better resolution. It will not read licences plate numbers. But I knew this before I bought it.
 Purchased this camera on an Amazon sale to join an already Blink camera system. The camera si reliable and dependable and does the job. It holds up in the bad weather and has fairly good vision in the night season. Well worth the money. A breeze to set up or add on to an existing Blink system. I'm hoping they soon have the capability of monitoring on a PC, not just a cell phone.
 We purchased this camera a year ago.  No major complaints other than sometimes it recorded video / alerted us when there was no motion at all.  Lately, it hasn't been notifying either of our phones most of the time when there is movement at our front door.  Then we switched to a new modem/router.  All of our other devices switched over to the new wifi connection seamlessly.  Blink wouldn't even recognize the module anymore.  I went through all of their troubleshooting steps, no luck.  I reached out to customer service, got an email back from "Ace" asking for the serial number on the module and 4 days later.......no reply back.  Will probably end up buying a different outdoor camera now (NOT a blink product).
 2 pack, both set up and in use through winter: very good resolution. Sensitivity control needs adjusting to avoid "small motion" recording. Use for both live monitoring and recording when away. Online storage is OK (no cards or other equipment required) and can save clips locally through the app when needed. Solid and dependable as most users have indicated.
 They work great.  When looking for  security cameras you also need to check you internet upload speed. My speed is only .44 so that’s really slow but the cameras still work they just have slow response.
 Love that I can watch my home when I am away from home.  The video is so clear, pretty much crystal clear, and you can adjust the settings as to when the camera engages. I have a few placed throughout my property.  Security cameras are a must have living in the country, not just for watching your house to ensure it is safe, but to watch for wild life, since we have all kinds if wild animals out in SC.
 I like everything about the Blink XT product, except the installation brackets that come with the set. I did purchase the XT Wall-Mounted brackets and have since installed the 2 cameras using these brackets. I like the design, but the small screws that enclose the camera are not that strong. 2 of the screws stripped, since they are screwed into the plastic holes. I am concerned that over time, the camera will fall out. These screws should be machine screens that screw into a metal housing so it is more study.<br/><br/>Any other suggestions would be appreciated.
 Works well, but if you are mounting into wood find a different screw.  The camera itself works pretty good.  I tried mounting it into a wood beam initially with the screw that was included, it would not go in and ultimately I stripped it.  Found another screw that worked perfectly.  Now I just need to figure out how to get the first one out.
 This thing works great. I’ve had it for 3 months now with no problems. It’s been outside in the cold for weeks. I’ve turned on the enhanced video, which I found was more useful. I’ll let you know when the battery fails.
 I bought two Blink XT cameras. They're an amazing value.  Cystal clear imagery, on-demand pics and video. Many settings to extend battery life from scaling motion sensitivity to scheduling active time periods. The command-control App is smart, intuitive, and rich with functionality. Blink's free storage service is overly generous and their 24/7 Tech Support is remarkable. With all they offer, I'm almost ashamed of what I paid.
 These cameras are outstanding, they are user friendly and provide great quality video for piece of mind.  I have used them for the last year and a half.  I had a problem with one of my several cameras so I contacted customer support.  They got back to me immediately and fixed the problem right away.  Can't say enough good things about the blink camera system and their support team.
 I liked the fact these camera are easy to setup and easy mount on the wall with one screw. No needed to run power cable and video cable in the house. The battery didn’t lasted up to 2 year or 1 year as advertised. The battery lasted for 3 months on my XT camera mount in front of my house. Blink app crashed a lot on my iPhone X. The camera takes 7 seconds to load up whenever you click on live view and the camera is 25 ft to my WiFi router.<br/><br/>Buy and try it. I’m happy with my YI Home camera.
 I went out of town and somehow my back door opened even tho it was locked. Caught nothing on the camera so I'm figuring it wasn't shut properly. One of my cats got out. This camera is why we got her back. I took the top off her cat pan so I could put a bowl of food outside without the birds getting to it. Put this camera out side and after almost a month on Xmas eve we caught her on video and was able to get her back :) this cameras work great as Nanny cams too.
 This camera is decent for the price. Ive had this for a few months and the batteries are still going strong. It is great for checking up on the house or even spying on the dogs, lol. I love getting alerts while im at work. The app was simple to download and the camera was extremely easy to set up. Only downfail is at night, you cant see a whole lot...the camera gets a mist effect from the cold weather. Im hoping that goes away once Pennsylvania weather warms up come spring. Fingers crossed!
 Arrived on time as promised. Set up was extremely easy. Video, motion detection, and notifications are excellent. Only negative is IR/night mode. It is terrible. Everything looks like pea soup fog, not usable at all. Paid extra for the XT model for the night mode capability, total waste. Might be a defective camera as I have read many reviews that state the night mode is excellent.
 I researched twelve hours, three days. Almost bought two other competitors products.<br/>I was a technician my whole Career.<br/>I decided on Blink. I am extremely satisfied. So much that today I will send systems to three family and friends for Christmas.<br/>Awesome.<br/>I considered cost, quality,etc. no fees. Love it. Been sharing with all my people what I think aboutBlink. Thank you.
 Get lots of coverage! That seems to be the best thing about this price point, the ability to cover an area from two or more angles, so if the inevitable "lost a second" moment happens from one angle (because they take a second or so to turn on), you'll have other coverage as well. I now have 16, in 3 zones (when you get a zone/system/sync puck, you get a group on/off switch ability, and an additional block of storage).
 I have tried other cloud cameras before, but the pricing changed over time and I didn't like the feeling that my footage was held hostage.<br/>The Blink is very easy to setup and install.<br/>The app, is good, but I have a feeling will get better.<br/>The only con I can say is that in the app, you can't give different cameras separate alert tones.
 I bought a 2 camera XT system back on Black Friday as a Christmas gift, so I didn't install it until after Christmas.  It was super easy to set up.  The cameras are easy to install.  The App for iPhone is easy to use (although the downloaded clip is pretty short and doesn't start with the initial motion).  So everything would seem to be 5 stars, but (always a "but", eh?) the resolution of the images you get don't seem all that good to me.  You can see the house, the trees, the plants, etc. but when a person is imaged, unless they are right up by the camera, you can only tell it's a person, but not exactly which person.  Maybe I was in error when I thought I'd be able to id any trespassers?  On the whole, I guess, for the price, it's a great little system.  I just thought I'd be able to "see clearly now" as some 60's or so singer said.  Best for the New Year to all!
 I was skeptical of a battery operated no frills unit but I was SO IMPRESSED with the EASE of setup and installation  and then  the picture and sound QUALITY just BLEW ME AWAY!<br/>placing an order for 2 more to have COMPLETE Coverage!<br/>THANK YOU BLINK<br/>And "In the BLINK of an Eye"  I was Protecting my Home and Family!!
 Blink cameras are extremely limited, but they can be useful in areas where you don't have electrical outlets and don't receive much traffic.  Even at the least sensitive setting, my dogs trigger the cameras.  They also don't have the option to arm/disarm only certain groups of cameras or to receive notifications if a camera is triggered, but not others while not receiving notifications for others.
 Made this purachse for security. It works well for daytime video captures but doesn’t do well at night. There was a person at my door and the night vision doesn’t make out their face.<br/><br/>Also you can’t record video whenever you want. It only records when there’s motion sensed.<br/><br/>I’d say if you can find one that has good night vision and you can record when you want, get that one.
 We absolutely love these cameras!! They alerted us of movement in the driveway when I looked at the clip I noticed that is was of my dog, who escaped out of the backyard, I was out of town on business so I called my husband at work. He went home immediately and found her an hour later. I also like knowing when packages are delivered. Great cameras. We have had several friends buy them based on our recommendation so many that we should get a commission!’
 Did not get to use this product, I have a tri-ban router that includes the required ban with but could not get it to connect.  Support told me that I would need to disable the other channels which was not acceptable so I returned product.
 I don't know how this could be any easier to set up. I'm still playing with camera placement, right now it's watching my chickens. At about 100 plus feet from the module, I'm still getting alerts but it's not very good for live viewing. But again, it's a good distance away, my fault not Blink's. I first set it up in the backyard and it worked great. I've read a lot about issues with battery life. If it's somewhere hard to reach and change batteries I can understand. For me, it's not a problem. I'll be able to reach all of the cameras using a ladder (I'm planning on 5 total) and batteries are fairly cheap. I know I'll be changing them in the next few months, mainly because of the fun factor and my son/dog setting it off). I'm assuming Blink tells us 7,200 seconds of storage instead of 2 hours because it sounds like we are getting more but 2 hours FREE is nothing to sneeze at. Especially when you can download the clips you want to keep. Now that Blink and Alexa are buddies I hope Wink isn't far behind. It will be nice to have the option of setting up IFTTT/robots when I get a notification from Blink. As an aside, I work in hotels all over the country. This would be easy to set up in my storage room and keep an eye on my equipment.
 These were easy to set up and install.  They work great day and night.  I only wish I had a few more of them so I can see all sides of my yard.  I was robbed a week before I got these.  If I'd had them,  I'd be able to see the thief clearly.  I feel much less vulnerable now with these little cameras watching over my home!
 We purchased this for outside our back door in December 2018 and today February 27, 2019 we already received a battery low notification.  Not two year battery life at all, I think they meant two month.  Also, we were hoping for a camera that would notify us when there was motion, but nope there is a delay. So if there is anything going on, by the the time we get an alert its too late to respond.  Overall, a huge disappointment in this purchase.
 So far we really like this camera. The picture is very clear and it was incredibly easy to install. It took a bit to figure out the camera setting I wanted but that is just due to preferences.
 We have had the Blink XT Cameras for several weeks now and have been VERY impressed! The sound and picture quality is worth the money alone! We like how you can adjust the sensitivity via the app. This makes it so the camera can pick up moving things from father distances. In the end, this security camera system has given us peace of mind in our home. We have been so happy with this product that we have ordered another! Thank you, Blink!
 Pros: easy to install ( wireless ) , has audio, Smartphone controlled<br/>Cons: resolution is less than stellar, night resolution is very poor, the cameras are quirky. In the event your internet goes down, the system goes down with it. Only smart phone controlled, can not be controlled by your PC, or laptop.<br/>Wish I'd purchased a more professional ( wired ) system, along with pro installation.
 For the most part these cameras are pretty good. They work great during the day and are ridiculously easy to install and set up. The only bad thing (which is a pretty big deal) is the night mode. When someone walks up to it at night the face is totally washed out in white making them unrecognizable. This seems to be a common issue that the makers are aware of.
 Battery lasted 1 day. One. Maybe 24 hours. Maybe less. Picture quality is low but not terrible. Cuts off at 30 seconds of filming so it wouldnt capture all of the crime of that’s what you’re hoping to catch.  I get limiting to 30 seconds if the movement triggering the camera stops, but as long as movement is happening in the frame it should continue.
 App could be better FOR SURE, and the holder something that would just not snap off. But although the burglar snapped it off the wall with a tall stick, LAPD caught him. They asked where the camera was, he'd trashed it near by and it was recovered!<br/>Another issue is that the heat will mess up the movement sensor permanently, so make sure it is installed in the shade.
 Terrible camera. I expected too much from it. The picture quality is ok (but just ok). The motion sensitivty is a joke-- if it's too high it will send you an alert every two seconds...even at an 8 it wasn't sending me any alerts or recording. 90% of the day the camera fails or the system is busy, even when the app is showing excellent connections. Would not recommend to anyone.
 Had the cameras for 3 days, I tested in my drive way and back yard. The drive way camera had great video, and night vision was great too, the back yard camera was the same. The only issue was both cameras would motion alert like crazy on the default settings, and when I lowered the settings the cameras would not detect anything. So today I will be returning the cameras. Suggestion to Blink, if you are going to make a outdoor cameras you need to have both IR and Motion mask, this is a standard feature on all cameras systems on the market.
 After exhaustive research with video security system, I went with the Blink XT system. The setup was about as easy as it gets. Connecting the cameras was a painless experience. The mounts that come with the system are a bit flimsy and for the money spent they could do better. Fortunately there are many aftermarket mounts available. Overall I am very pleased with the setup and quality !
 This camera installed easy and does what I need which is let me know when someone comes to the house when no one is home. I find the iPhone app easy to use and typically use the manual arming function. I have not gotten any false alarms and the unit seems to sense properly when a car comes up to the garage. The mount is a little flimsy but I used a zip tie to secure it better. I'm a month in and the battery seems fine but I have it disarmed when I'm home and only use 5 sec clips which is enough to see who came to the house. It also has been working at temps from 0-20 degrees. For the money it does what I need. I will be adding a second unit.
 I live alone and not much on tech so that being said this is so awesome. I know if I get a package delivered it send a message to my phone if anyone walks in the area of the camera ! It is so easy to set up and work !! I will be buying more for my other door and etc ... anyone that says negative things is just wrong . I even bought one for my moms house and she 75 and also uses it
 I bought the Blink XT unit about an year ago with the hope that it could provide basic security function. The unit started giving “thumbnail failed” message about two weeks ago. After few back and forth troubleshooting attempts with customer support that failed to fix the issue, the customer support stopped responding to me. They probably realize there is product quality issue. I live in Chicago and this Blink XT unit obviously failed the test of Chicago winter. I will suggest you go elsewhere for your security solution.
 The thing I do not like about the blink system is that I am constantly receiving "unable to view video clip at this time" messages when attempting to view video clips after a motion alert.  This happens whether I am connected to wifi on my phone or using cellular data.  If you use the blink system for home security, what is the point of getting an alert if you can't get watch the video clips until the person who triggered the alert is long gone?
 So far this camera has performed 100% as expected for a $100 wireless camera. I haven't encountered any issues, recorded and stayed on through a cold winter full of consecutive days below zero, and the battery is still going strong. The love feed is good and has motion sensor recording of course which works good as well.<br/><br/>Recommend.
 How can amazon put thier name on such a worthless, frustrating piece of garbage?<br/>What good is a security camera if you can only access the live view 10% of the time, you cant read a license plate from 10 feet away, and most of the recordings start several seconds after the event?<br/>This thing will trigger when a random car drives down the street from 50 yards away, but if someone pulls into the driveway directly where the camera is pointed, it wont start recording until AFTER they park and exit the vehicle. How does that happen?<br/>If i want live view i need to try several times before it comes on, if at all. Totally worthless as a security camera due to its unreliability. And 2 year battery life? Ive had the thing for a month and gone thru 4 battery changes.
 A great and sinole concept but has been nothing but issues from the very get go. Highly dissapointed with a very dissapointing customer service too. Can’t recommend this product and regret getting it
 So far, I really like this product.  App is really easy to setup and use.  Video quality is terrific.  Camera is super easy to install.  I like the mounting bracket that came with it.  I would recommend this to other people considering a security camera system.  No wire to run.
 These cameras are ok. They have good pictures, not the best. Also, one camera almost never plays a live picture. We always get “live view failed” at least 90% of the time. It’s frustrating but it does capture most motion for recording. There is not a microphone to speak to the camera. The camera does record noise although very fuzzy sounding. Would not buy again.
 Great camera, excellent day time video quality.<br/>The night vision needs improvement though..<br/>And the IR lighting even on low settings white washes faces so they are unrecognizable at close distances.
 Camera is great for the price. Picture and sound quality are good.  You could easily identify someone if they came in view.  The settings are pretty easy to figure out after a few minutes of playing around with.  Installation was very quick.  The mount it came with was simple to attach.  My only complaint so far is I have mine out by the garage under the roof, it was very cold for a few days then it became substantially warmer. When the warmer weather came,  it created precipitation on the lens.  Picture was blurry for a day unless I wiped off the camera.  Maybe a weather proof case to go around it would help but I'm not sure.  Other than that,  it has been great!
 Been having issues with the app since August and logged a support call in early September.  Was told things would be fixed with new app update. New update came out couple weeks ago. Things have gone from bad to worse!<br/><br/>Technical Support says others are experiencing same issue but they don't know how to fix it.<br/><br/>$300, spent and the app doesn't work! Too late to send it back.
 Procedure for setup was easy to follow. Haven't had system installed long, but all cameras are doing their job.<br/><br/>Negatives so far, have not been able to download a video to my phone. Also no access to cameras from a computer, only by app.
 The Blink XT systems installs very easily and works well.  I'm still adjusting the sensitivity of my outdoor camera as it seems to sense motion when the bushes move due to wind.  This is just a matter of adjustment and I'm sure I'll find the right level.  I use one of the XT cameras indoors and would like to focus it on a digital weather station tablet so that I know what's going on in my vacation home when I'm away.  This camera is located about 15 feet from the tablet and when I enlarge the picture on my cell phone to "zoom in" the resolution is not great.  I still need to experiment with this.
 Works well, good motion. This unit still has the blue light. I put a piece of electrical tape over it. Stays stealth and the IR is acceptable out to 10-15 feet. If you want preformance of a 300.00 camera....... Get a 300.00 camera. This is one of 3 blink cameras I have. I like this unit.
 it will be a year with this camera in March 2019 ... worked fine but now the video is displayed at times with a greenish colored tone. Yes, I've replaced the lithium batteries with the same type, worked for a day and once again the greenish colored displayed re-appeared.  Was told to ship it back for a refund. The point here is, I want it replaced with one that works.
 The instructions in the box were incomplete as I soon discovered! After contacting the seller, who then emailed me another set of instructions; which as it turned out, still did not connect the device to my internet! After about 10 tries, I had to give up! I've not been so frustrated since that time that I got something with instructions only in Japanese, lol.
 Very upsetting how the product goes on sale then stops.. Then goes back on sale so you figure i better jump on it.. Then next day goes more on sale and includes an echo dot. So now im out money and a dot.. Unbelievable
 System works great, having sound is a huge improvement over the Netgear Arlo system I also have, which was far more expensive and uses batteries very quickly.<br/>Plenty of features and settings to get thing setup right for your needs.<br/>Setup was extremely quick and easy.  Very pleased with this system so far.
 Had it less then a week and the "2 year" battery is already dead. Going to return.
 Pro's:<br/>Cheap to run<br/>cameras are good quality, easy to install, and weather proof<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Many times you hear something in the front yard, go to the app, and it takes FOREVER for the camera to pull up the live view.<br/>Get "unauthorized Access" or "failed to load" often when you try and look on live view<br/>often when blink notifies you of "motion on the front door" the actual footage wont load for several minutes.<br/><br/>Overall it works.... If you just want it to record what happen then it would be perfect.  However, if you want it for a security purpose (i.e. you want to see who is at the front door when the doorbell rings before you answer) I'd get something else.
 I had high hopes with the nice website, branding, packaging, and backed by Amazon.  This is nothing more than a 'proof of concept'.<br/><br/>1) Trying to balance signal strength between the cameras, sync module and wifi is a mission.  There was no way to get appropriate signal balance in my home (2500 sq ft, 2 story).  The camera to sync unit signal was always weak in any location.  (The only way I was able to do it was with a mobile battery charger for the sync unit and portable, battery powered wifi repeater, both very close).<br/>2) The mount has no swivel, it only rotates on the x and z axis, not y.  So don't think you can put this at the corner of your house and capture the entire front, it only shoots straight ahead and will angle up or down.<br/>3) The app doesn't refresh signal strength often so you don't know if relocating helps unless you wait an undetermined amount of time.<br/>4) iOS status bar updates don't change.  If you get a call while in the app and the call ends, it still shows the 'tap here to return to call' bar.  Tapping the folder to get to your video alerts worked about 20% of the time.<br/>5) The motion sensitivity will sometimes capture objects far away, but not right in front of the camera.<br/><br/>In summary, this isn't worth the money or the time investment trying to get it to work.
 The system was super easy to install and set up and I was really hoping it worked as advertised. Unfortunately, the camera's do not consistently detect motion.... which is the main thing it needs to do well.  At times it worked great but every day It would go hours without picking up any motion. When I tested it I found I had to be within 3 feet before it detected me.  Other times it worked fine. I tried moving the location but it didn't help. Customer support was not able to provide any answers and i ended up returning it.
 VERY POOR PICTURE QUALITY WHEN DARK
 honestly the way cheaper chinese cameras do a way better job in both motion detection and video quality. motion detection is beyond terrible. it never catches people at my door yet i get several false detections. ive played with every setting including the beta zone detection.
 Very inconsistent.  A bird may go by and it will send a notification, but 2 trucks parked in front of my house and 6 working men and nothing. Regret buying this.
 These cameras are what we have been missing. The piece of mind alone is worth the money for the house being safe. After tweaking the setting for about a month they work great
 Camera works great price is great and couldnt be happier, you will have to play with the settings inorder to prevent false motion detections and in areas where there is alot of motion i would recommend adding a USB cord because the more motion it picks up the faster the battery will drain. Also if u have issues with it picking up people might want to increase sensitivity, this will increase false motion detections. It is $100 which is way cheaper than most other security cameras so understand there will be limitations and the cloud storage is free which is a plus.
 Worked great just long enough to get out of the refund timeframe and then it became utter junk. Picks up a leaf blowing 20 feet away from it, but missed someone walking by right in front of it or a work truck pulling up and parking 6 feet away. This is a too good to be true for the price point situation. Spend a bit more to get a quality product with real customer support. Expect to wait days between customer support emails. Constantly switching out batteries, two years is a bad lie. Maybe if it’s somewhere that will never get used or record anything. Mine is lucky if it lasts two weeks between battery changes.
 Do not buy this item.<br/>The only pro I can think of for this item is that it comes with a wireless receiver so it helps with the wifi connection, and that there is no monthly fee.<br/>THATS IT!<br/><br/>Here is a list of issues I had before I ended up buying a Ring Doorbell.<br/>They say the battery lasts around 2 years or 40,000 seconds of footage. I had 6,000 seconds of recording, and my camera died.<br/>The app is terrible, it gave me so many issues when signing up.<br/>The app takes so long to load a video.<br/>It may see you and start recording, or it may not.<br/>Two users on the app can't watch the camera, only one. Also, if you're in the app, the camera won't record anything.<br/><br/>So many more cons, but heres what sums this up:<br/>-You get what you pay for.<br/>-Buy a more expensive camera, I bought a Ring Doorbell 2 because it also has a battery power. I tried going cheap and this is where it got me.<br/><br/>Don't buy this.
 Incredibly slow and jumpy. Takes 15 seconds or more to get an image to show up in the app ... if it does at all. Skips repeatedly. Night vision unusable. Waste of money.
 I loved the camera's at home home in Michigan...... until I needed to change my password. The module needs someone to reset it using a paper clip direct. You then can go through several steps to reset your password. This is difficult to do remotely. Tried,but didn't want to stress my house sitter to help. You'll need Wi-Fi that is not disturbed while you are away. FYI
 Nice little camera.  good picture and quality.  alerts come quickly.  big draw back is the mount.  It just clips on.  No screw or anything super secure.  Mine is on a front gate that if closed too hard the camera falls off.  Like why?  who thought of that? but its held up after falling off 2-3 times.  works for piece of mind and package tracking.
 EASY TO INSTALL AND SETUP!  Saves me from running over daily to check up on 93 yr old Mom...LOVE THAT YOU CAN TURN OFF THE LIGHT THAT SHOWS THAT IT IS WORKING&gt;&gt;&gt;GREAT FEATURE!
 I set up a couple exterior cameras for my wife's elderly aunt. Her children live in other states  and wanted to receive alerts when motion was detected. I used my smart phone to set up an account and get the cameras functioning. I was hoping to turn pass the account to my wife's cousin but according to support "He needs to be on the location where it was setup to add it to his existing account." He's about 1,000 miles away so this isn't an option. It would be nice if I could have transferred the account for him to manage. He can add the account I set up to his Blink account and I can uninstall the app but I don't think this is the best solution.<br/><br/>The daylight images are great and the ability to change durations and sensitivity are nice features.
 I think the product is great and seems to work really well however... the mounting brackets that come with these are really crappy. They are very flimsy and don't articulate in enough ways to allow you all the needed mounting options. I am having to fabricate new mounts to make these work properly on my house. I feel for the price and what they are made to do, they should at least provide an adequate mounting bracket.
 Picture Quality is superb, I only wish when the camera picks up any activity, it sends a message to my phone, but for some reason, I get a silent alert rather than a beeping sound, I checked the app on my iPhone to make sure the sound is on for alerts. Great product for the price, hopefully, ​it will work the same way with a harsh Michigan weather, Stay Tuned!!!!
 The app is completely horrible! The cameras say that they are busy all of the time and won’t let me view my live stream. Definitely worst cameras ever!
 System is good but the fact that THE BATTERY WORKED FOR TWO MONTHS NOT TWO YEAR AND FROM “OK” to “REPLACE” IN MINUTE...!!! Also we can’t put rechargeable lithium battery in it.
 The app that controlled the camera was full of bugs. When I contacted Blink customer support of them, they responded quickly, but none of the solutions they provided fixed the issues. When I reached back out to inform them of the same, I was told to do the same troubleshooting steps I already had (i.e. reinstall the app/reset the network and camera).  It appeared their rep was just typing off a script without any interest in resolving issue. I returned the camera for a full refund.
 The Blink system I bought and installed is better than I expected, for outside monitoring of my back door and driveway.<br/>The picture is very clear and the audio is good.  There seems to be not much of a delay in the video transmission to my phone, either.  I just may add more cameras at a later date.  My only bitch is that I can't access it to my office PC, but I understand Blink is working on that!
 I bought the outside cameras and the night vision and motion detector work very well. Easy to set up and sync. My only problem is security with the actual camera. These are for outdoors, yet the plastic mounting bracket snaps into the camera and can easily be hit and knocked off.<br/><br/>My solution was duct tape. Even if they wack at it and the plastic breaks, the camera will still be hard to get down unless you climb up and cut of the duct tape.<br/><br/>Perhaps they should use metal brackets to a metal back that screws into the camera front for outdoor cams.
 Very easy to set up (and English speaking tech support is available if needed), and we paired it with her i-phone. May be a little on the sensitive side (detects even the slightest movement within the camera range and sends alerts to the cell phone) but rather it be that than not sensitive enough. Storage of video online is also a big plus! Compared to more pricier options online, this is a winner!
 This little camera is very handy. I have 2 one inside and one out. Install a simple app on your phone and keep an eye on your pets or any disruption. You can set the sensitivity levels. It did use the lithium batteries in about 2 months. You have to use lithium AA, a standard AA set of 2 doesn't have enough volts to even use the camera.
 I bought one of these to test its performance.  It was easy to install, set up and operates without any difficulties.  The negatives are that the display on my phone is half-size, and I wish it had a distinctive notification like the bell when my Ring doorbell is activated.  Overall, however, I will give it four stars because it is relatively inexpensive, it performs well, it requires no external wiring, and it is not complicated.
 It works OK for me but the fact that they chose black present a problem, overheating.  I put aluminum foil over mine which keeps the temperature down and does not seem to affect the connection.  Maybe it does but it's working for me.
 Works when it wants to. I get alerts but 75% of the time it takes forever to load and/or watch a live video. I have 4 other cameras in my house that I paid a lot less for and don’t have all these issues.
 I bought these after my home was burglarized. They have already caught two people scoping out my home and my neighbor's house. I've sent both footage to the local PD. The only gripe I have about these cams is the flimsy mounting bracket they come with. I feel like if a strong gust of wind came by, the cameras would get knocked off. Somebody suggested super glue.
 Out of the box the sync module was defective. I was able to get customer service on the phone easily and they sent me a new unit which set up and works fine. After one week in operation , I have no complaints and is working fine. Its great to be able to put it anywhere with no wires. If it continues to work like this I will get some additional cameras
 So far so good. Will update review if things change, only docked one star because the sync module does not do well if you have steel siding. Couldn't get the sync module signal over 3 bars until I moved it out to my garage that has slate siding. Won't be an issues unless I decide to add another camera on the opposite side of the house.
 Just installed today and it was super easy to setup. Hardest part was just figuring out where to mount the cameras.  Seems to work well enough for the price.  U get sent notifications after it records a clip.  Gotta play around with each camera’s sensitivity.  I will post an update, but so far am very pleased.
 These cameras work great. No fuss. Easy to setup. Battery or powered. Free storage. Great night vision. Great motion sensor. Great range. Great image.<br/><br/>So many gadget. I don't need more headaches with gadgets. This just works.
 Cameras are very easy to set up and the app walks you through the syncing process.  We bought the extra brackets separately - I recommend them vs the ones that come with the camera.  It took us less than hour from unboxing to monitoring the outside activity.  We plan on adding more cameras once we figure out the pattern of activity around the house that we can’t capture.  Highly recommend.
 Immedia - you need to increase server capacity - "System is Busy - Please Wait"  really doesn't build confidence that we'll be notified and can see what's going on in a timely manner!<br/>That said, I really like these cameras and the system, especially being able to self monitor and have some system storage without a monthly fee.  Too often companies get you as a customer and then start charging.  Great product at this price point.<br/>Improvements and accessories coming look pretty good.
 For the price point, this is a really excellent product.  I love the "No Wires" aspect of this and the picture quality is good (I'll keep you posted on battery life but I would recommend a high quality battery, especially for the exterior units over the rechargeable ones).  App on phone was super easy to set up and even my smart phone limited father had no problems navigating thru the app. I actually ordered 2 more cameras to get full coverage around the exterior and view all entry ways on the interior. Free storage space on blink app is enough for most folks.  I highly recommend this product.
 I love it, great pic's outside during any time of day/night. I only wish I could tell the software to record 1 camera all the time instead of armed during the times I have it set to arm the whole system, interior and exterior. I am not confident, the first big wind won't blow it down either. I wish the piece that secures it to the wall were a little more sturdy, especially being outside.
 Works well outdoor...I wish its more flexible in the angles and can move and bend to get the right angle. seems like its only best in corners. I like how  you can adjust the sensitivity. I also wish there is a 2-way talking function, where you can talk to the person on the other side of the camera
 I am a Blink fan and own two indoor cameras. These outdoor cameras work as expected so far but I have a couple things to note. One I did not know or think about that can be solved by Blink developers and the second I kind of knew but wish there was a better option.<br/><br/>The first issue is the arming and disarming has to be all cameras at once. The way around it so far it using a second sync module so i have a workaround but the user interface is not very user-friendly when using it this way. I think this can be fixed in the software and hope they change this or provide more options.<br/><br/>The second note is mounting options are not that great and wish there were better options so I don't have to figure it out myself which I am still in process of figuring out. Anyway, having indoor cameras already I knew this would be something I needed to figure out. I will add that i was looking to add a power source on one camera as it will always be enabled for motion as it is outdoor (security) and to plug in a power source you have to remove the rubber flap that is under the mounting clip so i have to have the mounting clip out of the way and then seal the plug. When it gets a little warmer outside I get all this in place I will update my post and maybe include pictures.
 So far so good. I haven't tested the extent of the range of the components or the battery life to it's fullest extent, but I've had no issues aside from no obvious password recovery system. I watched the review on Amazon about the product and it is Well out of date. They're costumer service is currently very active and prompt. I'm having a slight issue directly downloading the video clips to my phone but am working around it by emailing them to myself while they're costumer service helps me resolute the issue. Overall I think it's a very clever device. I'm very interested to see the future improvements from this company. P.S. In the time it took to write this review they have already responded to my issue via email.
 Absolutely in love with this product. I have three in my home and my best friend ordered the five pack and now just ordered the outdoor cameras. Her home is now like Fort Knox. It gives me security while I'm away from home and sometimes I can even catch the animals being naughty at home. I highly recommend this product
 I have had the system 2 months now...I'm happy with the motion detector and the video quality.  Mine has been in temperatures between 19 degrees and 75; directly in the rain.  The camera is outside approximately 10 yards from my router that is inside the house.
 We mounted it outside so that we can monitor the front door activity. It works great, even at night. Wish we would have also purchased the indoor camera with it. Will add the indoor when the  rice drops. The smart phone control is great. If you forget to turn it on when you leave you can do it from your phone. We highly recommend this item.
 Great camera system. I can see who's at the front or back doors, and it saves short video clips based on motion sensors.<br/><br/>Be warned that the connection between the camera and base is weak click on. At about 20 degrees tilt, it fell off due to gravity.  Highly recommend getting another base that screws into the camera.
 I like the blink cameras and system very much. I had a Canary and they kept reducing freemium features and they king of have to many features on their app. Blink is back to basics but what it does it does well.<br/><br/>The Blink cameras are great.<br/><br/>The main peeve I have are the mounts. For I the design is fine. For outdoors not so much. My outdoor camera recently changed position due to strong wind!?
 The camera looks good taste good pictures and film as long as you need it to and does good motion detect. So far so good. The mounting bracket is a cheap piece of plastic.  I am having to order an aftermarket piece in order the mounted securely, they should really make a better bracket for it then that cheap one they've sent with it at that price
 Do not buy this system servers continue to go out and it leaves the system useless and your property unprotected.  You have no recourse when this happens.
 Batteries don’t last more than a few months in this camera. Especially if you have a lot of activity where the cameras  are placed.  Sometimes the cameras won’t sync to the module... and there’s a loud click when the recording starts. I guess it’s supposed to be a “blink”. I do like that there is free cloud storage for a month and then If I need to keep a recording, I take a screenshot on my phone.
 Pro- Easy install, fair price, hopefully the battery will last as long as claimed- so far still better than recharging regularly like I've experienced with other cameras. Good app and settings from app. No service fee. Can mix and match cameras with base.<br/><br/>Con (not really)- Short 5 sec clip for the claimed battery life- can be set to longer, but will affect battery life. Can't record live feed. audio is one way from camera (no speaker on camera). no pan or zoom. The infrared is ok. limited storage space.<br/><br/>These are really great cameras if you are looking for an easy basic wireless system.
 Very good value for the money. Setup is easy and picture is clear. Low light visibility is not as good as I would like for it to be but in decent light it is actually very decent. Night vision is pretty good.<br/>Overall, I am liking it so far and would recommend it to anyone looking for a security camera setup at home. Best part is that you can add as many cameras as you want and monitor all from the same app and from same window.
 I have three of these cameras in my home.  The number one thing I like about these cameras is, you do not have to put holes into your home or walls.  The second best thing is that they are mobile.  I did not give these cameras five stars because they do not have a built in speaker.  If they ever developed speakers for these cameras I would give them 5+ stars and I would have more of them.
 Bought this for my daughter who lives alone. It was easy to set up and install. We were even able to conceal it to some extent. The Video is clear. I liked that it didn’t have to connect to a doorbell and that we didn’t have to use a subscription service. If you are looking for a decent, easy to set up security camera, this will work out fine.
 Very affordable, and easy to install.  I highly recommend this system!!  A few things should be changed or improved.  (1) Wall mount should swivel, only moves angle up or down, (2) Should be able to configure notifications for every camera, not just system wide configuration, (3) Should be able to set notifications for lower than 40 degrees.
 Pros:<br/>- Good picture<br/>- Audio sounds good and picks up sounds from a decent distance<br/>- Motion sensor works good<br/>- Easy to set up<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Even with full connection to hub and WiFi it still takes longer to load a love picture than I would like for it too<br/>- There needs to be a setting to continue recording until motion stops with an unlimited time feature.
 I bought this to record wildlife in my backyard.  I mounted it on a tree right outside my kitchen but I couldn't get the live view to work.  I emailed the company and they told me it was too far from my wifi.  I bought a wifi extender and put it in the kitchen.  It still didn't record so I returned the Blink and returned the extender.  Bought something else.
 Didn’t work when I needed it.<br/>The mounting brackets for them are crap. They can’t hold the weight of the camera and they droop and sag changing the camera angle you set them for.<br/>They do pick up motion and the app is great.<br/>Unfortunately my truck was broken into last week in my driveway and the camera pointed directly at my truck did not capture any of it. I do get awesome video every time  my wife or I pull in, but that’s useless.
 Dislike.... I bought camera in October 2018 installed in a building that had low traffic maybe twice a week and batteries died by December 2018 wow what a lie I was told batteries would last two years if I have to buy batteries every two to three months that will be almost hundred dollars in battery in the two years and the night image is very low grade!!! A guy was three feet from camera and the police or myself couldn’t make out what he look like. I had to hook my old cameras back up that’s  wired.
 Firmware is subpar. The cameras trigger to any motion at all (which is terrible when it looks down your driveway and passing vehicles set it off).<br/>Sensitivity adjustment is useless. All of my cameras (2 outdoor, 3 indoor) either trigger at nothing at all or they trigger long after motion should have been detected. The package delivery people will be safe from detection unless they approach the front door extremely slowly.<br/>Due to the incessant triggering one of my outdoor cameras already needs charged. So much for 2 year battery life. It's more like 2 months.<br/>I wasted too much time trying to find a position and/or setting to make these work and now I can't return them.<br/>These aren't anywhere near ready for prime time. Spend your money elsewhere.
 I had very much trouble with the setup.  I couldn't find the APP.  I spent 3 hours trying 5 or 6 APPs I found but they wouldn't work.  I thought my tablet was out of date, then I called customer service.  They couldn't help me but she did mention that the APP was a blue square with a white B.  I looked again found it and 10 minutes later all is good.
 Cameras were easy to setup and operate.  For the most part everything was great.  The tiny mounts are not great but function.  If I would have known you can power these via micro usb cables I would have bought those when ordering the cameras (only for indoor operation).  Two of the five cameras are outside, no issues.
 Just received this today. I had an issue with syncing the base unit to my wifi network. I emailed customer support and they suggested rebooting my router and the unit. Worked like a charm. If it wasn't for this issue, it would've taken about a half an hour to set up, including mounting the camera outside my home. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the bracket that holds the camera seems a little flimsy. Other than that, the camera takes crystal clear video and the whole system is pretty user friendly. Time will tell if it stands up the the elements, but this was a very affordable solution to what I needed it for.
 Worked great the first month I had it.  Then the lithium battery died and have had problems with it ever since I replaced the batteries.  The scheduling doesn't work anymore and it doesn't record any motion anymore.  The Settings have not changed since the first month when it worked fine.  Some nights it makes a loud clicking sound for hours.  I wouldn't recommend this product.
 Brackets are way too loose, we are afraid the camera's will blow away when our winds pick up.. Husband said they were easy to install.. Also, the night vision is horrible and can only see at night if the motion lights come on..Day vision is good, but sometime the speed is delayed...
 WOW, this is as simple as it gets. Some programming time on the I Phone, then mount the cameras. One of my cameras needed to be mounted to a brick wall. I used some 40# capacity adhesive velcro for this one. The other one was one screw into wood. I've already ordered a third camera, using this one to capture the tag number if someone pulls up  my driveway.<br/><br/>Good optics, good instructions. I will recommend this system without reservations.<br/><br/>Ken Webb
 This system is a little over rated but the price was encouraging.  Disappointed that I can't access the cameras from a website.  Also, only one user access allowed.  Video quality is pretty good.  The answer here is.......you get what you pay for.  Not the best but also did not pay top dollar.  Easy to setup and working within 5 minutes of opening the package.  That was impressive so they are very easy DIY.
 So I was having a problem with someone getting in my truck at night looking for valuables. I know lock it up, sometimes I would forget and that was the night they would get in. So I bought this as an inexpensive way to keep an eye on the cars in my driveway. It sits close to the road so the thing that was the best was that I could adjust the sensitivity to not pickup every car up and down the road but would get the pics or vid. In the drive itself. Pics are a little slower in taking than the Vid. don’t know why, so I keep it on vid. Long and short, I will be adding to my system and very impressive.
 Very easy to use, easy app to navigate and less than 10 minutes to set up both exterior cameras. Works flawlessly and does exactly what I had hoped it would do. Very easy Intergration with Alexa. Will be getting a few more exterior cameras like this as well as a couple of the interior ones. Excellent video and picture quality
 I have a Blink system and think it is the best  video/audio security system for the price.  With this new outdoor unit, I was able to arm my front door, and my driveway.  I live in the Midwest and they have  made it thought a very cold winter and work perfectly
 No option to start recording manually.<br/>I would’ve giving it 5 stars if it had the option, while viewing live, to start recording to your device or somewhere else. As of right now you can only watch, so if something was to happen while watching live, you wouldn’t have any record of it.
 I had my system for 8 month installed at my vacation home in Central America and wondered why my system went down and wouldn't connect to the Blink server anymore. After initially blaming the local internet service provider, I did some research: turns out that Blink started to use region locking recently which rendered my vacation home system useless. This system will only work on North America now. Blink won't exchange or refund.  $500 waisted
 Great camera system.  Good quality and I love the fact that I dont need to have to subscribe to a service to use the app. I originally purchased this security system because I was worried that the little bunny statue I have in my garden was sneaking into the house at night and upsetting the dog.  Turns out it was the garden gnomes.
 works as stated. terrible mounting hardware and NO customer service to remedy the issue. could be a 4-star product if the service didn't suck
 I must say, when you unbox this package, you can't help to think how cheap these feel and look. I mean, compared to my Arlo system, these are about as cheap looking and feeling as a child's plastic toy. However, they work great!! I have them at my second home, and can not complain. Let's just hope they last!
 I purchased this camera in May - everything was fine - Now it's November and the pictures are pink. I have replaced the batteries and nothing changed
 Great camera so far! Answers what I have been hunting for in a out door camera...but...disappointed in the rise in price from $89.00 last month to $119.00 this month for the XT...$30.00 rise in price...my question is why the rise in price? It would have been a deal breaker if I had known the price was going to rise..I may not buy another cam to add to my system at this price....
 As soon as I initialized the camera, the picture was blurry as if the lens was smeared with grease.  Customer Service recommended a software setting change which did not help.  They asked if I mishandled the camera or got it wet, and I said no.  Then they stopped communicating.  They ignored two follow-up emails for over 48 hours.  You might say I "got the message" and returned the product for refund.  One star is too generous.
 One major problem that prevents me from using this for my intended purpose--the "Infrared" light is actually just a red light. The red light is used for night recording and can't be turned off, and it's bright enough to interrupt the sleep of my baby so I can't use it as a baby monitor. This otherwise seems like a good addition to the Blink system, which I'm very pleased with for the rest of my house and would give 4+ stars.
 A piece of garbage.... batteries didn’t last one full week, yet they state up to two years in the description. Lag time in live video and alerts is horrendous!!  Motion activation barely works. I walked around my yard and the camera motion activation never picked me up. Buy a Ring doorbell system instead, it works so much better than this.
 It was about time Blink decided to make an outdoor camera. I use it on my porch. As with other Blink cameras, the video and audio quality is outstanding. I love all the adjustments you can make in the app. The ability to take it offline is nice when you know there will be a lot of action in front of the camera.
 I've had these camera for almost 6 months. They worked fantastic in the summer months, now that it has become cold they do not work at all. By cold I mean 20 to 40 F which is well within there recommended operating temperatures. If you need a consistent camera I would not recommend these at all during the winter or anytime it gets below 40 basically.
 I was hesitant about installing these and what use they would actually be.  I am now a believer.  They are fantastic.  The app is easy to use and highly manageable.  You can adjust the camera sensitivity and area the camera reacts to.  Best of all it is completely free once you purchase the hardware.
 Awesome security camera. We set each camera motion sensitivity to #7 because if we set them up any higher it detects false alarm - it would send notification of motion detected but no one was around.<br/><br/>Also, I should add that on our iPhones it would receive the notification alarms faster than our Android would (about 5 seconds difference).
 Purchased a two camera kit initially then got another two camera kit after using it for a couple days.  Setup was easy, mounting was easy, and use of them is easy.  I am skeptical about the battery life expectancy but time will tell there.  It feels good to have some "home security" (and I can watch my dogs :D)
 I finally got the cameras put up. The only draw back was that my phone was a little old and was not compatible with the app. Recommend going and checking if the app will download before purchasing. I ended up purchasing a new phone before I could set-up the system.<br/>After installation, I LOVE IT!!!! Excellent!!! Highly Recommend!!!  A++++
 Really liking these cameras - image quality is great during the day and decent at night. We have a long driveway and cannot hear when people come up to our house - works really well to provide that advance warning. Also great for seeing when deliveries are made.<br/>Installation was easy, though I did purchase a different bracket to hang outside - the one that came with it would not have held up to our weather conditions.<br/>Overall, very satisfied with this product
 The cameras usually work well. Sometimes (and it is not often) I can't log into Blink with my phone, even when I get an alert. That is frustrating. The sensitivity level can be adjusted. If it is too high, wind noise can trigger an alert, or a cat walking on the driveway. I have 4 of these outdoor cameras and feel my property is more secure with them than without them.
 Ended up having to return due to them not being able to fix an android issue I was experiencing on my Note9. There solution was to go buy a new phone pretty much...<br/>Worked fine for 2-3 weeks when I got it then the app updated and it kept crashing and caused poor picture quality for over a month so I returned
 We bought Blink during the holiday and the price was phenomenal for the value.  This system is so simplistic; the cameras are wireless and apparently last for 2 years.  The view of the cameras are excellent and the settings are fairly easy to navigate.  We started with 5 cameras for the outside and we are now hooked so 5 more will be coming for the inside of our home. Also the system connects with Alexa so that is a bonus.  The only drawback which isn’t a big deal is you can’t access the cameras through a web address.
 The mounting brackets for these are not very good. I’m wondering when I’m gonna go outside and find them on the ground. That being said, they are superior to the Arlo cameras in every other way (I’ve had those too). The fact that you can use aa lithium’s is a HUGE plus. The blink app also allows for more flexibility for recording options as well.
 I was looking for an affordable outside camera system and this seemed to fit the bill perfectly. So far they have worked great. We just had some of the coldest weather in years here in Michigan, actual temperatures to -15 and no issues whatsoever with these cameras working outside.  We will definitely purchase more if we decide down the road that we need more cameras. Would highly recommend this product to anyone, easy installation. Love the app and receiving notifications on my phone from anywhere.
 So far so good. I was really happy that this affordable camera was easy to set up and has the features I was looking for. I set it up to link to ny phone and it gives free storage of the clips recorded when motion is detected. There are also some more sophisticated features like deciding what part of the camera shot triggers recording.... so I cut out the top part of the fence where squirrels go back and forth to avoid constant recordings of squirrels. Im really glad I found this... knock on wood.... but it really seems to be what I was looking for without some subscription
 An add-on camera for a system of several Blink cameras at my place. Love the flexibility of sensitivity settings, and alerts. Price is a concern, so bought it at a sale price. WyzeCam keeps theirs at a really affordable price but they have no outdoor cams. Blink is my go to cam for outside. Both Blink and WyzeCam slam Ring for the perspective on their cams. Ring has a slow cam response, and terribly distorted fish-eye image. Also, Blink responds MUCH faster to flare from sun or other light sources than Ring.
 I bought two Blink XT cameras.  The software and monitoring system operating through one's cell phone.  There is no option to connect to a home computer, which buyers should be aware of.  The system works as advertised.  I've only noticed one glitch (so far), which is sometimes the audio notification to the phone becomes disabled and then returns, with no apparent pattern.  The camera sensitivity is something that you may have to play around with to avoid having things like wind through trees setting it off.
 Terrible camera. Can rarely access it T home and never when away. I have owned several Amazon products but this is the worst. Can not recommend
 Super easy setup. Very clear picture even in the dark.  Get to watch any mail or package deliveries. Catching lots of neighborhood cats and squirrels visiting the front door. Bought a second camers to cover the backyard. Can adjust the length of video and can set it to stop recording when motion stops. Very happy.
 DO NOT BUY!!!!! Blink is only good for inside or on the front door. I bought 5 camera and put them all over my house. Two months later, they are all dead. When I contacted customer service, they said cause it logged to many seconds....isn’t that what a camera is supppsee to do?!?!? This was the biggest rip off !! They don’t last two years, more like two months. I tried to get get a refund but it was past the 30 days so they wouldn’t refund me. Plus the other cameras couldn’t connect to the sever, which defeats the purpose of home security if I can’t position  the cameras how I like and must worry about placement near the sever. Do not waste your money like me.  Stay away from this product.
 setup was EASY! I was able to do by myself in just about a half an hour for all 5 cameras. The ONLY con I have with them is that we bought them for the Alexa integration thinking that they would work with the new Fire TV Cube (another bought another cube!) and of course, they aren’t compatible... I hope they are soon because that was the main selling point for me!
 This little camera works pretty well.<br/>It will pick up everything or nothing depending on your settings.<br/>The video is clear and so is the sound.<br/>You don't pay for any storage.<br/><br/>A couple things that I don't like:<br/>You can't view recordings live, so if you are viewing, you can't record it.<br/>It send an alert after it's recorded and not prior to the recording.<br/>So if I rob your packages, your video will be solid, but you won't know<br/>until after I've robbed you.<br/><br/>I bought it on a black Friday sale so I can't talk about the full price.<br/>Over all I give it 4/5.
 Camera's (I have two). Are functioning but the battery life is poor. I am getting less than 2 months per camera. I have purchased Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries @ $11.76 per 8 pack from Walmart. At this rate I'm looking at $117.00 in cost for the reported 2 year battery life.<br/>I understand the settings can be adjusted to extend the battery life but you need to read the fine print to understand this and I don't think there is any setting that would extend life up to the 2 years reported. These cameras did not meet my expectations. I'm an Amazon Prime member and have had years of satisfaction with all my dealings with them . This is my first review and shows my frustration.
 You wouldn't be able to get a clear image of someone's face unless they were really close to the camera and I've noticed that the camera doesn't turn on until there is movement in the center so it has a really narrow view for when the sensor goes off to even start recording.  Not worth the money.
 bought this system after a lot of online research. reviews heralded this product. I hate it. it goes out on a weak wifi signal, or even the remotest tiniest thing. I've contacted support. Ive reset, rebooted until I'm sick of resetting...I've got two cameras, only one works most of the time. When they work, they are really good quality and the app is good but who knows when they will work. Not dependable, if ever needed for the real reason i'm not confident that they would even capture the crime or trespass.....who knows. Don't buy it. Buy something else.
 I really like this product. The video quality is really great and very clear. The audio is good but since I keep them outside the wind can mess it up a bit. I don't blame the camera for that.<br/>If needed I would definitely buy another Blink camera again.<br/>The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars rating is that I can't view the stream live on my computer similar to other cameras like it.
 The Blink XT camera was a very easy set up and works well inside BUT I didn't do enough due diligence prior to purchase.  The camera cannot detect motion through glass so it must be placed outdoors to detect potential intruders BUT living in Minnesota the operating temperature of only -4 degrees will not suffice here.  So, the XT outdoor camera is of no use from December - March here where I live. Everything else is great.
 Great camera. I actually bought this camera for security and also to watch for solicitors lol. We live in a nice neighborhood and we get ALOT of solicitation in my cul-de-sac. They dont bother to read the signs either.<br/>I really like the "live" feature but sometimes it can be a bit choppy. I have to agree with others about the slight delay in time when someone triggers the camera to when the footage is sent to your phone. Its maybe a few seconds though.<br/>So far so good.
 Bought 3 cameras a few days before leaving the house for a couple weeks to be in warmer climates. Front door, back door and living space are covered.  Systems was really easy to set up, the Blink Ap walks you through set up. Could better position cameras but good enough for now.  Have been able to see when oil and package were delivered and when neighbor comes in to feed the cat and when a fox visited near front door just before dawn.  Definitely makes monitoring and feeling okay about being away.  Between the cameras and online thermostat there is some peace of mind, glad I bought Blink and will buy a couple more and position better.
 These are basically motion sensors that record. I would not really call it a camera because of limited software features. For example, you can not run different schedules unless you purchase a separate sync module. Even more, you can’t turn notifications off for certain cameras even if they are separate modules. System would be a lot more useful if there was more flexibility with scheduling and alerts.
 had a bit of trouble setting up with my Google pixel 2. They sent a new sync module but it still didn't allow me to get past the first step. I deleted the cache storage on my phone and for some reason turned on the location services which were not requested, but the system started working loving it so far
 Just opened<br/>Motion detector not working<br/>One camera has green spots all over<br/>Record time is to short<br/>Picture quality is ok not as good as ring<br/>Amazon is refunding the money<br/>I bought this in November and just opened<br/>Good customer service<br/>But I prefer a better camera
 These cams are extremely easy to set up and the mounting bracket pretty adjustable. The app works well. I am concerned with the quality. Seems cheap. Also, its ridiculous they say the batteries could last up to 2 years. Mine lasted 2 1/2 months.
 This system is great.  A friend of mine put all 5 up in less than 30 minutes and the storage is free, no additional fees is right on the money- who needs additional charges.  Great images and they work really well.  I can see everything from whereever I am - rain, sleet and snow.  I would recommend these to anyone.
 Super easy to setup, good for a basic security camera imagine is good, I love that is wireless. Downsize is that the storage fills up fairly quickly, also the mount is not good at all, someone can easily remove the camera from the location. Not at all of features.<br/>I dislike that you can record while in live view.
 I bought this to try in my back yard and after I hooked it up I found that it has sensitivity issues.  Basically if you set it to 5 or 4 you didn't capture the person until he already walked past the camera and you couldn't see them.Even with a 30 foot capture area. If you turned it to 6 it triggered off of every thing that moved like the wind blowing the grass etc. When I looked up this problem there were a ton of complaints for the same issue. I never returned it, and just left it. Hooked it back up two nights ago in my kitchen and it seemed to work inside and was fairly accurate on 5.  Now Im home and wanted to turn the camera off so it doesn't send me a message every time I walk in the kitchen and the app just spins like it can't reach the cloud server.  Junk...
 Amazingly easy to install. Amazingly easy to check on my phone. Beyond my expectations for my first exterior security system. The small black cameras blend in with our black iron balcony. I hate seeing those large glaringly obvious ugly cameras on some properties. I want people to see my house, not my cameras.
 It is extremely slow to respond, on both Android and iOS, and sometimes doesn't respond at all. If I hadn't already spent so much money on these cameras, I would've replaced them a long time ago. The scheduling app is not intuitive and confusing to use. I've spoken to support many times and I am only ever told to power cycle the system, which I have already done multiple times.
 The blink cameras are okay for a quick inexpensive camera for a remote area such as a shed.  If you're  looking for a good all around system the blink is not it.  PROS-ez setup, wireless, no subscription fees.  CONS-Video quality, no continuous monitoring, limited cloud storage, motion detection is unreliable, the included mount is almost worthless, cannot limit the motion detection to a particular area to minimize nuisance alarms.  I filled the storage up in one day because every car that drove by caused an alarm, when I reduce the sensitivity, people do not trigger an alarm.  UPDATE-Do not buy!  Included batteries died in only 5 days.
 Worst camera there is for $100.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Problem with syn togehter and confusing when setting up the name of the camera.<br/>-Motion sensor have to be 10 feet or else doesn't work.<br/>-Slow and there's delay once start recording the motion sensor.<br/>-Not much of option for settimg up any features.<br/>-quality is incredibly horrible. you can get 4K with this price.<br/>-nightvision can't see anything over 20 feet<br/><br/>Pros<br/>-can set it up with Alexa<br/>-battery does last 2 years, just make sure nothing moves around in front of camera for 2 years.<br/>-good customer support<br/>-small and compact and put it anywhere. Make sure people don't steal it once they sees it.<br/>-waterproof
 I would highly recommend the Blink security system.  It was very easy to install and set up and works great!  The outdoor one is working fine tonite when it is only 15 degrees outside and the night vision works very well.  I purchased a three camera indoor Blink system also and one of the cameras was malfunctioning and customer service was very helpful and replaced it right away.  Everything is working great.
 The picture quality is fantastic on these cameras. For the price they can't be beat. We had family over yesterday and i was showing it off. My dad, brother in law, mother in law and sister all bought 2 or 3 camera sets from Amazon right there in my living room while we were talking about it. I should be a spokesperson for Blink!!
 I just installed them a day ago.  Setting them up, adjusting settings, and taking sample photos/videos were VERY easy and intuitive using the app.  The pictures were clear even with the image saturation due to the Christmas lights.  One of the cameras was triggering every minute or so but once I realized the sensitivity was maxed out, it was not an issue at all to get it into a working range.  Turns out it was responding to shadows from the inside house lights being walked in front of or turned off, so it can be very sensitive!  Now they both pick up us leaving the house, letting the dog out, etc. (i.e. things you would expect) and I'm pretty happy with them overall.
 After struggling with Zmodo cameras, updating firmware for DAYS and an updated app that left more to be desired than the original app, purchased these for outside my house. The app is super user friendly and the cameras were set up in just a few minutes. Can’t comment on the batteries yet but the picture and sound quality is great. Definitely worth the price and will be replacing more of our other cameras with these soon!
 I added this to my other Blink cameras.  It works well, especially the picture quality at night.  However, it is limited in function options and the sensitivity is a pain to try and adjust to an active environment.  There is no way that you will get 2 years of battery life if you use it in an active environment.
 The only thing missing from these cameras to get a perfect review is having the ability to set motion detection zones.<br/>The sensibility from 6-7 are a huge difference<br/>If you pick 7 you will get nothing but notifications from the shadows of moving tree branches.<br/>And if you bring It down to 6 you miss people walking by the camera at a fast pace. I currently have two blink cameras and I have one on the right hand side of my house where there Is not much movement at all from tree branches. I have that one set to 8 and It does great.<br/>Will definitely be buying more cameras to the house once there is an update on the motion detection zones.
 Simply awesome! No wiring or electricity required for the cameras -- I installed 4 cameras in under 30 minutes. Takes great pictures and video. I couldn't be happier.
 Great around my house on the out side.  Not good if you put in an active area like over the garage. Batteries for an out too fast.
 So easy to set up for me.  Visual quality is great.  I easily download to my phone any video clips that I wish to save.  The only drawback that I can see is that if I happen to watch a live clip, I cannot select record at that same time.  The need has yet come up to do that, but wish it was possible.  I've been up and running for a month with no issues!!!!!
 Excellent video quality. Easy set up and to adjust settings for your needs. I'm very happy with the Blink XT and am buying two more for family X-mas. (Buy the adjustable mounts sold separately)<br/>I'll add a photo later.<br/>UPDATE: Does not work well below 10 degrees F, not even with ac power.
 Easy set up.. I was worried about the Wi-Fi not picking up the camera's but it works great in a 1300 sq.ft house. I'm sure if you own a 3000 sq. Ft. House or more you may have a problem.. Maybe... I don't know... I'm very happy with it so far... Pictures are nice and clear.. I recommend it.. Get it..You won't be sorry..
 For people that have no cameras and do not want to run power cords to better cameras,,,then these will work and they do work well.  I am not sure if someone could identify a thief or IF the cops could use them for identification and prosecution.  For me, they work and will do what I want them for.
 The set up was pretty easy. Picture quality is excellent and the ability to customize many different settings is great. The only downside and it's a big one, the mounting setup is terrible. Anyone can just reach up and pull it off your wall with a light tug. And I emphasis light. It also doesn't swivel so i couldn't mount it exactly where I wanted to.
 We bought a set on here for like $25 and they work better than these. They don’t catch everything or they catch too much. There isn’t a happy medium. Battery doesn’t last  long if they are used. We are not pleased at all with these.
 not bad, wished it was made of metal instead of plastic.  took about 5 minutes to sync up.  pleasantly surprised to see i'm able to monitor from work with live feed.  mounting hardware SHOULD OF been made of metal, but it's plastic, so i was a little worried about over tightening the one mounting bracket.
 The motion alerts are a single charm on your phone (assuming it’s not on silent).  Not sufficient to get your attention if you were sleeping or not looking at your phone at the time of the alert.<br/><br/>For example if you have a camera in your garage where there should be absolutely no movement at night.  You might want to set an alarm mode for that camera i.e. “annoy me until I deal with you mode.”  But all you will get a little diminutive popup that you can check when the bad guy enters your room.
 Very pleased so far.  Setup was super simple even with having to move the dongle to a better location in the home. The options have plenty of features for a completely wireless system. The clips have recorded clear images and have had no motion detection issues.<br/><br/>Will update if I begin having trouble at a later date.
 Have had it installed for a little over a month. Install was super easy. Works great, picture quality is fantastic. My only issue is the range between Camera, base &amp; router. I had too move the bas and router to the side of the house where the camera is to get a consistent connection.
 I have to say, I am very impressed with these cameras. Very easy to set up. The video quality is very good. I love the controls you have for each camera. I also love that each camera gives you a temperature reading of room. I recommend getting the optional mounting brackets with swivel base, one included has limited range.
 I use blink for home security at my front door. I am notified of any movement at my entrance and I'm provided with a stored recording of the event. It was easy to set up and install and works as advertised.
 Easiest wifi setup - have tried previous cameras in years past and setup was difficult. This was easy. The only difficulty here is actually opening the unit to install the batteries and obtain the serial number ... HINT ... during setup there is a provided video which REALLY helps instruct you in removing the back panel of the unit. The written instructions are not as clear.
 I'm really happy with this purchase. Installation and setup is easy. Video and pictures are very sharp. So happy I bought another one. I highly recommend this product.

We live in a small town and on the busiest road in town so I really have no worries, but like most towns there are a few people that just make you a little uncomfortable. 3 days after setting up our cameras a local transient and addict/alcoholic walked right through my front door at 3 in the afternoon while everyone (my husband, my 2 small children and myself) were home in the living room. With the footage from the cameras the police were able to positively identify the man right away. It also catches all the critters prowling around. Overall I’m very impressed. Attached is a video taken at 1:34am with the night vision.
 Disappointed. Have two cameras one out and one in both have five bars and I can manually look and picture clear as can be. However, despite sensitivity to motion being on high neither camera triggers a recording. I’ve walked in front of them, waved, had deliveries and nothing. Useless and a waste of my time.
 The camera works great and allows for remote access viewing. The app is user friendly and allows you to set up schedules for camera to be armed for recording when motion is detected. The best feature is that there is no contract fees each month. Other cameras I researched required monthly fees for cloud storage.
 I have had the blink 1 camera kit one month.  Paid $140.  Would I buy an add-on? Definitely not. It has a huge delay to start recording.  It only records half of the event.  It records UPS when they are already walking away from door. Not as they are walking to door.  I have tried every setting on max.  My WiFi signal show strong.  I moved camera from to different locations and no change.  It triggers excellent, but there’s a huge delay from when motion detection triggers to when it actually starts recording
 After two days of trying to get it to work I am ready to toss it!! Occasionally it works very briefly and then stops. Motion detection was working and then stopped.  Was able  to get a picture but now that has stopped. Live view was working although it took a very long time. Now, camera not working. Useless !!
 Had them for 2 months, all cameras work great and the alerts come about 1-2 seconds after the activation. So far no battery issues but I would recommend buying separate mounts as the included mounts are very flimsy and fragile. I will be adding more  to my 4 camera system soon. Best bang for your buck out there
 Very simple setup and installation. Works great if you’re wanting to keep an eye on s place that doesn’t see much activity. Does NOT work great if you have or need full time security cameras. It only saves things in 60 second clips and then restarts. I’ve missed some of the needed footage. Really annoying that your phone beeps every minute that a new clip was recorded if there is activity. But I can’t shut it off cuz I need to know when renters arrive at the houses. The battery’s are already low and it’s only been a month. Not a good fit for what I needed at all. Wish i could return them.
 We have a summer home in a very windy, rugged, cold, rural area and have 2 of these camera's outside, and 2 inside.  Installation was a snap, and they have worked flawlessly.  We travel a lot, and the camera's allow us to check-out our vacant home 24/7 from anywhere in the world.  Very reassuring.
 Bought this for a home security (against break ins etc) and I love how fast the alerts come to my phone. Easy to install and set up. My only complaint is when it detects motion it only records for about 5 seconds as opposed to recording until the movements stop. That said it will start recording again if you continue to remain in its field of view. Great video and sound quality for the product.
 Camera great for basic security needs.  Clear day video and pics. Night also very good. Stock mount terrible, flimsy.  Purchased after market case and mount much better.  Biggest negative is battery died 2 weeks in high traffic area. Either move to less active or buy cord and plug in. Do recommend.
 It definitely has its positives where it’s quick to install and all around a decent product. But when you try to watch a live video to let it continue to feed.... overall the thing just times out. I keep getting messages that the system is busy so I can’t keep an eye on things as they happen. We have a nanny so these are decent, but the loud click and bright blue light really kind of give it away.<br/><br/>It’s a camera you’d like if you weren’t home when things happened, but it’s not great for being what it’s supposed to be.
 I love the blink cameras! We have our whole house set up with Alexa and all the amazing things she can do! (Manage my security cameras, turn on my lights, play music through out my house, etc!) these cameras are small and inconspicuous and records a very clear picture and very clear sound! Good purchase!
 I've tried to make this work for our family.  It captures the tail end of one of our cars just as it is entering the garage.  When we get packages delivered it shows them walking away.  The setting are set to the highest/best they can be.  We go through batteries on them monthly.  Waste of money.
 I purchased this because my dad got this one and it works for him at a greater distance between camera and module than what I have mine set up. I am so far extremely unhappy with this product. I purchased it so I could keep an eye on my horses while I am on vacation. I set it up, which the instructions are very poor. I have the sync module a mere three feet from WiFi. Purchased a very good new strong router. Have my camera at 78 feet from my sync module and router in direct line of sight. I get Interupted signal, no signal and lost signal. Sadly I am on vacation now and can’t return it, but if this continues, it will be returned on 1/18/19 when I get home!
 Really enjoy this camera. Gives us an extra piece of mind knowing we can check on our home when we are out of town. The only downside to this product was the customer service we received. The customer service was done through email and it could have been resolved more quickly. Took days (business days) to receive responses, which prolonged the period. For the price, the customer service could've been a bit better. Other than that, great product overall.
 Pleasantly surprised!  Was very easy to install (took about 15 minutes).  Has a simple app that's easy to use.  We replaced a Reolink unit that was battery powered because we wanted a camera with longer battery life.  If the Blink battery last two years as advertised, I'll be happy with that.
 WOW! Maybe the easiest installation ever. Know your home network password and you're in.<br/>Janky appearing camera mount is easily installed and works satisfactorily within tolerable limitations. Excellent picture quality.<br/>Too soon to comment on long-term performance.<br/>Highly recommended!
 This is an inexpensive system but it has a few flaws. The re-action time stinks-meaning sometimes I see the person walking away by the time my phone is notified. If you try to blow up a paused shot it just gets blurred. If you have a big house-the sync module isnt as effective for all cameras. For instance, my front and side of house cameras work great, the one in the rear of the house, furthest from sync module ---not as well. Its off-line alot.  Lastly. the span is not as wide as it should be. I guess I expected more but got what I paid for. I suggest you spend more money and get a better system.
 The night vision is defective. Unless you want to record an area that is always well lit I’d find a different product. Customer service was very poor too, a call. Center in India that was so loud the rep and I both had to shout to be heard. I expected much more from an amazon owned product.
 Installation was a breeze and took no more than a few minutes. The only real draw back is the video lag. It’s around a 5-7 second delay. We will get notified someone is there but by the time we look at the live view they can be out of sight. Still not bad since you can review the footage after the fact.
 Easy to set up and works great. The app you can use with it is the best I've used with all my various cameras in the past. Works with my Echo Dots and Alexa. It is easy to mount pretty much anywhere you would want to put it. I have no complaints about this camera. Great job Blink!
 These things were very simple to setup. I've had them for one year and haven't needed to replace any batteries as of yet. Just make sure the cameras are in range of wifi.
 ... unless I can figure out a way to insure that the area where the camera attaches to the mounting bracket can be secured well enough to have confidence that it will not fly away with the first stiff breeze. It's hard to believe that a company would keep producing such a cheap and flimsy camera mount that is intended for outside use. I cannot be the first person to have had this concern. For the money, I'll cobble together something with Ring or Wyzecam.
 Very good resolution, and the sensitivity and area of ​​vision can be adjusted according to preference.  In comparison with other cameras, the battery lasts long
 I liked the idea that this was an Amazon product so i was hoping it was going to be better quality.. The video and picures were poor quality compared to the Arlo system i have at one of my proprties.. Also when i was testing to see how acurate the camera were working they were not picking up movement everytime only when big movement happened which was concerning especially when the movement at my front door was not setting the cameras off. I recommend spending a little more money for better quality cameras.
 I love these cameras! They aren’t “top knotch” grade, but they definitely get the job done. The motion sensor works well. I wish the app could have more features, but it works for the price. I purchased these during the Black Friday sale. I wish I had ordered more during the sale.
 Throwing these mass produced pieces of junk in the trash. I have had nothing but issuees. The customer service team doesn't speak English. The camreras will not connect to to anything. I am tried of dealing with garbage Amazon is pumping out. Stay aways from this. It doesn't connect well.  3 hours spent with the customer service of blink. Considered this trashed.
 So far, so good. Takes good video and the wide angle covers a broad area. Sensitivity can be a little sketchy though. Too high and it takes videos of leaves blowing across the yard. Until I got it right, I had 25 videos after the first hour. Solid construction but I'm skeptical about the bracket. It looks like it might break off with high winds because of how it fastens to the camera. Hope not... if it holds up, I may purchase more cameras because one controller (included) can handle up to 4 cameras.
 It’s a good camera if your looking for something simple. I bought this camera in November 2018 and so far the battery it came with has been great. The only thing is that when it rains it does get a bit foggy but other than that it does the job.
 Absolutely love this system, as it is completely wireless!! The cameras run off of 2 AA  lithium batteries that are not included. I purchased the covers, but have read many people use them without. Great picture/view and love receiving notifications when they pick up motion detection.
 So far the cameras are working okay..the problem is....they don't always work correctly.  I noticed that they have a harder time when the Sync Module is not getting as good of a signal.  I love Amazon products but when the Sync Module is only like 15 feet from where the camera is,  it should get more than 1 bar.  My house isn't that big so I am not sure why all 5 cameras only have at the most 3 bars( and that's only the one right near the Sync Module)  The rest either have 2 bars or 1. Going to give these a try for a few days longer and if I keep getting spotty motion detection due to the Sync Module I might have to return these.
 My barn doesn't have electricity and I had a mare due to foal and wanted to be able to see what was happening.  Super easy to set up to wifi, easy to place, app is great, and this thing performed better than expected... foal was born last night and I didn't have to sleep in the cold... saw when it was time to go out, and was there for the whole thing!!  Best part.. I have movie clips of the event, all while I was busy helping the mare.  Totally recommend.
 Easy to install, the phone apps works seamlessly and the picture/ video quality is excellent.  The motion detection is very sensitive and picked up a cat walking by. I set up the device in a location that only is activated when people come to the front door. The free storage in the cloud is a plus.
 I bought 2 camera with system in May. It's only November  but replaced battery 3 times already. I don't get too many motion detection but the camera's eats up battery like crazy because the the sensors are always active. Battery doesn't even last 2 months.  Other than that, all is good.  Product can be improved for power efficiency.
 I've been really impressed with this little camera. Super easy set up, great picture, great audio recording.<br/><br/>The base it comes with isn't great so it was worth getting an aftermarket one just for the increased ability to manipulate and angle the camera. No matter what, the camera just screws off the base so dont worry about getting something bulletproof with three inch screws, someone can still pull it right off if they really want to.<br/><br/>The best part is the "Activity Zones". You can highlight zones in a grid overlayed with the picture to keep it from triggering every time a car drives by.<br/><br/>Now that I have the one, I'll probably go back and get a few more.
 Video is clear both day and night.  Batteries do not last as long as advertised when used continuously.  Installed in Sept, this year, camera recently began malfunctioning.  Began hearing a continuous relay click when camera activated and started recording.<br/>Notified seller, awaiting response.
 Pros:<br/>1. complete wire less and is powered by battery, thus easy to install and move around<br/>2. installing/adding cameras via mobile app is very easy<br/>3. giving a peace of mind i.e. better than not having any security cameras around the house<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. expensive compare to the quality and reliability the camera provides<br/>2. mobile app sometimes can be slow and sometimes shows busy<br/>3. cameras become foggy sometimes<br/>4. 1 camera has very obvious horizontal lines and blurry especially in night mode<br/>5. false alarms on regular basis even with default setting<br/>6. not record the footage when it is expected to even with the same movement at the same spot on regular basis<br/>7. do not trust its temperature beta feature, it is varies on different camera even after being calibrated (sometimes 5+ degree difference)<br/><br/>Hoping in the near future, it will have app made available on the Windows and/or MacOS<br/><br/>Update: 3 months later, 1 camera is low on battery with minimum of usage where cameras are only at night
 I really love these. I purchased a two pack to start with and added an outdoor one. My only complaint is when I put up my outdoor one it was too far from the source so it didn’t work. So I had to move it closer. Everything else is great.<br/>No wires; no contracts and long life batteries❤️
 The setup was relatively easy, and the picture quality is pretty good. However I do have concerns about the mounting bracket and how it attaches to the camera.  I fully expect to find the camera on the ground some day.  It's not what I would call a solid mounting device.  The bracket, and its attachment to the camera, could have been a lot better.
 The product was easy to connect to my wifi system and has been in use for 2 weeks.  I have not had any false alerts with my two cameras on the outside of the house.  I did not use the screw to attach my cameras but bought picture hanger tape that works better on my concrete structure.
 super easy to install.  but the motion detection is lacking....  I understand the system has to "wake up" but someone will be already walking away by the time it detects motion.... makes it useless.  Back camera is constantly giving me false alerts.  Really disappointed..... probably going to return.
 I’ll start with 5 stars. Although this product is not sold outside US I’ve bought a set of 2 and setup was QUICK, only issues were: sync module HAS to be close to router, and when i tried to set up one camera for the first time a bit far away from sync module it did not worked, had to get closer to sync for setup but then i was able to position camera were I liked. Wide angle is good, motion sensitivity good, TEMP sensor is welcomed for a child monitor mode need to test the alarma though. So wait for more tests to come. Bought the Set of 3 is the best deal.
 Picked this two camera pack up right before Christmas when it was $137 with a free echo dot gen 3.  Can’t be any happier. The video is clear as day. The night video is good but if there is any light or bright moon it some times washes out a little. Only down side is the hub doesn’t reach that far.  My house isn’t huge and when I place the hub in the middle of both cameras I get maybe two bars for each  still works good but I will have to buy another hub for the backyard. All and all I am very pleased with this and couldn’t bet $137 for two cameras the hub and an echo dot.
 I have the Blink system in my home and wanted to put an outside camera on my front door. It works great anytime someone puts something in my mail box or opens my storm door it captured it in HD res. with sound. Sends my a notification on my cell phone to review it. Blinks the best way to protect your house inside and out.
 It seems like a good camera. Decent quality, lots of settings in the app to mess with, and easily installation. One major problem I’ve had with it though. It doesn’t actually pick up movement and send me a notification about it. I’ve seen it do this for others but it doesn’t work for me. This completely ruins this security camera being of any use to me, since it only records when there’s motion detected.
 The batteries that came with the product only lasted two weeks with very minimal usage (less than one hour of total clip time, low settings, low traffic area, etc.)  I happened to get a Blink email requesting feedback that same day, so I responded but have not heard back.  I have since purchased and installed a solar panel as an alternative power source.
 I bought these to keep an eye on my cats and they work great. I am impressed with the quality of the cameras, really clear pictures even at night, and the ease of them being battery operated therefore no pesky wires to try and hide from my crazy cat that chews everything within reach!
 Easy to set up.  Very clear pictures.  Very little delay.  You can arm/disarm all or each camera individually from your phone.  You can change the sensitivity and video settings from your phone for each camera individually.
 I have had my 2 camera Blink XT for about 2 weeks. I set it up and installed the cameras in about 30 min. IT was very easy and everything worked as advertised. Cameras activate for a person but are not set off by the cats. This is perfect for us, but if you want small animals to activate the cameras the sensitivity can be increased. Would prefer if the mount was a little more heavy duty, but it works.
 Easy setup, all features worked but the camera displayed an all green screen  Customer service responded satisfactorily but could not fix over several firmware updates.  I think its because the outdoor temperature dropped to 10 degrees F- the XT is rated for -4 deg F., When I brought the camera inside, the green screen went away.  I received a replacement, so we will see what happens.
 I bought this on Black Friday, already it decides when it wants to work and when it doesn’t.  Pointed at my door my (husband is an IT guy so it’s set up fine) and I’d say it detects 30% of movement at my front door. Most times people come over it never goes off. What’s the point of having a camera that doesn’t go off?
 I currently have 3 Blink cameras set up on the exterior of our home.  They have been in place for a month or so.  They were easy to set up and install.  They work very well and are simple to operate.  We use them all of the time.  Clear picture for sure during daylight hours.  Nite time is a little more of a challenge.  We are still experimenting with the best places to locate them to get a picture that is good enough to clearly ID what comes into the site line of the Blink during hours of dark.<br/>In summary...for the small investment we have made to get Blink cameras we are very satisfied with their performance.  We will definitely be purchasing additional cameras.<br/>Thank you Blink Team!
 Excellent, clear, foolproof instructions for the setup that made it a snap!  I especially appreciate the scannable serial numbers and the simple, intuitive IPhone app. The packaging and design is something Steve Jobs would have been proud of. Love the simplicity and elegance of the design. I was up and running 20 minutes after opening the box.
 As a review based buyer, I felt the need to give my feedback.  I purchased this unit about a month ago, it’s perfect for my application.  I was a little concerned with peoples 1-2 star reviews focused on battery and motion false alerts.  I am happy to say that I have had zero issues with either concern.  I placed my camera under the overhang of my roof faceing the busy street and front door/garage. I live in a small city on a state highway this camera with adjustment is able to isolate constant car travel and side walk congestion.  I am very happy with it!  Make sure you clean the area it is mounted well including cob webs.  I will add a video clip or picture soon!
 Really loving this.  Having fun with it too.  Great for piece if mind.  It all set up in like 2 minutes.  Super simple and easy.
 This is my first security camera and I’m quite pleased with the video quality.  The mounting screw seems a little flimsy and anyone can walk up to the camera and steal it.  The camera does a good job of activating when there is movement and turning off after the time that I set.
 Have found no way to disable the red LED "motion sensor activated light" on front of camera.  This light is visible from any area or angle an intruder may be approaching from, or entering.  Not much of a security camera with this flawed feature.  Bought a one camera system to try before spending lots of money to purchase the 8 cameras I needed, glad I did.  Will be sending back for refund, and no further purchases.
 I just bought this outdoor version... I have 3 of the indoor type mounted outside... Been out there 2 years now... The night vision of the outdoor version is useless ... The indoor models work best but not good....
 Good picture from the camera. But the cameras are made cheap. The worst is the plastic attachments. They break easily. One of my cameras fell off the attachment, onto the ground and my dog chewed it up. That hurt...Opening the back to change batteries is hard, and I’m afraid the plastic will break. Fix the mounting attachment and battery opening and this would be a great security camera.
 It is very easy to set up and start using.  The system does a good job but settings are not very accurate.  The sensitivity setting and others to fine tune are just okay.  That is why I did 4 stars.  Otherwise super easy to install and start using.  Quality is fairly clear as well.
 Likes: Battery operates, can mount almost anywhere<br/><br/>Dislikes: Motion alerts are delayed in getting to your device, the camera recognition of movement is so slow (3 second lag easily), fish eye view restricts visibility.<br/><br/>Had very high hopes for these but ended up returning and buying cheaper knock off cameras that work better
 I like that their is no added cost after purchase, I like how easy it is to setup, for the price the picture is clear. I don't know about battery wear since only been up a week. I wish that WiFi distance was longer, but that could be my building. I would recommend this product.
 For the price it is a good camera. However, if you need 24/7 surveillance and need to access the camera more than once a day, then the batteries are not going to last you long. Mine lasted a month and when I replaced the batteries they died within a few hours. I’m exchanging the camera and hoping the new one is better.
 Pro’s<br/>-Easy to install, video quality, size, app and alerts work well<br/>Con’s<br/>-Scheduling does not allow you to schedule individual cameras at different times, for instance have your outside ones on at certain times and interior ones off can not able to be scheduled. You can only enable and disable individual  cameras via the app.
 These were easy to set up and work OK. Triggering is a bit delayed. Resolution is not 1080 HD. The mount is not very robust. It would be easy for someone to pop it off and walk away with it. I have disconnected it when trying to adjust the angle. These were shipped as a kit with an Echo Dot. There is very limited functionality. The Echo can only arm or disarm the cameras. The cameras do not work with Google Home.<br/>Was able to catch package delivery and a feral cat that has been sneaking in the cat door at night.
 Purchased this product 2 weeks ago one of the cameras started malfunctioning ie: stuttering clips, some clips don’t render/register just showing a picture when supposed to capture 5sec clips, poor connections to sync module and WiFi even though the 2nd camera that works perfectly fine is a further distance from the sync and router they will tell you do everything in the book to go around it still having issues called multiple times having 30min+ conversations was told the last time I talked on the phone with them that they will send me an email will diagnostics and a plan to further assist the issue which they never did so no I wouldn’t suggest this camera to anyone.
 These cameras come with the worst mount on the market.  They easily can fall off or be stolen.  In order to get a decent mount, you have to spend another $7-$20 per camera.<br/><br/>As far as the actual camera, they work great and are easy to set up.  I have one of my five that seems to have a halo, so I need to return it.
 Hoping to send it back and maybe get a replacement. Supposedly a year warranty. It's not overly used, so no reason the battery should need to be replaced already. Lately it just always says live view failed or camera busy. The connection was good so I don't understand what the deal is. The forums and help pages do not help.
 I do like the video quality of the cameras and the ease of use. However, one of my two cameras list sound within about 6 hours of being mounted. It is being replace by Blink at no charge but I am now regretting my purchase a bit. It is a little concerning that I had problems almost immediately.
 Very happy until it rained. The lens fogged up even though the unit is sheltered. It would be better if it had two-way talk, but for what it is compared to a fully wired system, I think it’s pretty good. No storage fee is a plus. I just installed them, so we’ll see how they do long term...
 Good video with sound, easily installation. I wish the app provided a continuous live feed upon opening instead of just displaying a screenshot image. My only problem is with the mounting hardware. It does not provide a secure platform and I have concerns that my camera will fall off from wind.
 Less than an hour i had all 5 cameras installed and online!!!! the only thing i don't like is the hub range, i had to install outside the house to get coverage of the 5 cameras. i don't test check the coverage via mobile line yet, tomorrow i'll update this review, till now them works really great!
 Bought these cameras in December and synced to my Wi-Fi but didn't have installed as my Wi-Fi router went out and I had a delay in getting a new one.  Now that I have a new router, I've tried for 5 days with Tech Support to connect my sync module to my new router. The sync module will not recognize the new Wi-Fi router or allow me to change it. Tech support will only answer my emails during the night and tell me over and over to repeat processes that I've already done. I've sent screenshots showing them that I do not have that option of instructions. Tech support now will not even answer my messages. DO NOT BUY this system. It is a complete waste of money!
 Set up for reasonably easy although not great like Nest or Ring. Resolution is good. Customer service Incase you have a question is great. The only reason I gave it one star less is because a night vision in the dark is poor. Also the clip that comes with the cameras don’t swivel so that’s a bummer.
 I love these camera’s. They have a great image quality! Very easy to set up. The email notification is my favorite thing about Blink.<br/>I have a traditional CCTV system as well and the image quality is better! You do need to have strong WiFi especially for outside camera’s. I love that these camera can be moved very easily! The motion trigger works great as long as to can position the view to capture motion going across instead of towards the camera.<br/>Now if Blink can come out with a video doorbell...it would be perfect!
 Super easy to install and setup app. App walks you through the entire wifi setup. Mounted outside in less than 15 minutes. I get great video and still picture quality, and notices to my phone where ever I am. Definitely recommend and will be purchasing two more in the future. Great camera setup.
 The camera worked as described in daylight. However despite the efforts of the tech support and their replacement of the camera, the infrared was totally useless.  I returned the camera.
 Blink was very easy to install. I am typically not good at these things, so when I say it is easy..it is easy.<br/>I like the fact that it can be monitored from both my phone and my wife's phone and that we both receive notifications when the system is tripped. Each of the cameras can be independently armed or disarmed.<br/>I purchased the 5 outdoor camera set, although I am using several of these indoors. The resolution is terrific.<br/>Just had it for 1 day, but so far am pleased as punch.
 I love these cameras I purchased so I could see I could keep an eye on my elderly neighbor who fell and I didn't know it to help her get up in her yard. Works great and she is very happy to know I know when she is going out
 There’s cameras work great and what a great picture. But only two stars because the batteries don’t last if you keep it on so that it records when there’s motion. You would have to change the batteries every 11-13 days.
 Excellent cameras!  We just hung them up, no wiring needed, downloaded the app, very simple! The pictures are very clear, and it notifies you on your phone if you camera has been set off by motion and then you can look to see what it was.  Can look back during the day/night at any triggers as well as watch it live.  It caught a tornado on ours as it came thru. It also has clear sound.  Great cameras!
 Got this as a gift for my boyfriend for our home. Picture quality is excellent. Works great. Only had one issue so far when we left for Xmas (about 40 min away).. system wouldn’t pull up live view or take any videos. Unsure why. Started working as soon as we pulled back into driveway.
 1- if ur  expecting to read license plates, don’t - see enhanced vid<br/>2- Motion trigger is inconsistent, there are no zones that are configurable<br/>3-  Live view is not continuous. You have to click continue every 10 seconds ( could be changed in a firmware update but who knows)
 Not what I expected. It’s only been 3 months since I got these cameras and I’ve already had to replace batteries on 3 cameras. I use these cameras on my multi family home and what I’ve realized is besides that the batteries won’t last 2 years like they claim, this is not the system you want to get if you have a little foot traffic on any cameras. If I had to buy again, I would not get this system.
 Love this camera and that I can see video playback without a charge. Great that you can set the sensitivity so it does not go off at the smallest movement. I am going to purchase another for the back of my house.
 I have strongly mixed feelings about the Blink cameras.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Great battery life<br/>No wires means you can put these ANYWHERE, quick and easy<br/>Decent quality video clips<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>IFTTT integration is a simple on/off<br/>RBoy had a GREAT integration for Smartthings but that was killed the day before Blink was purchased by Amazon<br/>No motion zones leads to too many false positives
 These cameras are very easy to setup.  The connections started off strong, but after about 3-4 days, 2 of my 3 cameras began not picking up on movement.  Everything else worked, real-time video and pictures, but even with the sensitivity at its highest, I could walk in front of them and they would not trigger.
 This was super easy to install.  I was a intimidated at first but then I decided to just read the directions to get a feel for how to install the app and connect to our WiFi.  Before I knew it, I was already done with the technology part.  The directions were easy to follow.  As for the cameras, we installed 5 in less than 40 minutes.  I would definitely recommend to family/friends.
 Was having quality issues, but support was very fast to respond. Received replacement within a few days. Quality is as good as more expensive cameras I have. Software not quite as good (can't take a random snapshot, or view portrait easily if camera is rotated). Well with the cost.
 The Blink XT camera came in the mail quickly and in perfect condition! Very easy to activate and install! No wires to hassle with,  and it's very sleek! The motion detection sensitivity is adjustable. The night vision is very clear,  as well as the audio.  Live streaming from your phone is real time. You also get notifications on your phone when any activity is recorded. Clips get saved on a blink app you install,  and you can download the ones you want to save to your cloud account.  I took a trip to Chicago this past weekend and felt relaxed knowing my blink Camera was watching my home and I could check in from time to time from my phone.  So this even works while you are far away from home! You can buy one blink Camera with one modem kit,  and you can later but more single cameras to add to the one modem very easily.
 The concept is good however there is a  hub less than the size of a cigarette pack that has to be plugged in all the time. The install was fairly easy.  I hooked up 2 camera and it took about 10 minutes.  I was really let down by the picture quality.  it was almost dusk with plenty of sunlight but the picture quality was blued and not ver detailed.  I think they are not there yet with the development.  for about $60 a piece, i expected better picture quality.
 myself and a friend bought these and have had multiple issues with them. I do like how compact they are. The mounts they come with are total junk and they fall off if bumped at all. IR doesn't work on several of my units now after less then 2 months. very dissapointed
 Resolution is good.<br/>Battery powered is nice.<br/>BUT, in my opinion, it’s no match to Nest cameras. Clips can’t be more than 60 seconds and there’s no way to view via PC. App doesn’t open to a live view, rather a snapshot made during setup/placement<br/>I suppose if I had any area where there should never be any activity or movement this would be an OK option to send an alert<br/>Nest has revamped its pricing for cloud storage and I find it reasonable for the peace of mind
 One the best - and most elegantly designed products I’ve ever seen !  Manufacturing/build quality is also outstanding. The camera itself is waterproof for intended outdoor applications. The back cover seals very well, and it’s light enough even with the two AAs installed, to mount properly with its included mounting bracket and the single wood screw. Didn’t even need to drill a starter hole to fix the unit onto the siding board above our front door. Default image quality settings are crisp and will work for for most applications, but you can also change the recording settings to “Enhanced” via the iOS App if you don’t care about saving the most storage space (or “Saver” if you do.)
 Love ease of set up. Would like to see microphone used as two way option on new models. May need to add wifi extenders to boost signal, or add a sync module. Have issue due to aluminum siding on picking up signal to far side of house. Brackets are to easy for someone to just take camera so mount out of reach or upgrade bracket. Live feed and notifications works great.
 Product came today. All cameras appeared heavily used before. I am going to place another order today. Hopefully this time I will get a brand new set.<br/><br/>Addendum: 2nd also looked used. A few finger prints on the cameras. The seller showed clearly inform buyers that the cameras are refurbished.
 Easy to install on home. Good range. I added a wi-fi network extender to reach the far corners of my home outside. Picture clarity is excellent.<br/>It takes a little trial and error to find correct sensitivities for each camera but this is quite simple to do. The auto alert on I-phone works very well.<br/>I would buy again.
 Batteries may last 2 years, as they say, but only if you don't use the camera.  I am using the camera, and the batteries lasted 1 month.
 Gave them a try....<br/>Bought the XT 5 pack 2 weeks ago. Installed them and was impressed so bought 2 more XT and 2 indoor cams.<br/><br/>All was going great until yesterday. Wind got up blowing tress and causing shadows and they went off 30 times an hour. Adjusted sensitivity down to 4 and still tons of alarms for crazy stuff.<br/>Took them down and boxed them up to send back.<br/><br/>Good concept and great idea but you have got to work out those issues before i can justify almost $1000 worth of cams.<br/><br/>Just bought the ring setup to give it a try.<br/>Wish it had worked out but glad you had the 30 day money back trial.
 Overall it was an easy install and picture is very clear. However, the only down side is that you only have access to it by phone or tablet.  If you need access on a desktop there is no option. This is the negative so far, but if you can get past that issue.  You are a good!
 Camera has adjustable sensitivity, adjustable video quality, time cam on and can have motion detection turned on and off through your smart phone. The only frustrating item (although very minor) is that periodically when attempting to view video clips or turning system off or on the Blink cloud is busy. Other than that, its a good system.
 The camera was very easy to install and is very convenient with no wires and few tools needed. The camera has continuously connected and disconnected from our internet (which continued to run Netflix on our TV at the same time so there was no internet problems). My biggest complaint is that you are not notified of a person being there I TIL the recording is complete.
 I bought 3 of these cameras, but only installed 2 of them. The first one I installed had the batteries due in less than 24 hours. Had to steal the batteries from the 3rd camera to get it back up and going again. When trying to watch live video feeds, I constantly get camera video unexpectedly stop and can't access either camera. Really disappointed and do not recommend buying them.
 The unit actually works well, however when you lock it into position, it is not sturdy enough and it will keep on moving
 Shocked to find this product does not work with a PC or Mac and is cell phone only.  Granted I guess I could buy a iPad Pro with a large screen for this, but that seems kind of silly.<br/>Such a basic misstep is probably why I am see all the sales for this unit.
 First product review. The product is decent and easy to set up and use. Some functions need to be fixed. The motion detection has limited range I would guess 20-30 feet. Perfect for a porch but doesn’t work well for longer driveways. Also, don’t like the live view. After every 30-45 seconds you have to hit continue to keep viewing live view instead of just streaming it.<br/><br/>Positive: I have 5 cameras 2 hubs and didn’t break the bank. Wireless, good picture quality and sound is surprisingly real good. Night vision works well to.<br/><br/>Negative: two cameras are low on battery power after just a month of limited use. Range of motion detection limited to about 25 feet
 Very easy setup, you can put them anywhere you want, I'm on my second year with the batteries. A couple of cons: no pinch to zoom, I wish I could talk back to whomever especially on the inside camera for the kids and when opening the app the images do not update automatically.
 Surprisingly good night imaging. The microphone in this unit picks up ambient sound from very far. I know this because wasps and birds keep triggering recordings. I wish there were settings to avoid this, but I am pleased with the camera and will purchase more units in the future.
 Its not a bad product. However, i was not very impressed by the cameras. Perhaps my expectations were too high. However, being an amazon product I did expect more.<br/><br/>My major gripe is that the motion detection sensor needs major improvement. I first had this mounted above my front door. At 5 and below the camera never turned on in time. When I received packages it never got the delivery persons face, only when they were walking away. Could be an issue for identifying porch pirates.<br/><br/>Putting the sensitivity level up did solve my last problem. However, I was now presented with a different issue. Anything with sensitivity level 6-9 created too many false alarms. It started catching anytime a bird flew by or anyone passing by in the street. I quickly filled up the allotted storage space (Which is free). It became a nightly chore to delete unwanted clips.<br/><br/>I decided to give RING a try. I much preferred this system over BLINK. What made the difference was the fact that I could set motion zones. With this i could turn the sensitivity all the way up but turn off motion sensor to areas I did not need to be monitored. I believe this is where the BLINK system failed. If amazon were to somehow incorporate a system like this I would definitely give it 5 stars and purchase more.
 AMAZING CLARITY AND SOUND QUALITY! Originally got one for a crazy neighbor and ended up getting the notifications (whether night vision or regular) sent to my phone showing I also have a crazy roommate! So discreet they've been right in front of it and never saw it.
 So far I have been pleased with the operations and performance.  I have been a little concerned with the mounting system since I live in a really windy area but so far I haven't had one fly away.  If they continued to operate well I will probably add additional cameras.
 This was a gift from my children. I LOVE it! I can be away from home and I get a notification that someone/something is on my porch! There is no monthly fee, you can add more cameras inside or outside. Was easy to install, people are not looking up when coming to your door, they are looking at doorbell. You can activate it and watch a live feed.
 I like that the camera is totally wireless and waterproof but it always starts recording too late. It essentially useless as home security.
 With solid, constant, and reliable internet, the Blink works great. Very happy with it. HOWEVER! I intermittently lose internet throughout the day (problems unrelated to the blink), and while I don’t expect the Blink to work without internet, I DO expect it to reconnect and start functioning again after the internet is reconnected without manual intervention. That is NOT the case. The only way to get it working again is to power cycle the system. Totally unacceptable, and it makes this product useless for me.
 The idea is nice. Bought the 2 set. Images are pretty good quality but the supposed 2 year battery is a complete lie. I set the images to 5 second clips, kept it out of the view of trees/sidewalk/street as recommended and the battery is dead within a month. Ok—maybe I got a dud but the system doesn’t even bother to alert you, it just goes dead hence the 1 star— as security cameras shouldn’t die without notification......
 Put the camera up yesterday after receiving it the day prior. Tested is quite a bit so far and it does not do what it is supposed to do which is record movement and alert you. It does once in a while but not consistently. I do not believe I have done anything incorrectly with the set-up...disappointed.
 I got this mainly to monitor my amazon packages and deliveries. It works exactly as advertised. I like the notifications to my phone. It’s nice to see whose is approaching my front door. Most of the time I can see who is at the door before they even knock.
 Pros: Great value. Easy to set up and use. Great customer support from blink. Free cloud storage. Great color video quality.<br/>Cons: Sync module has limited range - I have a big house and could not get good reception from the sync module to all of the cameras, too much distance to from sync module. I had to purchase a second sync module to cover entire home.<br/>The mount that comes with the camera is too easy to detach from the camers making it too easy for thieves to take the camera if it is within their reach. I brought the Wasserstein mounts that are a lot more sturdier and holds the cameras more securely.
 The price is fair and the camera works great.  We have one in the front and the back.  The black ones are for outside and uses IR to see in the dark and works well.  I understand the white ones for the inside does not use ir for the dark, it has a LED that lights up.
 Not the best product for outdoor camera. Too much false notification. I gave 3 stars due to convenience. ONE star for the delivery flex just tossed my package on to my porch, caught on camera. Please advice the delivery that you are contracted with to be careful with pacakges.
 I was really looking forward to trying this device when it was announced, and waited until it was available on Amazon. Why Amazon? Free two-day shipping &amp; best customer service. I have used DropCam and currently owning Piper NV for indoors. It has so much potential, but the motion detection does not work for me: too many false alarms, and missed capturing real motions.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Size. Very impressed, not sure how they managed to design such a small device.<br/>- Wireless, assuming the battery can last that long. But seriously, if the battery can last 6 months, that's good enough for me.<br/>- Easy to set up.<br/>- Free video clips. You do not see many companies offering this anymore.<br/>- IFTTT and Alexa integration.<br/>- Price.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Motion detection does not seem to work, I played between 1 to 6 on sensitivity but still. I received 8 alerts in an hour, but every clip I watched, I could not tell what was moving at all. I walked underneath it, nothing. Tried a few times. I will leave it for a few days before I return it, if it still does not work. I put it 9 feet up and almost looking downwards, not sure if this is related. When it was successfully detecting motion, there was an initial delay of a few seconds.<br/>- Open live stream or take snapshot takes 10+ seconds. They should take a snapshot when the app is opened.<br/>- Image quality is low.<br/><br/>Edit: I think for outdoor it just does not work for me, maybe it is the angel, or I do not know, it defeats the purpose for me. I put it indoor for a few hours and it seemed to work better, no false alarms.
 Added outdoor cameras to our camera group this year. Suggestion: Put outdoors on a separate sync module so you can leave them on 24/7 even when interior cameras are turned off. These work well &amp; we're satisfied enough that we've bought them for several different houses.
 Woulda have been five stars but connecting the camera to my internet for me was a nightmare. I would give customer service five stars, they where great with trying to help, eventually with enough searching on the internet I found out this system is pretty picky with what router your using. I use a netgear router and with some fooling around with dns and shutting off access control it final worked and has been running smoothly.
 I bought a 2 camera system and installed them in our vacation home, one over front door and the other overlooking the backyard. Setup was super easy &amp; installed just as easy. Menu options are easily tweaked for each camera. Sensitivity, night vision, record time, etc. Cloud storage is free ! 400 miles away &amp; they work great. Might have to move one under cover , it's sometimes gets blurry from rain.
 Worked only 1/2 day.  Had to reset four times wouldn't detect motion or send notification.  Wanted it to work so bad .... but got frustrating and packed it up and sent back.
 Super easy to set up and install. Works great so far! I have a Riolink camera similar to the blink, but it wont stay connected to wifi. The blink has it's own transmitter that plugs in next to your router. Now I can actually use a wireless monitoring system. Plus I saved &gt;$50!
 Love this product!  Sync well with my indoor kit. I will buy another. IR works very well for my needs. Worth the money!  I’m half way around the world &amp; I can see what’s happening live at anytime. Can’t beat that.<br/>Please BLINK add a floodlight add on and a solar power add on. Thanks!
 Pros:<br/>-Easy setup with iPhone and Alexa<br/>-Easy installation<br/>-Clear video &amp; sound<br/>-Night vision works very well<br/>-No hardwiring needed!<br/><br/>Cons<br/>-Video is slow to load on both the blink app and Alexa device.<br/>-5-7 second delay on video<br/>-Video times out quickly, and you have to keep hitting continue or else wait for it to load again.<br/><br/>All in all the positives outweigh the negatives. This is a great indoor/outdoor camera at a really good value. If you’re looking for a wireless option this is a great one.
 Amazon since you own Blink and Ring systems, could you please set up the Blink activity zones with the Ring activity zones system. I own both system and love them for different reasons, but It would be greatly appreciated if you could do this! Love both products!
 At first I wasn’t sure if this would flop like the rest of the easy to install Security videos but I decided to try. Awesome product I was shocked how quick I received notices when someone  would walk infront of the camera. 6 seconds. Wish it had two way speaker. But man you can control these camera easily with the app.
 Great Product minus one very important feature.  There is no way to setup a special "sound" when a motion alert is displayed for iphone users.  Huge oversight and why I am deducting two stars.  The missing two stars will promptly be added once this feature is available.  Thanks for making a wonderful product minus this one issue.
 Lots of false alarms. Example, recorded FEDEX guy leaving my porch but not dropping off.  So I got to see his backside. Great if I want to identify a thief to police, right!  Records the shadows created by car lights but not me walking through the field of view. Regretting this purchase.
 I just got this cameras yesterday around 8pm, so far i did install 2 and they were working fine, but today 1 of the cameras stop working already, i called tech support and they did find out that camera has an error and will need to be replaced, honestly i total dissaponint it so i may return all the system an i will get a differen one
 I'm able to maintain necessary surveillance for my side yard shed.  This camera and my motion light are just what I needed.  It has gone thru several rainy days and much solar heat and is still hanging in there.  Hope it continues, I'll be contented.
 I wanted to try out Blink camera. I’ve previously used ADT cameras but it was so expensive each month. I like Blink so far, that why 4 stars. Unless there is a different model or something I’m not aware of changing.. I wish the sound of motion sensor coming in was not so obvious, nor the blue light. Eventually I want to place a few outside and 2 more inside as well.
 Customer support exists only to waste your time and push you past warranty period.<br/><br/>Motion detection only records about 5 to 10 seconds AFTER it detects motion.  Pretty useless for security.<br/><br/>Motion detection scheduling just stopped working; it arms when it needs to disarm and vice-versa.<br/><br/>Cannot control via Web browser, you MUST download intrusive app to control the cameras.<br/><br/>These things are going in the trash.
 When it works the way is supposed to is great. Everything erratic, keeping my yi for now....update, really bad operation when away from home. No notifications, long buffering. Yi loads right up while blink is buffering. Clear cache more than once a day. Hindsight would not buy for using at work.
 Works well and so easy to install (double stick tape).  I started using Blink a couple years ago indoors and this is the first camera I am using outside.  Very happy with the ease of the system.
 The batteries that came with the camera were listed as lasting up to 2 years.  They only lasted 5 days and then were dead and had to be replaced with lithium ultra batteries...Blink should come up with better batteries or provide rechargeable batteries with the camera.

I e thing about this camera! It doesn't record 24/7 it only records when triggered by a moving object or noise records for 60 seconds max will get some action either before or after a person has walked by! If your trying to catch someone it's not easy with this camera!
 I like the easy installation without wires and video quality is great.  I dislike the live view feature that does not always work.  I have to retry several times and it always fails.  WiFi signal level to sync module is very strong, only 15 feet away from Wireless AP and at line of sight.  Both cameras are within 25 feet from sync module and 40 feet from wireless AP.  Live view fails to connect more often than successful connection.  Not a reliable way to check for detected motion in the premises.  Can not 'arm/disarm' cameras independently.
 Not very fond of them, Went to Arlo camera system instead, much happier
 I think it's going back. I have it looking out the side of my house but it has yet to pick up any motion. And I know there's motion because cars park next to my house. But the camera never picks up anyone coming or going. Also, the battery life depends on activity. So if there's a lot of activity your best bet is to plug it in. I've had mine less than a month and the battery is already nearly dead.
 I’ve had this camera for two days and so far it has been wonderful. Clear picture. Every time I have went to watch live it pulls right up. Got this to keep an eye on my chickens and garage. You can change the sensitivity so that it won’t record things as small as chickens.  This is everything they say it is! Next paycheck I will be buying another one for the front porch. Well worth the $130.
 Everything was great until they decided to pull the plug on 3rd party integration with SmartThings without any notice.  It makes it tough to trust what they'll do next and not want to continue doing business with them.  Shame on Blink for not caring about their customers.
 The batteries only lasted for one month instead of 2yrs.<br/>The customer rep stated it had a range of 300ft from based, but only had roughly 150ft from based.<br/>The cameras did not zoom in or out  and anything beyond 30ft could not make out.<br/>The cameras only recorded when motion was detected within 5ft but the camera view is over 50ft.
 Pros -  Operates with 2 AA lithium batteries. Two years battery life but we will see... The video quality appears to be good.<br/>Cons - The installation requires two devices - The camera AND another device that acts as a receiver and connects to your router and requires a wall plug in. Therefore the camera is NOT wireless.  If I had known that I would have bought a Ring video camera.
 I am living in an apartment complex where sadly my orders from different carriers got stolen. Last time I ordered a new band for my watch. When I cane home from work it was stolen in front of my door. Now with my security cam no one will touch my packeges anymore !
 So far I like it a lot. Easy set up and access to the router. Android app works well/consistently. Lense quality is good (1080p) and motion detection is not inconsistent. Of course, I will be most interested in how long the battery lasts for my application. Will re-review if battery life sucks!
 Awesome easy set up great clear photos and video. I purchase a solar panel too maximize all features.
 Really picks up blowing branches and rain drops.  Wish they could just do human recognition.  Loved seeing how much wildlife we have in our urban yard...  Very sweet in a world gone nuts!  Nice to see innocent animals surviving  in the urban wild.
 It came so fast-which is perfect because I can hurry and install before the packages I ordered start arriving.<br/>I hope the installation is easy for me-as I'm not at all gifted with such a skill.  I'll update if it is NOT easy otherwise I'm happily feeling safe.
 terrible. go with canary or YI cameras
 For the purpose of just having more peace of mind I ordered these. Super easy set up, but make sure the cameras are within range of your WiFi and central module. It appears with the factory settings these batteries will last a while. High traffic areas like a street will trip the motion sensor. It also has a delay in capturing video.<br/>Being cloud based and battery operated, you do not get the constant live video. You can access the cameras in the app and watch live, but remember it wears the battery down.<br/>Overall I am very pleased with this product.
 I BUY THESE CAMERAS TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE PROJECT HOMES IM FLIPPING AND THEY'RE GREAT. SMALL, WIRELESS AND DISCRETE WELL EXCEPT THE INDOOR VERSION WITH THE BLUE LED ON THE FRONT. I HAVE THESE MOUNTED OUTDOOR IN AN AFTER MARKET WEATHERPROOF MOUNT.
 These home security cameras (blink xt) are awesome. I'm impressed with the angle degree and clarity of these cameras. I chose to power my cameras rather than run them on batteries due to the heavy traffic in the area. Nevertheless I experienced the same quality of clarity with batteries that I do with USB power supply. If you're looking for security cameras that easy to install and give you top quality vision, then blink is for you.
 This thing is garbage, terrible quality, asked if I want to continue every 5 seconds.  Why is that even a feature?  The quality is so bad if you needed to see someone's face well you couldn't. Dont waste your money on crappy Amazon products.
 Would have been 5 stars if the lag time between sensing movement and starting the camera wasn't so long (about 5 secs).  But the picture/video is really good. The phone app provides great functionality and the price for the unit is more than reasonable.
 These camera work great. I have now had them for about 6 months.  Outstanding picture and sound quality .  The batteries really do last, which I  did not believe, at first, but now I do . The motion sensors work great and are sensitive so you do not miss anything..<br/>Very easy to installl and set up.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.
 I really like these camera, easy to install and picture and sound are great and very clear even at night.  I would only say that the piece you pop on the back on the camera to hang them up could be more tight once you pop it in there.
 They work perfectly. Almost. The only niggle is that there needs to be a way to properly expose back-lit subjects. Docked a star for this. I am hopeful that a firmware update will correct this issue.<br/><br/>They are easy to install. Alerts are reliable and repeatable.<br/><br/>Good job Blink !
 The price is good. Blink has non-unified passwords: one for the app, one for the sales site, one for community support. The mount is flimsy, but holds the camera tight. Wind above 10mph adds moderate shake. Picture/movie quality is very good outside. App settings are very good. Lack of web browser GUI is probably a future deal breaker for more purchases. Let's see if Blink matures.
 If you are looking for a wireless home Security camera for the outdoor well look no further. I didn't want to right my review till I had my Blink XT for a while. The camera is great during the day and at night and it rained, snowed and hot outside and the no issues none what so ever. I was skeptical because of the battery but she's still going strong.
 I purchased the Alro Pro and the Blink XT camera systems to compare. I live in Alaska so operating temperature is big for me since it does often get below zero. The first 24 hours was all it took, the Arlo Pro cameras did not work the next morning since it was only -2 degrees outside. However the Blink System did work. The two systems are both rated for -4 degrees, and this was a key feature that I wanted. The system is easy to setup and the app is intuitive. I highly recommend the Blink XT system for anyone that lives in an area that has temperatures that dip around zero degrees from time to time.
 Range of this device is horrible. It basically won't stay connected unless it is in the same room as the sync module. Tried to install camera outside less than 50 yards from the sync module. Sync module is in a window with line of sight to camera. Sync module is less than 3 feet from wifi router. Will not stay connected and latency is terrible when connected.
 Setup was easy. The detection range and sensitivity are really poor with this camera. Saving video to your phone is terrible. The image quality not good at all, grainy and washed out. I have few YI much less expensive IP cameras and the video quality is much better than this one. I am very disappointed at this model. Sorry but I have to send it back to Amazon for a refund.
 I love these. Easy to install and set up. So far after 3 weeks, they have not failed yet. I have most of them close to the house but one is over 100 ft away and still picks up signal. Best cams for the money and probably better than higher priced ones. FYI, try to put them where they are not in the sun.
 When I purchased this I thought I was being very careful but this is only a camera not a doorbell camera as I thought. It works good but you can only get one angle so you need like 4-5 of these that gets costly. For now we have only one.
 I like it because I can put this camera anywhere . I’ve been testing this camera inside the house before I put it outside. I have noticed a delay from when the camera detects to when it starts recording. I am getting many recording of nothing because what ever triggered the camera is no longer in site that has to be fixed .  I have<br/>Thought of keeping the camera inside the house but when the night vision turns on it’s way to loud . I would also like the option to same the video to a local drive on my network.
 I am using Blink to keep an "eye" on a cabin we close up in the winter. It has been great to ensure the caretaker is actually checking the place in our absense and is giving me a way better sense and proof that we aren't being taken advantage of - which has happened in the past. I was concerned about the "battery" aspect but so far it has been easy and efficient with no need to cut holes in the walls at great expense. Planning to use these at our main residence for sure! Thank you!
 I bought the two camera set specifically to watch when community cats come to eat or sleep. I have one camera watching the feeding station and one watching the cat houses. I love it! I get alerts while I'm at work letting me know which cats are visiting. I can then watch them on live view if I choose. It's great!
 Have had no issues with my other outdoor camera (Blink XT) that has with stood the elements for about 1 year now, but one that I installed just 3 months ago has gotten water/condensation inside the camera. After working through an Ohio fall and half of the winter, it just went offline one day last week. I then removed and inspected the back cover to find water inside, surpassing the two possible ways in, showing that the seals are not always adequate. Currently in the process of figuring out what I will, or will not be getting from Blink. Will update...
 I really like these cameras. They are a good buy for the money, the setup is painless, and there is no cloud storage fee in the near OR long run. The motion sensitivity needs some tweaking out of the gate, but once it is dialed in they work well and present a clear picture and crisp sound. I have one camera out in the cold and it has held its battery life so far.
 Really like the Blink camera I have set up outside and may add another when they go on sale.<br/>The camera was very easy to use and their customer service very responsive.<br/>So far just the mailman and the neighbors cats but that's a good thing!
 Terrible. Stopped working after one minute of use and the load time is dramatically slow. Waste of money and time. Not worth it.
 Did quite a lot of reearch before buying this. t was insattled easily and even when I had issues with one of the cameras, Blink customer support help me out and replaced it immedaitely. The system is all set up and working well.
 We replaced an old clunky DVR wireless camera system that just never worked and was difficult to setup.  Blink was EASY to setup and operate not issues at all.  We just opened the box, put in the batteries into the cameras and followed the app set up and it just worked.
 if I could give it 0 stars I would.  Never got it to work.  Tech support X 2, I was buried with computer lingo  MAC address, Static IP, router firewall etc. wifi hotspot} I literally spent hours trying to get this to work, to no avail.  Returned. My wife says "you get what you pay for".  Very true.  Tech support tried very hard but couldn't make it work  maybe they rushed to market too soon.
 We're happy with the Blink and setup was simple. Unfortunately,  we've been taken by Amazon. We purchased the Blink XT system on 11/27/18 supposedly a Black Friday Deal for $349.99. Currently on Sale for $299.99 plus a free Echo Dot. So much for trusting Amazon and Black Friday Deals.
 Easy install, abundant features in the control panel, internet/cell phone interface works seamlessly and has great video quality. No wiring needed and the battery life on the camera is great. Updates so far have installed well. Home security has never been easier at such a low price point---you have to love technology these days!
 I finally found the perfect outdoor camera. I keep getting packages delivered to the wrong house from USPS. Well now I have it recorded that the packages were never delivered. Thankfully the people in my neighborhood drops them off. One package was delivered to the house on the corner and the camera showed it. But on their records it said it was delivered to my house. I will be adding 2 more outside at different sides of my house.
 The product was used for home security and its doing the job. I recommend this blink xt. Their customer service is great 👍. Its worth the price.
 Have had this camera for about a week now and like the way it works. I have it set up on my phone and I-Pad. I'm 70 and not a techie but had no problems setting up. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is the lag in the notification, My phone chimes about 10 to 15 seconds after some one crosses into view. I tried moving the wireless unit to different locations but with the same results. I am playing with the sensitivity because a cardinal set if off. It will be interesting in the fall when the leaves start swirling. Will update in a few months.
 The camera is easy to setup and the daytime pics are clear.  We have a porch light and a street light.  You cannot see any images with the light turned on at night.  The camera is easy to remove from the housing.  While this is good for battery replacement it also make it susceptible to theft and strong winds.<br/><br/>I will look into purchasing the ring camera that connects to the door bell.
 Likes - Very easy to setup. Took about 10 minutes. Easy to use. I loved that I could know exactly when my kids got home from school. A little peace of mind.<br/><br/>Dislikes - the only issue is that you cannot set different schedules or cameras and you cannot disarm individual cameras. We ended up having to buy a separate sync module for indoor and outdoor cameras due to this limitation. However, aside from the additional cost, they are so easy to setup, really not an issue. I would really like to see two way audio added but that is just a wish.
 I was pleasantly surprised how easy the Blink camera system was to install and the quality of the pictures/videos.  I highly recommend the Blink System.  I am in the process of ordering a third camera.  A great price for a great system.
 We have 2 cameras outside and love them!  Doesn't cost to monitor and gives you peace of mind.  I like knowing who is at my home when I am there and when I am not.  I like that it is wireless and the batteries last up to two years.  So easy to install!
 The video and sound quality are great. I've already caught someone trying to steal power from the RV outlet on the side of my garage. I'll be buying another for the other end of the house.<br/><br/>It would be awesome if I was able to pull up the video on my Fire TV :)
 While it was easy to setup, it really doesn't have the features that a professional security camera would have. There is no continuous monitoring capability via a webpage and you have to repeatedly press the continue button on the app to keep viewing - that is silly. The coverage isn't all that great either, and I STILL can't login to the blink website because it doesn't know who I am!!! This is a toy - not a serious security camera.
 I am not a geek and I found this very easy to setup. It is the first thing I ever set up by myself tactical support is always there for you. The value is exceptional!!! I am sorry I purchased mine from home life Via Cox cable
 Loving my new wireless Blink XT so far. Connecting the device to my wifi was simple and setup was quick and easy. The app was also just updated with a Beta feature to allow zone control which is a very nice fix.<br/><br/>The mounting bracket is ok but with it just snapping together to the camera I worry someone can just snatch the camera and run but I noticed there's plenty of aftermarket options so I might end up ordering another style.<br/><br/>Still very pleased with my purchase and I am planning on purchasing additional cameras to add to my system.
 Theres a slight delay in starting the recording. If its covering a small area the trigger may leave sight before it even starts recording. Great options on length and sensitivity. Good picture quality as well. Distance you can place this is surprisingly far. Overall im satisfied.
 Video quality was good, but difficult to get the right sensitivity on motion detection, particularly with motion headed straight toward the camera. I returned it because I wanted an immediate alert, not one 60 seconds after the motion event.
 Super easy to set up, super easy to use the app, and the picture quality is solid. This seems to be the most painless and hassle free wireless camera system I've found. The app worked well, and I liked the scheduling function a lot. I really appreciate that there are no monthly fees.
 They work great, even in the extreme southwest Arizona heat.  We love the audio capability.  Be sure to install the app when you install your first one.
 These Blink cams have worked great for me. No monthly fees (biggest selling point), no wires, and great battery life so far. I was tempted by the Arlo at first but after the personal experience of a family member with their fees and short battery life it was a no brainer. As long as you are looking for motion detection alerts (not 24 hr. surveillance) this is a perfect camera (along with the indoor versions.)
 These cameras are awesome, they are wireless so easy to put up anywhere. I put the 5 cameras up around my property and they work great I get a notification when they detect motion and you can see instantly what is going on.
 Like but had to purchase xFi pod extender from Comcast to make the one over the garage work. It took a lot of trial and error to figure out the issue. A couple are not as clear at night as I thought would be but would recommend.
 I could not be happier with the Blink System. I bought the 2-Camera XT system and then added on another XT and 2 indoor cameras. It takes less than a minute to set up the cameras after only 3-5 minutes setting up the initial system (I am not exaggerating). I have convinced friends to switch after they bought other systems where you have to pay monthly for the cloud storage. One of my favorite features, on your Fire Stick you can say, "Show me front door camera..." and the live video displays on your TV.  All around great product, great value, great security.
 Works great I live in apartments and had some vandalism on my car. I got this to keep an eye on it and it worked really well even from a distance of my wifi router. The only thing I didn't like is you can only record up to 1 minute clips, I wish you could extend the record time to longer.
 Terrible. Only up about one week and now the camera picks and chooses when it sends a notice
 CONS<br/><br/>This item was not sent "NEW" as description led me to believe.<br/>5-6 Camera's had some type of marks around the face.<br/>The USB cord was defective. It had to be placed in a specific position in order to turn the sync module on(if this doesn't work then none of the camera's will).<br/>There is around 3 seconds of delay in live feed mode.<br/>It takes 8-9 seconds to load the video that was recorded.<br/><br/>PROS<br/><br/>The picture quality was good and crisp when viewing through my phone.<br/>Night Vision worked great<br/>Sensitivity was really good.
 Tricky to get camera, sync module, and Wi-Fi all working together to produce a reliable camera system.  If the strength meters show weak signals, the system won't be reliable.  Recommend buying camera and sync modules in pairs unless the multiple cameras are really close to the one sync module.  Also, will probably need a Wi-Fi extender as well to provide the strong Wi-Fi signal needed.  My cameras are outdoor and far away from each other so each camera needed one sync module mounted fairly close to the camera.  I had to get a Wi-Fi extender as well to provide a strong Wi-Fi signal.
 I'm thinking of sending back for a refund.  records in short  spurts... does not capture the continual motion.
 Easy to install and good picture. They work really well. Wasn't a big fan of holder it comes with, I'm pretty sure if you throw something at it the camera would fall. It should be something sturdier. And the range, it gets a good front range but wide not so much. And zooming in isn't great.
 The IR Illuminator is really good. The daytime recording is excellent. Keep your camera or cameras close to the module for optimal live viewing. The mount it comes with is okay. Perfect for the indoor cameras. Outdoor cameras need a different mount. You have to use a specific kind of battery. The camera settings are clean and understandable and the motion detection is very responsive. Overall great camera
 I love the fact and ideal of having an additional security camera. The ones that are installed did a wonderful job in providing coverage. However, I wanted to ensure additional coverage was considered in my security and installing an extra camera provided both the coverage and security comfort. Thank you, Blink XT Home Security. Regards, V
 jury is still out but so far it is working great.  I am test driving these and a reolink camera, which is also ok, but took forever for it to come in.  Waiting to see how long the batteries really last to make a final decision.
 Day 1 review: Super easy set up, small, compact, discreet. Great range to WiFi and receiver box even at the further point of install. Clear pictures, still working on tweaking sensitivity. Again, only day 1 but 5 stars hands down.
 Easy to setup range is OK camera is located  about 40 feet from router alerts were easy to setup and video quality is very good I have had several cameras in the past and this is the best so far.  Hopefully batteries will last st least 1 year
 Be aware that this camera requires the Internet cloud to operate and with plenty of upload bandwidth. DSL is not fast enough. You can not access the camera directly. My account got shut down because I used a third party app which is not allowed. If you need this camera to operate with a third party security system then look elsewhere.
 Great security camera,  precise motion detection, clear video (live and captured)<br/><br/>battery life has been good so far!  I used a guardzilla on the outside of my house (brick house) and the connection was poor but with the Blink camera connection was good.<br/><br/>overall a great wireless security system.
 I was a little concerned reading some of the customer service reviews before I purchased but decided to give it a try anyway. I had a problem syncing and gave them a call. Marvin walked me through so patiently. After more than 20 minutes and trying many things he suggested I may have a bad sync module and I have a new one on the way. I had called my internet provider,  Netgear etc to chech to see if there was a problem . All said everything checked out...now 3 days later I tried syncing again and it worked. I already have the new one on the way which I will return as soon as I get it but Blink really provide me with wonderful customer service and a much appreciated resolution.  Thank you. I will recommend to friends.
 Easy to install, easy to use! Love that it has night vision...I live in the city and this is on the front of my home aimed at my parking area. Only flaw is sometimes it clips videos before movement ends or the allotted time is up. Overall perfect camera and I would highly recommend it. (And his brand in particular)
 "Something went wrong. Video Stopped unexpectedly!" Get used to seeing this message if you purchase this product.<br/><br/>I've only had this camera for a day and I'm already returning it.<br/><br/>The camera is located about 12 feet from the Sync Module and router, which are colocated.<br/><br/>Not only does the live feed fail to load an obnoxious number of times but the capture rate is just as bad. It completely missed my two kids leaving the house for school today with Sensitivity set to 8 of 9!
 Well-designed wireless camera system that is priced right, with no hidden data storage charges.  If you have good WiFi out where you want to place the camera, you will get the system up and running in 30 minutes or less.  I haven’t used any indoor cameras but my four outdoor cameras have performed well.
 MISLEADING PICTURE.  oNLY RECIEVE MODULE  NO CAMERA WITH KIT
 Set up camera and it worked.  2nd day motion detection failed to work.  I could not get it to come back online.  Reset camera.  Could get a live view but no motion detection.  I left on a work trip and the camera went offline.  My wife checked the module and the lights are showing proper functionality but I cannot get a view.<br/><br/>I travel often so I don't think this product is ideal.  Support directed me to reset everything when I'm home.  This is frustrating since my first trip it failed.  I do not have a high degree of confidence this is the right solution to monitor activity at my house.
 I wanted to buy a few more smart home cameras that worked with Alexa. I had one  Arlo camera. I decided that the Blink XT had to be a better camera as its owned by amazon and compatable with Alexa. It was very easy to set up and I had live images really quickly. Since the first day the camera keeps loosing signal, or is ‘busy’. Almost every image is captures is fuzzy lines. What a great disappointment. I wish I had just bought another Arlo now. Clearly the Blink app is crisp and clear but useless when the camera cant keep a signal.
 Setup was easy no issues, video quality is OK not HD :-)... I like the wireless feature the arm disarm video capture and all settings made from your smart phone.  The only thing they do not come with mounts must be purchased separately. So far I'm liking it and no monthly fees.
 Best truly wireless cameras!  Still haven’t had to replace the batteries after a year. Keep in mind it does depend on how much it records for battery usage.  My company even uses these for monitoring  wildlife trapping and rat traps in attics!!
 This entire system is very unreliable. The control module drops it connection for no apparent reason rendering this substantial investment useless. Reading the Blink forum reveals this is a very common problem. I really wanted this to work but I'm not optimistic.
 Good system.. battery life isn’t great though. I very rarely use my front door, however, the batteries have only lasted about 6 months. I wish there was a better solutions for the life<br/>of the batteries.
 Cameras work good but I received one of my outdoor cameras in non working form. I called the support line and there help desk line was noisy and could not speak English very well. I don't mind that but they had me on the phone for over an hour and could not get it fixed. I persistently asked to exchange it but the lady on the support line kept insisting it was my fault even after I changed the batteries multiple times. All 5 of my other cameras work great but if you have an issue I would exchange it right away instead of trying their ghetto help line.
 Had it for a few weeks - works as advertised. I get a notification on my phone about 8-15 seconds after motion detection. No problem for me since it's not a door bell. We have front porch lights (2x40 watts), and can see relatively well if you turn off the night vision. With night vision on, it's too bright.
 I like the idea of it running on batteries and using WiFi. It’s very small and discreet as well. The downfall is that it doesn’t work well if you don’t have a strong WiFi signal. When in “armed” mode it would not pick up motion that was 5 feet in front of the camera. It was very hit or miss as to when it would pick up motion and the point of it is to pick up motion and monitor when you’re not there. I returned this product and looking to purchase a better product, you get what you pay for.
 I appreciated the ease, simplicity and seamlessness of setting up and operating my two camera XT system...I have had it for about two months and would certainly recommend it....EXCEPT...the two year lasting lithium battery on one camera died in six weeks which makes me pause about expanding the system.  Come on BLINK you can do better than that!
 Motion detection leaves a lot to be desired. I positioned this about 20 feet from my car and it can't detect a person opening and closing my car doors at night even at full sensitivity. Which is what I bought it for. It also catches the tree branches waving and wastes battery life.<br/><br/>The battery life is terrible. Had to replace the batteries after just 2 months of use.
 I purchase this camera in Jan 2018 for outdoor use. The battery for one of my camera's has already went out and after replacing the batteries the camera doesn't work properly. One of the cameras disable itself because of high uses (we've had some strong wind). Other then that it's a good camera.
 Works  great. can adjust
 Complete piece of junk.  Did not work. Called customer service and it was so loud, the guy cannot hear me and huge delay with answering any questions.  Sending back
 I really wanted to like the Blink camera. The claim of two year battery life is just not true. For me, I was at least hoping for a year. Heck, even six months would be acceptable to me. Recently, I've had to replace the batteries every two weeks. The app did say high usage at one point, but we're maybe in the area 3 to 4 times a day. Is that really "high"? I'm glad I didn't buy the three pack I originally wanted. Maybe in the future when they get the battery sorted out.
 This camera is ok for live viewing but for security purposes it is absolutely worthless. I initially installed it above my garage door as I wanted surveillance for the driveway. It does not detect motion coming toward it, only side to side. When I contacted customer service, they suggested I move the camera and experiment. Wow....good thing I contacted them. Never would have thought of that on my own. So I relocated the camera to the edge of the roof and it picked up every single whispering movement of a nearby palm tree and picked up every car that passed the house but never picked up anything, man or vehicle entering or exiting the driveway. After relocating the camera again to where the tree is out of view and the street is just a sliver in view, it still picks up cars passing by and if it does pick up movement in the driveway, it's after the cause of the movement is long out of the picture. I could put it perpendicular to the driveway but this would cause it to be too far from the base to work. I think they brought these cameras to market a little prematurely. They should have done a little more R&amp;D before releasing them. I'm not interested in how many cars pass my house during any particular day.

 Easy to setup. Time will tell how useful it is. Messing with the sensitivity hasn’t helped much. On 3 I get video of the mail mans back while walking away. On 4 I get every car that drives by in the road. Do yourself a favor and order a mount at the same time. The provided ones are garbage
 At first work great now get too many camera not ready readouts
 It worked well and had good video quality. My main problem with it is that it is not very securely attached to the mounting mechanism. Someone broke into my foyer, stole some packages and then carried the camera off with them. Fortunately I did have footage. But it was rather disappointing as a “security” product.
 I got the 2 camera system for a great price. Cameras were easy to install and since they are battery operated you can put them pretty much anywhere, as long as it’s in range of the included home module and wifi. I like that you have the option to do a live view and also enable/disable motion detection through the blink app. There’s also a really cool option to select/deselect areas on a grid of the view from the camera for spots you don’t want the motion detection to trigger. This system helps put my mind at ease when I’m away from home and when I’m expecting packages.
 Our Blink cameras, 3 out of 4, only lasted about 4 months.  we were informed by Blink representative to replace the batteries with lithium batteries; however,they still did not work, after many attempts to resolve by tech-support. Blink did replace the camera however what happens when these batteries go out in a couple of months? we were in form before purchase that wants the batteries run out,  cameras would still function after replacing with lithium batteries, so far this does not seem to be the case. These cameras start off at a good price and to be wire free is amazing, but if they can only last through the original battery life, it doesn't seem like such a good thing after all.
 I already have several of these. Best system you could ask for! I will say though, that you can get a 'bad' camera. I have had one for a few years now.<br/> No matter what the settings are on, the battery only lasts 2 weeks. I have called tech support and they said my settings should be changed. I did this and it made no difference. I asked for a replacement and they said no.
 This product had more features than I knew about when I bought it. It has an area of the sensor that can be blocked which was very helpful because my flag would fly into the corner of the picture. I was able to block that segment of the scan so that it would not trigger the recording. I also was unaware of the temperature sensor. I'm very pleased with the product. I do wish there would be a way to not to desensitize the camera for when I drive in and out of the driveway. That is a random activity and cannot be scheduled.
 Bought these cameras for inside my home when my dog was having mobility issues so we could monitor her when we were at work. Love we could live view her plus get notifications. They have saved her a few times when she fell and couldn’t get up again. Now she’s gone but we use them inside and outside our home. We really love them. Keeps us safe.
 I purchased this system after my parents had suggested I do so bc they had been using it for a month or so and were extremely pleased. Meth use is on the rise where I live and I live alone with my seven year old son and felt uncomfortable at times in my home. So far I have been extremely pleased. Set up was easy and the cameras do exactly what I need them to do. Actually setting up where you want the cameras and what you want to see on them is a bit of trial and error. But once you figure out where you want them it's done! And there is very little maintenance required.
 So far so good. I really like this system easy install. Licensed JW wireman for 21 years and fishing cables is no fun. This system takes all that out of the equation. Everything I needed. Still adding more cameras and money well spent.
 I review many cameras this one is excellent clear picture and sound, good for hiding small neat.  The only downsize would be it doesn't have two way but who needs to talk to a criminal while there's in your house.
 I love the free cloud storage and being able to monitor my home without wires.  However, the motion detection is frustrating as the motion has to occur going across the field of vision not coming directly at it.  I first mounted it directly centered on the top of my garage.  I would walk down my driveway get in my car and pull out and the motion detection never detected me.  I mounted it more sideways and it's a little better.

You have to explore the app and see all the ways you can customize everything from the recording length to the areas where it will detect motion. I like that it doesn’t constantly record because it gives you the important points when motion is detected. Sensitivity of detection can be adjusted as well. Overall great product for the price!
 We have had this product for about a month now. It does works but not all the time. It says the battery life will last 2 years and mine is completely dead already. The camera goes crazy and just starts recording 2 second videos back to back to back. You also have to be super close to it for it to detect any motion. Do not recommend
 I like this camera because I wanted an outdoor camera, and the storage for the videos is free in the cloud.  It works great, and I bought a second one.  I have a Nest indoors, but that was way before these came out.  Simple and works on the phone.
 3 different networks tried, customer support gave generic "reset the device" walkthrough, didn't do anything and this thing would not connect. It takes too long to mail the defective unit to them and then get the new one from them. Waste of time.
 For home security, I have tried Nest, Arlo, Netvue and Blink.  Blink has been the easiest to install, use and their service when I had a question was extremely quick.  I now have 11 Blink cameras and love the coverage. I also found Blinks infrared capability better than Arlo by a mile. Overall, I strongly recommend Blink.
 Got the two camera system. Set was easy and great. After a day one of the camera’s said it was busy. I noticed the camera had a red light on it. I followed the troubleshooting from the community page. Nothing worked. I contacted customer support and they were quick to response initially. I responded with the information they requested and I have not heard from them since. It’s really disappointing the one camera works great. I wish they would just swap out the defective camera but I’ve been disappointed with the customer service. It makes it hard to recommend.
 I had my system up and running in less than an hour. The Blink app is easy to use. Clear audio and video. Works great. I recommend this to anyone who wants a video security service for the Home or office.  I  ran into a problem and customer service had me up and running in just a few minutes  Excellent customer service in the US by Americans who speak English.
 Each unit is dependent on the base station. The base station is the only one that accepts wifi. The camera units are dependent in this base station. Despite having wifi on my driveway with strong  signal, i cannot use the camera unless i move the base station close to the camera
 Camera was mediocre for it's  price tag. Missed big motion events, lagged and didn't work at all in certain places. (Even within Wi-Fi range) the picture quality was good but what difference does that make if the camera doesn't even record? 😑
 These cameras are not water proof if you decide to use the usb power option. I decided to plug mine in and water gets inside. Blink will not give me a refund. Highly recommend looking at other options if you plan to keep the camera plugged in.
 Works great, doesn’t move though so you’d need a couple to make sure you can view what you need to.<br/>Wish it came with mounting instructions for that matter anything to mount it with.<br/>The night vision could be better
 I love that a few things.<br/>1. It uses batteries and doesn't have to be hard wired to your house<br/>2. Motion detector and sends a message to my phone (I can see who dropped off packages, when the teenager left, etc.  I can program this for 5 sec, 10 sec or more videos.<br/>3. I can mount it anywhere
 Great product!  The picture quality is amazing for such a small camera.  It is perfect for the front porch, sidewalk and driveway area.  I highly recommend this product.
 I use this camera on our cabin which is high in the Colorado Rockies.  I use it more for checking on the weather at our cabin; catching photos of wildlife on our property; and of course for security.  I used the Blink to replace a Logitech camera and I like Blink so much more.  It is easier to install.  It syncs with our cell phones and that process has been made very easy by Blink.  If the batteries last as long as they say, that will be awesome.  The batteries used are AA batteries instead of a $30 to $50 battery.  I will buy this camera for other family members.
 Whats not to like! Quick delivery. Simple setup. Instant notifications. Cloud storage. No monthly fees.<br/>Tried to buy this system on prime day but missed out. Had a bicycle stolen out of our yard and regret not buying this sooner. Now i can see who's snooping around my pad.
 Nice system, and easy to install. Cost was reasonable. Works very well on phone and Kindle. The only drawback is that it isn't Windows compatible. I'll see if the battery really does last 2 years. More than worth the money.
 Easy set up and a pretty good range. I am using it to monitor the house while I'm gone and so far so good. It gives you messages when the camera has been activated and you can watch in real time from your smart phone.

I wish this night vision was a little better but the blue “recording” flasher seemed to do the trick. 100% better than ADT and ARLO
 I’m disappointed, this worked great for about a month and a half and just suddenly stopped.  Overall a decent camera except if there is someone actually moving in front of the camera (knocking at the door, which is why I got it) it tells you the camera is busy so you can’t see them anyway.  I’ll be returning mostly because it is faulty in my eyes as far as immediate security but even more so because it just decided to stop working all together.
 I really love the camera system by Blink. I compared it to the other main ones (Ring, Nest, etc.) and found that Blink provided the best quality camera given the no monthly fee. GET AT LEAST TWO! You won't regret it =)
 Very slick and light and very easy to install. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is that every once in a while it gets wonky and wont detect the movements 100%. Resetting the camera by removing it from the app and adding it again will fix the issue and then it happens again after while. Considering it is a security Camera I would expect it reliably work 100% of the time!
 Heard that certain techies at a close by university are using this product. So I purchased a cheaper one that did not work! Returned it got Blink on sale around Christmas and now 😃.<br/>Easy to set up and easy to monitor.
 Good camera! Sometimes they disconnect randomly but that could be a battery issue. They have very good night vision and are easy to hang up and take down.<br/>You can also disarm them and rearm them depending on your preferences. The app was easy to set up and alerts you when something is seen. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase. They a very good for a wireless camera system. I have one about 500 feet from the house and the camera can still give feedback to the tablet inside the house.
 Bought this for my mother-in-laws house.  It really offers peace of mind knowing that I can see her house and any visitors right on the phone app.  It was easy to install and works like a charm.
 After installing these I threw my FunLux cameras in the trash. Did not realize that I had settled for such a bad product until these Blink cameras show you how it should be done. Exceptionally good setup process. 10 out of 10!
 I have only had this a week..it has worked good EXCEPT for early morning when it is very cold it didn't work till it warmed up...I will give it a couple more weeks and see if it was just a fluke or if it indeed dosent work when cold
 The colors aren’t as accurate as Wyze Cam at times. The clarity of both is about same. The Wyze Cam loads a little faster. I have them both outside and covered from above. The Wyze camera’s detection zone is more accurate.
 Superior camera. This is an amazing system and super easy to deploy. I love getting notifications of movement and the cloud storage is perfect.  You can access easily and set up multiple users.  You’ll love it!
 Good camera, good pics, like that you can choose recording time. If you use MAC address filtering you need to add the camera AND base to the filter list. However the lithium batteries only lasted two months and died. Disappointing.
 This product is outstanding. Should have bought it 2 years ago. Had it 2 weeks and no problems. I wish I could disarm one camera instead of both.<br/>Update. Had six months and still batteries are good. Very impressed with this product. I bought 2 more.<br/>I have now had this product 8 months and am so impressed with how you can adjust the settings on it. The battery life is still good. It videos for a longer period of time because I changed the settings. It gives me more coverage. Great product!!!!
 Strong wifi signal needed and batteries do not last long. Tried direct USB connection and this did not work at all. Camera has been more trouble than it is worth. Wait for the wyze outdoor camera coming soon.
 This was by far the easiest system to set up and use. I was able to get it powered up and connected to my iphone in a matter of ten minutes. I like that I get notifications right to my phone and I don't have to be connected through any land lines. If the batteries really last as long as stated then I don't see any issues with this product at all.
 We have bought a three camera Blink XT system for both our home and beach house.  The cameras give a clear resolution picture and the system is easy to install and operate.  We like the live video feature that allows us to check weather conditions while we are away.  Additionally, the cameras are easy to arm and disarm and not overly sensitive so we don't get false notifications.  They work as well, if not better, than advertised.
 I am loving my new cameras!  The videos are very clear.  The set and installation was very simple.  Depending upon where you plan to place the camera, I would recommend purchasing one of the additional wall mounts.
 Tech support non existent and instructions vague.
 All I can say is this is not worth 300.  I'm not very pleased with it. I have been shopping for 2-way speaker on cams. This isn't the case. Also, there is a major delay on movement and for this price, the picture quality is terrible.
 Wow!  This setup is very easy to use, the iOS app is flawless and there all the features I was looking for!  Unbelievable great experience if youve ever tried to setup a small home security system and had frustrations, you’ll be thrilled!  Awesome price, awesome performance.  I bought 2, but more to come for sure.
 Easy to install...so far all features are working.. adjusting the small issues out.. placement.. sensitivity.. alerts.. but only real issue is higher definition (more MP) would be better and zoom capable... good basic system..
 Actually for what we wanted to use these for, they work perfectly. Not difficult to install and setup. We bought one and liked it so much that we bought two more. Now we'll have to wait and see how long they last.
 This is great addition to a home security system, or even a stand-alone device to monitor an area of your home, indoors or out.  Easy activate and install.  My techie son even managed to integrate it with my SmartThings Home system for ease of use.
 The unit I got from amazon was missing some parts, so returned the amazon one and bought direct from Blink.  Anyway, product is so easy to install and use, and it's great to give you peace of mind when not home.
 For price and ease of setup and installation, it works great.  I do not like the brackets provided for installation as the camera is too easy to be removed.  They just pop on and off the bracket.  I'd prefer some type of fastener.
 The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because there is always room for improvement.... We have had a big snow storm after we set up the Blink XT Home Security Camera System.<br/>NO PROBLEMS with snow or the freezing temps or even the melting snow!<br/>Blink XT Home Security Camera Systems are small and easily hidden.<br/>We are ABSOLUTLY happy with our purchase.<br/>And now have talk to others and they also have ordered Blink XT Home Security Camera System for home and business
 Ok forget off upon receiving and opening I will say the quality of the camera was good I downloaded the app as per the instructions. They walked me through the set up which was easy and straight forward. I got 2 cameras took about 10 minutes to get them up and running. The video quality was good. I'd say equal to my ring cameras I had. Features and that the cameras had such as timers and camera sensitivity were good as well. The only reason I rated this camera so low was the audio was absolutely terrible. Sounds like a diesel is running all the time
 Was a little tricky to sync with the app but once we figured it out, it works great. Love being able to check on things at home whenever I want. Video is very clear and picks up even very quiet sounds. You can mount it on the wall or stand it on something.
 The battery’s need to be replaced about once a week! It also misses a lot. My mailbox was hit by a hit and run driver today and it didn’t pick it up. Disappointed
 I like the concept.  Delay in sending activity.  Cuts off before the movement stops.  Having a bit of difficulty with getting the settings right.  BUT...I like it.  Glad I have it. I think it was the best choice,  I would buy it again.
 I purchased these at home in Colorado U.S.A. For my families home in Mexico City. I decided to try them out here in U.S. before I take them over there. I am so pleased w the size of the camera. Literally like half an iPhone plus. They are wireless and they use batteries that are easy to find. Set up was so easy. Just an email, and you can play around with the camera settings. Alerts to your phone and customize the motion detection, clip recording length and so much more. Night vision is also very good.
 We put this outside our front door. We had to change the angle so it wouldn’t go off when cars went by and now it’s perfect. It goes off when people walk up to our door and when the occasional stray dog or cat wanders through our yard. I also like the live feature so you can turn it on and see what’s going on at any given time. Well worth the price.
 Love the cameras my only reason for not rating 5 stars is that you can't set a schedule. I mainly wanted it for when im not home from 8am-6pm but you can't set that with these. All in all though they are great
 The mounting bracket is weak, thin plastic. The camera just snaps onto the mount with nothing to lock it in place. It falls off if you bump it. I'm afraid a big gust of wind will blow it off. A single screw holds the mount to whatever surface you mount it to. The screw then becomes one of the swivel axes for the camera. You can't tighten the mount enough to keep it from swiveling there, as it will deform the plastic. Really a mess.
 This product is a Win! So much for the price, so easy to set up and monitor! Perfect for my from door... I don't have a storm door and the front door has designed frosted like glass and side lights, so I can never see who's at the door. This is perfect! So glad I purchased this!
 I order new cameras and the product I received was covered in markings obviously from previous usage.
 Satisfied on how fast and easy it was for this install. The cordless camera makes it easy to mount anywhere.  It was easy to move from different locations if needed.<br/>I'm giving it a 4/5 stars because there isn't a live record at the moment. Overall pleased with this camera, I even ordered another add-on unit
 Video is great and these cameras work well in cold weather. However support regarding ports it uses on the router is less than desired. If you have a device on your router that requires port 443, this camera will hog it and render your other device useless. Contacting the router company is not a viable solution when the product is what initiated the issue. That port is a necessary for many things and a product meant for home surveillance should be more flexible than it is now with its lock on port 443.
 This security system works really good, I really like it!
 I am very happy with the camera.  It was very easy to set up and lets me know when someone is approaching my front door.  If you don't need an actual recorder for events, this is great, inexpensive and functional.
 I love my blink, I see my pkg.’s being delivered and I can watch the back of my large lot as well from any break in’s to our storage sheds. No monthly fee and only batteries what’s not to love. Thanks 😊
 Amazing product.  Detects motion about 75 feet away and an estimated 160 degree fan from camera.  Also detects noise from a greater distance.  A white color option would be great.  This would then be unobtrusive on homes of similar color.
 I am happy with the purchase, it works as advertised.  I wish they would get the “grey out” updates to me soon, so I can eliminate that area the camera picks up does not record images of traffic going down my street.  I would also like to see a program allowing my Win10 computer to pick up images, so I can view the image with a few clicks while working.  An even better idea is to attach an API to the PC program so that programmers can use the images in when developing Alexa skills or programming language programs.
 I have three of these outside and six inside. Beautiful optics, clear image. Only limited time viewing before it times out. NO ABILITY TO FRAME CAPTURE AN IMAGE. Such a great camera. It would be so nice to be able to frame capture on the fly. Almost all the other cameras offer this. Too bad.
 The camera is great and has very clear videos but the notification of someone on camera comes after they left the view of the camera. Another thing is that we bought one in October and it’s December 26th and the batteries are dead and it says the batteries last longer than a year so I’m kinda annoyed by that. I still recommend the camera because no monthly fee is added and it’s reasonably priced.
 Great camera for the price! The set up was so easy, I think it took me less than 5 mins to set the cameras up to my phone. Maybe a little more time to figure out where I wanted them. The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars, is bc how easy it is to instal them, they would be very easy to take down. However, if someone would try and remove them, they would be caught on camera. The footage is so clear, and I don’t even have it set on the higher resolution. I definitely expect to buy more soon.
 Love these cameras. Work well no monthly fee. Not too crazy about how camera just snaps onto holder. Too easy to steal. Its a big investment. Needs to he safe from easy theft.  But function is great!
 Works great, but a few days later one of the camera just stop working, I ran through the troubleshooting a few time, end up working for a moment then stops. Tried to connect blink support no answer yet. Can I just exchange one camera? Just I got it off here?
 I’ve had the cameras since Oct 7th. Last night it lost connection for some reason and what do you know???? Someone stole something from the yard. Really hurts the value when the one time I needed it, it failed. I’d be careful picking this one. It failed me horribly.
 Wow!  This system is so easy to install!  I am not a great "techie" person...only took about 20 minutes to install from start to finish though.  Super easy set-up, free app, works great!  The resolution of the videos is much better than my previous security system.  I am glad I made this purchase!  Now I can see my kids coming and going.  Also great for seeing when packages are delivered to my home.  This was a no-brainer! For the price and ease of use, I am very pleased.
 I like the product although getting started was a bit problematic.  Once I got the hang of how to set up the base unit and add the high quality cameras, it became easier to add more cameras later on.<br/><br/>This order was for three camera's for a Xmas present (that should tell the reader something), but don't make the mistake for asking for three gift wraps.  They packed all three in a single bag, which is fine, but still charged me for three of them.
 This system was easy to install and set up via the app. Within seconds of motion detection I recieve an alert via the app on my smart phone. Would recommend product to anyone looking for a easy to install camera system.
 Product is exactly as described.  System works great, picture is clear,  sound is clear. Only thing I dislike is that you cannot zoom in/out on the recordings. There is also about a 2-3 second delay. The price is a bit more than I wanted to spend but all in all I am happy with this product. I will be adding a couple more cameras to my system,  but it will take some time as one camera alone is approx. $89.

Not sure if you can tell from the photo but now I get this purple snow like static in the video. I uploaded a video and pictures.
 I am very pleased with our new 2 camera system, we have had it up and running for two weeks now and all is well. Very clear picture day &amp; night. Our only complaint is the brackets that come with the units are terrible. They kept falling off the cameras with the slightest touch. We went out on Amazon and purchased 2 new brackets that should be included with the units. These work great.
 Poor camera build quality, feels flimsy and cheap. The app feels unpolished compared to competitor's offerings.  Camera footage quality is subpar too compared to others of the same resolution. Purchased a Reolink instead and much happier.
 Works great.  Great image quality, video, and sound.  The only thing is the notifications are completely hit and miss.  I've had days where I receive no notifications and I'll log in and there are several recordings.  It just randomly went offline after a month so I need to resync it again, hopefully just a one time deal.
 So far, so good.  Had to tinker a bit with sensitivity and if is very windy out you will be changing it depending on where it is placed. Night vision is good.  Could see we had a cat and a raccoon visiting out back.  Plus a moth that was in love with the camera for a few mornings.  Happy enough we may buy more.
 I bought the 2 camera package and one of the camera is using batteries with 14-20 days and it shows low wifi connection. Now on 3 weeks and customer service still think the camera is not the problem. Change batteries several times and swap with the other camera that is on same batteries that is now further away it show good wifi connection.
 It seems that the mounting hardware was not sufficient to hold hardware in place, therefore not able to use. We have missed the return date by 5 days and stuck with an item that is non usable. Due to the in-climate weather, we were unable to attempt installing again. Now that it is warmer...too late to return...unhappy.
 I was excited to purchase and install this system and it worked great for the first few months.  Then after updates through the app store(IOS) they have screwed it up to where you can no longer send videos.  After contacting customer service and being told that they can replicate my phone and version and successfully send videos they later contacted me saying that they couldn't and were aware of the issue.  I have since then downloaded at least 2 updates to which they have yet to fix the issue.  Sure wish I would have just bought the Ring system
 I like that these cameras are wire free so there’s no cords to run &amp; no plugging in or running wiring. I like the app that works with the cameras &amp; that you can see live view or look back at recorded files. The mounting hardware that comes with it isn’t very good. I bought a few mounting brackets for the blink XR cameras online for about $10 &amp; those work much better so you can aim camera wherever you need it. I use these cameras to watch over my front &amp; back yard of my home.
 Very easy to set it up. Found no difficulties. Free cloud storage. Motion sensor worked fine. I wish it could respond slightly faster then it would be perfect. Good customer service. Now it's an Amazon company.
 I have 2 Blink cameras in my house so I bought this one for the front door outside. It worked great for a while and then the hinge would no longer hold the camera up. Right now it is attached to the front door frame and leaning all the way down to the welcome mat! I'm waiting on a 12 dollar attachment to try that has an arm with a ball to hold the camera. I'm hoping this works! The camera works fine and the picture is clear. I was just disappointed in the attachment.
 I have oh I guess 10 of the whites ones all have been great.  But out door ones don’t seam to have eonough signal strength.  Not sure if I would buy again jury’s still out on that one.
 This camera concept is great. There are two major issues. One the battery is said to last 2 years! Well mine only lasted 10 days!! The camera is pointed at a street with lots of traffic. Still.<br/>The other issue is the night vision is not good at all.<br/>So. I am returning, this is a good information camera without much traffic. Otherwise don't waste your money.
 Pretty good so far. Setup was fairly easy. Sensors are good, as well as alerts. Mounts are my biggest complaints in that it has poor adjustments and not very sturdy. I did get these for a great price during Christmas season
 Really worked out. No wiring. No power plug in issues. Only annoying thing. Thy sell a blink siren that u can manually activate. But you can’t buy it on Amazon and no one there can tell you how to buy it
 When it works its great the connectivity is a problem still no extra fee or monthly service or worth the money
 Affordable system for living with untrustworthy neighbors. Provides some peace of mind regarding mail, packages and vehicles. Wireless cameras with no storage subscription and affordable batteries are the features that compelled me to purchase. System was simple to install, too.
 This is my 4th camera I've ordered.  Two outside, two inside.  My only complaint is at time the recording is slow to load.  But other than that it's great.  No monthly fees and easy set up!
 Good video and audio quality (day &amp; night). Easy user interface. Simple to arm/disarm. It takes some patience and practice finding the right sensitivety levels for your needs. Have not had any problems with the sync module or the cameras.
 So far, I love it. Simple set up. Easy to use app. I have the camera positioned to view my front door. It captures good quality video and audio. I love that I can peek in a view a live feed anytime.<br/><br/>If your looking for a simple, motion detection camera, buy it.<br/><br/>If you want a security system, don’t buy this. Buy a security system. It’s a no brainer.
 Great camera. I've watched delivery people drop off packages which was great.<br/>Installation was painless. I wish it offered the option to speak to people at our door but otherwise I haven't had any issues.
 I have 125mps Spectrum modem/router,  so speed is not my problem. Both the snapshot and video constantly fail with both displaying error messages<br/>To make matters worse I have only one camera on this network.
 I really enjoy these cameras... I only wish you could record to your phone or cloud on demand.  It will record on movement, but not on demand.  If you buy these on sale, you score, if not, they are very pricey
 The Good: Opened the package that came in one day, read instructions, five minutes, downloaded app, plugged in sync module, camera up and running in five minutes. The whole operation took less than twenty minutes.<br/>Not so good: The package does not come with any mounts for the cameras. Now I can double stick tape up the camera or search for one on Amazon.
 I love that you don't have to pay a monthly subscription fee with these. And the ease of use and installation is excellent. While there are a few features that could drastically make them better, I've been happy with them thurs far!
 No wires, no hassle.  The only one I can find that is battery operated and comes with free cloud storage too.  So far it's doing what it's supposed to do.  Wish there is a two-way model that I can use at the front door to use as an intercom.
 A little nervous about the batteries lasting two years, so only 4 stars for now.  However, the set up is stupid simple...even for the IT challenged!  Great picture.  Great price.  Oh...free storage?  YES PLEASE!
 the cameras fail a lot, they do not communicate when I want it, they always fail, busy, install high-speed internet and as always, the problem continues, and call technical support and it does not work as it is supposed
 We installed a 3 camera system to 2 smart phones in less than 15 minutes.  Everything seems to work, fine, we both get alerts, can "live" view, and can able/disable the system.  Nice system for a good price, and no monthly fees.  I would definitely recommend it (actually, I already have!)
 Setup was very simple. The app is very easy to use with lots of customization options. The camera is of good quality, and the image quality is very sharp. The free storage for your recorded clips is really nice.
 Product as described. Easy install outside, downloaded app and set up within minutes! Love the cloud, able to store clips &amp; select all to delete. Has a good range, in fact we have the sensitivity set to 5 because it would pick up the shadows of moving vehicles! Love the camera, very happy
 Great little camera system that’s very well contained and operated. Decent night vision but it kind of washes out faces if they are in the direct path of the IR light. Easy to setup and easy to install, I’m extremely happy overall. Feel much safer when I get those notifications showing me what’s going on at home when I’m not around.
 This was an add on to 3 exterior cameras that I had already installed.  This is an impressive product with a very easy installation.  I couldn't be any happier.  I just wish I could monitor it on my laptop.
 1 Oct 2018. I requested a return and sent the item back. Amazon CS was very helpful understood the issue.  One of the cameras would not sync with the phone app, took longer to report an alert. Would not buy another blink again.  Sadly I thought it would work for our needs, but it did not.
 After a month of being patient, I tried numerous locations for the module and cameras, I tried all of the settings and ultimately came to the conclusion.....you get what you pay for.  I even upgraded my modem to 500 mbps speed thinking that was the problem; however, the cameras ablilty to capture video during day and night was  severely Inconsistent with connectivity to the module, and the video was overall unresponsive to movement within the field of view.  Sorry not impressed.
 set up was quick and easy. it works well and setting up a schedule for activation was easy.  I also like how you can turn of the on indicator light that you cannot turn off on the indoor version.
 Disappointed with these. They are clunky and recording is slow. I was hoping these were as good as the amazon indoor cameras but it’s not. I would prefer a different brand if given another choice.
 We love this camera; was easy to set up and works great!
 I love these cameras for outside my house. They were so easy to install.<br/>The website is user friendly and live can control many features with my smartphone.<br/>I also purchased the outdoor skin to add extra protection against elements.<br/>I would recommend this product will probably by more.
 I bought these cameras, 3 indoor 2 outdoor for security system. THEY ARE FANTASTIC!<br/>High quality, work perfectly, great pictures and video. No wiring, wifi to our devices worldwide.<br/>We monitored our home from Europe, crystal clear! I highly recommend these products!
 so far extremely happy purchased 5 camera system and works great! Had to call customer service for lost signal issue, but unlike other reviews I had NO issue getting resolved
 So easy.<br/>Just put the battery in, run setup, take a test pic, mount in place, test with another pic &amp; adjust, done!<br/>This is my second camera for my back yard.<br/>Great system!
 Love this system and easy use. I do wish that we could start recording while we’re viewing the cameras on our phone, but that’s a want. I highly recommend these cameras. Easy to setup and install.
 It works okay but not that great. Slow reaction times and disconnects often.
 Have to change battery in areas of high activity much much sooner than the reported battery life.  Quality and clarity are good.  I wish they would upgrade the App to where you can put different scheduling times on each separate camera.
 These cameras are super cool.  The app works well, cameras are easy to program in and simple to deploy.  I started with a 2 unit kit, but will be adding more cams in the future.  Superb video quality.
 On paper, this is a great system. Motion activated camera that sends me an alert whenever motion is detected? Sounds awesome! However, I ran this for a month and learned it just isn't what I expected.<br/><br/>I wanted something to monitor my front porch. This Blink system seemed better than the more expensive Ring so I gave it a shot. My biggest complaint is the motion detection. I installed this above my front door, but got alerted every time a black vehicle drove by my house. This was strange and no matter how low I put the motion sensitivity I would still get alerted every time a black vehicle drove past in the distance.<br/><br/>I ended up moving the camera two more times around my porch. The final straw was when I started getting inconsistent motion alerts. Sometimes I would walk under the camera, wave at it, and nothing would happen. I would also receive false alerts when the sun would rise. This really angered me. I realized that if I couldn't trust or rely on the system to work consistently, it wasn't any use to me.<br/><br/>I spent a lot of time trying to get this system to work. I grew anxious about this camera and the lack of security it provided and I really tired to make it work. Maybe my camera was flawed. Maybe it was defective. But I finally decided I would rather have my $100 back to put towards a real system, or save my money and not get angry every time I received a false alert.<br/><br/>This system relies on motion detection to perform and in my opinion it just isn't reliable.
 Love this
 Ok So IF, blink modual, Wifi, all you blink cameras and THE ACTION is in the same  10 ft.² area.<br/>Then this SYSYEM IS PERFECT. (Given if you are also close by to make sure its wirking )
 Day time works fine, but night vision is very poor, though captures it nicely but not useful as pictures are not clear.  The only good thing about this camera is battery operated (I hope battery last longer).
 It recorded very well but the images were not clear enough to make an identification
 Easy to set up. The zones feature needs some work, seems like it is ineffective. Some of the features don’t work as they should, at least in my opinion. But for the price they are very decent. Good option.

I can arm and disarm notifications and review associated saved video clips.  I love knowing exactly when there is motion at my front door and being able to review and save the video without a monthly fee.

 Very easy setup, great quality picture and sound, and a decent price. The clips aren't super long, but you don't have to pay a subscription fee for storage. I definitely recommend this camera system.
 I really like how the camera operates.  The setup instructions, or lack of, were a bit frustrating but we managed to get through it.  Also wish I had been altered to buy a mount for fastening to the house.  Maybe I was but didn’t realize the mount described that comes with it, isn’t adequate for a good mounting bracket for outdoors.
 So far so good. Easy set up, clear picture, called tech support and got fast service. Very happy. **Biggest problem is it takes the video soon long to play, not hood when u wanna see what's going on !!!
 My husband is a security nut so we have several IP cameras.  This one is wireless and uses WIFI.  It is a good camera but is only as fast as your WIFI, but it has a good picture.  It arrived on time and new as described.
 Work as described. picture quality is nice. Night vision is not bad. I have been able to catch packages as they arrive and asked neighbors move them to a secure location during the various porch pirate season throughout the year. It's a great 1st level entry camera system. From my experience, phone notification times very between 5-20 secs depending on bandwidth and location. Easy to set up and free cloud storage.
 Super frustrated.  No matter what I do it keeps going off-line. Now every time it detects motion there’s no video to go with it. I’m getting ready to send it back. It’s more hassle than it’s worth
 I installed this five camera system at my house in less than two hours and it works wonderfully. The system had easy to follow instructions that even a non-techie like me was able to follow. The picture is a little small but that should be expected for the camera size.
 It's a good security camera but had I to buy a blink waterproof charger because we live in an area with lots of motin. The lithium batteries would only last a week. Still over a good security camera.
 I love my cameras but the batteries dont last 2 years ive had to change 3 of my camera batteries already since i put them up Thursday.
 No matter what setting I put this on, it doesn’t see anything coming up to my porch or on my porch. But then randomly maybe every week or two it’ll catch a car passing on the street 90 feet away LOL
 Omg these cameras are worth the money. I even bought an extra one to put on my back door. I'm so glad I found these cameras because I didn't want to be in contract with an alarm company. Once you have wifi you are good to go. They are easy to install.
 The camera works well.  Battery life is very disappointing.  I am on my third set of batteries since January.  I have set up the camera at the front of the house.  Because there are three persons that come and go all day, there is a lot of videos.  My clip length is 15 seconds.  I turned down the sensitivity due to street traffic about 100 feet away.
 I only gave them a 4 rating because the hinge on the bracket you put the camera on is very loose and moves too easily.  The cameras are great and affordable, but buy an upgrade on the brackets.
 We really like our Blink security system.  We added two outdoor cameras to our in home system.  It is Super easy, but the setup instructions included with the new cameras were not helpful.  You cannot install a new camera from the Blink menu. I went to Youtube to find out that all I had to do was scroll down to the bottom of the existing camera picture zones on the Blink phone app.  That is where the add camera icon is located.  Click the icon, insert the camera serial number, name the zone, click a picture and wha-lah.  The clarity is incredible.
 This unit was so easy to set up and install. I would give it ten stars if I could. Great video. Easy to operate. Finally! A security cam that was eaay to set up and get running.
 Camera is ok but the plastic mount is a complete joke it’s so flimsy and easy to pop out that if I mounted it outside it would fall off. That’s pitiful expected more from amazon
 The set up is easy and picture quality is decent for the day time.<br/><br/>Low light images are not great.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is the battery life.  I bought two camera and both of the units had dead batteries within one month.  I did extend the clip length to 10 seceonds.  I live on a dead end street with not a lot of traffic, but the units capture movement on a fairly steady basis.  I would think the batteries should last longer, but I guess I’ll change them every month or find different units.
 I’ve tried a lot of cameras installed various types these come closest to a wired installed system I recommend them to a lot of my customers who don’t have thousands to spend on security
 This is the best security system that is reasonably priced and easy to set up. Even for a technology challenged person like me. It does a great job, and I've recommended it to family and friends. SO COOL !!
 So far I'm very happy with Blink. It's perfect for what I need it for. I have it at the front door and it picks up everything that moves...….even a wasp that came to look it in the eye...lol.
 This is my fourth blink camera.  I am very satisfied especially with the battery life and when the batteries do die, you can replace with off the shelf batteries.  Not like other cameras I have used.
 Easy to install. Picture are clear. Will purchase some more for the back of the house.
 Blink was an easy set up, both mounting the camera and app on my phone.<br/>We use it for security and for monitoring when we are expecting a shipment when not home.<br/>Excellent video and audio from this unit.<br/>We recommend blink to our friends and of course to you as the reader of reviews.<br/>We will be purchasing another for our back yard very soon.
 Love my Blink system! It sends Instant alerts to my iPhone, has Live View mode, Free Cloud storage for up to two hours of clips , and no monthly monitoring fees! Plus, setup is a breeze.  I like that I can adjust the sensitivity so that it doesn’t pick up every single vehicle that drives past my house . Can’t beat that!
 Hands down the best security camera system. Batteries DO last long, easy install, user friendly app. LOVE!
 Quality is good as is the recording that comes with it, but does burn through some batteries. Alkaline batteries work fine, but only last a few weeks. The lithium that came with lasted a month or 2.
 Spent an hour trying to get the unit to connect to my WiFi network without success. Called tech support (another hour)and they concluded I received a faulty sync module.  Now I wait 2-3 more days to receive a replacement.
 This camera does exactly what we were looking for: a simple-to-set-up, straightforward, affordable security camera. I've used it to see who's at the door when I wasn't expecting anyone, which made me feel way safer, and while away on vacation to check in on how things were doing on the live-feed. We receive notifications every time someone or something sets the camera off, and have hooked it up with our Alexa so we can just tell her to "Arm" or "Disarm" it without going into the app.<br/><br/>Great product!
 This camera system is fantastic for home security where you are a DIY person. easy set up, instructions, great tech help if needed. can't say enough. Quality and Cost can't be beat as far as I'm concerned have had 2 cameras for month GREAT.
 Although I will end up using the Blink it will not be where originally planned.  Its coverage was not adequate, but in another location on my property it will suffice.  I would not recommend it as the primary security.
 Had to call Cust. Support 4X before I got someone willing to help me ... and I was on the phone with him for 2 hours.<br/>He couldn't get the App download to work.<br/>Sent it back.
 Very happy with the quality of the video compared to our much older system but not so happy with the motion activated alerts.  Interface allows adjustment but it seems to either get tripped by everything, or nothing at all.  Branches moving in the wind brought the 2 year estimated battery life down to less than 2 months.  Would love if you could create motion zones because having your cell phone chiming in with a notification every few minutes gets really old really quickly.
 Great system, but not for me. If you're looking for a live monitor, this will fall short of your expectations. Understanding the purpose and capabilities of a product is key to your satisfaction as a consumer; this product was my reminder.<br/><br/>"I am still learning." -Michelangelo
 I needed a decently priced camera to motion capture events when I'm away from my apartment and this does the job.<br/><br/>There's a live view to view live video. Small enough to not be obviously seen when placed properly. Easy to set up and use.
 This is a great camera, the resolution is great, the company did an update where you choose the motion you want. Easy to set up and it's easy to replace the batteries. win/win.
 Ranges are much less that advertised. I had to put the Sync module next to my router in order for it to connect and the camera will not work more than 20 feet from the Sync module. The ranges are so short that I have not bothered mount the camera (still sitting on the kitchen counter) because it really provides no value from where it is functional other than maybe an indoor camera. Had I wanted that, I would have bought the indoor model to begin with.
 I liked the price, the easy set up and the Free online storage.  The night vision is great.  Motion detection is not perfect but works..  Does not pick up motion coming straight at the camera.. (that is noted in there adds)  For the price and ease of set up it is a really great system..  I have 4 cameras and will add a 5th for 100% coverage of my property.
 Easy setup. Control Software easy to use. I hope the battery last as long as advertised. Suggestion on improving would be add a microphone and a battery backup in Sync module with storage chip if power would go out.
 Batteries on one camera lasted only 3 months, that's an awful lot less than the 2 years advertised.
 I really love the live with sound short videos of motion detection. The config was so easy even an old lady like me could set it up. The price was a bargain for the product's utility.
 Love the portability of the cameras.  We bought all Blink XTs so that we can move them outside or inside.  We have them in our RV also.  You can turn the alerts on or off.  We also use them to keep any eye on on schnauzer.  Easy to set up on your cell phone.
 I like the idea there is no costs involved, cameras run on batteries, very easy to install, took about 20 minutes. I purchased the cameras to protection for my home. Video and live feed are very clear.
 East to set up with the app.  Instructions are easily understood and there is no cost for storing the video.  Battery operated with easy installation.  I recommend getting the receptacle holder for the communication devise.  Ordering mine now.<br/>Will buy more.
 Works great, battery lasts forever even in the - degree winter weather of Alaska.
 Great wireless cameras, but u need rechargeable batterys because the camera uses a lot of batter and the distance from ur internet router and camera can not be that far.
 Very happy with Camera  Very reliable good product
 Bought 2 of these.they work great but this morning i found out ants love them more.
 Constant connectivity issues with the Blink XT. Camera is 4 feet away from the blink hub and 12 feet from a router (direct sight, no walls). Camera app shows 5 out of 5 bars to the hub and to the router yet the camera live view is never working.
 I even bought another two additional cameras.  They all sinked perfectly with no problems.  The entire system is great and well worth the money, but be aware that it is monitored and controlled thru a smart phone and not your home computer.
 Really like the cameras so far, not sure how long the batteries will last but we'll see. The one thing I don't like is the inability to add them as part of an Alexa routine so I can arm them when I tell Alexa goodnight.
 For the price, ease as setup, WIFI, battery power, mobility, software and quality of picture and video this is a great value. A great, low cost way to get some video security setup for your home or business.
 Easy to install, yes. Easy to use, yes. But, poor picture quality, no zoom capability and mounting brackets are pretty flimsy. I suppose if you were just using these for the inside of your house or apartment they'd be fine but for outdoor use they just aren't that great.
 No issues with this camera now after a few months of cold winter weather. Still on original battery's and this get triggered often at my back door. Highly recommend these.
 It works super! Gets the job done. The only think I feel like needs to be pointed out, it does not record all the time. It records for a max of 60 secs when motion is detected. If you are not looking for a camera that records all the time and is 100% wireless this is it.
 Only 1 regret ... why did I wait so long.  So easy 123 set up and my home is in full view and secure. No more running up and down the stairs for a doorbell only to find a solicitor.
 I now have 6 of them I read somewhere they work up to 100 feet I have one 127 feet from my house I have a old module that wouldn't allow the cameras to record multiple cameras at the same time this new one does I've gotten 3 recording's at the same moment not sure if it can do more than 3 but it's enough for me
 Absolutely love the Blink XT camera system! Researched for months on best camera system for our vacation cabin. Very easy installation and setup. Best amazon purchase ever!!
 Love this camera so far. I am using outdoors. Great picture at night and during the day. I like the beta where you can gray out sectors to prevent triggering the motion detection. May buy another one!
 I was initially skeptical when I purchased the product because of the bad reviews on the mounts. Today as I write the review is day 4 since I mounted my cams and they latched perfectly to the mounts. Am assuming the mounts were modified. So far so good and am a new home owner large space living alone so I can monitor the inside and out of the home while I take frequent trips. I am in the military
 Bracket to cheap, the snap on system too easy to connect it on and off bracket. Cant share live feed with other device or other family at same time. Times out after 1min of live feed, you have to keep hitting continue. Not even worth the price.
 My cameras are for security for my package deliveries, and they have options for how long or short of time you like the camera to run. They also have a option to restart quickly or not. Very clear
 I've come back to change my review from 3 stars to 1. Do not purchase these cameras. Poorly thought out user interface software, cameras lose the first second or two of activity, WILL NOT RECORD MORE THAN 60 SECONDS EVEN IF THE ACTIVITY THAT IS BEING RECORDED HAS NOT STOPPED, and night vision is completely washed out.
 These are the best because of the no wires involved!!  Great long lasting battery, these pick up wild animals outside the house and when packages get dropped off.  Really handy!
 Easy set up and excellent night vision. It doesn't over trigger. We had a bad rain storm and it didn't set it off but a mouse did. I would have given it 5 stars but they don't have it worked out to project on your tv. It does on the Amazon spot.
 Great camera for the price. The only complaints I have are the ridiculous mount that it comes with and the resolution could be better. I would gladly pay more for better resolution. I like that the online storage is free and I can add more cameras as needed.
 Battery and one camera only lasted 6 months and I bought a system for my friend and his battery just barely less of him a month. Other than that the cameras work great. Also I had no trouble hooking up my cameras to the wireless system but my friend had to call customer service to get his hooked up because it wasn't working correctly with the wireless system that was kind of a pain to deal with
 The motion detection is a joke. There’s such a lag from when it senses something to when it records. I’ve tried adjusting it every possible way. The person it senses will already be in your house before it even gets a glimpse of them. Same for when the leave!!! Only positive thing is it’s night vision, audio and live feed. Other than that it’s a waste of money!
 The "FSMART Camera Rotation Mounting Bracket", works great with this cam unit.  My cam did not come with a bracket.  It's the best, AA battery, wireless, outdoor unit on the market now.<br/><br/>Cons:  Fixed locations.  Cannot rotate, remotely in any direction.
 Bought for outside home. We are in a cold winter climate so estimated two year battery might get six months in winter. Nope. Lasted 6 weeks. Claim too good to be true and I underestimated the impact of cold. If your weather gets below 32 degrees you’ll probably have a similar experience.
 Cameras seem to work in the beginning, then, after a few months, the keep going offline, or can't access live view, and keep having to reset the module so the cameras can work correctly... like every month you have to reset the module.... should have bought a security system with hard wire... at least that doesn’t mess up....

Very well packed. Quality all around. Very Easy to set up and install. App Store application works flawlessly on my iPad and IPhone.<br/>Great night vision and motion detection.<br/>Notifications are accurate and timely.
 We love the Blink, it does it's job really well, and by the way just to remind people when buying the Blink, buy the bracket that goes with it, easier installation.
 I don’t typically bother to leave reviews, but I am so impressed with the ease of this that I felt I must give proper credit. I just got this today, and had it set up and mounted outside in less than 10 minutes. I ordered dinner, and the Blink app alerted my phone of motion detected before the delivery guy even got to my door! As long as the battery holds up decently I will be ordering several more of these.
 I like the easy setup and that it can be mounted anywhere. I ran through one set of batteries in one week due to the setting and high volume of clips stored (busy street). I had to play with it and angle it so it doesn't get every car driving by.  I wish it would tape longer. If something is going on it only catches about 30 seconds max and you can't talk to people at the door like the Ring.
 Item arrived as described and shipped in a timely manner. I was able to setup the camera on my network and fix it to my within 30 minutes of receiving it. Great item and I highly recommend it!
 Great picture/viability. There is sound too! Connected to app on my phone and you can customize alerts and intensity of the motion sensor alerts. We've had no issues at all. We've even had friends immediately purchase them when they saw ours installed and we showed them the video quality
 It is a great device.  I would give if 5 stars, except I wish the notifications were a little faster.  The person is usually gone by the time I receive a notification that there was motion on my porch.  It does it job as far as recording all activity on my porch.  I really wanted it to discourage porch pirates and to have a recording of them if they show up.
 I had a bit of a problem getting set up but it was my problem not Blinks!  I find them excellent for the job and I I intent to get several more cameras for more coverage.
 Cheap price for piece of mind.  Work great.  Our cameras go off multiple times a day(12-20 times a day) so batteries don't last long. Average battery replacement for us is monthly.  No issues so far.
 They are easy to install, however I get camera busy error a lot. When I try to view the live feed it just buffers. Wish they worked better. I have a very strong WiFi signal but just not working for me.
 So far this little video camera is freaking awesome!  It was easy to set up for an electronically challenged person like myself. Wow this is fantastic. Will purchase more in the future. They’re kind of pricey, but worth it.
 Have had this up since before christmas.<br/>Great connectivity, picture, and app so far.  Zero complaints<br/><br/>We will see if battery longevity holds up as advertised.
 As far as design its pretty cool, functionality wyze, it’s no good. BATTERY DIED after 1 week of use. Not sure where they got 2 yrs. The camera starts recording motion detection late. The detection radius is maybe 15ft at most. The “ mount” is super flimsy, If you wall mount this thing nd tilt it down a bit feels like it’s just gona come off.  It’s not worth $130, maybe it’s useful to check in on the nursery or as a door bell camera, but definitely not a security cam. I had to  return this thing.
 This is a very basic wireless outdoor camera system, that is easy to use and a good value.<br/><br/>Had no problems setting up a 2 camera system. It took less than 30 minutes, including mounting the cameras.
 Good price and great when it's online, but it goes offline sometimes and needs to be reset in person.  We're not always there, which is why we purchased it. Excellent pictures.
 These are incredibly user-friendly. Quality of audio and video given the price point is spectacular.  I'm so happy I found these, and I love the accessibility and setting adjustments of them through the Blink app. I would purchase these again in a heartbeat - highly recommend!
 Works really well .Control from our phone.Pictures are clear and easy to install.
 Whenever I purchase something that needs to be connected to the internet I have to call my son to help me, however, with Blink I was able to do it myself. I downloaded the app to my phone and followed the step-by-step directions. In an hour's time I had three cameras connected to the internet and two cameras installed on the eaves of my house. The third came sits on a shelf so I can watch my dogs while away. The picture and sound is clear. Best investment I ever made for the security of my home.
 I wanted to love this product and I did...for 9 days...the batteries are already dead! I was going to but a bunch more, thank god I didn’t because I am pretty sure this one is going in the garbage since I can’t afford, in more ways than one, to deal with replacing the batteries every other week! So disappointed!!!
 Wish you could record during live view.<br/>Wish you could login via computer.<br/>Wish it could record for more than a minute.<br/>Has a few seconds delay before it starts recording when sensor is triggered
 I love my system. it was highly recommended by my daughter and son in law.  Easy to use.  The app is wonderful.  I have had no problems with it. Would buy it again immediately
 Bought the five camera system and have 2 in the yard, 2 in the house and 1 at the lake which is probably 50 yards from the house
 easy setup tech support is great have piece of mind, wish it notified as soon as it started video seems to take about 30 seconds after it starts, love wireless.
 You get what you pay for. The night vision was over exposed at times. Not very clear. Lens fogged up at night. Distance from our wifi outside the house was a joke. Shop around.
 Batteries dont even last 24hrs!! Poorly advertised !!!! Set it up yesterday with only 10 sec of rec on motion activation on for less than 6 hrs and its telling me to replace the batteries allready !! With how much these cost, I'd get something else !!!!! Glad I didnt get the 3 pack !!!
 Easy to install camera, night vision is great and can adjust areas to allow for movement and some areas that can be turned off for cars driving by and animal movement.  Wish I could purchase this again at the fall prices I purchased the cameras  for as I need to add on.  Price increase $40 per additional camera.
 Camera functions pretty well, but sensitivity has to be set significantly higher than default value of 5 in order to capture a moving object as it enters the field of view.
 Pros: Great instructions for set up. Quality picture. Good motion sensing.<br/>Cons: The way the camera attaches to the mount seems so week that a stiff breeze could dismount the camera.
 I didn't expect the product to live stream video like my Tend cameras do, the picture quality is good. The sound is okay. but I don't love the way it functions. I like being able to just stream the video without draining the battery. the notifications were pretty slow, meaning once movement was detected it took a fair bit of time for it to tell me on the app. My Tend cameras are actually pretty darn quick and faster than the Blink cameras.
 Not easy to set up. Then 1 part didnt work spent hour on phone with them then had to wait days to get replacement. If i knew it was this difficult would have bought a ring
 Does everything it advertises, and does it well. App is stable, motion detection works well. I will update this when I have used this product more and have some sample video to upload.
 Seriously, if you appreciate peace of mind, do yourself a favor and get some of these. They work like a dream and they capture everything you need to see. Only thing is, you'd want cameras to know when they get delivered to your front porch. You know, just in case...
 I purchased the 2 XT camera set for my home/business. Arrived on time and was able to install the app, router and both cameras in less than 30 minutes. I purchase after-market camera brackets for the camera and router to finish the install the way I wanted it.  Love how simple the app is and usually have a motion detection with 5 seconds. Since my home business is in a separate shop on my property, I quickly know who is at my front door or when packages are delivered.
 This security camera is very good choice in light of wireless, and it’s very easy to setup and mount; however, this easy job drives to easy stealing the camera with one hand only!.
 I have been using for about 10 days now, i am not big fan of it. its ok but sometime it seems like it has problems...i am going to wait few days to see how it goes,,,,it not i will have to return this.
 love this setup! i was a part of the original kickstarter campaign and i loved it so much i had to get an add on! works just as well as the more expensive security systems but at a fraction of the price! very clear and being battery powered means they can mount anywhere!
 Christmas present.WOW! The gift that keeps giving.Like everything especially NO monthly BUT,audio is only 1way &amp; no siren feature.I liked sooo much I added 3 adl cameras.
 Wow, technology is awesome these days. This complete installation and set-up only took about 5 min to complete. Worked so nice, I ordered a 2nd for more coverage. Really slick to use and easy for most to install in such little time.
 love the camera , the wife loves to check on house all the time while at work. we even monitor when things from amazon are delivered!!! no regrets , will prob up grade to more of them at a later time.!!! thanks again amazon!!
 The app lacks expected features like camera rearrangement. Half the time it takes 30 seconds or more for a camera to come online for me to see the video. I've swapped out almost all my blanks for wyze cameras
 I like what the camera can do but this is the third blink camera I've had that has eaten the battteries quickly. They claim two years life on them. This most recent purchase was within three weeks, battery dead. I want these to work because they are so user friendly but maybe not good because of battery drainage. Lithiums are expensive to keep refilling every month.
 Got here super fast very easy to connect with the wi-fi system less than 5 minutes super product so far .very happy  this is exactly what I was looking for. No wires to worry about and alerts are perfect.
 This sytem works very well. Very easy to set up and the view is crystal clear.<br/>I would highly recommend this to anyone needing a security system for home.
 Not impressed with the motion detector or should I say the lack of motion detection. I have walked outside, by the camera, up to the camera, down my driveway and back and it never picked up any motion. I have left my house, got in my car, drove out of my driveway and it never picks up that motion. However, a car on the next street over goes by and you can see a teeny tiny movement and it captures that motion! Very disappointed.
 Finally a really great outdoor monitoring system.  I cannot find anything to complain about. Only one thing I would want is text messaging capability for alerts.
 I couldn't get mine to work.  The camera doesn't move around the room or zoom and I couldn't get it to work with my phone.  The agent and I decided that it was a defective camera.
 Love this little camera. We have 4 at various locations around our property. I have peace of mind leaving town and not having to ask anyone to keep an eye on our property.
 Two cameras I already had to replace the batteries after a few months. Setting is on medium I'd call it.
 I love it because it is small portable and is able to adjust the settings with ease but I hate that 1. I can’t talk through it 2. The battery life is affected when I forget to disarm it.
 Product is good, resolution is acceptable for small camera, night vision is ok. So far Beta for Activity zones is not effective and i hope it improves to help reduce false notifications. I want to hook power up to one of my busier cameras but it says it will void the water proof warranty.
 It has to be connected to two remote devices; your wifi router AND the blink monitor!  The image quality is extremely poor.  Their live streaming is very bad!  Very hard to setup.  Does not really work correctly with Alexa.<br/>I suggest that you get the Amazon Cloud cam its 1M years better than this junk!.
 Purchased this outdoor camera to monitor the outdoors. The 20 foot motion detection distance is grossly inadequate for any real outdoor monitoring of my rural property.  If all you need to monitor is a door into a structure then the 20 foot maximum detection distance may be sufficient<br/><br/>UPDATE:  in less than 2 months after acquiring and mounting this camera, the motion detection function stopped completely.<br/><br/>Complete waste of money in my opinion!!!!!!
 Unless you have awesome internet service.
 Good picture but camera range from module is limited.  Once I move the camera outside it would not pick up my WIFI.  Had to move back inside and set in window.
 Super simple installation. Make sure you have good placement for a good WiFi signal. I would also recommend the weather protectors for your cameras.
 My experience is if the camera fail they run you through endless tech support loop I think the idea is to get you to give and buy another one. which I won't until they replace this one.
 Nice cam but every change of light effect it. if the deliver person coming fast it will not get him. Not the best camera in the market.
 Software on android phone would constantly log me out.  What good id a camera if you are not logged in to receive alarms?  A trouble shooting guide told me to reload software.  Since that time I have not been able to log in at all.  When enter my password will just go back to the enter password page.  No prompts to tell you why.  Works IK on my android tablet, not my phone.
 I would give it a 5 star for the quality, price point, no subscription needed, design, ease of use. But not having a desktop version for one to monitor wile at work, etc. seems like an easy feature to implement that still is not available and that is a big disadvantage compared to other products.
 I've had a one-camera system for less than two weeks and I have had to completely re-set the system twice already because the Blink module wi-fi network just stopped working. I am going to throw it out and look for a more dependable system.
 As long as you have a good internet and a strong WiFi it works great. I do wish the hub had  a Ethernet port so you wouldn’t have to rely on the WiFi connection.
 Set up is easy and the price is right for what you get but from the first day I installed both cameras one works great with motion detection the other does not, I've given it a week playing with it and seeing if weather or location would change how it works but it doesn't... the other camera works great in both locations I moved it to(switched it with the other cameras location knowing the one worked fine there).<br/><br/>I have put in a email request for help with the broken camera I'm waiting for a response. Once/if I get one I will up date my rating and review.<br/>Other things I've noticed is the camera IR works good enough for what we want, it' picks up cat's crossing our porch at night and during the day so that' a plus. The phone app is easy to use and both my wife and I can see and control what we need too, it' works on both phones with no problems at all.<br/><br/>The Camera mount that comes with it is on the cheap side in the way it feels and the screws that come with it striped while putting it in the roof...so make sure when you screw it in it's where you want it because it may be hard to unscrew and move later...<br/><br/>It would be nice if it had a program for the computer so I could check from my laptop. If customer service comes back as helpful I will note it and give them another star, if not I will be taking this down to a two star rating... for now I would recommend checking other systems out and then go with your best judgment.<br/><br/>Update: 11/29/17<br/>After working with customer service for a couple of days and trying everything they suggested they are sending a replacement camera. True commutation is through emails but response time was with-in 24 hours if not faster and even though I worked with a few different people communication was clear and easy to understand and they seemed very interested in fixing my problem fast as they could. So as far as I'm concerned customer service is 5 stars but I still wish they would come up with a way to view on PC also not just my phone.<br/>Update 12/7/17<br/>New camera arrived on a decent time frame with free shipping to send the other one back that didn't work. New Camera works as good as my other one does! Customer service and product both are great and it's doing the job I wanted it too The phone alert is working great, I'm now aware of kids walking in my yard and by my porch if I have a package missing I will definitely have a very good video to give to the police.
 I bought the five camera package. The set up and installation was easy, however I am unable to get alerts on my Android smart phone (Galaxy S8). Needless to mention that I went through Manage Account &gt; Notifications &gt; App Notifications &gt; General/Motion etc.<br/>Also, it would be much beneficial to have (a) access  to view and get alerts on more than one phone.. In a family only one person gets alerts or has access,  (b) two way audio. and (c) more video clip length.
 Defective out of the box. One camera had a clicking noise and all batteries came defective. I returned them.
 Easy set up. Some issues with camera like missed triggers but tech support was top notch, very responsive. I bought a second system today for another location.
 The quality of video are pretty good. But you will need to figure out the app and settings. The wall mount part does not really work, you would need to buy extra wall mount to have 360 degree view.
 I'm somewhat technologically challenged. I bought blink after using Arlo. I found Blink to be easier to set up, but more importantly, easier to use and maintain. Arlo battery use is quarterly if you're lucky. Plus Arlo makes you re-login at the most inopportune times. Very Annoying! After easily setting Blink up it's pretty much maintenance free. And does what I bought it for. Keeps me informed on the surroundings of my home.

 Great cameras for the price paid. I purchased the two camera (Outdoor XP) so I could install one at my front and rear entrance. The quality of both cameras are good. The only issue is a little delay in recording . Unless someone  stays at door or entrance for a short while most times the camera records when someone is walking away and does not show their face.
 I put this camera on the front of my house. The batteries lasted 10 days. I really like the concept of a cheap camera you can put anywhere you want and not worry about it. The video quality is decent for daytime use but at night, you can pretty much only see silhouettes of people with no real detail. I played with using IR and leaving it off. The night picture quality was usually better without IR.
 Hooked up 1 of 4 cameras right away.... slight delay for turning on but the image quality is amazing! I love the night vision too. Can’t wait to install the rest.
 Wish I could speak to any potential intruders
 Setting this item up first off didn't seem to bad... then all of our issues started. Camera would not stay connected to anything, would constantly drop off and say it needed to be reconnected. Tried reconnecting multiple times a week, only for it not to work. We have been trying to use this since Christmas and have had zero luck. Best to just go ahead and get any of the Arlos, they are much better, and we have had zero issues with them so far.
 I am an audio video tech and my humble opinion is these cameras have so much promise with no power or signal wire - now all wireless with excellent image at 1080. WiFi connect and see live video on demand, motion sensor recording on your phone. I bought two Blink XT's (outdoor model) and will probably buy a couple more within a  week. Once the app is on your phone and all devices are registered and activated the system pops
 Up close picture quality is great but even 17 feet away it couldn't read a licence plate
 Excellent outdoor security cameras.  Detection range and area are great, up to or more than 100ft.  High quality video, especially during daytime.  Night time is not as high quality, but sensing at night is still great.  I caught a cat trying to walk under my truck at 4AM!  AA batteries are very convenient.  I also noticed you can turn off the camera indicator LED by a switch located near the batteries to make these super invisible cameras.<br/><br/>I do have one issue with the camera not turning off after detection has ended, even though i have that option selected.  I am going to contact customer service and report this.  Maybe they have some firmware/software bugs to squash since these are brand new.  This is not a deal breaker as it just means the camera records to the exact amount I specified (30s for instance).
 fantastic product!!!! I chose this blink set up because it was an Amazon company and they have great customer service. This was super easy to set up and get running and works flawlessly absolutely love it!
 Love this little camera.  I wanted to see what critter was wrecking my flower pots. It worked great. Caught the birds and chipmunk. Great picture even at night.  I love that I can be away from home and see what is going on
 Slim, small, easy to mount, and works great.  Excellent picture.  Now let’s see how long the battery lasts.  If it runs 2 years like they say , then this will be the camera to beat !
 Easy to setup and works well. Not exactly a 2-year battery life though. You need to turn down the quality by a lot and reduce all other features to max it to 2-years. So yeah, perhaps two years but it won't be the best.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R2UUP93VTEIARD"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1H68z72GOS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gv4LcHaAS.png"/> Great product. Easy to install. But what’s up with the blue light?! My 9 year old nephew spotted it in less than a day! Video attached. Is there a way to turn that off when it records? Or do I need to just put a piece of electrical tape over it?
 A really great product with awesome customer service. First one had a defect and they immediately sent me out a new one and it’s been working perfect ever sense.
 Only downside I could think of is that you can’t activate cameras individually which may be a non-issue for most. Other than that, they are great
 This camera makes weird noises everytime it detects motion and starts recording. Actual mechanical sounds comes put of it. Like a camera ftom 1970’s. Worthless
 I like the support I get from the Blink group, practically 24/7.  And when they detected that one of their cameras was defective they immediately sent me another one with a ready made label and instructions on returning the defective one in the same box.  I didn't have to do without a camera while waiting for another and I appreciated that very much.  I don't get that much support from the sellers of other surveillance cameras I have purchased .
 I started with two - this is my fourth camera.  Good picture quality, even at night, and weather proof.  This one went out in a tree in my front yard and keeps an eye on my driveway.  Love it!
 Great camera with a clear picture/video and sound. I love that it’s truly a wireless camera, which made it very easy to setup.  It is a little pricey but I still recommend it.
 These camera's are great for keeping an eye on my home while I'm away or just don't want to answer the door. There are tons of great features, the only thing I wish it had was two-way communication (like Ring) but I can live without that since I get free cloud storage (unlike Ring). Looking forward to adding one (or) more to my system.
 I love the Blink camera system. I own 8 indoor/ outdoor cameras. They all work great! Batteries last pretty long but of course that depends on usage.
 This was easy to set up except for putting the batteries in the back part of the camera was hard to lock it into place. Hope that they can fix that and make it easier for people for when I have to change the battery. Overall I've been very happy with this product it has shown good picture resolution.
 I've had it for 4 month now and it does not work properly.  I've adjusted the settings over and over again and it still doesn't work.  Very disappointed in this product.
 Didn't want to spend the few extra dollars and bought the indoor version first, should have just gotten the xt the first times. Effective and notified instantly anytime something happens
 You will not believe the clarity of these cost effective cameras.  The ability to schedule and set sensitivity makes them even better.  No option on the battery yet, but optimistic.  Only downside that I have encountered is the ability to shut down cameras individually.
 Purchased two separate systems and I LOVE the ease of installation, and the ease of managing both systems from one account.<br/><br/>I love these so much I bought them as Christmas gifts for all the guys in the family.
 Product is fine for what it is...a cheap, easy to install video monitoring setup.  Because it runs on batteries, continuous video monitoring is not possible and I knew that.  App is clunky...there should be a list of cameras that settings can be changed en masse instead of a settings screen for each cam.  Request sent to answer one minute survery "so you can help pick future options'' is BS.  It's just a marketing, data-mining tool.
 got this as a present for my husband who usually has trouble setting things up. this was easy, other than to find the best place to mount it. Once we decided the whole process took just a few minutes.
 This camera works on everything, my boyfriend and I get the same alerts and same clips which helps us both because it doesn't make one person be the "administrator" or whatever. My sister has a similar product but doesn't get to use all of the features because her boyfriend is set up as the main person on their account.
 We bought 2 at Best Buy and then bought this 3rd one.  Easy directions and installation.  Definitely a great camera to keep an eye on pets.
 This is my third Blink camera and I love them all. They work great for me and are easy to install and maintain. Can't complain. Highly recommend!
 These are great for the price and long battery life. We’ve mounted them around our house and they seem to work well. There is always a slight delay in the camera sending the clip, but to be expected.
 Had it for a couple weeks now. Great product. Free monitoring with text alerts, that's nice. You can adjust sensitivity levels on recording as well. Good product.
 This is an amateur camera, do not buy it if you want to watch the stream, as you have to keep hitting continue.  Also the recording is terrible... It starts recording when the person is almost out of the viewing area.
 I wasn't expecting a first class technology for this price and while I don't want to imply that this is the situation all of the time....it's almost more frustrating that sometimes the video's open right up, but more often then not they take a good long time or don't open up at all.  Live view is notoriously unreliable and most times I cannot get it to open getting a message that says "Live view failed"  or worse yet "not authorized".
 This is great piece of mind every time I leave the house ! I’ve had no problems! I also bought for 2 other people and they love it! Also with 0 problems
 Best ever! Records when nothin detects and have nigh vision and sound? My boss has home security she paid thousands for and it has no sound! This does!
 Really loved the color.  States that it is dishwasher safe.  Ummm, no.  When put in dishwasher initially, the black "paint" spread onto other areas of the items.
 Horrible cameras! Got fooled by the four stars. The motion doctor is the worst. I have a Couple of ring prouducts which is a lot better. I was drawn to the product because it has free cloud recording service. What’s the point of free cloud service if it doesn’t pick up motion?
 Free cloud, it's size and portability sets the blink apart from all the rest.<br/><br/>Only two items that would seal the deal are opening it up for third party software (closed system is intended to milk out the cloud fees) and the option for smartphone alerts to be distinguished from the rest.<br/><br/>Great product
 The battery died in 3 weeks . I agree to the fact that the camera is good. The exterior camera firmware was missing the mesh feature which is added recently it will help optimizing the battery life.<br/><br/>But its not acceptable for the fact that the battery still ran out in 3 weeks. I tried maximum battery optimization before the mesh feature came out recently.  Looking for other options as well. At this point I am no decided whether to return it or not.
 Love our Blink XT camera! I recommend them to everyone. Just wish the battery life lasted longer, we have it on a more sensitive setting and I find we change them at minimum once a month, but more like every 2-3 weeks. Great quality video, sound is clear. Excellent product for the price point. Does exactly what we need it to do!
 I love these cameras.  Couldn’t have been easier to install and setup. I got them on a great deal but would have paid twice the amount for them at their regular price.
 Their garbage the batteries Don’t  last  enemy two weeks lol. Don’t buy them  The sound don’t work you have to have more than one brain for each camera they are garbage save your money
 Who knew!  I like this camera BETTER THAN THE EXPENSIVE ADT cameras I have outside!  Simple to install, simple to use, simple to adjust my settings...I love it and plan on buying more!
 Works great, an we saw who was illegally dumping in our trash bin. Only downside is it costs too much for additional cameras to add-on.
 Love this little camera.  Easy to setup and has been working great.  We actually bought a setup for our fifth wheel and our home.  Wherever we are we can see whats up.
 Blink is ok, but if you want to have a fully secure CCTV,i would just get those CCTV with DVR, i ended up buying usb cables to plug in these cameras,cause they drain batteries like **** so yea, not for me. Overall, its Ok
 So far so good.  I currently have 8 Arlo cameras, but I'm going broke buying batteries.  So far, I've had a couple of these camera's in high traffic areas for the last couple of months, and haven't had to change the batteries.  So this is fantastic for me.  With the settings I use, the batteries will never last 2 years, but that doesn't matter - they all ready are lasting SO much longer than what I'm used to.  Great camera so far!
 The product works as advertised which is what I look for in any good product.
 It wasn't too difficult to setup and once I figured out all the settings it works fine.so I guess this is motion activated that must be how it saves power.you can also press a video button or camera button if you want to see it live.i captured a rat in my attic that triggered the motion sensor and it sent me a 10 sec. video clip to my phone.
 Addition to the others, now I think we’re covered.  Great product, great customer care.<br/><br/>Thank You
 Works pretty good. I would have rated it 5 stars, except it's not very clear at night and keeps defaulting to 50 seconds instead of the selected 60 sec.
 Easy to set up or add a camera and generally works as expected. The exception is the temperature functionality which does not appear to work. An email from Blink support made it clear that this is an app function in BETA testing. While I would not rely on this device to accurately monitor temperature, it is excellent in most other respects.
 Doesn't record that's the most important function for me I returned
 These are great. Easy to set up. Had minor problems of the motion detection turning off on it own. But that only happened once. Very portable. I have one mounted and the other I move around depending on what I want to monitor.
 Cameras work good but aren’t as good as my Ring Doorbell and Ring floodlight.  You get what you pay for.  Blink is free for 2 gig of storage
 Digging the quality of the camera. Definitely compatible if not slightly better than ring. Battery life is reasonable for wireless mounting.
 I like these cameras.  Easy to install and set up . A breeze to install on your cell still have some kinks to work on. They are well worth it
 Live view fails a huge amount of the time rendering this product virtually useless for my purposes. Unfortunately, I did not see all the comments online about live view failing before I purchased this. The manufacturer should disclose this known issue.  Selling it with the claim that this is a working feature is misleading.
 Does not require electrical outlet to work.  Can be located Easley in different locations  both indoor and outdoor.  Also Amazon supplies free back up of camera Video on their web services for free.
 Best camera on the market. Infrared and quality of video is awesome day and night. Cloud makes this inexpensive. Love blink cameras.
 It is a good product, but it needs to improve in terms of the features of the application, for example being able to zoom in images, being able to visualize from a computer and not only from the cell phone or the tablet.<br/>The quality of the images are very good, both day and night.<br/>I do not have comments about the duration of the batteries yet.
 excellent camera system. work well outside, no problems. battery hods its charge well. very easy to mount and control with the app. I have the indoor system as well which works very well. going on third year soon with original battery.
 The night vision on my Blink XT works well and setup is fairly easy.<br/><br/>Just to note the minimum re-trigger period to start recording again after a previous motion detection recording is 10 seconds.
 So far so good.  Easy set up, easy installation.  Pretty prompt notifications, and even with night vision the picture was pretty clear.  I'd take it camping to get bear and other wildlife photos, but we don't camp near any type of signals.  Probably buying more cameras.
 Issue with the system the software glitches when trying to arm and disarm. Also wish there was a DVR function not just motion detection.
 I have four entrance doors to my home that I wanted to be monitored. The Blink cameras were very easy to install and picks up all motion in their view.  I even had to Gray out(block) a complete tree line beside my driveway where I had one of the cameras focused on because when the wind blew the trees (even slightly), the camera would pick that up. It is easy to customize each camera to focus on exactly what you want to monitor. Great product!
 Do not buy this product cameras don’t work very good I had a truck stolen and the camera didn’t pick up anything nite time is very poor save ur money and buy something that works I wish I could return them
 Great price and very easy to set up and use.  Nice that there is no monthly fees.  Works great in daylight, but night video leaves a lot to be desired.  We have a light by the front door and with the IR illuminator on, even on low setting, the image is bright white.  Cannot make out a face.  With the IR illuminator off you can't see anything beyond the front door.  Not bad if you leave your porch light off.
 Infer  red view detect too bright light, however if I turn off I do not see anything except the light. Image become foggy in the morning because of the high humidity in Florida.
 Tried to set up via the app, was saying my serial number was invalid after me inputting it via my camera. If y'all can't even get your devices set up right you have some problems. Will be returning and not purchasing again
 After reading the reviews on the Blink XT I decided to purchase it for my front door monitor! After 1 week I am very pleased with the simplicity of setup and the functionality of the unit!! Hard to beat this camera for price and versatility.
 Bought 1 just to test it out before I bought more. So far so good. Easy set up. App works good (although sometimes connection fails but I reload it and it works so no big deal). Good quality. Night vision could be a little better. All in all decent product for the money and does what I want it to do. Will probably buy 1 or 2 more now.

I’ve emailed tech support I will update this post with their response. For $200 this is pretty disappointing
 Very easy to install and works without hitch. I love the snap shot of ion so I take photos of my place and compare when I get home just in case I do miss a motion activated video due to any unforseen malfunction.
 Free cloud service makes these cameras beat out the others. Thousands of videos and 9 months on batteries and still going!
 Easy to set up and the app is easy to use. Only problem is that the clips have a delay which show a person walking away but miss the full view.
 Easy to set and works great! Surprised at the great reception and easy to use interface. We use it to track how our dogs are escaping the yard.
 Excellent choice to complement existing security system.  Video very good.  System very sensitive to movement and very good night vision.  Now able to scan  surrounding property at night with ease.  Highly recommend.
 Five minute install and is compatible with IFTTT. The Blink camera can be deactivated to save battery when my iphone is nearby and reactivated when I leave the property.
 When the product was functioning’s the quality and interface was amazing. After two days I can’t grt the camera to connect anymore and it is useless. I already reset everything; Camera and signal unit. The price was too good to be true in my case, might work for yourself or others but not for me
 Absolutely awesome although a 360 adaptation/mount is required, it’s worth every penny.
 It's easy to set up &amp; it's very easy to use. Pove the quality of the picture. Even the night vision works great. Good sound quality
 Reeeeeeally easy to set up and get started! Cant believe how well it works! My last system was wired, and this is better quality than that was!
 Installed outside attached to our motor home. Works great so far and easy setup. We monitor our motor home from iPhone or iPad while away.
 I didn’t like the system, the movement sensor doesn’t work properly, it only works when you are very close to de camera. The camera doesn’t record anything, if you are not watching on live or the sensor doesn’t detect any movements you can’t see what is going on
 I tried for over two hours to get this to work. First the sync device wouldn't connect to the WIFI. After a dozen tries it finally did. I bought the two camera kit and had to keep resetting the cameras to get them to show a picture on the app. I gave up after resetting the cameras over a dozen times. Find a different camera set up and stay away from this product!
 Love the fact of no monthly fee! Ease of use is great as well. Could benefit with a communication speaker on the cameras and, please, release the "Bling" doorbell... Don't want to need to have a different service for that....
 I am 75 years old and I installed the system all by myself. Love the peace of mind it provides.
 Slow to show me footage
 Love my cameras.  Had a minor problem and support was great solved my problem in a few seconds.  Again great cams and service.
 This system works well for people who travel.I can monitor my house from any where. I'm about to re-order one for the rear of my home as well.
 The battery life is great, but the amount of time it takes for the camera to activate and start recording, after detecting motion, makes it nearly worthless in many situations.
 About five minutes and I was  up and running using my Galaxy. With these new systems, or at least this one, they have worked out the problems with floating I.P addresses and the like that made hooking up cameras for remote viewing  only for the very knowledgeable. Cloud storage of videos is great idea.  The sensitivity setting also seems to work great.
 The cameras worked for about an hour, then everything died! I have no lights on power box I hate to purchase a whole new system cameras and just to have this box HELP!
 This OS camera goes through a set of  batteries within a week. Too expensive to operate in winter time. I had camera in a somewhat sheltered area.
 I have ordered BLINK products three times now. High quality, EZ to install and INEXPENSIVE. Game-changing residential video system!
 I’m using these to monitor certain areas of my home basically to watch my kids. They work great and were super easy to set up.
 works great when the camera is working like new... Number one BIG problem... Night vision part of camera doesn't last very long. I have 7 of these units different places outside and in the house... live in Ohio and took a trip to Wyoming... while out west I could turn each camera on and would get a great live picture of whats going on back home... DURING DAYLIGHT... of the 7 cameras... I'd get nothing at night from 4 of them... of those 4, 2 were less than a month old when the night vision stopped working.
 The camera has a temperature range of 40 degrees for a low and 90 degrees for the high.  Not a great camera for any place in the US except for San Francisco.
 Cam is easy to set up and work with through the app. All the reviews indicating poor night vision are spot on. Night vision whites out images and is very fuzzy. Also if there’s a light in the area it throws off the auto night vision as well.  Daytime image is great. Also the motion detection is delayed, so u often catch people after they are already walking away or have passed out of the frame.
 I had Blink set up and operating in less than 30 min.  That included the time spent watching the videos and I read the documents.......
 We purchased the 2 camera system a couple of weeks ago after we had 2 break-ins in our small business. Wish we would have bought these before hand. Anytime motion is detected, it sends an alert to our cell phones. We can look in on the store anytime and when we're sitting at home. You can set days and times for it to automatically be armed. It was easy to set up. This is a great system to have with no monthly fees. I recommend this product.
 Like everone else. This is a phenomenal product.  Works great. I have it inside my front lamp post. I bought to track when I get a package left on the front door step, or the mail man comes and I set my phone to give me a Ding Dong. LOL
 Concerned on how long the battery will last.  Would like the time someone is at the door to be longer. appart from this pleased with my purchase.
 Love the camera, but the battery life is terrible, doesn't last 2 years as stated.  I have replaced the battery twice in one year.
 As a wireless camera it works fine. Setup is easy.  The entire reason I bought it was to work with Alexa and my fire tv cube.  Does not work with Alexa and fire tv cube.  Many better choices I’d you just want a wireless camera.
 I Love The cameras. My cameras arrived 08/29 but one of the cameras, the batteries died after 7 days. I suggest having extra batteries. The other set of batteries in the new camera are fine. Just some bad batteries I guess. Everything else fine. Set up was easy.
 This weather proof camera is great.  No wires for power or video. Used it during a construction project.  The camera alerted me when the workers arrived and kept me posted on progress.  The setup with iPhone app was easy.
 It works better than Ring doorbell, and you don’t have to pay monthly service to record the video for you like the Ring doorbell .
 The customer service is very bad and don't know what they are talking about. I called several times and still the same. It never would connect like it should and still haven't been able to get it to work. Check on other products before you buy this one....
 Not impressed.  Quits recording seconds after it starts. Can't detect objects coming at it.  Put your money towards a better system.
 These cameras work great, capture picture or video, and sound, motion detection is quick to record.. very nice for the price....
 It worked in the beginning but now notifications don't work. I have no idea why. And, if you had audio so that I can say something, that would be great.
 You won’t catch anything with it , no matter what it will start recording and then end it even if there’s still movement
 This is a great camera for our vacation home. Clarity is awesome. Motion detection works fabulous. This is our 4th camera and will purchase a couple more.  You can see how the weather is off your cell phone or even see the deer in your yard. Awesome camera
 Works perfect.. if your looking for a blink home security buy the black device . The white device is good but the black device has a better picture and also night vision
 I am pleased with our new security system, but it really needs to be monitored on my laptop. Camera mounts are so-so. They routinely fall apart when placing cameras. I hate having to sign in every time when booting up my tablet. Customer support is poor when asking questions about Blink and my Kindle Fire. I was told by a Supervisor that they are not crossed trained to work on both.
 Good picture.  Good quality. My only complaint is the live view is not very quick (responsive). Sometimes you have to try 2-3 times to get a live feed.
 They are not bad. I’m still using them can’t complain. They do the job. I installed one on my tree in front of my house.
 The pictures are very clear, love that they are battery operated.  They are very easy to install, even for a 76 year old woman.  We now have 4 cameras mounted in various locations, so that we have full view of our home.  This one was from a delivery from Amazon.
 Easy to setup. Clear picture. I did have some issue with 1 of 3 cameras not connecting. It finally connected after several tries and is working properly. Hence 4 🌟 (stars) instead of 5.
 Great but simplistic security system. Can only turn on or off all cameras, not individual cameras. Perfect for a small office or home. Consider Arlo Pro 2 for something more sophisticated.
 Used this in my office so I knew who was in and out when I was gone. Now retired I have both cameras covering our Condo.
 Set-up is simple &amp; picture quality is good.  BUT, the mounting bracket is cheap  and very limited in flexibility.  Be prepared to spend more money on decent mounting brackets
 Great easy install &amp; setup. Like the available to install anywhere because of battery power &amp; wireless. Show the camera pictures to family &amp; they can not believe the clear picture.
 Love the coverage and the night vision. Works super well for my application. Mounted on the gutter which was super easy.
 So far so good.  Have to monitor the battery use.<br/><br/>I would like it to have an away arming feature.  It would make the product much better for me.
 Camera has excellent resolution and easy to set up. Only downfall is a very weak mount to the camera. Cameron is very easy to bump off of Mount.
 I am not handy or tech savvy and I was able to install and work these with ease! I definitely recommend them. Good picture quality.
 I really like this camera. The instructions were idiot proof and it took just minutes to set up. Motion sensing is working great. Picture quality is great. Best of all the is no monthly fee to save videos on the Blink cloud service. One thing to keep in mind is when they say the camera takes 2 AA batteries, they mean 2 lithium AA batteries. Regular AA batteries are not recommend  Blink says they last 2 years or so. Still I am very happy.
 Easy to set up and use but wish there was an option to turn video on without "continue" coming up and would like to be able to manually record
 Have had for three months and it's worked great. App works well too. I would recommend getting after market brackets though that are more secure
 Pretty good for the price. I had arlo pro which kept going offline. Decided to try blink and so far so good. The range is a bit limited, but definitely detects and alerts me as expected. The battery is also pretty decent and fact that it’s lithium is a plus. Definitely like it better than arlo pro.
 Video is very clear. But the downside is that it doesn't record when someone is starting to approach your home. By the time it records they are almost out of view. I would not recommend Blink.
 The daytime view is wonderful and having lots of fun with it viewing the small and large visitors in my woods.  The night view is all black.  Cannot make out anything of the area it suppose to view and/or record.  This is not the first XT I have purchased.  I though through Amazon I might have a better quality camera then I have from QVC.
 I love being able to keep an eye on my horse in his stall at all times. The night vision works great too! I can always tell if he’s okay
 Easy peasy setup, excellent range and the cameras survived the -40F weather with ease. No wonder Iris is going belly up.
 The piece that the item comes to hang on seemed slightly broken and only allows the camera to be hung straight and not on an angle.<br/><br/>But they refunded me 20% for that and the camera caught my neighbor stealing my packages within a week so we are all good. Love the free cloud storage, that you can share clips and that you can adjust the strength of the motion detector to your needs.
 The installation and setup was super easy, has a nice design but it lacks live streaming. The live capability has a 3-5 second delay and is worst than a $30 cam.

I Have Nest cameras as well.  These are better and you don’t have to buy a subscription.  Super easy to set up.  Works well on my iPhone.
 I was unable to connect for almost a month. I returned it before the return window closed. I must have gotten a bad one.
 Your survey does not ask for any improvement ideas / issues. You wanted feedback but don’t allow the customer to provide any negative feedback or issues that merit consideration for enhancement. Ther are a couple of feedback items I’d like to provide:<br/>1) would bbetter if you fine tune the zones a bit better. Right now the zones are way to large.<br/>2) it would be very helpful to know how much battery power is left.
 Easy to mount, connect and use. Large variety of settings on the app. Considerable delay in motion sensing so they don't always capture everything.
 I have the full system and really like it. It’s easy to use and I don’t have to have a monthly subscription. I bought the extra brackets and they were easy to install.
 I give 5 to this product because it does the expected job specially the motion detection is awesome. But if you wanna get advantage of its performance do not rely on batteries. On my case I had to replace the batteries every 12 hours. Finally I purchased the power cord that solved my issue. Still I like the product. Easy to use and to set up. Battery life null. Do not count on
 So simple!  No cords, no special programming.  It’s practically just turn on and go.  I’ve had no trouble with battery life even in cold temps.  Quick response to alerts, within seconds.  I’ve added a 3rd camera since my original purchase.  Very pleased
 We had 2 blink cameras &amp; worked great so saw these on sale so was able to get 2 more w/ sync module so now have backup for both.
 The blink to camera system is alright, but great difficulty mounting them, to get them in the right position, etc. I think all mounting hardware should have been inclusive, besides the little plastic ones that came with. Hard to exactly hone in on position, and we noticed it was not detecting vehicles or foot traffic in driveway. Readjusted them, will try them again today.
 Unit works quite well in good weather  Not good in snow and rain sometimes as camera gets covered  must adjust light intensity sometimes due to sunlight or darkness but that all can be done from phone.  Great to be able to listen and will be excellent when they sell units that u can talk back on
 No option to record live. I don't like that you either are recording clips and getting constant notifications OR your camera is disabled. I bought this system to monitor my home while I'm home and when I'm away and I can't record someone stealing my stuff if I've watching it happen.
 BAD NIGHT VIDEO
 Really easy setup, so far working great. Would really like to be able to talk to whatever walks past the door, obviously not a deal breaker, I knew going in this was not an option. Would recommend
 Clear view of someone on our steps but I am not happy with the delay.  We got a notification at 1:00AM and by the time we were able to look out the pizza driver pulled out of our driveway and parked in front of the correct house.
 Working great and batteries holding up for several months so far.
 Awesome product overall especially for the price. Easy to set up and use. Only drawback is if the covered area is very active it will drain the batteries super fast.
 Not happy with this product. Does not secrecy motion well at all. And did not sync with Alexa well either. Will return and go with another brand.
 I have had blink cameras for about a year now. The only issue I have is with the attachment feature. Camera is easily removed from attachment. Because of this I install above head height so someone doesn't just grab it and walk off with it.Someone could easily knock it off the attachment if needed. Camera needs some kind of feature that allows for solid attachment that can resist being knocked down or removed easily.
 If you blink you might miss it work. This camera is great if you want to manually take pictures, but if you expect it to do any of the other advertised features think again. Mine works for about 5 minutes after setting it up, them requires disassembly and a fresh setup before working again for 5 minutes. DO NOT BUY, save yourself the headache and buy a better product.
 These were easy to install and set-up the app. Free limited storage of video which is way more than we need. Decent viewing area and good night vision. Easy to use app. Would recommend.
 Works great, added this to my current security system but I look forward to an integration with my Ring system.
 Very simple set up, less than 10 minutes and I am not techy at all. Takes great video, and sound is very clear. I should of bought the 2 pack
 Overall good but the lag in videoing motion is a problem.
 We use these around our home and they work great. If the bateries die make sure to replace with lithium batteries.
 I don't like writing much about any products, but this one made me to write...this is amazing product. Make sure when you use in night/dark, don't scare coz everything turns in black and white. :)  5 star rating!
 I love the no wires installation and get good quality video despite the less than ideal wifi signal from base to camera. Tweaking the location settings has gotten me what I want in terms of sensitivity and camera angle. But it does seem to miss some motion seemingly at random.
 max clip length is only 60 seconds. moreover, the next clips starts after a huge delay. useless for the money paid.
 System works well with great pictures but I don't like the 20 to 30 second delay in notification that someone/thing has entered the monitored space.
 Not too bad so far. Does what I am looking for. Not a terribly difficult setup but could use some more info upfront about what everything does vs digging. Nice pictures from the cameras.
 Great product.  Super easy to install and works great.  I use this to watch my lakehouse and boat.  The boat is about 25 yards away from the house and it works great.  I would highly suggest.
 Great cameras. Easy set up
 Use this camera to monitor our inground pool and back yard it works good and it blends well with the tree I have it on I get alerts if anyone is back there I can also live view from the camera I liked it so much I bought 3 more
 I am glad I made the decision to install this camera system!  It gives a piece of mind especially knowing what goes on when you are not at home.  The cameras were very easy to set up and install.  The app is very simple to set up and use.  Very clear video and pictures.  The best part about the system...you do not have a monthly fee to pay!!
 So far are great, installed them this weekend so need a couple more days before I can say a solid year or nay on how good they are
 Overall I like it. It was easy to set up and works well. Only problem Is that the video clip is to short. It should record until motion has stopped
 Can't seem to get the camera to see movement on other side of glass. Good for viewing. Ring system is much much better. Clumsy mount
 Received and installed today. Easy installation.  Very pleased with image quality.  Motion notification to my phone is extremely quick. Video quality is excellent.  Pleased so far. Will post updates if things change.
 Overall pretty good.  Motion sensor only detects out 20 feet and that's an issue (for me) if you want to monitor outdoor spaces.
 Nice to have an outdoor monitoring camera of this small size. Has bit of delay when capturing pictures/video triggered by moton sensor and kinda annoying delay when triggering manually via Blink mobile app.
 Amazon should pull this product or at least alter the battery life expectancies. The camera is okay, but the two year promise is a joke. I’ll be try Anker’s camera instead.
 Had the indoor version before and they had the fastest trigger alert. These... someone would be in my house before my camera alerted me. Awful
 I bought this for a Christmas present for my wife. Yesterday 03/20/2019 it stopped working I have replaced the batteries and reset the unit but it still does not work.I bought a second one also this is working fine so far. What can I do? Can I return this.
 The camera was very easy to setup. You should be aware that battery operated cameras take quite some time to establish a connection until you see video or a picture. I guess that is intended by the manufacturer to save battery.
 It’s a cool system for capturing motion activated video and recording for up to 1 min before resetting and retriggering for another recording session after a set period of delay time. However, it will not live stream for more than about 20 sec without hitting a continue prompt. This is a no go for me as I wanted to be able to live stream to a viewing device (echo show, or tablet) so I could keep watch of my property. I understand the battery drain so I figured I would just power it via the micro USB port. From what I understand it still will not maintain a live feed for more than a few secs. I will keep it for what it does but I don’t think I will be adding to the system. I wish this information was in the description before I bought. It may have been in the other reviews or Q/As and I just missed it. If you’re looking for a continuous live streaming system this will not work.
 Camera is mounted above my driveway. Works very well but batteries only lasted 4 1/2 months.
 I bought the system from home shopping channel. now im stuck staying with this system.  no support from blink. inconsistent cameras. batteries DONT last. brackets are super CHEAP  only positive thing is the storage of clips is large and free. I've had to replace one after two months because it stopped working....again no support from blink
 Great purchase.  Easy to install hardware as well as set up app.  Clear picture and able to set up settings as necessary.
 2 friggin month battery life...maybe 1 or 2 recordings per week is not considered "normal use" apparently.....get the ladder out replace, get the ladder out replace, get the ladder out replace and on and on.....and this is an AMAZON Company...…..well done!
 Excellent product.
 Overall very good system for being wirless. The cam quality is good minutes star for the flimsy bracket.  Qulaity is good outdoor or indoor I am not convinced it is 1080p..
 Very good camera and the price point is great.. Easy setup.  I would have given it a 5 but I have several Dropcams that have better features.  If this was my first step into the camera world the Blink is the way to go.
 I have only had it for few days but so far so good.  Clear instruction and easy install.  Everything is working well as advertised.  Mobile app is extremely easy to use as well.
 Easy to setup and works good. I would have given it a 5 if there was a compatible audible siren or microphone to scare away any intruder.
 Battery need to be replaced after 10 days!!!. The camera record all the car driving on the  road in front of my house but didn’t record when someone came to my door.
 I ordered a two camera system, I had this up and running in under 10 minutes.  I love the ideas of not having to pay a monthly charge.  The cameras are small, but great picture.  I am going to be adding more camera in the future.  Great product for the money.  Definitely worth the the investment.  Highly recommend....
 Easy to use, easy to install and can get notifications straight to the phone. Dayton night vision is awesome.. both are pretty crystal clear
 Ok quality but triggers too much and when you turn the sensitivity down it won’t trigger at all. Plus, one of the cameras battery is already dead. Not even a month.
 Work good clear images but batteries don’t last anywhere as long as they say only got 3-4 months not anywhere close to the 2 years much cheaper than ring but I wish they had the floodlight and doorbell cams
 I ordered 5 of these camera. Not very good quality. Someone broke into my storage building and stole a generator and also took the camera. I did order the extended warranty but it does not cover lost or stolen. I would not recommend this product!!
 For some reason this camera is extra dark and the night vision pretty much sucks Unlike the other one I ordered and I stalled just feet away
 Lots of value in this 2 camera package. The camera mounts could be a better but I have not had any real issues. Easy to set up and intuitive to use. Works as described with well thought out app features. NO MONTHLY FEE's Scale ability up to 10 cameras on a single module is a plus. A "thumbs up" purchase if you want a great value security camera system.
 Good  system for the money. It works well. Good night vision and the picture quality is decent.<br/>The sw has a few bugs in it, but the camera dose what was is advertised
 This is a great product.  Very easy to install.  The wireless connection is very responsive.  Works perfect for large square footage.
 I needed a system for basic security and to check on pets. I went with Blink to avoid fees for storage and I am very pleased with my choice. Fairly easy setup and video quality is good.
 This is a great product at a great price. The only drawback is the inability to view on your computer.
 Easy to install. Great scheduling feature. Good view range at front door. Very sensitive to motion but I just tried to reduce sensitivity and that appears to be working.  Wish it had 2-way audio, but I haven’t needed it yet.
 I've only had this product a couple of weeks.  It was easy to set up.  I still need to work on how to get alerts, etc...  I think I'm also going to buy a solar panel for each camera so I don't have to climb up ladders every 2 years.  And if the batteries don't last 2 years it will help me not be mad when they do need recharged.
 This works perfectly for me. Good price point , excellent image quality and even has sound. The app also has outdoor temperature and battery status. Well done Blink!
 The battery does not last for two years right now I had this almost less  than year I have to change the battery already. I have the camera on mostly during the night and sometimes during the day.
 I really like this. Only complaint is that it overheats quickly. Not very practical for outside use if you live in California. Works fine tho regardless.
 On the description it says batteries are supposed to last up to two years but I am having to replace my outdoor one every week or it goes offline. It gets used more than the indoor one granted but not so much that it cuts 2 years of power down to a week...what's up with that?
 Most clips were the last 5 seconds of some one leaving the frame. Night vision is weak in resolution.
 I can tell this is an Amazon company by how easy it is to setup.  It works great and eliminates the need for wires and security company fees.  Highly recommended.
 Bought this 3/31/18 instaled in 30 min. very simple. the app works great! The picture and video quality is wonderful, the audio is great. i called customer service because i wasn't getting the notifications on my cell, the gal knew what to do and talked me through the setting on my phone, after i had to reinstall the app. Custmer service called me back within 10 minutes to check if i was all up and running. Great service.
 Difficult to connect and see live feed on your phone. Even when you ‘achieve’ that, the video quality is very poor. I did have 100mbps wifi connection.
 Bought two of these on Black Friday. Had my first package thief 3 weeks later. The motion sensor worked great and police were actually able to identify (with the help of some tips from a social media post I put up) the two morons. Very pleased with the night vision quality as well. For me, I mainly bought because I didn’t want to mess with wires. It’s paid for itself so far.
 I love this product.  It went up within a half hour. That’s out of box and installed. Quality is wonderful.  Dings my phone. I love that voice is recorded.
 These cameras are great.  They work as designed and deliver excellent images and video.  My only beef is the weak plastic mounting bracket that comes with it.  The camera snaps in and out of  the plastic ring too easily and a good storm would take it right off.
 Battery capability makes it worth the purchase. Just as easy to install as Ring but batteries last two years.
 GREAT cameras, easy to install, very clear picture and video.  Will definitely purchase more cameras to add to my bundle!!
 I really love the no wires need to be installed. But unfortunately it has a very narrow area and even when I hang it really high over my front door I see very limited spots. It has a really big delay at night.
 Love it! Clear view, small enough to go anywhere.
 Great cameras. I bought these cameras after our vehicles were broken into. They are easy to set up and install. High quality images, day and night. I ended up buying a third camera. I like how you can delete zones from the cameras field of view to reduce accidental motion trips. Definitely recommend.
 Connection outside cameras can be a problem due to an over extended connection module providing a weak link with the camera nd router.  This causes slower activation and recording when needed.<br/>Positive is that the application allows for desensitizing areas where movement of vegetation may cause recording of irrelevant motion.
 Super easy to setup and the app is easy to use and understand, and all with NO SUBSCRIPTION NEEDED!<br/>Thanks Blink for a great product!

For the most part, it catches images of wildlife.  Tonight around 1am it captured a person looking into a few of my windows. In the video attached, the person is headed to my front door when it appears he sees the blue light on the camera engage.  Thankfully this seems to scare him off.  Police were called and responded. Though they didn't catch him, he knows we were watching. So thankful for this system.
 Good camera for the price. I really like how you don’t need a subscription to use it. Video quality isn’t great even on the enhanced setting. Camera starts recording as soon as it “detects” motion. It would be great if it gave you the option to choose as many seconds as you want to prerecord before motion is detected. It would also be great if it let you gray out the areas in the frame that you don’t want motion to trigger on.
 Excellent picture quality. I purchased this  for a friend in a foreign country and it works perfectly with the phone.
 awesome product.  highly recommend...
 I thought I could use this inside and point it out my window but the motion detection does not work through Glass
 Easy to set up and install to our existing system.
 It was a little difficult for me to connect. Other than that it's a nice camera. The night vision could be better.
 Since set up I have had color failure &amp; motion detection failure. I have to hire someone to access the cameras as I am 75 and cannot climb ladders.  Too expensive to have someone out here every couple of weeks.  They were fixed Thursday and now it is Saturday and there is only color on 2 cameras and motion detection on none.  I do not recommend this product.  Look elsewhere for home security.
 I've been wanting a camera at the front door for a long time but didn't know which one to buy. Blink XT is awesome! Small, simple, and the ease of use is great! The picture and video quality is excellent and if you leave your porch light on at night, it captures everything in color as if it's daytime.  Love it!
 For the prive these cameras have me satisfied.  Quick set up. Clear picture. Worked great all the different devices we had.
 These camera are a good idea gone wrong. First of all these suppose to be an outdoor camera but the lenses get fogged up with little effort front the weather. Also condensation on the lens prevents it to capture anything. The image quality at night is marginal at best.
 The only reason I give this a 4 and not a 5 is because of there is no zooming functionality with the camera, AND the package comes with really crappy mounts. Theoretically, someone could walk over to my camera above my front door and simply pop off the camera with relative ease. I would have preferred it if it came with an encasing for each camera that is more secure to the wall its screwed into.
 Poor video quality, poor material, night vision is over exposed even on the lowest setting, renders useless videos. Overall, very poor quality product.
 Excellent. Took me a bit to activate it but that was mostly my mistake. Works great for what I need it for. Good price. No monthly fee.
 Product works well, but I should have bought another camera systems as this one doesn’t have a built in speaker.
 Love this little guy.  Worth the money. Great videos and I might buy another.
 This is so nice to be able to sign in a see my house when I am not there.  The video is good and the fact that I can take a photo is most helpful.  Will be expanding the cameras.
 It's an easy to use security solution. I'm happy with the motion detection and cell phone alerts. We'll see how long the batteries last. My hope is that they will figure out a way to have cameras connect to different wifi addresses. I use the cameras across my yard and wifi doesn't always reach. I use a range extender but can't get the  cameras to use both home address and the extension address.
 Just bought this on Sept 24th and batteries are already dead...  said they would last a year.  Also sound breaks up.  Signal is good so that isn’t the reason.  Would not buy again.
 Good quality. I have it installed at my our entrance and turned on for motion, so it comes on whenever somebody comes to the door (and I get an alert with a video clip)
 Camera works great. I received mine last week. Today I noticed the price dropped 20 percent. Bad timing on my part.
 Really happy so far with the unit. Installation and set up were easy. Read reviews about not being able to position the cameras very far from the base but that did not apply since our place is small. If I were to do it over again, I would look for a unit that has two way sound, think it would be more useful.
 For today's tech ever shrinking this camera was a bit large for what it offers. Great clear pics and video. Installed in 15 mins. Unable to hide due to large size.
 Very sharpe pictures. Picks up even birds in the mulch. The “live” feature is great. Questionable trespass late on night-police called and was able to watch police canvass the property. Product installed in Nov 2017
 Easy set up. Wonderful to see my office when I am out of town. Works great. Highly recommend
 Great product, easy install and amazing picture quality. Very happy with my purchase.
 Worked great for 2 days . Then stop working.  Customer service says that my router is out of date so i have to purchase a new router just to use the camera? No thanks.
 Smart, Simple, Easy to install.  Can monitor on your smartphone.  Gives you that feeling of extra security!
 The best thing I purchased so for for Security purposes. Great Quality video and notifications.
 Love this camera but the mount does not swivel so you are relegated to tilting it. Wish you had better range of motion to set the picture precisely where you want it.
 I like my NEST cameras better. The mount is somewhat limited in its range of motion, picture quality not that great, IR is barely adequate.
 The battery you mentioned can be used for two years. I have almost less than two weeks of battery. You told me what to do.
 I purchased two of these for the outside of my house.  It is a terrific product and gives me great peace of mind
 Very easy to setup and maintain.  Only negative so far is the utmost basic camera mounts that came with the package.

 I use this to monitor the exterior of a house in France.  Set-up was easy and the quality is incredible!
 I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.  THEY WORKED FINE FOR COUPLE DAYS.  NOW I DON'T GET NOTIFIED ON MY PHONE ALL THE TIME.  WHEN I HIT"LIVE VIEW" IT SAYS LIVE VIEW FAILED. SOMETIMES ITS JUST A STAND STILL PIC INSTEAD OF VIDEO.I CALLED YOUR COMPANY ON TWO DIFFERENT OCCASSIONS AND THE REPS WERE NOT HELPFUL AT ALL. $200 OUT THE WINDOW!!!!  NOT HAPPY!!  I'M SURE THIS WON'T GET PUBLISHED, BUT OTHERS SHOULD BE MADE AWARE!
 Works great. Easy to install.  Pictures are good at day and night. Only con, you can't talk to the person in front of the camera, but that's not really what I need it for
 High quality video, very easy to install &amp; configure, great wi-fi range.<br/>I installed a 5 camera system a few weeks ago and its been awesome.<br/>I keep the motion clip set to 15sec. to preserve battery life.<br/>I have one suggestion for the app developers, please show % of battery life in the app!<br/>Highly recommend this system!
 this is the real deal, love the features, easy to install, and no issues or worries would buy again and add more
 My blink seemed to always have a weak connection, even when I put it next to my router.  You get what you pay for.
 For a 5 camera system, the price is reasonable. I receive a good wifi signal to all camera's covering all entrances to my home and garage.  If you're looking for a budget security system and need it totally wire free, I recommend this system. I gave 4 stars because there is always room for improvement...
 Bought some junk the first go around and finally got smart and went to Blink.  So easy to use and set up....and works well with Alexa.
 I purchased this security camera to monitor how well the bath remodel contractors were progressing while I was at work.  It was the first time I have had to leave complete strangers in my home because everybody had to go to work.  The camera worked great inside the house with lights on, the images are in color and the microphone pick up sound well, which is why I rated it 3-Stars.  Outside at night was a real problem with both that stupid 5-second delay before recording footage, and it's lousy infrared (IR) technology.  The camera isn't 1080p, which I thought I read in one of those reviews that it is? However, it is not, it is 720p, and at night the images are black and white. How Atrocious?!!!  One other problem, with it being b/w is that it wouldn't be of much use to police because it also doesn't have closed caption.  You wouldn't be able to zoom in on those old black and white images for a clearer or closer look at intimate details/important information.  That sucks!  My recommendation is to lower the prices until you can change/improve upon all of my complaints.  Right now, its just not worth the money. That stupid five second delay made me feel like I needed to go in for anger management counseling.
 Just what I needed &amp; all the features, I did not need a lot of storage, only what was motion out side.
 I was looking for a good entry level camera system and I think I found it. Easy to set up easy to sync to my iPhone seems to work great. I’m sure you can spend more money and get better sensitivity and such but I thought for the money it was worth it. I’ve only had it a month but so far so good
 The only good thing is the setup is quick and easy.  I did not realize this camera does not have a zoom which is a big deal for me and the other issue is does not have the ability video live.  Those are deal breakers for me.  One more thing, I was unable to view most of the videos for some reason.  I have a galaxy 8 plus, so I shouldn't have a problem.  Considering returning it.
 Yeah yeah yeah everything is great but I was very surprised and disappointed to learn you cannot have your Alexa alert you of motion on the cameras. You can get a phone notification through the Blink app, but no way for Alexa to do it.<br/><br/>Blink's company logo literally says "An Amazon Company" but can't send a damn notification to Alexa? WTF?!
 Pretty easy set up and installation. Clear directions though there's a few steps to follow.<br/>Do recommend taping or velcro for camera location to be sure it's where you want it.<br/>Not sure how I lived without this and the smart plugs for two lamps. Great gadgets!<br/>I do have Echo Show but with smart phone it isn't really needed. Good for backup if phone not handy.
 You can put this camera anywhere and it runs on batteries for ever. Use it all the time.. Love it. I have 3 of them..
 I love the blink cameras. The only down side is that my voice isn’t heard on the other side. I can hear perfectly well but can’t speak with a delivery man.
 This works great up close but more than 20 feet away it's awful. I parked 17 feet away and it couldn't read my license plate
 Bought this as a gift and the recipient LOVES it. They demonstrated how it works and I’m impressed.
 Recently purchased two cameras and the installation and setup was simple. I really couldn't believe how easy it was. The cameras are both outside but linked well with inside modem and all is working great. All this coming from a technical novice.
 Unimpressed with the app. Returned.
 You can’t read a lisence plate on a car 20’ away.  That’s kinda super important for a FREAKING SECURITY CAMERA!  Easy setup an works great otherwise.
 We had a camera at our front door but really wanted a great camera to also protect our back of home. We bought the Blink a month ago and has not disappointed us st all!! Excellent night vision and picks up with movement quickly. Planning to add one more to capture the rest of our home.
 Love the added security. I like the motion detection video recorder and that it saves to the cloud. I can access it from my phone or my echo show. It’s a lot cheaper than other home security systems I had been looking at.
 Works great.  It pick of cat at night, and big truck on the road which is about 35' away.
 Love this system ~ it's installed outside and provides great coverage via audio and video.
 Overall good product. Easy setup. Watch live or alerts when motion is detected. This is great option if you can't get power or a low volt line to the camera. My only critique is that the camera mount is some what limited on the angles.
 I installed these about a month ago, I like them. I was skeptical of Wireless and battery operated, but they seam to work great. It is important to run a schedule for motion sensors, everytime I let the dog out in the morning he set off every camera.
 This add on camera is easily installed and works very well. I’m happy with the cost and I especially enjoy that there’s no subscription required for use.
 Does not record. I changed batteries 3 times called tech support. And still not working waste of my money. Too late to return . Not worth it
 Want refund
 Works Pretty well ... videos are very short ... and since it’s outside it is left on all the time ...so, the battery only lasted a couple months ... but easy enough to change
 was trying to test it with lucks, and it surprise me with the easy installation, sensitivity, free-cloud storage, and the AA battery with 2 year is the champion!
 Great quality, easy to follow instructions, has a wide range of view, and the app is easy to use and to pair with another phone.
 Received the system and installed them two weeks ago.  I like it.  The only problem I have is too sensitive, ie. dump truck, or large vehicle passed then it is triggered.  Other than that, it is a really good system!
 I love this product. It is so easy to set up and use. I love that it alerts me when there is movement.
 Use this outdoors in NH to watch the ice eaters and make sure the dock doesn't get iced in. I was worried about how it would perform in the intense cold but so far so good. We're half way through the winter and it's worked great so far. Image quality is great, wifi range is good, battery has performed well so far.
 These cameras are awesome!!! We travel &amp; it's nice to know we will know when someone is at our house when we're gone. They are a bit sensitive but I think we can adjust that.
 This thing needs TONS of work.  Blink advertises the batteries will last an entire a year and I've been lucky for them to last 2 weeks.  They need to be a little more honest in their advertising and say "Batteries will last an entire year, IF you keep all settings at a minimal level and don't expect the cameras to catch anything but one recording a day" cause that's what it is forcing me to do.  Most of the recordings I get catch the action almost AFTER the fact, and most recordings are unwatchable.  Storage is limited and even though people have begged them to allow Google Drive or Dropbox integration to move recordings off easily, they've yet to do it.  You can't access your cameras online via a PC, you have to use the phone app only, just one inconvenience after another.<br/>I don't know... maybe since Nest cams were my first security camera experience, I just got really spoiled and just don't like these because they're so inferior to the Nest cams.  I have two Nest cams and while they are expensive and you have to pay yearly for it, they are FAR superior to these things.  I just wish they'd make a battery powered one that can work with solar panels and I'd be set.  Anyhow, I'll be selling this to the first person who will take it off my hands and grab a Nest Outdoor cam and find a way to wire it to the outside.
 Generally I do like this product.  I was disappointed though to realize that the Live View is only 30 seconds which defeated my purpose of using this product.  I knew that there would not be 2 way audio, but I really wish Blink would add that feature.
 So easy to set up and works flawlessly. Can't wait for the next promotion to order another unit or two.
 Liking this camera system better than the Arlo.  Have both and this one is much clearer.  Verdict still out on battery life.  Will have to wait and see.
 systems is reasonable priced, easy to use, doesn't required hard wiring  uses batteries, have to see how long they last, they say two years, will see.  Dislike would like to use my laptop computer to monitor.
 This is the best deal I have seen on camera’s. I am enjoying the wildlife pictures! Great product, exceeded my expectations!
 Perfect compliment to my front door Ring door bell. Easy to install. No wires need. Works on batteries.
 All as expected. Once the activity zones are finally installed (software upgrade) these will be very functional.
 This system is wonderful.  Easy to install, easy to adjust parameters,  great quality videos. Will update review when I figure out battery life.
 Not user friendly.  Put camera outside and when activated blue light comes on and announces itself.
 Great product for the price. Night vision is good but not great. Love the free cloud space!
 This two camera system has been installed for about 2 months now.  Motion detection is a little slow and one of my cameras won't let me check live view but will capture motion and alert me.  Weird.  All and all very easy to set up.  Batteries are holding up fine at the moment.  Decent range.  I gave them 4 stars because of the live view issue.
 I bought 2 blink xt cameras and only one works colors and black and white. The other one just black and white. Not so happy with this purchase
 I like that it gives me the temperature and that it’s light weight and easy to use.
 System works well and protects my entry way. I get alerts almost immediately and 2 months in I have had 0 issues. Stable, reliable and good image quality. Highly recommended.
 So far the 2 purchased are working as advertised during a wet December. They seem to trigger motion appropriately those it takes a moment for the recording to kick in.  They have a lot of cool features that seem to give the flexibility needed.  Picture is good quality. Alerts are legit.
 Works great! Easy to set up and great night vision! A friend who helped me install thus (because I can't climb up a ladder) and my next door neighbor are going to buy these after seeing the results! I highly recommend these cameras!
 Pros. It is easy to install<br/><br/>Cons. It doesn’t work the way it should. The motion sensor is either too sensitive at setting “7” to record moving leaves every other minute or it misses a 6ft man walking staright to the camera at sensitivity setting “6”.  Recording too many videos will drain the battery in no time
 Update 2 months later: Suspicious man attempting to see if my front door was unlocked.  He was captured on camera and the police used it to put an alert out! Thank you BLINK!!!<br/><br/>2 cameras set up in under 30 minutes.  It took me longer to screw in the mount due to my surface than it did to connect them to my wifi.  Picture is amazing and great wide angle too.
 Fantastic product. Very easy install; good video quality, great sound quality. The main reason I chose Blink over others is the battery life of the cameras. Not having to recharge or replace batteries frequently is a must, and that has been impossible to find in a wireless system until now. I really hope Blink releases a doorbell camera soon. Thanks for a great product.
 I put these cameras in for the front door and drive way. So far they are good to go and haven't been disappointed yet. My main concern was package theft and people near my vehicles. If I had something to say was downloading the video clip. The ups person just threw my package at the door and wanted to show the company but downloading the clip was very hard to get done.
 This little camera seems to mimic the human eye. I would buy more if I could afford
 I use this to watch my front door and my mailbox. It works well in the rain or the summer heat. I have three blink cams and like the weather proof one the best. I love this product.
 Five stars for ease of setup alone, Battery life is misleading. If there is a lot of activity like your front door you are lucky to get 2 months. That said, batteries are cheap!
 Great cameras easy accessible and adjustable while at work or on the go best system on the market for the money
 Won't connect outdoors with the hub just inside with strong wifi and camera just outside. Going back.
 This is a Great product for security.  we've had Bl8nk for over a year and so happy with it that this purchase is an additional camera.  Easy setup.
 Its an ok product. Live view its a bit off (5)sec. I just like the idea that i dont need any wiring or drilling.
 I am starting with three stars only because the camera was registered to another account when I tried to set up the system. My best guess on this is I was sold used items with the pretense of being new.  After I get the camera issue resolved I will re evaluate the system it's self.
 I purchased this on December the 18th, received it on the 20th, to see if I liked it and if it performed as described. If it met my needs I planned to order more cameras for my home.  The price was 77.99 but when I went to order more cameras on the 24th the price had jumped to 129.99, a $52 increase. I’m considering returning it.
 I love the system and the price.  High quality video and audio for a great price and with cloud storage free.
 I have had the two Blink cameras for a couple of weeks and they seem to be working great.  Very easy to set up.  The feature that I like the most is the ability to designate active zones, so that vehicles driving down the street do not activate  it.  The one thing I would like to see is an icon of battery strength rather than "OK"
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R3GAZBDEKDOK70"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YngaKUItS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tfMXktfyS.png"/> During the day the cameras work great but at night they take a while to activate. I had someone come up to my porch and steal something and the camera only caught the middle to end of him being visible.
 Love it. Perfect for simple home camera security. Only issue I have is the resolution could be better.
 Very good secuiry cameras and the available app makes it very easy to install.<br/><br/>I can access any of my cameras through the app without any additional router set up.<br/><br/>The only issue i have is the mount for the XT version. The piviot point has no way to tighten/lock it in to position. Seems possible that it would move very easily with high winds.
 Great camera but I recommend not using the provided bracket.  It’s flimsy and your camera will fall as mine did.  I purchased a mounting bracket and it’s secure.  It’s easy to set up and the resolution is excellent.  I like that I can also hear sounds.
 until the batteries froze up?  At -9F worked ok, but then died?<br/>Doesn't like cold weather?
 I am a forever customer of Blink! After doing months of research, I purchased the XT starter kit. Sooo easy to set up! Took about 15 minutes from start to finish. Excellent quality.  Liked it so much I bought an additional camera for the side of my house. I feel much more in control of my home security  and highly recommend this product. Thank you soo much Blink!
 Did not have a chance to see how it works. It was stolen from my garage. I have a similar one at the office and it works great. Will buy again and write another review
 Good but I was disappointed to see the hub/XT starter kit go on sale no long after for significantly less than I paid for just the XT.
 I just bought a home and I have currently 5 of these cameras outside and love that I see what’s going on at my house while I’m gone. If your going to set these cameras up I do suggest you get a sleeve that protects them from rain..even tho they are waterproof the rain gets all over the lense where you can’t see but that’s the only issue I’ve ran into and fixed it with covers.
 Love it, love it!  Works as advertised, easy to set up, simple but robust app, and great picture and sound.  Gave us peace of mind when we were on vacation.  Got movement alerts when our cat made her twice-daily trips past the front entryway.
 This is a neat little package, perhaps even a bit over sensitive, but it tracks who is in the front door very nicely.
 Works great.  Infrared is also nice.  Sligh issues with mounting bracket.
 Easy setup. Can see activity when you’re not at home. Motion sensor has quick response. Good choice of setup options.
 These work just fine, but I wish I would have went with a different solution. Wired.
 I got our first camera off of a Facebook ad it works great.  Placement has been a bit tricky, our front porch faces a rather busy street. That used up the batteries in about 2 months. if you place it properly the batteries will last up to two years.  There is a slight delay in notifications. I liked it so much I bought another for the backyard. It's great that you are able to check in at any time.  Blink does offer cameras for indoor use as well.
 These cameras are great, I have two in my back yard. It covers the back of my house and the side of my house.
 I've only had it about a month but easy install and it has everything I need no monthly costs<br/>Maybe a dislike is the one way audio but not sure if it's needed
 What awesome and convenient camera system. Simple to set up and to use. Great quality camera and contents that come with. Very sleek and nice looking
 The Blink XT was very easy to setup, it provides great pictures and video and is very easy to customize to my needs.
 I wish all products delivered as much value as quickly as this. Easy to setup, easy to operate, peace of mind delivered.
 I liked the one I bought for my daughter so much that I got one for myself.
 Really like my blink xt.  Wish I could afford a few more of the cameras right now.  Willing to take a few freebies😄
 good camera, not a CCTV but works captures and no wires needed, image quality at night no so good.
 If they are outside the battery lasted 3 months joke so much for 2 years false advertisement
 Pretty good system for very little money. A couple of things could be improved. I'd like to be able to arm and disarm individual cameras rather than having them all armed or all disarmed. Also, the night vision isn't real great.
 I got this to monitor my beach home in Florida while I'm not there. It works great. I had a friend go and stay and sure enough I got motion alerts on my phone while in NYC . Can't beat this for the price.
 We have this camera in the garage and its 100% worth my money.  It looks and sounds amazing. Easy to set up and control on your phone. No complaints
 Great product! Easy to install and assemble. Great visual quality when viewing property through the app and being able to set camera sensitivity means a reduction on annoying notifications.
 great product, a must have.  I have 5 cameras now, love the system, a must have
 Works great as advertised. am considering buying another to add to my system.
 I have two cameras set up on the exterior of my home. I really like the fact that I can view them from my phone as well as the footage is saved. Be careful if you need to change WiFi password, as it will disengage cameras. I had to re link and all footage was lost.  Other than that, I am extremely satisfied .
 I have tried the PNZEO W3 and the Mini Spy Camera WiFi but both don't work period. I have spent countless hours to set them up but in vain. It took me 10 minutes to set up the Blink on line and now I understand why it is an amazon company.  High-tech is simple to set up. The quality of the video is very good and the alert it sends me every time it detects a motion is amazing.
 I'm 58 1/2 years old I'm not computer smart but these cameras were the easiest thing I've ever paired with my phone so simple so convenient thank blink you got a customer for life
 These cameras are amazing! I use them to check on package delivery, door guests, and the arrival of my kids home from school.
 Although advertised and purchased as "New", upon opening the package the item looked used and had deep scratches and scuffs but the worst part was finding out I had to reset it as if it was already paired before (Used). Also the mounting bracket would not stay on the camera as well as the surface I was drilling it into no matter what, I'm afraid it might fall with the lightest wind. #dontblink
 Seemed to work ok..... Recently lost connection with the internet.<br/>Not able to restore to get it to work.
 So far so good...provides clear pictures and video in real time.  No associated monitoring costs.  Would buy again.
 initially when i read some of the reviews, i got scared but decided to purchase anyway. i bought 2 indoors and 2 outdoors.<br/>setup was super easy, speed is really acceptable, distance to the connect hub is 60 ft<br/>tech support very responsive and helpful<br/>i also have 5 nest cam that might have more features but for the price, Blink is really a great buy
 Easy to set up and love that it is truly wireless.  But the motion detection sucks.  Basically have to choose between overdosing on false alerts or no alerts! Would help if the Activity Zone functionality actually worked.
 Worked fine for the first day or two. Nowconstantly disconnecting.  Keeps having to reset sync module.<br/>Not a very secure security system.
 I put these at my cabin since I don’t live in that state. They work great anytime of the day. Light or no light. Day to setup and to use.
 Does the job need to work out some kinks but it is just getting use to the camera
 Easy to install.  No fees, but it does use cloud service to store clips.  It would be perfect if it had local FTP storage ability and 2 way chat.
 Easy setup and intuitive interface.  The cameras are easily mounted and have great battery life.  The only drawback is that there is a noticeable delay between movement sensing and recording.  I still think they’re worth the price.

Great image quality.
 I like the free cloud storage.  Would be 5 stars if I could use a rechargeable battery.
 I like them. They work but I got them to watch my kids at home over the summer. Batteries last about a month with constant use. Software is also lacking. Wish it had like a scedual.
 I really like the simplicity of this device. It’s very cool to use and simple is better here.
 very nice camera, app is very easy to use<br/> i already got u more customers.
 Pretty fantastic no problems yet but since I live in the far Northeast I will have to bring them inside in the winter.
 Haven't have this outdoor version.  Have been using the indoor version for a long time.  Time will time if it last.
 The camera didn't detect motion when you passed. Also when I received alerts there was nothing in the snapshots. No motion was ever recorded when it happened.
 This a great wireless security system at an affordable price, plenty of storage and no fees
 Update: Had these about a month now. Very happy with the purchase! I looked at arlo and finally decided on blink.  Im glad I did.  Streamlined system that fit our needs perfectly. Motion detection is spot on!<br/>Easy to use. Quick motion response.
 Great compact unit.  The complete wireless unit is a great plus.  Very easy set up.  Now time  tell how good the system works.
 No brainer !!! Easy to install and use, but buy other brackets that are available  they give you more range of motion... would definitely buy again
 I've had for a year and works great! Very easy to setup with the app and batteries work forever. I recently install a power cord so I don't have to bother with batteries.  I also recommend you buy an outdoor case and mounting bracket sold separately.  The mounting bracket that came with it isent very versatile.
 Bought these on a Black Friday deal. Only took a few minutes to install. Now have cameras in front of the house and at the garage. Very satisfied with purchase.

Easy to set up. Works good. However, the mounting brackets are very flimsy and break easily. You cannot buy the brackets anywhere. Without brackets, you just wasted your money.  UPDATE:  For the last week the temperature has been very low around here. It got down to 3 F.  All 3 Blink cameras started showing blue tint images. Then all 3 died.  I brought them in for a couple of days, but no luck. They all died at 3 F. temperature. These are NOT ready to be used outside in the cold. What a disappointment.
 It’s a pretty solid camera. Not a long delay at all for motion sensor. Quality is great! This picture is my living room with it being completely dark in there so night mode is awesome too
 These cameras were so simple to set up, they work flawlessly, and the schedule feature is easy to use. I love my Blink cameras and recommend them to all my family and friends! Worth every penny. Enjoy piece of mind while away! These are awesome. I know when packages get delivered and when my kids get home all via text alert (with video).
 This is my second set of Blinks.  Blink is the best product out there for reliability and picture quality.
 Great price, amazing little camera, very easy to install. Love this little camera, can’t say anything about the battery life haven’t owned a long enough to find out. Very easy to install, very easy to set up.
 It was very easy to set up and link to out phones.  The app is easy to use. We would reccomend this product if you want additional security. The free cloud account is great. One item to note when purchasing any of these types of cameras is to look at the temperature range, they look like they are about -4 to 113 degrees farenheit.
 I am happy with the Blink XT we have our device mounted outside and the view covers both our home and our neighbor. Only suggestion is to receive the notifications right when motion is detected instead of recording first.
 nice system if my up-load speed was capable  of running it.  I had to send it back.
 I bought this system with an add-on camera from this retailer. After about a week, both cameras stopped working. I thought it had something to do with my router after all it was kind of old. A new router did not solve the problem. I finally traced the problem to bad batteries being shipped with the unit. Two out of four batteries were dead on arrival just about. They had no voltage. A fresh set of alkaline AA's solved the problem. This vendor needs to check their batteries shipped with the unit. I'm rsting this four stars only because of multiple trips up and down a ladder to install &amp; reinstall the cameras and rebooting many times.
 Fantastic product. Great for seeing if you have packages at door or someone comes to door.
 Can anyone help me ... all of a sudden both cameras stopped picking up signals! Allis connected to wi if , power did not go out she batteries good to go! They will work live but nothing else! Help!
 I have this instead of Ring. It works great - I can see anytime anyone approaches the front door.
 Easy to install, great picture/video quality, works great. I am just hoping for more promotions on the XT so I can expand my unit.
 This is a great product. It's very easy to install, set up, and configure. I had held off for years on buying cameras like this due to storage, wifi issues, and usability. These cameras solve all those problems. Storage in the cloud makes it very easy. No local computer has to be configured to captures you camera footage. Wonderful product.
 Great whil it lasted. Quit recording video after 2 months and only gets audio.
 Easy to set up and use. Catches motions very well, and picture quality is great.
 Love the outdoor camera. Only wish it had a speaker to talk into.
 Easy to set up easy to install works well with iPhone. Wish it worked with Firestick app
 I love this!! I researched and researched to find something that would help me know what was happening at home when I wasn’t there. This is fantastic! It works great. I set it up in 15 minutes by myself. Can’t say enough good about it.
 Easy to set up. Took 10 minutes in total. Good quality picture, good price.
 Best home security cameras. No monthly fee! Easy install. No wires! What more could you want?
 These are the best need to go on. Sale for me to buy 2 more security camera
 The best cameras for the money. I would recommend the optional mounting brackets sold separately.
 Super easy to set up, works better than advertised with the zone control feature.
 Great camera, great picture and sound. Battery that came with it only lasted 3 months... far cry from the 2 year promise.
 They work... hopefully as time goes on update will make them less clunky. I can’t seem to keep gaps of time out when someone is walking up my driveway then back.
 A bit tricky to add multiple sign-on to phones but the picture is great and the features for taping little snipits of video when the sensor is triggered is very easy to use.  Love it and plan on seeing car prowlers.
 I would give it 5 stars if it had two way sound. Up to know is working good. Good video quality. I wish they had a door bell video camera but I don't think that will ever happen because it would compete with Amazon other products.
 Total novice, just what I needed to monitor a vacant house. I was wary, tiny box, two tiny cameras with a tiny instruction guide. Well for $225 you are getting quality cameras, and excellent simple software. I took my time installing, but now I could do it in 10 minutes flat.. All the questions I had were answered as soon as I screwed in the two cameras. A small matchbook sized "station " is plugged in right next to your internet router.  They somehow sync with each other automatically. You download an app on your phone which walks you through a few easy steps. The cameras are high definition and have auto infared. Beautiful pictures or video.  I put one near the back door, one in the front.  They are wide angle and super clear. The cameras have auto motion sensing, they come on at any movement from 10 to 40 feet, you set the sensitivity. You set the video length, 5, 15, 20 seconds up to a minute is recorded and sent to your phone at any movement. Of course the longer the video the shorter the battery life. Just Set it and forget about it. The app will notify you by phone chime immediately if a new clip has been made by a "visitor". Once by my cat until I decreased the sensitivity, they are HIGHLY sensitive but can be adjusted down. I didn't need an alarm company with monthly dues, I only wanted to know if someone went to the doors,( or through the doors). I can call the police myself. The video snippets are cloud based so no hard drive needed and it's a free service. Plus at night a tiny blue light starts blinking everytime a video snippet is being recorded, it would freak out a would be intruder if you put them in plain sight. I want visitors to know their actions are recorded. These little babies work! I got the XT version because it's the weather exterior model, not sure how well that will hold up it's just a rubber gasket in the inside back rim where the two AA batteries go, but so far I am impressed. A couple drawbacks, I have to watch notifications on my phone so I can't watch livestream on my laptop, but really it's not made for that since it's battery operated. You would go through batteries like crazy watching livestream for hours.  Also the one tiny window sticker is a joke, they should include a yard sign at least. I bought a generic First alert yard sign. Also the cameras have to be within about 50 feet of the server. But Overall a strong buy. ( BTW I wasn't paid a dime for this review, or received a discounted product. I paid full price. How do all these reviewers get free stuff? I would like in on that deal.) Anyway if you have a vacant house to watch or even your own place while you are away it's money well spent.
 Great product. Easy to setup and use. App works great and links to Alexa almost effortlessly.
 It works great when it works! One of my cameras starting flashing and making a clicking sound when it detects motion. It records, but the click sound only lets the bad guy know Its there.
 We love this! It has different options for notifications and when it records, which we love. We are planning on buying another one soon, would highly recommend!
 Not worth the money...only plus is that its wireless. Motion detection doesnt work through glass, only records what it detects, no memory card accessibilty for 24hr playback, picture is average...basically an expensive deer cam. Add a memory card option to justify the price.
 Easy to link and install. We lost power and they went right back up when the power came back.
 Love the idea behind the camera and ease of use, however the battery does every 2-3 days in the location we need to mount it. Higher traffic area so it comes on frequently.<br/><br/>Basically it’s a waste of money if you need it in certain areas.
 It will only record 4-6 secs even though I put it for 60 secs this is frustrating!!!!
 Bought this to protect my front door in my open air condo complex. During the daytime, it picks up every little movement, even on the lowest sensitivity. But then at night, on the same sensitivity level, you can walk straight into my place without the camera recording at all. When I wrote to the company, they told me I should use ITTT to change the sensitivity level for day vs night. That makes zero sense. If the camera is less sensitive at night vs during the day, then the change in sensitivity should be built into the app. I wasn't going to toy with an entirely new application to make the camera work the way it should out of the box. You should be able to set a camera zone, rather than a sensitivity level (or maybe both). I highly recommend against this product. Good idea, but not worth the money unless you want to constantly be changing settings, hoping the camera detects movement when you need it the most.
 Bought this add on camera 4 months ago to have an outdoor camera- we have had -30 degree temperatures and a very cold winter and this camera is still going very strong very impressed with picture quality and the battery in this terrible weather.
 Used for about three months. So far, so good. No glitches with connection to router or the app on my phone. Camera has a lot of setting options.  Battery life will be shortened by use of camera and settings. But for the money these will work for now.
 Everything is perfect except, the brackets that hold the cameras up should be more sturdy, and the video quality for the night vision isn’t that great. Also at 25 meters during day or night you can’t make out fine details like license plate numbers etc.
 I say my only problems with this is occasionally when I’m watching the Live feature the sound cuts out after about 2 seconds and then when motion is detected it records 60 seconds worth of video and then notifies you. It records sound and motion just fine, even in the dark. I’ll definitely be getting more camera and keeping with blink.
 These tiny cameras are easy to install and easy to set up. they have great quality that sends right to your phone
 Short of 5 stars (4/5); each camera cannot be scheduled independently. Overall, very satisfied with the two-camera bundle I purchased.
 For just over $250.00, I was able to install two cameras on the exterior of my property that work great. A simple app download to my mobile and I have audio and visual of whats going on at my home when I am away.  I will be adding more cameras in the near future.  My two camera system went from the box to up and running in just under 15 minutes.
 Second unit I have bought . Liked my home unit I bought 2nd for mountain cabin
 Works just fine<br/>Installed for my Dad, they love the extra security<br/>I love the easy install
 Would not recommend constant alerts with nothing on video. Every time I get a legitimate alert I get about 5 to 8 false alerts with nothing on the video. I wish i would have went with a different security system
 been working with several in my network. no issues or complaints
 Not happy. Installed to exterior of home to watch house while on vacation.  Camera went offline 2 days later.  Came home and took apart, camera is full of water.  Supposed to be weatherproof.  Will update if customer service responds, otherwise a waste of money
 Está cámara me la robaron y la tenía programada para los movimientos me la robaron y no detecto nada y menos me envió una notificación
 just an FYI on battery life under heavy usage, I got just over 4 months but it triggers 50 to 80 times a day
 Have purchased two and working good for the price. Installed them in a skin cover.
 Good value.  I bought this to add to my system and it works as described.
 Great product, I just wish you could zoom in, if it's possible I haven't figured out how. Good instructions, easy to program. Just found out you can zoom in videos,
 Super satisfied, very clear videos.  Only complaint would be that the camera is sometimes very sensitive and goes off more than necessary.
 Excellent quality for the money. LOVE that there are no monthly fees and includes cloud storage. Potential improvement would be preset times for Arming and Disarming (say 10 pm to 6 am and 8 am to 6 pm) so you don’t have to remember to turn it on and off every single time.
 Syncing issues that weren't resolved. Looks like it's nice if you are able to get it to work.
 Wish they had option to communicate both ways.  Battery life is awesome and picture is awesome
 Great alternative to a standard monthly payment for a security system. The one time purchase and value the app adds makes this worth it 100%.
 Bought this to add to our existing system.  Adding it was simple and quick.
 I like that it monitors temp and ease of use, I don't like the fact that I can't zoom.
 Not easy to talk with Blink have waited over a week for reply on bad camera only two months old.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-RFWUJ1G3CY9ZM"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91eDdpI-pYS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1dW0lS2j6S.png"/> The camera is usually is frozen up for the first 3 seconds of recording. Unfortunately that is probably the most important time when you can actually see a persons face.
 Product lasted 3 months and the started clicking non stop.  Drains the battery.  Also lost color, black and white only.  Very disappointed.  Amazon’s doesn’t back these for more than 60 days.  They send you a form to fill out.  Huge hassle.
 Great little system to monitor your home. Highly recommend. Picture is clear. Wish it had audio but I am pleased with it.
 Works great, easy to install. Only downside is if they do not activate there is no way to review the video as no hard drive
 10/10 rating from me. I’m probably going to be buying two more soon. Great quality and easy to set up!
 It is sad.  I bought this to work in my barn  aisle way and the Wi-fi just gets lost and I get no signal.  So it has become my garage camera up at the house and I am still looking for a solution to my barn surveillance.
 Very good video quality and sound. Still have a lot of false motion detection even when sun goes behind clouds and comes back it sets it off so I’ve adjusted the sensitivity to try to figure it out. Zoom option would be nice overall I’m satisfied
 I like these, high quality images and sound easy to install. Give me a security that I need
 I like the fact it’s compact wireless easy to set up  waterproof and affordable. I use it to keep an eye on my backyard underneath my deck
 I wish I got commission for all of my friends and family I got to purchase this system. Wireless system with no monthly fees. Great video and audio. Have incredible video of squirrel, coyote and trespassers. Perfect cameras.
 Shows a great picture but it has about a 10-15 second delay once the motion sensor is triggered.
 Great little camera, helped us nail a bad USPS delivery person
 Purchased the 5 camera set. Very happy so far. Easy to install and set up. Use for lake house and can easily monitor from permanent home!
 Easy to install and picture is great, sensors work properly as prescribed.
 Originally got some for a jobsite and then ordered this set for my home.
 I’m impressed with this security camera system. It was easy to setup and install.  The video quality very good and installation was a breeze with no wires to route. I bought 2 more 1 camera systems to add to my 2 camera system to increase my video recording capabilities with the additional sync modules.
 I'm "technology" challenged so I was pleased this was easy to set up.  I have it aimed towards the curb where my roses are.  Someone tore one out of the ground, roots and all, not once but twice!  The images are crystal clear and it doesn't record when every car goes by.  Highly recommend
 It is a good camera for the price.  But the motion sensor is a bit slow.  Usually the recording catches the person or animal leaving the field of view.
 Very satisfied with these cameras, records up to 60 second clips and don't have to subscribe to cloud storage service like is the case with Ring cameras.
 Been working flawless for almost 3 months in some extreme weather.  Easy to set up.
 Go for the wyze cam and save yourself some bux. This one is wireless and outdoor but that's easily overcome with the less expensive cam and with less free storage.
 So far so good with these cameras. I think he key is to have the right speed of service on your cable or dsl connection. I have had no issues so far but the real test will come in the sub zero temperatures this next winter.
 It works fine. However the hard part is the setting of the sensitivity. The sound is more sensitive than the motion detection  Installed above the main door. Everytime that the door opens it triggered by the sound of the door. And video clips did not catch any object moving.
 Setup was simple. The app works great. Response seems fast and accurate.
 I like this camera, easy to setup and good video quality.
 Super easy set up and installation. I am not a DIY person, and I had no problem. I am away from the house all day, so its nice to be able to keep an eye on things. The alerts work great. Also love the fact that it runs on batteries, as I have no external electrical outlets
 Didn’t think I needed a camera. But now I love having access to the house while I’m  at a work. Great purchase!
 WHAT GOOS IS A ADD ON CAMERA WITHOUT A MOUNTING BRACKET. WOULD HAVE ORERED IT T THE TIME IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WAS  NOT INCLUDED. WASTE OF MY TIMW  NOT GOOD  CUSTOER SERVICE...…...
 I have had these camera installed for about 6 months and they have been great. It has gotten below zero and the cameras still perform as they should love these cameras.
 Installation should be easy in both apartment and home settings but we can't get it to sync at apartment.  Two tries totalling an hour, then we gave up. But ... the apt is where we need it.  We took it to the house to see if we were just doing something wrong, but nah.  Works fine there.  We need to try again but haven't mustered the courage.
 The time it takes to tell you someone is at the door is too long.  The battery already needs replacement after 3 months.  Not good at all. Picture is nice.
 Easy to set up, mount and use from our smart phones. Recently purchased an add on for the inside... Beware the indoor camera lights up the room like a spotlight while in use. Lol unable to be incognito with that one. I'm exchanging for the XT version. Overall love it
 System doesn’t work at all in cold weathers.<br/>It’s currently 31 outside here in Michigan.
 So far so good but make sure you have adequate wifi strength.
 Very flexible system, and works well. Just be aware claims of two year battery life for outdoor cameras is highly unlikely. But that is not a significant drawback as I see it.
 These are great! Wanted a simple to use camera just for monitoring the perimeter. These are perfect. Happy with the settings, interface, range, picture.
 Love the ease of use of the cameras. I do wish the night view was more clear like the daytime view. Also, the storage fills so quickly and for my situation I need to take time to review the clips, if it catches enough, but the memory fills up so quickly with little ones in the home!
 These camera's were the perfect addition to the exterior of my home. They give us a nice clear view and the IR and motion sensor works amazing! We will be ordering more in the future and cannot wait for the rest of the blink security products to be released!
 Battery runs out quickly and doesn’t always pick up motion outdoors.
 Easy to set up and use. Nice picture, does everything I need it too. Price was right were it should be. Wish I bought more when it was on sale but only got 1 because I was concerned about how it works. Regret not getting at least 3. Now I have to wait for another sale or bite the bullit and buy at regular price.
 Very good but extremely sensitive even to wind so I can’t keep it on!
 Love them!  Money well spent, easy to install, and best of all NO wires!
 A zoom feature would be nice.
 Excellent outdoor camera! Very satisfied with product.
 Well worked good battery runs out fast ! Then there is motion and it stop even tho people trying to break into your car!!! Then people sirens made the cameras go crazy and stoped working!! So yea
 1 Star only because I can’t leave 0 stars. Worst camera ever!  Does not work! Customer Service did not help and was useless!
 Good camera for value. Put it up outside and weather got to -30, no problems.
 I really the ease of installation, but I wish there was a way to extend the range.
 Pretty simple setup, good quality video, great price and value!
 I love being able to see what's happening as soon as I get an alert.  I just wish it was easy to sync the system with more than one phone at once.  Other than that I love it.
 This is my 4th camera. I bought the 3 set a month or so ago for my K9 boarding buisness.  I hated the idea of wiring up a security system.  This was exactly what I was looking for. Affordable and easy to set up and works really well. Gives me peace of mind.  Loading is a tad slow but it is awesome picture quality is great!
 It started out working great and had clear picture. Then a week later the live video feed was cutting short and it makes a continuous clicking sound. Only used the camera inside.
 The thing won't stop going off for no reason. 15 alerts in 1min and the video clips are not even a second long. It's been going off for 5mins since i got home. Up to like 30 notifications for no reason at all. Nothing is even around to trigger it off. When it's not being a pos like it is now it's ok
 Wish the pictures were bigger but it definitely works as advertised.
 Easy installation, cooperative pricing, excellent quality footage, easy application to navigate.  No brainer to go with Blink
 I LOVE this camera! It is super easy to set up and the picture comes in nice and clear. It alerts me to my phone of any movement, and no monthly fee!! Highly recommend!
 great. view of front door good. unfortunatly, every cat that walks by, i get a message. but works well
 Super easy, great app, nice videos with sound, love it!!
 Great buy for the price and no stupid cloud fees.  Got three going now and adding more .  Access is great , just a little to sensitive sometimes.
 Not bad for outdoor cameras.. what i didnt like mostly was the fact that you got to be sign in in the app in order to receive notifications alerts. At least for android not sure about apple.
 Do not buy this product if you want something reliable. Range from camera to hub is awful. I have one camera 25 ft from hub and  if you try to watch live it will time out and never load. I can arm system and back out of the driveway in a full size truck and it will not activate the recording feature. Dont waste your money...
 This item has a very short range of vie and can’t be expanded. The box said a 2 year battery life but I bought it I. Dec 18 and by jan 9 the batteries were dead. When the camera senses something the delay of notification is long.
 Great that it’s wireless. Good resolution and detects motion most of the time. Mounting bracket is too loose. Squirrels and storms move cameras position.
 This camera was incredibly easy to set up and install. The instructions were very clear, the hardest part was getting the back off to get the battery inside. Remember to switch off the blue light that activates when the camera is recording before you put the cover back in place. (keeps the camera out of sight). Has worked without any problems since purchase.
 Love these cameras snd also at an economical price
 I really like this system . I think it would be a good option if the module had a built in battery just for backup cause if the thieves cut the power first , it would still be able to send the video footage  on it's own battery
 Pros =easy to set up &amp; audio, too!<br/>Con= it’s already on fritz: it’s only been up 2 months &amp; (1) it went be zero this am snapping shots repeatedly, &amp; (2) battery already needs replacement<br/>Short battery life &amp; haywire after 2 months — does NOT make for reliable home security camera
 I bought and setup the system. One of the cameras stopped working after 10 minutes and the receiver stopped working 2 days later. Customer service offered to send a new camera right away but since the entire system isn’t working now, I’m returning the whole thing. I need something dependable.
 I put this camera on my front porch, so far it's working great. The mounting hardware is somewhat flimsy, would be easy for someone to take it. It is about 25 feet from the base unit, an it sends video to my phone in seconds. Overall, its a nice addition to my home security.
 I love these!  We put one facing our front door and one that faces out lanai door but also catches our sliding glass door.  The picture is so clear.  Even at night, you can still tell who's at the door.
 These work really well. Easy to install, clear picture,  all good!
 These are just ok. Not reliable enough to use for security. Motion sensor doesn’t always work
 The blink found to be a good camera for what you use it for price wise product wise over all good  Wireless and the batteries won't break the bank
 Night imaging could be better but  it is what it is for the price. Time will tell on battery life.
 System doesn't work in hotels, useless for traveling.
 Worked good for about a week then it started to make a clicking noise like when it turns on and off .<br/>Will not let you see if it’s in recording mode.<br/>This product was not what I was looking for.
 During the day I have to move sensitivity down to 1 or 2 otherwise, it picks up wind, rain, snow, or trees move, sunlight change.<br/><br/>With sensitivity 1, or 2, almost deems the camera. The cameras does not trigger to catch even walking right in front of it.
 Blink is a great product idea that has failed miserably. Unfortunately, I am now $800 in to the product and the interface between the cameras, the sync module, the app and reliability of what I see as getting benefit of home security and knowledge of activity around my home has completely FAILED. Worse, Blink has no live human you can contact for technical support, and your only option is to engage in a series of time sucking emails with someone in India or Pakistan that send you canned responses that are no help and I already tried over multiple attempts to get the platform to work. Save your money and look elsewhere!
 Dont like that it picks up cars driving by or wind blowing a leaf. Better safe than sorry. It did pick up two individuals on my property. Range of coverage not very wide.
 I live in MN and this camera can not hold up to the cold. Winter barely has started and it dies every other day even if I have it on the lowest setting.
 WOW!  This system works just as advertised and the quality is super.  I am looking at expanding the system with other devices.
 Batteries died on 2 out of three cameras we purchased.  Very disappointed and would at the minimum, ask that you supply me with additional batteries.
 Love this camera!! Solid build with even better features
 You get what you paid for. Works as advertised but unfortunately it would be so much better if you can set dead or exclusion zones. Hard to set an angle when you have to angle it so it doesn't catch the street AND get a good shot of people walking up to your door.
 Easy to use and install. Download its app on your phone, plug in the sync module in the wall close to your wireless router, create your account, follow instructions and you'll be viewing wireless footage from your phone in no time, IPhone or Android. Adjust settings how you'd like. Remember that those AA lithium batteries will need to be replaced once a year or so.
 This is the most simple way to camera up your home.  Works great with phone app.  You can check up on your home at any time and place.
 Buy a couple of them, you will enjoy them immensely knowing who's coming to your door and when - you can even listen to their conversations.
 These are easy to set up and work as intended. Instantly know if someone set off the motion detector.
 So simple to install and use - going to buy MORE
 I am really impressed with the two outdoor blink cameras and hub. Set up was less than ten minutes and now I have peace of mind knowing when and who is coming to my front or back door. The pushes are awesome, I can see everything from work or wherever I happen to be. I'm adding one to check on the cat while I'm away too.
 Easy installation. Could have been perfect if attachments are included
 Surprising how well it works for the price, to be honest.
 great product - so far...
 Simple, reliable, reasonable price, no monthly fees,I like em!
 Battery life not good, overall a great value
 LOVE Blink!! The quality is amazing. The only drawback I have is that I cannot control the depth of motion detection or set a perimeter. I'll deal with alerts for cars driving by for the quality of this product.
 It actually works as described, easy to setup. I bought the 2 cameras and I use them indoor only at my apartment. I actually let it record me every time I come in and that way I make sure they are still working. Not sure about battery life but even if the batteries last 1 year I am happy, batteries are cheap, love the no wiring!
 Easy to install. Clear picture and clear live video.
 Easy set up and the system works as intended. If the battery life lasts what they say it will this was a great deal. I have 2 outdoor cameras and will likely be purchasing 2 more in the future if these keep working like they are now.
 These were fairly easy to set up and they work well. I wish there were more features though (landscape view etc). The cloud storage is nice.
 fast shipping and works perfect real easy and fast to set up got two blinks in our office again perfect will be buying plenty more Thanks
 Easy setup and connection, great picture, motion detection and notification.  Just what I wanted. Worth the money. Night vision is good, too.
 I love these blink security cameras. They let me know if someone is at my house one minute after recording them.
 Its been 3 months. So far soo good, few false motion detections because of wind but you will be fine if you set up the sensitivity. Its very easy to mount. Battery life is still in good shape. Camera quality is great. I will buy more whenever I get a good deal.
 I have 4 of these cameras now.  Works great.
 , a wonderful product works great easy to use
 Best home system I have ever come across. Easy to setup and use.
 Easy setup and good image quality.  Has a one way mic so you can hear the person on camera but can not communicate with them.  Two-way talk would be a major plus.
 What can I say besides Amazon did it again!!1
 Very happy with the two cameras we purchased
 Purchased this for my new rental feeling very safe and my boyfriend loves it he recommended it to all of our friends
 I own 30 of both exterior and interior cameras.  There are good camera and technology for the money.  The drawl backs, I have not so good experience in regards to viewing live view or recorded footage while the cell phone LTE signal or WiFi strength were weak....  you will most likely not be notified if the camera is triggered.  Also, between recording, there’s a 10 seconds gap.  Re-boot  your router or cell phone is necessary when camera acts up. So, I back up with alarm system just to have an extra layer of security.  I believe Blink engineers will keep making improvements as they have been.
 The blink is ok for a moderately priced security camera. Picture quality is good, but range for motion capture is hit or miss. Sometimes it will pick up motion 50 feet away and sometimes it will be set off on a windy day.
 I love this system and it does everything it is supposed to do.  It's easy to set up and easy to use.
 I love these, haven't had any problems with them. Love that they don't cost me monthly like most cameras.
 Bought this set for a month now and I am very happy with it.  Turn them on when you want them to record and set time of recording<br/>I been raving to frriends to get these cameras
 very very good but birds squirrels and wasps will set it off
 Home security. Works well , easy to install, it has a good picture and many different settings to do what you need. Either watch live or record with motion sensors. I bought 2 cameras and just ordered a third one.
 Love this camera! You don’t need a separate router and it even has sound!
 Good cheaper camera. Only wish there was a remote alarm option.
 Was great for like a week or two and now I can't get it to reconnect, VERY disappointing
 I love that you don't have to pay for a subscription and how quickly it alerts you when it detects movement. The only problem I have is you can't zoom in on the recording. Unless there's a trick I haven't learned yet. Other than that, I am pretty satisfied with it over the old Foscam I had which kept having problems.
 The Blink XT Home Security System seems to be the right choice for our home. My only regret is had we waited another week (we purchased ours on Dec 5th) we would have been eligible for the Echo Dot 3rd gen for free.
 These cameras are a great addition for home or a apartment security!
 I absolutely this home security system.<br/> No monthly fees and I can check in on my home when I’m not there.<br/> Setting it up was so easy and fast!<br/>Probably one of the best purchases  I’ve made and it gives me peace of mind❤️!<br/>In fact I just ordered an add on camera and I can add 7 more if I choose!👏👏👏
 Clear picture worth the money. The app could use some work but I still love the product
 this product is awesome and easy to install...
 Never a problem with these cameras.  This is my sixth one.
 Works well. Good quality video and pictures. Easy to mount and to change the settings.
 Easy to set up and completely wireless. The image is extremely good as well.
 Pros<br/>Works ok, and video is clear<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Triggers way too easily even on low settings. Wind sets it off, which just kills the batteries.<br/>A better way to create on/off schedules.<br/>Mount can use some work, not the best design.<br/><br/>What it needs:<br/>It desperately needs a web portal, not just a mobile app<br/>HomeKit support<br/>TV App : AppleTV app, ROKU App, etc...
 Bought the 2 camera system. I didn't necessarily believe the reviews that it was going to be a snap to set up - but it was. Took me about 5 minutes. Works perfectly and we love it. The picture and sound qualify on my iphone is amazing. Installed the 2 cameras with a single screw ... easy.
 Love these purely wireless security cameras with no monthly fee!  Very easy to set up and use.  I shopped around quite a bit before buying these, and still believe they are the best on the market. Great battery life too!
 I bought this camera for the price, easy installation, and the fact that there's no monthly service charge. The image quality is decent, but that's about it for pros. I'm disappointed because the motion detection function is not very responsive making this security camera useless.
 this a very nice system for a summer home, or a shed.<br/>not for your active place. its very simple to install, IT DOES NOT RECORD CONTINUALLY , only clips triggered by motion and you can't use live view while the camera is recording the short clips.
 WORKING GOOD , VERY CLEAR BUT I CANT CONECT WITH MY ECHO DOT 3GEN
 Easy setup. Very nice, good price.
 surprisingly long battery life.  good image.  a little delay on the warning on the phone but for the price. great
 This thing is terrible. Doesn't work consistently enough to act as a security camera (even after they sent a replacement). Don't waste your money.
 Great item. Exactly what I wanted.
 Tried one camera first. Once I narrowed the field of vision the picture was great...all day and night. I had a question and I got an answer the same day. I ordered 2 more cameras.
 Works as advertised. No problems so far!
 This camera works so well that we bought a second.
 Both the camera and base station need to be close to the router. With two camera's spreading on both sides of the house this is a nearly impossible system without the use of WIFI range extenders.
 Blink is the best!
 Camera works well but is a little pricey compared to other blink cameras.
 So far best security system for the price I’ve ever bought
 Easy to set up, easy to use.  5 starts all day long.
 Easy to install and use.  REALLY !  :)
 So i had this camera for about two months and it already says battery low it does get used at least a couple times a day but u would think thats normal not good for front of house with normal traffic
 I MAILED IT BACK BECAUSE IT DIDN'T WORK, NOW THEY WON'T REFUND MY $77.99
 This is the most flexible system I’ve owned. No wires. Awesome. App works great.
 Love it . So easy to install . We have it at our cabin upstate NY , great since we aren’t always there .
 Easy install and works great so far.
 We like this camera for what it does.
 excellent product works very well
 Good camera but misses things that could be critical
 Product works perfectly. Night vision great. Picture quality crisp. Installation fairly simple<br/>Well worth the price
 So easy to install. Always works
 Very impressed with the video quality and super easy to setup.
 Excellent wireless camera. Notifications are great.
 When looking for an inexpensive basic home security product I ran into this on Amazon and after reading about it thought it would be worth a shot.  It turned out to be a waste of time, it only picked up motion about 1 out of 10 times.  For the price there are other products out there that I can say with confidence say work much better.
 Love this camera system, very simple with great camera quality. Took about 10 minutes to set the entire thing up - app works great and free storage is unbeatable. Having the ability to add additional cameras to the system easily is a plus, and the mounting bracket was much easier than competitors. Highly recommend 👍🏼
 This thing catches everything.  Love the motion detection.
 These are the best. So easy to set up.
 Love it! Will probably be ordering more.
 Good price, easy setup....I read reviews from multiple sites for weeks before making a purchase.  Best overall for price.  Only wish was ,1080 clarity.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R26ZVI1LXOI9IH"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91fYxBATPOS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1zdaMPtpwS.png"/> Very pleased thus far.  Our Blink has captured racoons, bobcats and our beloved Florida Chameleon Anole flashing his dewlap :&gt;
 I liked this product in the beginning but then the videos became laggy and we only had it for 2 weeks and the battery life was almost dead and it said it was suppose to last up to two years. We returned the product because we dont want to constantly be replacing the batteries.
 Very easy to install just hang and download software, no wires to mess with, great picture and voice quality. Would buy again.
 Will not work in sub zero temps
 Only have had for a few days. Setup was easy. Camera picture is pretty good. No ability to arm and disarm cameras individually though. 5 camera system only comes with one sync module. Better off buying a 3 camera system plus a 2 camera indoor system if you plan to use any of the cameras indoor that way you get 2 sync modules.
 Good quality, easy to install, and user-friendly phone-app.  Would be even better if they could be easily integrated with other home security systems (like Ring).
 Super easy set up! Great for an apartment space! Easy access on iPhone. Just what I wanted!
 Easy to set up and view. Great video.  Range could be a little better but solved it with a wifi extender. Going through brick wall blocks it a little.
 Batteries ran out after 3 months. In the day camera has good resolutiom while at night it does not. You wont be able to distinguish people.
 Easy to use, monitoring anywhere u have wifi
 nice but make sure you have good streaming internet
 Awesome product just easy to install just awesome
 time delay from notification to  picture availability
 no rechargeable batteries  !
 Easy to install and use, very.  I just wish it had 2 way audio capabilities.
 nothing to say, except if one day, we can have a microphone incorporate. Blink, good prodct, but very pricy. now china do the same thing for 50 bucks, will try to see and compare. and keep you posted. otherwise except the price, very good product, i recommand it
 This is a great tool for home safety without spending a lot of money.  The app enables you to turn the cameras on and off and see a live feed.
 Love the system , it’s been running about 2 weeks now . Very user friendly and pretty good camera quality . Had my rear porch camera act up with the motion dection but it seams to be back on track now . Overall we like the system and would /have recommended to others !
 Still setting up to get best response to capture photo clip. system hooks up is east to get going. daylight seems to be doing ok, nice photo clip during daylight . but any reflection during evening or night the blue sensor light keeps it from working 100% of the time.  Thanks Tom
 Awesome set up , hope the battery last half as long as stated. Great picture and sound. Horrible , aweful, not well thought out well mounting clippie thing.. cmon an outdoor cam needs more than a clip on.
 Nice system, easy to install
 I have added 3 cameras and plan to add more. Love the app on the phone, notifications are nice. Picture and quality of the video also nice.
 Fourth purchase of blink. Easy and inexpensive.
 Works great. Easy to set up
 Love this unit so far. Easy to install. No fees and plenty of features. Been a great edition to our home. Only unknown is battery life.
 This system has a lot going for it but has a major limitation. I love the ease of Installation and setup. The quality is ok but the plastic mount should be metal.  Control by smartphone is top notch but through Alexa the control leaves a lot to be desired...
 good product,will probably add more cameras
 Love this setup. Honestly the most user friendly and nicest camera setup I’ve had!
 Love my Blink cameras see my other reviews
 Sometimes doesn’t respond or connect to the app and motion sensor doesn’t detect a person.
 Works very well. Best camera for places with no outlets/plugs. Need software improvement. Is in the right track.
 Has 4 of this and does their job perfectly. Easy to install and manage. Best buy for the bucks.
 Love it n easy set up- just not how to use it 1400 miles away
 Best system in the market.
 Best home security ever. One and only true wireless camera system. I owned 3 outdoor and 7 indoor cams.
 Great camera,  good quality pictures but the batteries do not last long at all.  It's been about a month and a half and they are already low. I even disarmed it frequently to save battery life.
 Took only ten minutes to install near my front door.  Picture and sound quality is excellent.
 I bought it as a gift and it is working great.
 These work very well even in heavy wind and rain.  They are very easy to install, I put them up in minutes.  Very good coverage area.  The video and audio are reliable.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
 Excellent system, great and exceptional value, highly recommended.
 Love this camera. It hooked up to our existing indoor Blink Camera systems and module. It has great quality and we love that it's wifeless..plus no monthly cost for home security!
 Good quality product.  Nice resolution
 Easy to set up and easy to view. Currently using this indoors as a second camera to watch my dog. Eventually,  I will move it outdoors.
 The Camera is very good.  Good quality but the batteries do not last 2 years.  I got my camera May 1st ans installed 3 days later.  Today is May 14 and the barreries already die.
 works great, good &amp; video picture quality,easy install, wish i would've bought more on black friday for that price.
 Poor quality picture or images, had to return it
 Easy to use and no subscription fees
 Very easy to install. They work great.
 I like that there is no monthly fee, like Ring. These are amazing..goid night videos.  Worth every penny!
 First camera worked so well, had to add another to the family.  Have a relative  on the other end of the country  connected to the system.  He is amazed the clarity of the camera.
 Not perfect but ideal for my needs. At this price point it will be tough to find a comparable device. Easy to set up and use.
 Easy set up and no big white light shining when its active.
 Blink pretty much is junk I had this for a few months facing my driveway where we park to detect cars coming up &amp; people coming &amp; leaving well it detected the sun &amp; wind in the tree better than any actual people movement<br/><br/>**even uses the grid to detect certain areas
 I have 2 XT cameras watching my place and I can check them at any time. I can also recieve e-mail alerts when a camera sees motion. Great cameras.
 Add claims the batteries will last 2 years, lie.  I had one outside and one inside on my boat, the outside unit had a number of motion events and batteries died in 2 months.  The inside unit had no motion events and died in 4 months.  Returning today.
 Great cameras love blink
 Very easy to install. No problems! Good images! No cost for storage. Peace of mind for backyard pool and front steps for packages.
 I like how easy it is to install and get it ready and go. What I didn't like that  in close quarters the picture quality is not that good
 I've had this camera for about a week, and so far I really like it. The quality of the images and video is very good, and I love that it doesn't require any wiring. Setup was super easy too.
 Failed in less than 9 months of use
 there easy to put up but the mounts are cheap plastic and if anything hits the cams they can just pop right off im planing to get the better mounts that are supose to work with these.
 Fits description and works well
 Love it. Read the instructions. Good quality.
 It’s amazing how it work via WiFi with no wires
 I bought the outdoor Blink, it has failed to work properly since I bought it, complained a dozen times and no warranty
 love this ,works great and even at night no other charges and pics go right to my phone. i wish i could talk threw it and should have got one more camera will prob order one soon ty william
 Cannot beat blink cameras for the price we have several
 it seems like its a little slow to notify my cell phone, sometimes no notice at all. it is awesome to install and no wires.
 Excellent product here just wish there was an alarm siren to arm
 Great products night vision works awesome I get my door in my shed
 easy to use, easy to set up. only drawback is no app for laptop, only for phone.
 Awesome but crappie mount.
 Very bad. Idk why people review for 5 start, connection live very bad, for oneday you may be can see live for 5mins, thats it.  and you cant watch offline either. No memories, no any options. Nsjwjwkenekenrjfidnejejdndndjdjehebebennendbrjjdneenejrjrbjejeiejebbeiejejrjrjjejenr
 Seriously Love it, I had a lot of cameras that claimed "wireless" but this stuff actually is. It needs wifi, so so so so easy installation and setup. Love love love it. No wires needed for any of the cameras.  Bought 4 more
 Very happy with the purchase of two outdoor cameras. The only issues were there was no mounting brackets included. I had to purchase separately. One way to improve this system would be to allow activating or deactivating each camera. Currently the system is on or off. Other then that very good system and value!!
 It's a good product., but once in awhile it does not pick up a motion.
 works like a charm, even shows the raccoons during the middle of the night
 We love our blink cameras. Easy to set up. Great clear, quality video and sound. The only thing we wish would be the capability to speak through the camera from our phone.
 clarity not real good
 camera just arrived yesterday. Spent an hour trying to install it last night.  The instructions for Apple say go to the app store and download Blink Home Monitor App.  Thought I did, and couldn't understand what I was looking at.  It was not what the instructions said, either in writing or the install video.  Finally realized it is for Blink auto charging.  At the moment I cannot even find an app for the cameras.  Asked for help last night and it is nearly noon today and no response.  Try it yourself before you buy.  I'm going to have to return the product.
 This system is fantastic and is working great keeping on top of things at home when I'm not there!
 Easy setup good quality image in standard light, low light cameras must be close.<br/>Motion activation works well and storage management is simple. I will buy more cameras to expand this system.
 Simple to work with, stable and good price
 Decent little camera to monitor my front door.<br/>If using a VPN, disconnect before setting up. Took me 10 minutes to figure that out
 Great system so far. Only complaint is the mounting hardware is flimsy.
 Worked great with my existing system. Easy to add on. Good quality picture.
 The "mount" is rubbish. You can go up, down, side to side. That's it. It is very limited, couldn't even get the right angle to use it properly. It worked at first, then nothing. Found an app for free and currently using an old cell phone as a security camera. Works great!
 Just what I needed while I'm out of the house. Easy viewing on a smart phone. Quality clip visability and very easy to set up.
 I love this security camera for daytime use.  I get no nighttime video as it just a blurr.....  I would recommend this camera to those looking for an affordable security option.
 Great picture quality, easy to install, perfect price and no monthly contract
 I am not at all satisfied with my blink camera's.  They work when they want.  A bush blows got it someone entering your driveway walk around the front of your house nope!  Very dissatisfied.  I have set and reset nothing.  At night no notifications at all.  During the day like I said a bush blows and I got it!
 This product works really well. However, I have had the product for 3 months and have had to change the batteries at least 6 times. I thought that when I bought it the batteries would last for 2 years. It has been very frustrating to continuously have to change out the batteries because batteries aren't cheap.
 Good security camera. I m going to purchase more for the front of my house.  Motion sensor works good.
 Returned it after testing it out. I like that it’s wireless and easy to use however, capturing video is super delayed by a few seconds. Sometimes even pause. Product is kinda cheap for $130. I would much rather pay a little more extra to get something at Costco which is what I will be doing.
 After trial &amp; error w/ four other cameras in my horse stall, this one is the best!  Easy set-up &amp; only takes AA batteries, not the expensive ones like other wireless cameras.  I highly recommend Blink.
 LOVE THIS SYSTEM. WIRELESS EASY SET UP. HIGH QUALITY VIDEO WITH SOUND AND NIGHT VISION. WI FI REQUIRED.
 Bought one and tried it out,worked great! So I bought 2 more!
 The good: small, great picture and sound, easy to setup and configure<br/><br/>The bad: motion detection is spotty at best. I setup 2 cameras and while one works best yet than the other, both don’t consistently pick up motion until it’s within 15’ dead center in front of the camera.
 Very easy to set up even for a technology challenged person like myself. Really like this product.
 Worked, no complaint.
 I like this cam but the field of view I limited
 Best buy ever very good image, easy to install, and the app is very easy to use
 Great motion sensing and phone alerts.  Nice vision works excellent.  Modular concept.
 Nice system, works well with my strong wifi.<br/>Video quality is good day and night. Motion detection is ok to about 20 feet.<br/>I wish there was the option to get email or text notifications.
 Works like a charm
 Cheap material but works!
 I like too much. No need monthly payment to see your videos saved.
 The motion detection doesn't work through glass.  Which makes this camera a $100 wireless "peeping hole".  So it needs to be placed outside to work.  Which means you can either have your $30 Amazon package stolen or stolen $30 Amazon package and a $100 camera.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money honey.
 Great wireless camera, love our cameras, wish had audio to speak.
 Easy to install, works wonderfully.
 Amazing product and works wonderfully. Now I can keep an eye on the office at night time. It’s actually fun watching all the homeless meth heads walk around till the wee hours of the morning.
 I've had this camera for about one month now and found the set up and installation pretty easy to follow. I'm not a super techy person and this is my first camera. The signal strength is great and the picture and sound quality seem pretty good but I don't have another system to compare it too.  I don't have any problems with it being too sensitive and turning on when a leaf blows by.  Seems to work well.  My only complaint (4 stars instead of 5) is often when I click on the  live view- I get a system busy message and have to try it 2-3 times before I can see a live view. I usually get it to work after 30 seconds or so but it its kind of annoying but not a deal breaker for me.  I don't get much motion/activity at night so I cant say to much about the night vision but it did pick up a raccoon walking on my deck one night and I could see it pretty clearly. Overall, pretty happy with it and plan to get another one for the other side of the house.
 Eeasy to install
 Battery Life Low
 Love these cameras.  Easy to install, easier to use, reliable, and produce high resolution videos and images.  One drawback is that the only APP they provide is iPhone and there is no iPad version for it. Using iPhone apps on iPads means flipping the ipad vertically every time.
 Cheap way to monitor your home.
 They are pretty good!
 Great product, easy to setup no monthly fees, fantastic picture quality.
 So easy to set up &amp; install. This was up &amp; running in less than 15 minutes. Good quality images, sound also is very good quality. We can hear a csr coming down the driveway before it comes into view. APP works great. Good value for money.
 These work the best of the cameras I’ve tried.  Right size and response from movements.
 Great pic! Goid systembfir price however 2 of 5 cameras are not working after only 6 months.  Trying to diagnose before I call.
 Love this so much I just ordered another one to add to my system! Great picture! Love the phone alerts when motion is detected!
 Batteries only lasted 3 months . Other than that good camera
 Easy to set up and use
 The mounts are so bad that they actually have better mounts that you have to purchase. I constantly need to re position the camera because it droops. Bad connectivity to wifi.
 Excellent product and a great value
 Excellent security system. I bought a total of 3 and plan on adding 2 more. No contracts or monthly payments.
 Really convenient and durable.
 Extremely easy to setup and great video and audio quality
 No Subscription, Cheaper System.
 Excellent product. Wish you could watch live video and record at the same time. Also wish it would be able to know when I’m home (like by my phone being home) and automatically disarm. Other that that they work great.
 I bought this a year ago almost to the day, and the camera has stopped responding
 Works very well easy setp
 Simple instruction and easy installation
 It worked for only three weeks then stopped working I tried everything with it resetting and changing the batteries but still not working! Really bad  don’t waste your money !
 I really enjoy this camera. Its weqther proof for sure. I had it outside all winter in Minnesota. The only thing ive found is the batteries drain pretty quick. It could be the settongs or all the cars driving past but I've now been using rechargeable ones. The only other issue is I am unable to zoom in from my android phone, only iPhone can zoom in.
 As a lot people are saying , I wish the cameras had two way voice and further  Motion detection then 20 ft max still love the blink system .
 This product was just as easy to install as stated.  It gives me motion alerts on my phone when someone is pulling into my drive at my house.  Clear pictures and sound on the videos.<br/><br/>The mounting hardware on one of my cameras broke too easily I think but the one I have put up I love.
 Easy set up and directions ,, links right to phone or computer,,, we will be adding more to our property for sure. Def 5 starts on this product. Clear picture, great sensors !!
 This is an amazing camera, everyone I've shown the motion triggered clips to was impressed with the clarity and live view.<br/>I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone....so many camera control options ....just seamless operation and connection to my home WIFI....great price point!
 Great cost and features.
 Nice perfect for my apartment
 I am mad that I ordered 2 of the outdoor cameras but the silicone shells that i ordered along with them are discontinued !!!!  I supposed to protect them outside now?!. I spent a lot of money for this not to work out !
 has crisp clear picture.love it
 I love these cameras. Ive tried quiet a few and none as easy to set up as these AND WORK amazingly.
 Was very excited to acquire this camera as it was touted to do everything I needed. The batteries did not even last one month. I did get a message near the end saying that it was being used excessively, but even so, that is less than 4% of the advertised time. Very disappointed.
 Love these cameras. Great for my needs
 works great, but lacks external speakers
 I have 3 of these cameras and they are the best. Easiest Plug and Play device ever!!!!!
 Ordered one....no mounts included.  Returned it and ordered a replacement.  It also came without the mounts....and subsequently returned.  Order from this supplier at your own risk
 Where do I begin. First of all, these things eat batteries. They are constantly going off line, losing signal from the wi-fi, or the sync module. they are well within the required distance to the sync module and the router. There is constantly something wrong, not working etc. Look elsewhere.
 Easy, quick, simple start up. Works better than expected. Adjustable settings, no fees storage. Purchased while on sale $70 range.
 Good camera
 Works great! Good picture too.
 Great value
 Best $125 we ever spent.
 I really Like this Product. Works Great and easy to put up.
 The system was extremely easy to install and activate. The quality of the images are excellent.
 Everything was as advertised...they do not last 2 years as advertised
 The easiest setup and use of any camera I’ve ever had.
 Great camera.  No complaints.  Works great!!
 Battery supposed to last up to 2 years only last a month
 Easy to install had them over two months. No problems batteries still strong.
 The work just as they say they would. The clarity of the picture in near darkness is much more than I would expect at this price
 Bought two outdoor cameras and planning to buy two more. So simple to set up and easy to control from your phone. No fees etc.
 Great product reasonable price
 The camera works well, but has its limitations.  Field of view is not big and audio does not work.
 Very easy set up, clear picture, you can customize to what you need. Have them all outside and have had no issues with the rain or wind. Great product.
 Helped us catch our pool man that wasn't coming!!!!  smile
 Very easey to set up the day time quality is excellent but the night time video is extremely poor you can not make out a persons face at all everything is a white blur.
 Great camera
 Have had it about 2 weeks. Easy set up! Easy app to use! Totally love this item! Other family members now want this item because they see app has no monthly charge, which is also a plus for me.
 Great camera, picture is awesome!  Please add 2 way audio.  Everything else about this set is awesome.  Battery life is very good.  Our system is activated quite often and still have original batteries 5 months into it...much better than I expected.  Setup was simple and I have zero issues.
 I like the system, just wish it had a bit wider lens
 Great product!  Love the wireless feature and image storage
 Needs to load faster.
 Makes me feel safe home or away
 I have 2 cameras to keep an eye on my carport.  Easy to set up. Picture and sound are great. Night vision is ok.  Settings easy to fix sensitivity.  I can look in using the app whenever i want.  Wireless conmection has not been an issue at all. For the price, these cameras are great.
 👍🏻👍🏻
 Great protection when you’re not home
 Love it !!!! very reliable  - great video (make sure you have it set to high rez)
 Hard to get signal to cameras outside of the house even 25 feet from the signal collector! Ridiculous for the price paid!
 Great product.
 Set up was very easy.  No wiring necessary - this will fit my needs very well.
 This camera beat my expectations. The video quality is great! It is completely wire free, and easy to set up with NO subscription!! The only thing I would change is the mount that comes with the camera, I will be purchasing something that is a little more sturdy as the one that cane with it is flimsy and pops apart.
 Great. Attached to my porch for all those midnight creepers.
 As expected and very user friendly
 The quality of both day and night vision is very good. Use Blink to cover the back entrance.  Getting another for the front.
 EASY EASY EASY - Does what its supposed to do.  Flexible settings.
 Not bad for a wireless system.  A bit of a challenge in sensitivity settings and a little slow in loading from your phone app to view alerts.
 Awesome product. Highly recommend!
 Good product and nice price.
 These cameras were one of the best buys I have ever made. Easy installation and setup.  Work great! Now I know who is at my door.
 Super easy to set up. Loving it so far. Just installed yesterday.
 Works great!
 Works well
 Buy this it works
 Excellent camera system!
 Love the Blink Cameras. The outdoor cameras work great.
 Big Fan of BLINK love this product &amp; highly recommend
 was great for a month and a half  then stopped working. Can't connect to blink servers anymore. may try to return if I can find the box.
 THESE THINGS ARE AWESOME. So easy to set up. I originally bought it because I suspect a neighborhood kid was taking things out of my car but then I got a mouse in the basement. Set up the cameras and found out where the mouse was getting in. Took the mystery work out of it for sure!
 Image darker than original camera when compared.
 We love our Blink camera's, a must have for us.
 Night vision stopped working
 good price
 It records everything, however, if you have a wasp nest close to it then you will be deleting a lot of video
 Personal use
 It doesn't only give me peace of mind it makes me feel safe
 Easy to use
 Works great. It can be very sensitive and pick up the tiniest things.
 great for security
 Absolutely excellent product
 nice image quality day or night, good sound also easy to install did it in 20 min or so
 exactly as advertised nice wire free system running off 2gb hotspot.
 This product is alsome works perfectly
 Front door.
 Terrific. Period
 Super easy setup and good video quality! I’m actually ordering another one to go over my garage.
 Works just great. Just try not to use the video so much it will use a lot of the battery.
 Arrived as promised
 These are great, and easy to install. Great video picture as well.
 I love this camera system. Was with them through Kickstarter. I have  recommended this system to multiple people and they have purchased the system
 Easy installation,  great quality, fair price, no monthly fee.
 product works very well.  I have bought 10 of them now...
 Great outdoor, waterproof, motion sensor, 100% wireless, security camera. Just need 2 AA batteries for 2 years. Fix it anywhere with mount comes with camera.
 Fast and easy to install. No power/data cables needed. Easy to use app.
 So far so good with the Blink XT - installed 3 months.. after adjusting the sensitivity of the motion alert its working just like i want it to. 2 cameras were installed and setup in less than 30 minutes.. some angle adjusting was required to get my perfect view. going to add a couple more really soon.
 I'm finding it impossible to get the back cover off. Very frustrating.
 It stop working after two days.
 good camera, easy to mount and install, just a bit expensive but i guess it's a pretty good value.
 It could have been a great item, unfortunately it did not work
 As described
 Works great.  Service was excellent!
 Overall good product worth the money however while it's recording you can't view live
 These have worked well for me.  They are small and very user friendly.
 Well worth the price. The video quality is fantastic and the user interface was so simple.
 Great quality. Easy installation. Had to also purchase aodrm extender but now it works great!
 Great product
 Working well with rest of cameras!
 Spent a decent amount of time researching cheaper cameras and doorbell camera's before buying this. Very happy, was easy to install and does exactly what I wanted it to do!
 Much better than Ring.
 Great product, easy to setup and work great, recommend 100%
 I’m impressed. Extremely simple to set up and use.  Clear video. I’ve already ordered additional cameras.
 I like everything about this camer system, super easy setup
 They work great! Nice picture/video with sound. Now they're even better because you can block out areas you don't want to pick up motion from, like a busy road.<br/>For the price, you can't beat em!
 Love it keep an eye on my 95 year old and the pool.....
 Gives peace of mind and stores to the cloud
 They work fine, wish they had a little better range.
 I have this camera at my front door and it works very well. The night vision on it is great. I really like that I can arm it on my phone and watch from anywhere if necessary and or live steam it from my t.v.
 Works well, but adjustment screw on bracket needs to be re-tightened frequently
 Nothing but good to say about them, I have 5 inside , 2 outside cameras, so far
 seems to be working well.  Fairly easy to setup<br/>only had operational for a few days will be interesting to see how long the battery actual last
 Works great. Only thing lacking is speaker to talk through. Works as intended and no monthly fees!
 I’m obsessed with Blink cameras. I use almost a dozen and give me a great deal of comfort knowing what’s going on at home when I’m not there.
 Works great wish it came in white also for outdoors
 Easy nice system
 Nice
 GOOD:_Images &amp; videos  are fairly good. Easy to set up. Cheap &amp; simple. No contract.<br/>NOT GOOD:_Scheduling the camera on/off needs to be a bit more flexible and improved. Not just on/off. Mounting bracket is easily to snap off- need to be a bit more solid.
 I'm going to give it one more try and see if the battery life is better.  I didn't like how long it took for the notifications to arrive on my phone when there was movement.
 Best camera for the price.  Works exactly as advertised.  XLNT PRODUCT.
 The camera will send images, even during “live”feedback , that are up to two minutes delayed. If I wanted to know whether the person at my door is an intruder or my neighbor, I’d have to wait valuable minutes in waiting for the camera to notify me and show me the image. In addition, the app and feed will often crash.
 In less than a year the unit is not working properly.
 Stop working I bought five this is my 6 and it will not get back onto the Internet I am bummed about that
 Five stars for the camera, but the mount is unusable. The camera doesn't lock into the mount. It's a common complaint. (Search the customer reviews.)<br/>Update: After 18 days, the 2-year battery is dead.
 Loving it
 No complaints.  Gives a perfectly clear view.  Would recommend it.
 Less than a month after I purchased this went on sale for 40% off.  Don’t buy until it’s on sale.  What a rip off.  These are not worth full price, other products provide better resolution and flexibity and quality for the same price.
 Love these cameras, easy to use and set up!
 It would be more effective in both of my applications, to have the ability to speak once the camera is activated.  Being able to say "You're on camera" could halt a break in rather than watch it happen.
 I love my cameras. I was skeptical because of some of the other reviews. So far so good for me. I always love checking it. I have 3
 Great price, easy to install, very user friendly<br/>First system that I know of without any monthly fee.
 Very impressed. We've purchased several!
 I bought these for the security aspect, but have thoroughly enjoyed capturing the post bar entrance and checking in on my pup throughout the day.
 this is the first security camera I have purchased, the instructions were easy to follow and the cameras were easily installed.  good picture and a wide angle lens
 easy to install and inexpensive to operate.
 I like them, only wish the re-trigger time was less than 10 secs
 Was looking for low-cost, quality, easy way to view my vacation home. Blink is it! Had it going in less than 15m...Going to put some cameras on my primary home...like the systems very much. And really love how they do NOT lock you into monthly service fees!
 I bought two cameras when they were on sale and I'm very pleased with the product. It is exactly what they said it was. Very easy to set up and after a few adjustments to the cameras they are working very well. I will buy a few more when their on sale again.
 It appears to work as advertised.  I hope they develop an ap to view on my computer.
 Cameras malfunction frequently leaving opening for intruders.
 Won't connect to our wifi, the instructions are little bit confusing.<br/>I highly recommend you don't purchase this item, go with "Ring2"
 The Incredible Hulk could get past these.<br/><br/>With the system on and armed a contractor turned up at my house, parked in my driveway, opened the gate into my back yard and was walking around door 10 minutes before the system decided to trigger.<br/><br/>The system is set on mid sensitivity.  I tried setting it on a higher setting and the alerts are going off every few minutes, car noise driving down the street, bugs and birds flying making noise next to the camera and the wind moving the tree leaves.<br/><br/>The problem is the system cant distinguish between range and object size. If its set s a human moving at long range (50-60 ft)  will trigger it, a fly farting within 10 feet sets it off.
 I already have an indoor system and needed something for outside. I couldn’t pass up this deal either. When I got this, it was $20 cheaper than a stand alone camera. Blink is great!
 Not bad. App lacks a bit
 never works, always losing connections. completely unreliable. i want my money back.
 When viewing the camera footage the screen is green. Happens to cameras inside and outside. Constantly getting error or need authorization when accessing the app. WORST CAMERA EVER. Oh and you only have 30 days to test it out, after you can't return it.
 Can be placed anywhere and is nice and clear.
 Good spot on
 The rechargeable batteries didnt hold a charge at all.
 It is easy to install. Video and Audio quality is decent. Enjoying zero subscription charges. But I still feel expensive.
 Best quality and resolution by far!
 I’ve had the system for over a year now and I’m loving it. Works as advertised. No issues.
 So far so good
 Precise and clear coverge
 Batteries do not last 2 years !! I guess they would if you kept the system turned off most of the time . Ours lasted about 2 months and we just have them set for motion when we are gone
 Works well at detecting motion, almost too well. I have a lot of false triggers. Blink says they are working on it. Camera mount is cheap. Mount up and out of reach or someone may steal your camera.
 Great camera. Set up was so easy and worked perfect!
 Excellent product....  Happy with this purchase
 I have had the 2 Camera Blink XT for about two weeks.  They really work well.  Just wish there was an option for local storage of captured video's and more sturdy Camera mounts.
 Good quality picture. Easy to install. it was a great investment for such a small price
 You need to be able to talk out through the system, as you can with Nest and other systems. You can hear sound with Blink, but can’t speak through the cameras. That’s a big turn off, and a major bummer that it isn’t advertised that way.
 Easy to install and great results/protection!
 Has it’s problems  but overall good
 easy to set up
 Great way to monitor visitors or anyone...the camera images/sounds are clear and they we're very easy to install. Added bonus it works off your WiFi so no additional fees!
 Great product!!
 Great system. Love the ease of use and set up. Wish this had  rotate, zoom and / way audio.
 Very Impressed with the function of these camera's will purchase again
 The battery died fast
 Works great!  Gives us peace of mind when away from home.
 So far awesome
 Easy set up, great quality. My only problem is my battery died in one camera 3 months after being up.
 Perfect for front and backyard entrance. Motion detection sensitivity can be improved by providing coverage area for each set point. IR is so so
 Awesome best camera ever 👍👍👍
 These cameras are very good for the price, going to order two more for my back yard. Had them up for over a month now and had no issues.
 very pleases with the system, it delivers great pictures of the area surrounding our home
 Glad I purchased.
 Fantastic camera. Works perfectly. I want more
 Likes<br/>-I bought the single camera and it alerts me if anyone enters my front door...does a great job and stores clips for 1 year.<br/>-Inexpensive<br/>-Easy to setup<br/><br/>Dislikes<br/>-No Geofencing
 System installed and monitoring in half an hour, including outdoor mounting using stepladder (which was 10 min max).<br/>Sensitivity  and resolution are great and false triggers are non-existant, even in today's 50 MPH winds.
 This product is def worth it if you get it on sale.  It doesn't have a huge array of features but it does the job.  People that are complaining about the picture is prob due to user. The Blink XT is wicked easy to use.
 Works well. Buy the multi pack system when it shows up on special or sale. If u buy just the single camera system your going to want an add on camera. Which are kinda pricey. But they’re pretty good.
 Love this item it was really worth the price matter of fact I have 3, 2 outside and 1 inside
 nice
 Excellent product, easy to install and works as advertised.
 Like the camera so far. Would be nice to include a bit of two-way tape to mount, as not everybody has wood available for screw.
 Incredibly easy to install.  The sync router was very simple.  Cameras and entire system installed AND WORKNIG within 1 1/2 hours on a Sunday afternoon.  Software is easy to use.
 Perfect
 Awesome camera system! Same features as other cameras, but much less cost. I now have 15 cameras...will expand again later.
 Blink cameras are great, functional &amp; inexpensive. Highly recommended!
 Where do I begin with this camera... Initially, I had really high hopes for this product. I received the two camera system and it was easy to install and setup. But that's about where all the good things end. These cameras DO NOT WORK CORRECTLY. I live in Arizona and I am not sure if it's the heat (could be) or whatever, but I'm sick of dealing with these cameras. The image is pink and about 40% of the time the camera does not record when triggered (see images). To be fair, they might work fine indoors, but good luck using them outside in the weather.<br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Blink-XT-Home-Security-Camera-System-with-Motion-Detection-Wall-Mount-HD-Video-2-Year-Battery-Life-and-Cloud-Storage-Included-2-Camera-Kit/dp/B0731NM58C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Blink XT Home Security Camera System with Motion Detection, Wall Mount, HD Video, 2-Year Battery Life and Cloud Storage Included - 2 Camera Kit</a><br/>Save yourself the trouble and buy yourself an Amcrest or something more reliable. The only thing that drew me to this camera was the fact that it was truly Wireless, but honestly, it's not worth the money nor the hassle. What a piece of junk and a waste of money! Buyer beware, you have been warned!
 I use other blink devices.  This once received was rebuilt and doesn't work as well.  Gets lots of 'offline' messages compared to past devices.
 Nice product.
 I am loving this system.  It is perfect for checking outside and seeing if someone is coming.  It is not the absolute best quality in the world but it does the job well and it is nice being able to see it immediately on your phone.
 Excelente
 Blink XT Home Security Camera System with... works just like it advertises , ty
 Nice product, very good seller.
 Easy to use and set up. Only thing I wished that was better is the mounts to place the camera on. They could have done better there. Can't wait for the doorbell to come out. That will be my next purchase.
 Best deal out there. Wireless, painless, easy!
 excellent wire free camera. Easy to set up and very clear picture
 This is a wonderful way to keep track of who is coming to my front door.  (Except for the cat that visits every night at 3:00 a.m.!)
 Good price and works fairly well. It does go off line periodically.
 Easy setup
 Easy to connect. Exactly picture and sound quality and video clips work great
 Have had the XT set up for a few days now and it is great. Easy to set up, great video and alerts sent to my phone. Really like that it is wireless and battery life is supposed to be 2 years. Amazon is great also, 2 day delivery with prime. I would recommend them and Blink to anyone.
 Activity zones(motion detection) is far worse than my other two brands of camera. Nice feature is that it runs on batteries.
 I like it.  Would be better if had option add an SD card. Also, the location of the charging port is odd. I can't have it connected with the stand.
 Oh my gosh...I love Blink
 I had this for two weeks the worked great and batters went dead n It wont work anymore. It wont connect or anything I have not tryed to contact seller because I have not have time in one day as it is but I wish I could get this situation fixed
 Love this Camera!! Excellent quality!!
 The best security camera
 Battery only lasted around 3 months. Camera was on my back porch pointing at my carport. Not a high traffic area. I am no longer using the camera, I won't keep replacing expensive lithium batteries that it requires every few months.
 I have 7  blink infoor/ outdoor camera. The batery will not last for two years as the company said. Maybe last for two months. Sometime there is no connection to the sync module.  I have to keep reseting. The company does not giving out the phone number so peoole can not call them in case people want to ask for immediate help.
 Night vision stopped working after a few days, doesn't always pick up motion, has few glitches. Ok for the price I guess
 👍
 Love this product. I am a little addicted because they work so well.
 So far, it is working for the intended purpose
 these cameras have all worked great for me, motion always activates, even when i wish it wouldn't sometimes, lol...
 I purchased the regular Blink home security system a few months ago. We love it and wanted to add outdoor cameras. This add on is awesome.
 Excellent product for the price bracket. Easy to set up and install, video and audio quality is good.
 I have two at my cabin that have been rock solid.  Extremely easy to setup, great video quality, and completely wireless!
 Great Wireless security camera system. Even works with IFTTT for Auto arming when your phone is not detected and Auto disarming when it is detected. So you never forget to turn it on when you leave.
 I’m so happy I can see my dogs all day
 One camera stop recording, then the Sync Module will not connect after removing it and try to add it again. Will have to spend time with Tech Support, regret purchasing this product.
 like it. lets me know when some one comes in
 Love these cameras. Very easy to install and setup.
 Great product
 great addition to my blink system. Easy to install
 Pretty cool and very easy
 Like the ease of use. Clarity and cost. Will purchase again.
 Set up was really easy and they send you an email with a lot of really good information on the settings.  The video and audio was also decent.
 easy to setup great quality video great value for the money
 Great camera works well outside
 good sound and picture will be buying more add on cameras soon.my family will also be buying.
 ...is because of how fast the batteries die! My batteries last only about a month or so. I have messed with the settings and everything. Other than that, the device and features are awesome. I love my system.
 If you need customer service forget it. The phone support do not know anything about blink cameras. Can’t even hardly even understand them.
 I originally bought Ring for surveillance camera and its a solid product as well. But I prefer Blink because I do not have to do a monthly subscription. I like how it records movements which are the most relevant recordings I need to see.
 Love love love all u need to know great investment
 My second add on outdoor camera. Works great!
 Great camera so far ! Hope it work great forever .
 Great
 quick and easy install. It just works
 Works great
 So far pretty awesome. For a cheap camera,  works great!
 The ease of installation was nice and the cameras work very good as well.  I was surprised at the WiFi connection range. But wondering if the battery life is really 2 years.
 Love the blink, using at our vacation home, good picture quality and easy to install/use.
 These cameras work very well and are easy to set up. I like being able to control them and view the clips and live footage from my home when I am away.
 I would give this a 5 star rating if they added the ability to record when live viewing and ability to snap a picture when live viewing. It is very simple to install and add more cameras.
 Love these cameras
 I set this up at my front door and it works great. Easy setup and it hooked up to my phone with no problem
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R12PAMOV7OWE04"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A15QF9o34zS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NFVUDkVsS.png"/> These cameras are best bang for buck.only thing is your wife can see when you do fun things outside why she is at work
 Great system does exactly what I want , very cheap camera mount though started out with two cameras added a third during Amazon days
 Cannot get sync to work.  On line help cannot solve the problem.  I think I got a bad sync box.  Product is worthless at this time
 Highly recommended security camera, no monthly fee and high definition. Smart way to buy it.
 Motion detector with push notifications
 good
 Nice and it does what it claims! Buy it!
 Great camera for home security. The batteries showed low when it got to -25 but then showed ok when the temp guy back up to 0. Great resolution and view. Was hoping for a wider view but you would have to get a fish eye and I don’t like those. All in all a great purchase and you won’t be disappointed. The software works great
 Spend the extra money on an Arlo...great theory, simple design, easy set up but could only get live view to work, won’t record clips or take thumbnails, advertised as 100’ range which is why I bought it...cameras don’t work past 30’...irritated...returning
 Works ok but sensitivity is an issue and it takes so long to start recording that if I get out of my car right away sometimes it only catches me just walking into the garage.
 Piece of crap had it installed for less than 2 weeks battery dead when supposed to last 2 years.
 Fairly easy install but batteries went dead after 20 minutes of using it.. not a great experience out of the gate as now I have to pay another $8.50 for batteries and hope it lasts longer. The mount is very flimsy so I’m a bit concerned about that.
 Great security camera with a super easy installation and setup. I do wish that they would add a speaker to the camera so you could talk back to someone at the door like other amazon products such as “ring.”
 The app is easy to install and the cameras are easy to install
 Trouble setting up because device had to be updated by customer service. Over decent product for the money.
 They work as described, so far it has been a great addition to our over all security systems.
 I live in east central Minnesota and installed this in November and it works in cold temps. Today is -24 F and it is working perfectly.
 So far love these cameras, good option to the more expensive brands that basically do the same thing.  Expanded to a few more cameras and that process was seamless.
 Works great!
 Its really a bummer when a camera is advertised as 2 yr battery life span but in the real world this lasted me under 3 weeks. I'm guessing that it last 2 yrs if it dose not record any videos. VERY POOR BATTERY LIFE AND ADVERTISEMENT
 This camera has great vision through the day and picks up almost every motion but night vision needs a lot of improvement. Simple to set up and use the app.
 AMAZING!! great video, great app!! Easy to use, navigate and inexpensive!!
 Works Great
 Great spy tool for home security.
 Love it
 Doesn't always work
 Not very clear detail. Can’t see faces even if enlarging frames.
 Works great but could be better with speaker.
 Poor quality pictures and long delay lag at motion detection. Live means 10 minutes earlier. It only works if I'm less than 30' from my modem
 Blink XT system works just as we expected. Nice to have the cameras to see who is coming by the doors. It certainly does not replace a security system but adds to a sense of knowing what is happening in the area surrounding the house. Also was easy to set up.
 feel very safe.
 I have 5 of these cameras,,  these cameras work so great ,, so easy to get them hooked.  Been 9 months so far and still on same batteries
 Two of 5 cameras, inoperative after 2 months in service.
 Easy to hook up and great camera.
 I have had it for a week and have had to reboot every day...support  is a joke, they read back the instuctions in the box
 Purchased as a gift for my parents. They love it. Install was easy, they bought add on cameras because they loved it so much.
 Pretty much as advertised. I like it quite a bit except the range that you have to be from both your Wi-Fi and  The camera module is kind of short. But other than that it’s pretty nice
 I bought the product because I loved the idea of being completely wireless. Product worked great when we first purchased them. However, ever since Amazon bought Blink the app.continually crashes,.live feeds rarely work, and no improvements have been made to the app. I would recommend looking for another product where they are committed to updating the app platform.
 Works great.
 Great value and added another camera to my curent property. You can add up to 10 cameras on the system.
 I put this in my bluebird house. Works great. Now I can watch the activity inside the nest box.
 It works well and was easy to configure.  However, the 2 year battery in my case was only 3 months and it is already alerting to replace the batteries.
 This camera is awesome!  The picture is great. You can hear they the camera as well. Night images are good as well. Very happy!  Love that I didn’t have to subscribe to any kind of storage system!
 Very happy with this product.  Was very easy to get set up and connected to my wireless.  Images are of good quality.
 Sometimes works, most of the times doesnt. It's the worst camera I have ever purchased. I have the DLINK cameras and even with the low resolution they work much better, also I had some tplink cameras and they did the trick. This was an incredible idea, bad product.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>UPDATE 10/13/207<br/><br/>I decided to give it another try, after resetting the module and the camera, I could not add the camera, it showed my an error that said that the camera was already registered. I almost threw the camera through the window, I'm glad I didn't. I contacted technical support, and they help me to "clear" the registration of the camera from the previous setup, so I installed everything again and put the camera outside.<br/><br/>To my surprise it has been working much better than before, I little more reliable I don't know if they made an upgrade or something but it's much better. The camera is far from perfect, but I can't complain that much, it's working better for me and the motion sensor is detecting much better than before 8/10 works fine.<br/><br/>Also I have not changed the batteries since my original purchase and it has been running fine from 1.5 months<br/><br/>I gotta say, that now I do recommend the camera, if you are willing to sacrifice a little bit of functionality, the great thing about this camera is that it can go anywhere, I even attached it to my dog, just for fun to take a few clips and see what he was looking at while I was away, I got some blurry footage of a widgeon escaping from him.
 Just what I ordered. Works great with my other Blink system I already have.
 Love the system, works!!
 Love this!
 Does a great job! I will be buying more.
 Great home camera system. Has really good picture quality and clarity.
 My Blink device will not work, I spent an hour on the phone with technical support and they said my module is was not working properly. I literally had it for 1 hour. They sent me new one free of charge and the same thing happened! So frustrating.
 Great!<br/>Super easy to place and works great!
 Neither camera will transmit live video even while next to sync module.  One camera 2 bars less sync signal than the other, from identical locations. Blink needs to at least replace one camera since this appears to be a quality control issue. Blink, please advise.
 Works well - as advertised. Love the free cloud storage. Would be nice to get a live feed from all cameras at once. Also wish the sync module was a little heavier/sturdier.
 Works great,  very easy to set up and use!
 item arrived in a timely manner and was as described
 I'm so disappointed i can't even put it into words.
 Camera is easy to install, records well, and had audio. The sensitivity seeing could use some improvement.
 Good camera but batteries dead already
 Product worked fine for two weeks. Then the cameras stopped working. Customer service is TERRIBLE.
 Every once in a while it doesn’t catch movement. Like a car pulling into the garage. Other than that I love it
 Super clear video quality with a wide angle of sight.  Really easy to setup.  My only issue was that one of the cameras quit sending videos for some reason.  Had to delete and reinstall the camera, but has worked fine since.  Great cameras.
 Great product! We love checking from our phone.
 This works great and it does it with no wires!! Love it!!
 Wonderful cameras for a great price. Great quality, sound is great, and nighttime vision is great. We purchased additional brackets to install with them.
 Very dissatisfied. Camera will not trigger a motion event even when standing in front of the camera and waving my hand in front of it. What a waste of $$$.
 Excellent item works great
 The batteries died in a weekend, the camera after replacing the batteries didn't work with the app and the quality itself was poor
 Love them have bought lots
 This is a really great camera system. I highly recommended. I originally only had two, now we have four all together to cover the whole house. Peace at mind while you're away.
 Easy to use and put where you want.
 Great quality, video, audio &amp; easy to use app is perfect! We will be buying more.
 Easy to install, easy to use. Love it!!
 I liked, very good image, sensor works well
 Everyday these things impress me more and more.  For the price i dont see how you could find a better option, easy to program and new features are frequently added to the app making it better and easier to use.
 works well with my iPhone. The contrast is somewhat poor when a strong light is present (sun). Sound is good. System is reliable.
 Low quality and lagging. Except for that the camera itself is really nice and light.
 I just got two camera set up for outside security, read instruction been using as recommended by directions and on line info provided by Blink, noticed that it said battery's last for 2 years, I dont have for a month and battery's are already dead, thanks Blink????,
 We love ours, it makes us feel safe.
 Great camera, the picture quality is clear and it was easy to install. However, I would suggest purchasing another mounting device because the one it comes with is really cheap. It doesn’t hold the camera in place.
 Absolutely LOVE this system! Very easy to install and setup. This system is actually more than I expected. Once installed, works flawlessly. Loved it so much, bought two more.
 Works great.
 works for our needs
 Love this sleek camera. Very handy. I can put it any part of my house without any wire or power cable.<br/>The one I dislike is not able to zoom it and the higher cost.<br/>Overall, it is still a good camera.
 I tried the Reolink Argus cameras first, after receiving two faulty units I decided to give Blink a try.<br/>These cameras have been very reliable since setting up a few weeks ago and they were simple to set up. I’m using these in a remote area with a cellular hotspot, all running off solar panels with a battery bank. The night vision is impressive, even when left on the medium intensity setting. If the batteries last ¼ of the advertised two years, I’ll be happy.<br/><br/>My main gripe is the mounting brackets. I’m sure they would work fine indoors, but any little bump from a squirrel or bird will knock the camera out of adjustment. I’ll have to have to get creative with reinforcing the mounts. Also, these work with Android/iOS only, no web viewer available at this time. Using a mobile device, I don’t think there’s any way to save still images or view them full screen, but video clips can be downloaded to your device or emailed to others. The free online video storage is a nice feature.
 Best home video system on the market.  Easy to set up easy to control from phone.
 Love the camera I like to see it with a siren and a two way talk kinda like the ring but overall it is a great camera at least you can see and hear whose out there and the quality of the picture recorded is great !
 I paid $120 for the camera and it lasted 4 1/2 months, what is  worse is that I email the rep and they didn't even had the courtesy of replying.<br/>Never again. Live and learn
 Love this product
 Great wireless system that is easy to install and easy to use.
 Easy to use. Great resolution.
 Do work at all temps. Sometimes cameras disconnect from network and have to remove batteries to reset.
 Easy set up and installation!  Works well!
 Easy to install
 I have 3 Blink XT they are  Great
 Very simple to setup. Works great.
 So far works great!
 Bought 6 Blink XT home security cameras. Two of them only lasted 6 months.
 It's a great affordable product, that does exactly what it states, I love it. I feel safe having these cameras up. The motion detection is so sensitive it alerts my phone when squirrels go by.
 Video quality is great. Will definitely add more cameras in the future.
 I like it, for what I need it for, it does the job.
 easy to install
 Easy to install and works like it is supposed to.
 Flimsy mount. Doesn’t come with power supply. Less then a sharp picture.
 I like the video camera, and it's operation. My dislike is it does not seem to take much pressure to make the camera break and fall to the ground. The mount does not feel very sturdy. I think that needs some attention.
 Clear picture
 Simple to setup and no monthly fees. Battery life is more like 2 months in high traffic areas. The included mount is pretty flimsy and I was afraid the camera would fall. I bought a 3rd party mount that enclosed the camera.
 Let’s you know when your little dogs are at the door and ready to come back inside
 Overall a very good product. I don't think the factory mount was good enough so I bought the metal mounts which gives me more adjustability. I like that I don't have to pay to store video.
 Purchasing another set for a family member.  These work as expected, just still disappointed they haven't brought out a doorbell camera setup and doesn't sound like it's in the near future.  Boo.
 Works great so far.
 Plan on buying a third party mount as the mount it comes with is cheap garbage.
 I swear I could work for this company! These cameras are amazing!
 Nd. To provide better outside attachments for units
 Great product.
 It’s small enough to fit anywhere. One battery lasts a long time without changing often. Mines been going for about a year now which is great. Free cloud storage for the recorded videos makes it awesome and affordable.
 Not easy to use
 Love how I can move them wherever I want
 Easy to set up. Great quality video and pictures.  Love the Nighttime feature.
 works like a champ
 Cannot connect to most TV's 0nly android and tablets.
 It worked awesome for 2 months,then went cyco,I'm still tryen to get it fixed
 Great camera to keep an eye on things remotely day or night as part of my home security system.
 Works great camera security system.
 Does a great job for the price! HD photos and images and it can go anywhere. Very easy to set up and install as well!
 I only have two problems with the camera. One: no two way communication. Two: the camera does not lock into the mounting device securely.  Even with the o rings the camera falls easily. Very poor engineering.  Please come up with a fix for this.
 I love this. We are able to have the protection without having to pay any monthly fees. We can keep and save whatever  videos/pictures we want from the cameras. I will upload pictures/videos at a later date.
 loved them
 Can you please work on the Activity zone feature in a bate version does not drink at all it needs a updates.
 this is just what is advertise, it works perfectly, it alerts you when new video<br/>motion happens, its easily to access, in all a great product and fair price.
 These cameras are crystal clear,  pick up all sound and react instantly to motion! They send the video clips right to your phone.  Super user friendly and easy to install!
 Great cameras.  Easy to install.
 Took only 10 min to install both cameras<br/>And get apps on phones set up.  Very easy to adjust sensitivity levels as well.  Great purchase
 Working great so far, no issues
 Like having eyes where ever you have a camera Great picture
 Went on a long vacation and wanted to keep an eye on the house.  Getting the Blink outdoor camera was the best idea ever after getting the system in the first place!
 Easy to install.  A little quirky using the app.  But works ok.
 Works well in the daytime, picture quality at night disappointing. Very easy to use.
 I use these as baby monitors- love them!
 Working great so far...
 The night vision did not work, completely blurry. Tech support was great and immediately helped us problem solve the issue (on Christmas Night). It ended up being defective and a new camera is being sent.
 Works as advertised
 Good,product but hard to set up.
 This system is amazing....wonderful photo and video
 Excellent product ,it works fine ! I would recommended to any one .
 Ease of installation was excellent and ease of use is perfect. Just wish it had a 2-second pre-record and the ability to record live view. This is definitely well-worth the purchase price.
 Easy install. Easy to use. Notifies me within seconds of someone walking up to my door. It’s faster than our two dogs!
 For the price, I was a bit skeptical about how the quality would be.  Pleasantly surprised by the picture quality and ease of use. Very good product.  I'm a satisfied customer
 Works great!!!
 Nice good picture
 Good Product
 2 year battery life is a joke, not sure what scenario they envision the lifespan lasting that long but I’m guessing most of you won’t see it. That said, it’s a good image, the app is easy to use and serves its purpose. I’ve changed the batts on one already and haven’t had it 6 months yet.
 I liked it until the camera didn’t show color anymore. It’s black and white. Would like faster view time when doing live view.
 Works great (two months)-good tech help.
 I love the ease of installation; no power wire to worry about. Can't get the IFTT applet to arm and disarm it, but text notifications work so it's OK
 Got this product Jan 9th hasn’t even been 2 months and we have had to replace the batteries after just one month and now at 2 months the whole system isn’t working at all. And of course don’t even have a way to contact someone.
 Wireless, reasonable investment easy install and works as advertised, what more would you want. If you are expected a CCTV system, with a HDVR buy that system. If you want ease of install, a good app for your media, this is it.
 We have been using the Blink camera for about two months now outside of our home.  We have it mounted on a light pole to view the construction near our home and to view the front of our home.  We live in a very cold climate and have had the temperature dip down to 1 degree (F) and the camera worked great.  The app for the device works nicely and provides notification of movement and is easy to configure.<br/><br/>We are still using the original batteries that shipped with the camera and the app is still showing an "OK" status on the batteries.  We have the camera about 90 feet from the nearest WiFi access point and it works great.  We have the hub about 40-50 feet from the unit and it runs like a champ.<br/><br/>The quality of the images and video are much better than I thought they would be for a camera that is so small.<br/><br/>I would make one recommendation for the app and that is to allow pinch-zoom to zoom in on the video while watching it.
 Easy set up and fantastic functionality.
 Works well easy to install
 Less than 7 days up and busted someone trying to break in our cars.  Able to share video to the police with 2 clicks.
 This product is terrible. It continues to disconnect and you constantly have to fix it.  A security camera should not be this much of a problem.  I just bought and installed the ring doorbell and it is worth every penny.
 Great camera. Very easy to set up. Great resolution.
 Very easy to install and setup, had a problem with the sync module during install but after a email another one mailed to us and the system works great. We are looking to buy 4 more units as its the best system on the market.
 Blink is a great inexpensive security solution
 Should have returned a long time ago. Doesn't always detect motion even on a higher sensitivity setting, new batteries and multiple reboots. Customer service was no help.
 I found the system easy to set up. The sync module connected right away. My phone downloaded the app with no problems. After setup and a few tests it was ready for action. I received a notice on my phone when out of state that someone had entered the property. It provided clear video with sound of the intruder. For the price its A+.<br/>Big Al
 Great quality and great video
 Nice to be able to control zones.
 States battery life lasts 2 years. Lasts 2-3 months with lowest trigger settings. They don't work well in the cold (10 °f or below) they click constantly when that cold and use all battery life.
 I enjoy my blink cameras. The only thing is i wish i could set each one on differnt timers.
 Easy to install/use.  It needs to have access from online other than cell phone app.
 I love this device. I use it at my home and at some rental properties. I can access it anytime and go directly to the activity only. I will purchase more if needed.
 very nice
 We bought 2 cameras and they are so easy to set up and to operate. You can adjust the settings to fit your specific needs. Will be purchasing 2 more additional cameras in the near future.
 Good camera, but returned it because WYZE cameras are much less expensive and same quality. Only pro about Blink is that is wireless. Other than that you can get 3 WYZE cameras for the price of 1 Blink.
 Pro: Easy setup, user friendly app, affordable, good audio/video quality.<br/><br/>Con: The mounting materials that come with the cameras is very poor and limited functionality. Order additional brackets.
 After retiring in the cctv systems business(30+years) this camera might have me going back to work. The ease of installation , the quality of the camera , is unbelievable for the price.
 Too difficult to set up
 Very nice device! Works flawlessly and very easy to install. I will purchase more.
 Bought this for my front door area.  Works awesome, easy install.  No issue with the batteries as of yet.
 Great product but when it’s raining stops working .
 Camera works great. Battery lasts 3-6 months not the full 2 years they say.
 Great price, great video, great options. I already bought another system for another property.
 Works great easy installation!
 Surpassed my expectations with the camera and setup. Great product. Mounting system could be better or should I say stronger.
 Bought one camera about two months ago.  Very pleased on how it works ordering another one today. If I had ordered both at same time would have saved a few bucks.  Any way worth the price.  Highly recommend the cameras.
 I get updates on every movement that happens around my house in real time.  I even know my wife is home before the door opens
 Cameras are unique
 Only complaint is that I can’t see my cameras with my Alexa devices or Fire TV cube. I have to use my phone.
 Works just the way it’s described. You can adjust how long it records for in the app. This gives me more peace of mind when I’m not home.
 Works great
 Great product! Easy to install and works great!
 Easy to use, setup, with a clear picture. Best feature is live mode using your phone.
 Great price and no monthly fees.  Works well, but I wish I could see it on my computer.
 just what i needed, easy install
 Does not work with wifi which needs login through webpage
 The video quality is great, you can sync it with your phone like everything else, it’s a great product.
 Video quality is decent and cannot beat the price and the cloud storage. Will purchase a few more for indoor use.
 Does what its supposed to do. Get notifications all day from the cats lol but it's cool. Catches every little motion which is good
 Love this easy camera solution. It works for exactly what I want it for to keep tabs on my front door and driveway.
 Night vision is not great in photo
 Killing my battery daily. Bought battery from amazon and it dies in a few days. Something is a lemon.
 Easy to use and install. Good resolution and excellent control setting options. I especially like the zoning feature.
 Works amazingly day and night.

 Realmente espectacular
 Great camera system without the need for wiring. My experience with the Blink customer service was excellent.
 Works great!
 I like everything about this item except the wall mount bracket . I would have liked it to be more sturdy. I am concerned a strong wind might knock it down.
 Good product, took sometime getting used to and finding the right settings but it's worth it.
 Sincerely, this system is unchallenged for what you get for the price. Only thing I want to be able to do is view them on my pc. Other than that flawless!
 Awesome little product. Does have a few glitches and as easy as it should be to live view but it’s good for receiving notifications for movement.
 Easy to set up specially easy to use
 Great product. Excellent resolution and reaction time at a fraction of the cost compared to other systems. They also continuously push out new updates to better the system
 Extremely easy to set up, quality looks good, overall the cameras are really good!
 What an amazing product, I have definitely added a layer of security to my home with this purchase. I cannot wait for the Blink Doorbell product to be released, such an excellent product!
 The sync module doesn’t work and the 24/7 help line is only a voicemail. Lies and garbage. Buy something else. Don’t trust an Amazon product.
 Great device!
 It is so convenience and easy to connect. It is also so clear during day and night. Work with cold weather and or lower temperature. Would like to be able to record/reward. Will recommend this item.
 Easy to install and connect to echo spot. Video quality is perfect.
 It’s a great camera. The only issue I have is that it doesn’t want to work lately at night. Usually between 6pm - 7:30am it tells me “live view failed” it didn’t do that before. Just the last few days.
 Horrible. Second unit and it still doesn’t motion detect. App has to be open and I have to shut off and turn on motion detection just to capture one video. App freezes the camera and doesn’t allow me to view area.
 Good camera system
 Excellent
 Work great
 way overpriced for what you get. 90% of the time it doesn’t record when you have it set on motion detection you can’t access live view and you have to constantly reset the the system
 Easy to use and install. We love the BlinkXT and feel much safer being able to see who comes and goes from our front porch when we are not home.
 has To be very close to router in order to work which makes it worthless if you want to use around your home
 Ok
 Simple, easy to install and function as part of security system
 I was hoping that the unit will work by just using a smartphone but still required a modem n router.:(
 Fantastic
 Haven't even had it up a week and it has already stopped recording.  It does however let me run live feed.  I will contact Amazon and see what they can do about it.  Otherwise it's probably JUNK!
 Really easy to set up and use. I think I was viewing it within 20 min of opening the box up
 Bought the unit did not come with two outside brackets. Have to keep resetting them. Will lose connection. I will be sending them back!
 easy to install and works great
 Fast Shipping, excellent product and item as described.
 I bought this camera to put on my garage to to see who is coming and going from my house. It will not pick up a vehicle or person walking straight at it. If you walk across in front of it, it will take a video every time.
 Easy to install
 This product does as advertised, BUT, the motion detection is very limited, I am lucky to get it to work 6 feet from the camera.
 Item stated that it came with wall mounts!<br/>It had none. I don’t want to return the item just need the wall mounts so I guess this is a gimmick to get you to buy it and then you have to buy the stupid mounts! Beware ...
 Quick easy set up. No wires to deal with. Exactly what I was looking for.
 Great product and fast shipping!
 Won’t stay online even though we’ve recently<br/>Upgraded our internet. Captures a leaf blowing but not an animal or human on our patio.  Completely disappointed.
 i love it
 Gift Christmas.<br/>It is Loved. I ordered an additional unit<br/>For Birthday in January! Couldn’t be happier!
 Works great for the price...
 Works as expected
 Liked how easy it was to setup
 Just installed my system. Easy installation &amp; it works great!!
 Keot dropping wifi, worked great inside, but not outside
 My 4th purchase of s blink product. Need I say more?
 Very good for video notifications and alerts. I installed 2 in my outhouse. Not good for a live video.
 The battery was dead. Terrible only 1 month function
 bought a blink XT.  Set it up as described but the camera would not connect. Tried to call for support but was put on terminal hold.  I am going to return it.  I can't deal with this.  I have multiple Nest cameras and while more expensive, have never had a problem with them.  Gonna buy a nest again.  I tried!
 Work great
 Big delay on the cameras. Whenever I lose power it’s a hassle to re sync the system.
 Very good cameras.
 For the price we’re happy with it.  Ton of notifications between the 2 cameras but we don’t mind, they’re easy to ignore.
 great product
 Easy install, setup and great camera
 Easy to setup and install. Works better than  my neighbors security system cameras that he pays $30+ a month for ! He is now going to get the blink!
 Camera night vision is not quite what I expected. However I would sure like to see PC access such as what Nest camera's provide. I have nest on doorbell and enjoy the PC access home and away.
 I have Blink camera systems on both of our houses, they work well most of the time. I would recommend them to anyone with wifi at home. I wish it had a talk back feature tho, the sound is very good on them.
 By far the best security camera on the market. Easy to set up, portable (no wiring) and the batteries last up to two years. Honestly if you get anything else you’ll end up regretting it.
 Very compact and easy to set. The only cons are if you and another person  cannot play the cameras at the sametime to watch  and if putting outside canneras the are sensitive to recording sensitive to wind.
 Great camera s &amp; tech support !
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-REFTFWSQIMTSB"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/914WsmnttES.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mKPa6-fYS.png"/> 2 years battery life? Not even close.<br/>3 weeks!
 Really like the clarity and the notifications. We feel very safe.  Our yard can be like animal kingdom so now we can see before we let pur dog out.
 I dislike the sound sensitivity can't be set independent of motion sensitivity. Loud cars kept setting the camera off. So had to turn of sound to avoid reducing motion detection range to stop false alarms.
 Works perfectly. Once I found the sweet spot for the blink hub to my router to the camera it's flawless
 We set this camera up to provide security at our front door. We’re still trying to decide the best position to aim the camera so it isn’t triggered by passing vehicles, but the camera works just as we hoped.
 Low cost, easy to sync and setup. Like the phone alert when motion detect activated. I walk in the house with headphones on and this system alerts me when some one enters the propery.
 Bought this for my parents new home for Christmas and they LOVE it!
 Best wireless system on the market. I have sold 3 other homeowners on purchasing these cameras.
 So far so good. I like the quality of the picture and also the sound. The app it is very easy to use.
 Easy to use and manage
 First off, ordering directly from blink would have meant an extra $10 shipping and would have taken about a week. This was not only cheaper but here the next day.<br/>Setup was easy and after updating was up and running pretty quickly. The quality of the camera is not the best in existence but is still very impressive especially given its size and that it is running on 2 AA batteries. In our testing so far it has triggered every single time and doesn't have the motion blur our cheaper camera had. Night vision is actually very impressive and can make out a lot of detail. This camera was very well thought out even including an option to disable the bright blue "recording" light. There will still be a dim red light which cannot be turned off but that is ok for our use. This camera is also very customizable you can set schedules, play with the infrared, choose a better or lower quality, increase length of the clip recorded, and change the timeout between recordings. It can be controlled remotely or viewed live for 30 seconds at a time because it is after all battery powered. Notifications are quick and its a breeze to share them with someone. The only issues we've had so far are that it doesn't activate right away and depending on how fast you are walking you can be already in the door with the door closed before it starts recording. This could be a setting I need to change and if anyone reads this and knows the solution please add a comment below for me.<br/>I would recommend this to anyone renting an apartment or townhouse that feels they need security or even to any home owners that don't want to deal with wires. I would however recommend anyone needing full time recording to a different system such as nest or amazon cloud cam or a wired system because they battery life will not last very long if you change the settings to max or use it in a very active area without using schedules.<br/>Also, bear in mind this does need wifi to function and if the power goes down, or wifi goes down this camera is a paperweight until both are restored. Just something to bear in mind.
 Wow. I am really impressed with this system. When I first started looking I was afraid of the price tag that came with a quality system. With Blink I get the best of both worlds, quality system at a great price.
 Very easy to set up, good quality, simple to use, perfect low cost security product
 Works great. Great value. Fast service!
 Arrived promptly and safely. Physical installation was pretty easy. However I give points off for the flimsy mount (only one screw) and flimsy attachment. I can totally see someone entering from out of camera range, making a dash for the cameras, jumping, pulling them down and tossing them out of range. Weakest link in the system. (updated, see below)<br/><br/>Everything was easy about setting up the system except stage 2. I couldn't remember my home WiFi password and every time I had to go all the way to the beginning, unplug the module and start all over again. I should have been able to just put in a different password and continue from there. this added 50% on to the time it took for me to set up.<br/><br/>The mount bracket and attachment is a hardware issue. But the other is software programming and should be easy to resolve.<br/><br/>The cameras have been very easy to monitor from my phone. The only thing I would like is to have the motion detector come on sooner. It doesn't pick up the mailman until he is on the porch. I'd like him from the time he comes in the gate. Once on the porch his hat obscures his face. To see a face I need the camera to start from the time someone enters the gate. I will keep tweaking the system until I can get it to do what I need but so far, I am very pleased.<br/><br/>Update:<br/><br/>I've purchased the <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Blink-XT-Camera-Wall-Mount-Bracket-Weather-Proof-360-Degree-Protective-Adjustable-Indoor-Outdoor-Mount-and-Cover-for-Blink-XT-Outdoor-Camera-Security-System-AntiSun-Glare-UV-Protection-Black-3-Pack/dp/B07CNZ2TQT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Blink XT Camera Wall Mount Bracket ,Weather Proof 360 Degree Protective Adjustable Indoor Outdoor Mount and Cover for Blink XT Outdoor Camera Security System AntiSun Glare UV Protection(Black(3 Pack))</a> and it is fabulous! This should have been included in the original set. Rather than pay $25 for the extra silicon covers an extra $10 gets me a secure cover and mount. I purchased a set of three mounts so I will be buying a third Blink XT camera for the garage now that I have a secure way to mount the camera on the garage facing the alley.
 This is my first security system. I really like them. Easy to install and get going. About an hour all together. Plus i like that they take normal batteries. This is a 3 month review.
 Great product, however,  lacks two way audio capability.
 I like that each phone in our home can read and control its function however the coverage is very limited requiring multiple Cameras. Buying multiple blinks then gets too expensive.
 product for the most part is good. make sure you have good wifi or cameras may not work all the time. does not have night vision. picture and sound is good quality. not bad for the price
 Highly recommend! Very easy to setup and use. There are mounts come with the package, they works great! Auto take video and sent notification whenever my package arrived.
 The camera worked fine and was easy to setup.  They battery life is another store.  They only laser 2.5 months  Not happy!
 I placed the order with the echo dot that was supposed to come with it and when it arrived today the only thing in the box was the cameras. Not to happy with that.
 Love it easy to set up I have not had to worry about the battery yet. I will probably order a cover for it when it rains it distorts the picture.
 Flaky. When they work they are great! But get used to seeing the "failed" messages...
 Works great, I have used over a year now. Batteries are maintaining well. No wires is a plus and system can easily be armed and disarmed while away. I would highly recommend this product.
 Easy to use,  links quick on my phone not bad for the price
 Great systems! No regrets in purchasing these!!!
 The only thing I do not like is that the cameras make like a switching noise when trying to comunicate
 Easy to set up and great very satisfied
 I love my "Blink"!!
 Perfect
 Excellent quality easy set up
 2 years battery life what just happened here i got robbed or what the battery stayed for 5 days then it stopped iam super disappointed i need a full refund on my order as sson as possible so disappointed
 Love this system! Easy to setup and works extremely well! Motion detection range is great, IR Illuminator works great too.
 We love these camera's! They are everything we wanted and so much more comfortable knowing we have them now. Easy set up, easy notification settings too.
 I’m very happy with the purchase. The unit works well out of the box and records somewhat clear video. Faces are not clear in night vision mode.
 Absolutely HORRIBLE camera. A complete and total let down. Security???? Not at all. Wanna be alerted by a squirrel? ALL DAY LONG. Do NOT buy this piece of crap if you have a good reason to actually need a security camera.
 Great
 Ease of installation and internet/phone app connections
 Such a great system!  No worries and the batteries lost a long time. Most inexpensive security system!  Love it!
 Does NOT come with camera!!  I only received the synch module.  Even looked like an open item.  BOGUS!!
 Awesome customer support &amp; good product so far.
 I'm not a fan of these cameras. the night vision is awful. you cant zoom in and make out anything, even in the daytime videos... my neighbor's trailer was stolen 2 nights ago and all the video's were useless.
 Installed in minutes and the setup was so easy.  Camera works fantastic.  Better than expected.
 Wish it just had flash.
 Great product!  I set up all five cameras in about 30 minutes.  Less than six hours later we caught someone breaking into our business. So glad we made the purchase!
 Easy to set up and work well.  Gives notifications when there's motion.  No complaints so far.<br/><br/>I did have to change the name of my wifi extender during set up, but that was the only issue.
 Like it so far! Few things I wish it would do but overall they are great!
 Great camera system, only regret should have gotten the extra cameras.  Would highly recomend these over any others.  Can set it, turn off and on vis phone app.
 Easy set up. Works as expected. Wish it had 2 way audio.
 Love the cameras, but the brackets do not hold cameras in position.  I had to use a nail to keep in place!  And Amazon Customer service not helpful
 This camera works great I've tried many different cameras and this one is easy to use although the camera does have to be close to the link system
 I love my Blink XT cameras. Both have worked flawlessly
 Easy to install. Software is very simple to setup. Images and videos are very good.
 good
 Batteries go out way too fast.  I have to change them every two months
 Easy to install and maintain
 This is the best camera system in my opinion on the market. Considering this is a wireless system and you get FREE cloud storage. No  subscription needed.
 gave me more security to my already existing cameras
 I like the clarity!  Just taking a little bit to get used to it and figuring all the WiFi issues out - gonna put on an extender to help. But all in all we like it!
 my 3rd reorder.  Love it
 Video and audio quality is great but the motion trigger option is horrible, a car reflection would trigger but when some one actually walk by it wouldn't do anything.
 It stopped working shortly after it was purchased. We think the batteries went out. They weee supppose to last 2 years.  Very disappointing. Then I missed the return date by a few days. It’s a shame because it was very clear.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R2GXJHEW01KVUZ"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91c+i0VsONS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91X-967-hQS.png"/> After 4 months, one of the camera’s view turns red when it is night time.
 Good
 Very good wireless, battery operated, outdoor security camera. I’ve been using it for 3 days so far and love it.  I was looking for something where I could keep an eye on the exterior of my home. I tried Dropcam (kept dropping wireless connection and the monthly cost is a negative). I also tried Arlo Pro and couldn’t get that to connect to my wireless. So I had very little hope of this working. It says it only works  on 2.4 ghz wireless. I have a dual band router 2.4/5 ghz and I don’t have any issues.  Setting up the camera was very easy through the Blink app. Some wireless cameras don’t like wifi passwords with special characters but no problem with Blink. I like that it runs on batteries too -  no wires.  There is a couple seconds delay when viewing through the camera or when it detects motion. You can also listen through the camera but you cannot speak through it to someone outside. You can enable motion alerts at all times or set it for different times on different days. Or no motion alerts at all. You can change everything through the app. If you have the camera enabled to detect motion it willl record a clip (stores it within a folder within the Blink app). I also get notifications on my phone and iwatch when it detects motion.<br/><br/>I tried setting this inside the house facing out the window however the infrared light on the camera creates a reflection. These cameras must be used outside. Installation was easy. The kit comes with 1 screw and a mounting bracket. Word of advice. Take a look at the mounting bracket and area where you plan to install the camera to determine best set up.<br/><br/>Video quality at night and day is 720p and looks fine to me. Does what I need it to do. I liked it so much that I immediately ordered the add on camera to install near my driveway.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a basic wireless security camera with no monthly fees give this a try.
 had it for two weeks now ... the quality is good .  battery life  is still holding for now .  the camera  itself  is really  big  then it  look online  which makes it harder to hind  it without being seen
 Works great and give me piece of mind when away from home.
 For the right price, you can't beat this system! For me, it was also a direct link to my cameras, rather than a website that may charge for premium features that I don't want.
 I ordered this camera with the Echo dot for Christmas.  I only ordered one camera, didn’t know how good it would be. I’m hoping they will go on sale so I can buy more.  It works wonderful!
 The camera was Easy to set up, and Easy to connect to the internet.  I set it up, connected to the internet and was seeing videos within Minutes.  I will buy another for sure.
 I own 5 outdoor and 1 indoor cameras. These are great and completely wireless. The app is super easy to use. There are bugs that could be worked out but overall a good camera.
 Great cameras
 Man do I love these cameras!  We now have seven in and around our property and was able to help the police out in finding a suspect that went running through our neighborhood!  Easy to setup and use!
 Love it.
 Excellent video for the price. The cameras were easy to install. The security synced easily with my network.<br/><br/>I am impressed with the quality sound during playback.
 Didn’t come with mounting hardware.
 battery last for 3 months
 It is easy to setup. This product you can set motion alert. Motion triggered recording is little delayed but does the job. Wireless and video quality is great.
 These are a must have for someone that is gone a lot it’s so nice to be able to check on my house and see if I have packages
 It's very reliable home security camera.
 The Blink camera allows you to review &amp; save files without paying a monthly service charge for cloud storage.
 As expected.
 This system is easy to install , easy to operate on app, very pleased
 These cameras are so awesome. I have a total 4 of these cameras and they work as advertised. A very affordable way to monitor your home at any time.
 Camera mount is plastic and unsecure and most likely someone will checkout camera and put in pocket and walk away , sensor is slow to activate.
 Works great, i have recommended to friends
 Great price and view is excellent I’m using for indoor front room area . It’s worth the buy
 The system was easy to install and set up. Works great.
 Motion alert to my cell is too slow not instantly. I have 100 mb interest services at home suppose to be fast  No two ways audio can not scare away intruder sometimes had trouble to have live view
 Thanks
 Good
 Works great except I'm afraid that it will get stolen outside.
 It’s ok. It could be quicker and pick up motions further but other than that it works for us.
 Very affordable way to have security cameras. Work well. Easy to use. Love that they are battery operated and do not need power.
 Extremely easy to set up. Very clear picture. Ide like to buy additional stand alone cameras
 Great service excellent quality
 Very nice.  Video very clear. Have had no issues so far. 6 months
 Had one issue after set up and their customer service was great.  Works exactly as needed.
 Easy to set up. I had cameras installed and working within minutes.
 Contrary to what Blink states on their website saying that batteries will last 2 years, on AVERAGE usage it will only last 3 months (needless to say I AM using the recommended battery)
 Love this products. Will be buying more soon.
 Very impressed with product especially for the price compared to others.
 easy to set up
 Works awesome
 Just got it today, I don't like the night time view. You can't see very well and it is kind of blurry.  Anyone else have this issue?
 very easy to install. Only thing that is missing is an open API. Otherwise this system is awesome for the prices. I have 10 cams working on single controller.
 Works well, no contract, no obligation, on WI-fi remote to your phone, easy to add more cameras. I highly recommend!
 I purchased two of the outdoor camera about two months ago and they are working great so far.  It was so nice not to have to run any wires to the cameras.  I want to purchase a few more to add to the system.
 I Love my Blink, secures my house with very easy to use features
 This lives up to all expectations.  Best bang for the buck for the price.
 Great surveillance product
 The battery did last even last 6 months!!
 I live in southern Florida, where temperatures are easily 100 degrees and then the afternoon monsoons hit. I can say that so far, this camera has taken everything mother nature has thrown at it. The picture is clear, the microphone is sensitive enough that it picks up sound from the neighbor talking on the phone in his driveway across the street, and the night vision is good. I did have to lower the motion detection setting because it was triggering from the shadows of the tree next to the camera, but that was easy enough to do. Overall, I'm happy with it.
 Performed as advertised with easy instructions. Took about 15 minutes to get all five cameras up and running. Positioning cameras was the biggest challenge for best day and night pictures. Excellent system for checking on kids and pets.
 Bought the product as a gifts for my boyfriend for Christmas and when I tell you he just loveeeeeees it . Especially the fact that he can connected it to an app and watch live streams .
 Great product for the price! Easy installation and simple navigation though the app. Settings that allow for record time and camera sensitivity are very useful and easily adjusted.
 There no good outside  if its moist out ,you cant see anything if theres a street light theres glare you cant see anything  a waste of money
 Purchased two camera system for outdoor. Easy set up, I did have a question regarding the camera position and the response was quick and very helpful. Picture quality is excellent
 Love these cameras!
 Great product for home security. Easily installed and easy to monitor
 Easy to set up, clear picture, better than I expected. Purchased to keep an eye on my driveway.
 Its so bad streaming live video , stop buy any iCloud camera  , save u r money
 Cheap. Easy. Effective.
 How easy it was to setup, but I don’t know if it’s just me-a couple times I looked at LIVE VIEW while armed then noticed wasn’t working had to rearm.
 There is NO option to manually enter a hidden WiFi network.
 Very easy to set up. Reliable and clear so far. I have it outside and  even using for 10days. HD video clips. I would recommend and will buy another at that same price.
 Worked for the first  set of batteries, then would just flicker quickly and drain all new batteries.
 Nothing but problems. Won’t stay connected to WiFi. Bought 2 systems and neither work. Have spent so much time with customer service. I’m giving up.
 Love it very easy to setup within minutes now my house feels secure. I would recommend this product to anybody that needs a reliable security camera system!
 Works great. Not overly sensitive like other cameras. Very happy with this purchase
 Units installed and programmed just as the user friendly instructions indicated.  Video quality is clear and appreciated.  I will be ordering additional camera's in the near future for additional area coverage
 It would be great if camera could be retriggered in shorter than 10 seconds.  However it is pretty good outside of this limitation
 Loved them easy to set up and install
 Very happy. Only wish is if you could set up the schedule for each individual camera
 Already have over a month with this camera, so far so good, i will definitely recommend it. Very reliable.
 So far works very well.
 Nice quality, very easy to set up. Picture quality outdoors not amazing but acceptable, don't expect any facial recognition past 20 ft
 Pretty impressed with this little thing! Not expensive, didn’t need anything but my I-phone to see what’s going on outside my wooden fence. Thinking of getting another.
 This is an excellent product, people were arrested due to video footage for a serious crime.  I am greatful for the continuous proctection of my home and family.
 I've had 4 less than 2 months and one cameras already stopped working the best cameras
 These are great,easy set up.
 Easy set up, great app. Had to fiddle with the settings so it wouldn't trigger with ever minuet movement. But once you fine tune the settings it's amazing.
 Easy set up. Clear sound and picture. Small nd easy to conceal. The only down side to this device is the battery life. The package provides lithium batteries, if you have high usage ilthey will only last 14 days.
 I like the battery mode. The free cloud storage is great. But The night vision is poor.
 Like how easy to set up. Only draw back battery life. Had it for a short period of time and had to replace batteries. Other than that I like them.
 Good image quality, very easy to set up and use. I was making a simple mistake trying to set this system up so, I contacted the Blink team and they walked me through it.
 Blink XT camera is good but the included "mounting bracket" renders it useless. The camera is now off, waiting on a shelf until a real mounting bracket arrives.

 Love it
 The 2 year battery claim is a joke.<br/>Made it 8 days.<br/>Motion detection is weak.<br/>Won’t pick up my truck leaving my driveway, but will grab headlight reflections from a block away.
 Performs as advertised. Easy to install, easy to operate. The motion activate and night vision are great features as well as having the app on my phone. Can't beat the price!
 Easily installed, and works great!
 It doesn’t video moving humans upfront or facward until he/she turns direction
 This is a very nice and simple way to have security cameras at home. My only complaint is that I have to change the batteries every few weeks
 without wifi don’t work...
 great!
 Awesome product, It's better than I thought it would be.  I have both the indoor and outdoor cameras, I would highly recommend this product.
 Cost effective... Work just as great as any monthly payment home security system... Great pic quality.
 This is a great product for the price. I would recommend this.
 Easy to I stall. Great clarity and picks up audio well
 The camera worked fine and I liked it for two months, then the night camera stopped working.  The daylight function still works.
 Cameras work great
 Seriously?! missing screw for mounting. Not sure what size just annoying when all parts don’t arrive
 Horrible quality. No way comparable to other security products like ring. Security cameras available on amazon for ~30$ have better video quality. Setting up was pretty easy though.
 Great product at very reasonable price.  Easy to setup and install.
 Amazing, great bang for your bucks!
 This product is worth the price. I have 3 cameras and it very convenient to have everything on my phone. The only thing I would have to say negative about it is the mount for the camera, seems cheap and easy to break. Quality picture great, sound ok.
 I really like it easy to use
 Economical and a breeze to install. Works exactly as advertised. Need to remove any branches that may move around with the wind if you have the motion detector enabled.
 Day time hard to beat this system. Night time if you don't have flood lights every where, litteraly day light. it not so good.
 The camera works perfectly. The reason I give it a 4 star is that the two audio feature is not included. Besides that everything works great!
 Work great!! Very pricy for single cameras.
 They all set up and worked great. Then 1 day it disconnected from my router and it will not reconnect.  Do a google search befor you buy about disconnecting from router.
 They work great I have Arlo cameras to but I prefer blink
 Simple setup and works great.
 Works great
 received  only two batteries and one mounting item with Blink XT 2 Home Security Camera System. When can i get another batteries and mounting item for my second camera?
 Bought 2, 1 is still going strong. The other's battery died within 3 months.
 This doesn’t work. I have had nothing but issues with this and I am really disappointed.
 I bought in December 26th 2018. Today is 01/12/2019 . The battery life no more!! Should gave 2 years but now only not even 3 weeks battery is finished!!!
 Good Product
 These cameras are awesome.  They are really a lot better than I thought they would be.  They get great sound as well as picture.  I bought 5 to cover 3 homes in a row.
 I use this camera for simple surveillance of our porch. I like this camera and operating system because it is simple to set up and simple to use.
 Very reliable and simple to use without any annual/monthly contract or charges
 Love the security I have with the blink .  Have two of them one in the front and one in the back.
 I'm thoroughly impressed with Blink XT cameras. Super easy to install and great picture quality all at an amazing price.
 My eyes back home...love this product
 Just as add sayes
 Finally working with amazon show. Now if they were only supported by your fire stick also.
 Took me less then five minutes to set up and works amazing!!!
 If you don't have internet,  like comcast or other it's not WORKS.
 Works great
 the product quality is terrible and the sync module defect in 3months. spent 1 hour with technical support, they kept telling me to do the same test again and again.
 setup was a breeze quality is amazing and the price you cant beat it!!! def adding more cameras
 Easy setup, instant notifications. Resolution pretty good.
 Love how easy it is to install. Just need two more and I'll be set.
 Does as advertised. I like it because it’s wireless and no subscription to pay for. Couple seconds time delay otherwise works awesome. Only wish you could talk to the person in videos but for the price not a big concern.
 Inexpensive &amp; works perfectly
 Extremely easy to install
 I love this product, I can monitor activity at my front door whether I am away from home or in bed early in the morning (usually the cat from next door).
 Good but no siren 🚨 lights or anything to stop the intruder good at Detecting bad as a Deterrent
 Free Cloud based wifi system easily accessed by your phone or computer with s clear picture.
 Price, ease of configuration, and installation.
 It works more like a childs toy. Doesnt always record. Doesnt always notify me when it does record. Too bad.
 Security around my house
 Great camera. Easy to set up even if you are not part of the geek squad.  Only negative was I had to buy external mounts and no discount when adding extra cameras.
 Love this system so easy to set up
 They are easy to setup and work as said they would. I cannot speak on battery life only had them for a month.
 Just the best !
 Happy with this product so far. Wish blink has a camera that could pan manually.
 Awesome product, easy set up, no extra fees.
 I just wish there was an automatic timer setting to turn on and off
 sencillo y eficiente cámara de vigilancia
 Awesome system, easy to install and it’s been super helpful
 Not very good. Bad video quality
 I really like this camera system, my only complaint is that 20' for motion detection isn't enough.  Other than that I cant say enough about how easy it was to setup.
 very easy to install and provides good performance. the only downside is that you can't have all day video record like regular surveillance cameras
 My son in law loves this Camera.
 Works great
 Dislike- Nothing about this product is a live a few. Everything is delayed. I would not recommend
 Nice , friendly and usefull !
 Works great
 Great value with simple set up and deployment.<br/>Battery door needs work, hard to open.
 These are not top of the line. They glitch a lot. But they do the job they are supposed to
 Great System and easy to install and use software, battery life is nowhere near 2yrs but still worth it
 I bought this item..curious to see if would actually work in another state..totally impressed with purchase.  Great price and quality video..well worth price.  Easy to install and setup.
 Easy set up. Good picture quality
 Reliable and easy to operate. Very quick set up with wifi
 This is my second Blink purchase. Very happy with this product. I love that it’s waterproof and wireless. Affordable!
 Received them today. I have 5 cameras going for 3 hours... Storage is already 20%. It is absurd that Amazon wont sell extra storage! I am returning them today!
 DOES A GOOD JOB FOR WHAT IT IS AND DONT HAVE TO HAVE A MONOTERING SERVICE
 Best money I could have spent. Audio  and video is just what I needed.
 A small, compact, fairly inexpensive security camera, that was exactly what I needed.  Easy to set up, and the app worked easily too.
 EZ PZ  hook up and simple to use. Love that it’s wireless. I bought 2 cams.
 This by far the worst things i have ever purchased on Amazon 😡
 Worked great at first but once the cold weather rolled around the batteries now die within a week very upset.
 Has a great picture and good sound. It was easy to install, no extra parts needed.
 This system is so great! Works perfectly and efficiently. I highly recommend
 I liked the product until I changed my wifi. Once changed my wifi I was never able to again to get it to work or connect. Seems to be one time use only. Possible waste of money.
 We have a 2nd home in the country.  We can now see bear, deer, and all kinds of wildlife that only show up when the house is not being used.  It’s wonderful!
 This camera is not suitable for outdoor
 Does exactly what I wanted it to do. Still learning the best settings for my use. I would buy again.
 Good camera but batteries won’t last three days. Camera is in the backyard where there are barely any movement
 Excellent cameras, extremely easy to setup. Programming arm/de-arm times is easy
 H I'll l.j gv
 Easy to install, good picture quality.
 100% a good buy
 Use for outside home security
 Good quality video, Good Motion Detection. Wish they could build Siren device compatible with this.
 Love it
 Easy installation home security camera with no wiring to worry about
 Came on time.. GREAT cameras for the price!
 Easy to use and great quality. Cant beat the price. The only thing I wished it did would alert me when it starts recording and let me view the camera during recording.
 Great little camera. Picture quality is good and it works like it should.
 The Blink XT is an awesome camera and super easy to use and set up. my only issue is I use batteries very quickly if i use the camera very very often.
 Easy to set up and works really well
 I love that these are wireless and small. Easy to install and use. I would recommend to anyone.
 I just bought this camera last week and now its cheaper then regular price if 129.99 I thank I was cheated out of the 40 percent off now
 Mounting brackets are really cheap and crappy.  Camera works well,  App works well.  I am pleased overall. Wish these had 2 way talk back so I could yell at the post man for folding my mail in half all of the time lol. I will say this. Blinks claim that the batteries last 2 years is a publicity stunt. I’ve had mine now for a little over a month and the batteries did not last. That’s pretty disappointing actually. You can set up the cameras to run on minimal use too. I have mine set on low sensitivity and the batteries still didn’t last. Would of given this product a 5 Star review if not for the weak battery life that they say should last a lot longer than that and the cheap mounting hardware. The app is great and the camera itself is very cool. Half way there Blink.
 The batteries are supposed to last 2 years. They lasted 6 weeks.
 This this is the best money I spent in yrs. Easy set up.They work GREAT
 👍🏻
 Great little security cameras.  Testing to see if they will last through our winters, so far working down to -20F.  Jan usually gets down to around -45F, should be interesting to see how they do, but, they are performing perfectly right now.  The field of view is a little narrow, but for things like doorways it's perfect, not so much for use over a yard or something wider. The entire Blink system set up unbelievably easy.  There are a lot of settings that can be made for each individual camera, not just one set of settings for the whole system.  So, you can have the front door camera set to highest resolution, or maybe increase the recording time.  Can go live on any camera, with sound, and more options.
 easy set up, quality of picture is just ok
 Great product!  Very easy to install and sync wirelessely.
 Work great. Setting up system was simple. Adding additional cameras is very easy.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R2UDTLCQR1REVR"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1mnJ+rqkiS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81n-wRIMhSS.png"/> This item has been the envy of many, and my eyes and ears when I need them. I initially purchased this because my landlord was sneaking around the outside and common areas of the 2 family property. Once I installed the cameras, all the suspicious activities began to reveal what type of landlord I really had. They compromised my families safety numerous times as well as invaded our privacy. I even got video of the landlord tampering with the camera. I will certainly purchase another. In fact, I wish I purchased the 3 or 4 pack. I would have gotten some interesting videos of really strange activity that words could never tell enough.
 On first attempt the sync module failed to sync. Call to Tech support told me I have to call ATT and have them open port 443 and disable the firewall. After a while with ATT I was able to do. Sync failed again several times. Called ATT again to make sure is done. Failed again. Called Blink tech support. I have a Velop mesh system so I thought that could be the issue, Had att check to the connection with gateway for the Linkys Velop to make sure port 433 was open. Not good either.<br/>Called Blink tech support which said that the sync module is getting "confused" between 2.4 and 5.0 GHZ  and that I needed to turn off  the 5.0 .<br/>4 hours into this I gave up and returning the items.<br/>When I compare this set up with the Sans8 cameras 5 days before this is a nightmare. Sanns8 was flawless the app made all the required<br/>changes and was done in 5 minutes or less.<br/>They did not worked for me, I suspect the Velop not sure. They do have very accesible tech support<br/>Update. A friend loaned me a sync node and it worked perfect. This was a defective node from the factory.
 Good image quality. Easy to install and use app
 have one outside and one inside, so far so good to have in your home.
 Want to feel safe and in control of what’s going on in your home? This is perfect!
 Great cameras I have had them a few months so far so good
 Very pleased
 These cameras are awesome and the setup was easy!!
 Not very good, I figured for $129 it would catch people coming and going to my front door. It did not. Was not easy to install either.....Disappointed.
 Great cameras. Difficult to open and why put serial number inside back cover battery case? Also zoom function would be great feature.
 Blink needs to put-out that doorbell.  We feel much more secure now that we have these installed, but we'd like that doorbell.
 Decent value for the money
 Good quality, but battery’s don’t last 2 years, maybe 2 months
 i feel so much safer at night and when i leave my home it gives me such a peace of mind that i have "eye" on my home at all times
 Easy to instal and easy to use, very happy with pushase
 Great camera. Easy to install and easy to use. Always working, never a problem.
 Work great especially in AZ outdoor heat.
 👍👍👍👍👍
 So easy and quick to set up.  Was amazed at the video quality.  Hoping batteries last as long as projected.  Definitely highly recommended thus far.
 I love these cameras. So easy to use and set up. Will be buying two more soon.
 Awesome picture , picks up sounds great and app is easy to use , batteries die a lil fast
 Clear picture
 These cameras are insane!!  Note - motion detection won't work through glass, you must mount outside - Works Great!
 Exactly what I wanted and needed. Easy installation. Easy to control. Just as advertised.
 I bought a comparative Linksys wireless cam seriously 5 years ago and it's better than this thing. Waste of $120.
 I have 7 Blink security cameras and love them.
 have to use for awhile to comment
 easy setup, works great only gripe is the mount bracket feel could be better built but overall great buy!
 Awesome camera and free software! My only complaint would be the mounting bracket is a little cheap. It feels like the camera might fall off of it!
 GREAT  camera!
 Being retired we travel a lot. Now we can tell when anyone or anything comes to our driveway and door. Works great!
 Product completely stop working within a month.
 Love these, great picture and audio. Easy to use.
 Easy installation, configuration is a snap and the app is filled with options.
 Easy to install and set up. Great product. Picture is great . We are going to order more cameras. I recommend buying this product
 This is the fourth one Ihave installed, and I think I will be adding another soon... They are great!
 The best cameras
 Range from receiver was very short less than 8 feet for good connection. Battery life is more or less 2 weeks with frequent use.
 I love my Blink system! Being able to see activity at my front door and back doors is priceless to me!
 Very easy to setup. The app application is user friendly. Free cloud storage was a big seller for me. Good sound, good night vision.
 Easy to install work effectively. App is easy to use and understandable. Highly recommend if your looking for an affordable home monitoring system.
 Love this system. Easy to mount and begin using. Don’t need to pay for storage. Excellent video storage.
 Really like them, but the distance from the sync module and wifi are limiting.
 Easy set up, good picture, and free storage. Very happy with this system.
 Works excellent with easy installation
 Great camera.  Battery does not last long, only about 2 months. But, this is a great camera and easy to use.
 Love this camera, so easy to set up . I’m still playing with it to make sure setting are good before I hang it up out in front porch.Going to buy another one!
 Great product for the money and very nice to have the true wireless option to hang anywhere you want.
 Love this outdoor camera. I have 3 watching my house and garage.  Just wish the motion activation could filter out the leaves of the trees when the wind blows.
 great product easy to hook up
 I love it!!!
 I like it as it works as outlined.
 This was a great idea but poorly executed. For reference I also have the Amazon Cloud Camera.  I purchased the Blink system so I could stop using the ACC to monitor what was going on outside and use it to watch inside the house.  This was a mistake and a great way to throw $89 away.  After the battery died on the Blink system (less than 3 weeks) I placed the Blink inside the house and put the ACC back in a window to watch outside. The greatest thing it has to offer is that there is no fee for using it.  So you can store a lot of clips for a pretty good length of time without paying for any service.  Its physical size is also great, making it easy to tuck into small areas so people won't look for it or keeping your house from looking like a prison.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Small design, easy to move<br/>Free storage<br/>IR is not bad<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Completely unreliable motion detection (more on that later)<br/>2 year batter is an obvious joke<br/>The app is easy to use but has too many flaws for a surveillance camera<br/>The mount is flimsy, which allows the camera to move easily<br/><br/>Okay so motion detection has to be the worst I have ever seen.  I placed my device next to a gutter to keep it from view and had a great view of the front of the house and street.  For some reason the camera could catch traffic moving right to left (even though the house blocked the right view) but it was incapable of catching traffic from left to right.  I would get a notification of a shadow and nothing else.  It did a poor job of catching people walking up to the house as well.  One larger flaw is that if it catches a car coming to the house, it will record the movement but stop after that. In other words, if someone stays in the car for a few seconds and then gets out, it will not record that.  We noticed it on multiple occasions with the delivery guy.  When you change the sensitivity from 5 (1-10 scale) it either records everything or nothing.  After receiving 98 notifications of leaves I pushed the sensitivity down to 4 and got 0 notifications in a day. I can't imagine what 10 would do.  I should also point out that the mount for the system is not great. In fact it was a contributor to the insane amount of notifications as every time the wind blew, the camera would shake and set the motion detection off.  One thing I really enjoyed about the Amazon Cloud Camera is that when you loaded the app it took you straight to a live view. Someone in development of the Blink system thought you really wouldn't want to see that so you have to tell it to go live once you load the app, which means if someone was breaking into your home, you would first have to hope that you got a notification and then load the app and then tell the app to go live so you could see what is going on.  That matters to me... and usually the police.  The app does a great job of telling you that if you view every notification, or have the sensitivity to high that you will not get 2 years of battery life.  That is a cruel joke.  I get it, its a battery powered system, but what is the point of getting the notifications if you can't really review them without killing the battery.  I have now moved the camera back into the house.  I use a USB power cable to power the device instead of a battery and we just use it to check on the dogs or look in the house if the alarm were to go off.<br/><br/>In all honesty, if you need to check on your pets, this isn't a bad purchase. But you can't talk to your animals like you can with other devices or the Amazon Cloud Camera.  I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone for any other reason.
 The quality of the picture n sound.Quick n easy to set up.And instant alerts of any movements and activities around my house.
 Easy add-on, simple to program and mount.  Holding up to the elements so far
 Great addition to my security system. Easy to install and operated.<br/><br/>Must have if you are concerned about strangers at the door.
 Poor picture quality. Then live stream never works when you want it to. Overall really disappointed in this product and quality of product.
 Great addition to my inside system. Easy to control from the same app.
 Love, love, love! Simple installation and setup. Love everything about them so I bought a set for my parents.
 easy to setup, great picture, works perfectly
 2 cameras have never worked.  contacted seller 3 times now and no response.  no range for internet even with an extender.  Very unhappy due to no contact from seller.
 Easy to install and works great.
 Only complaint I have is lens will fog up late at night, humidity or dew point related I'm sure. Will try anti fog on lens
 I have 6 blink camera and I love them. Easy setup and turn on when u need the camera. Will buy more blink camera to cover all the areas.
 Works like a charm
 Serial number is not valid. Can't connect it to my phone.
 hook up with W--Fi is intermittent at best. the camera stops working 2 feet outside the door.
 I did not like that you couldn't Zoom or pan out also has audio but no speaker but a very reliable system that is extremely sensitive when set up correctly
 No signal after 5 months of use
 There is a delay before the picture comes into play. Sometimes the subject has already passed before the camera starts to record.
 Works well..just keep in mind motion detection is only 20'. Otherwise, I am very happy with it.
 It's great for the price you pay I'd say! Easy to use and set up.
 Ease of set up and operation.  Only 4 🌟 as it needs two way talk
 affordable james bond tech that's built for dummies, works great!
 Took forever to get it set up and connected but it works great now
 just installed them two days ago. so far so good.
 Junk after having it for a year it dont work no more
 Works great.  Captures street and front and back porch activity. Clear images.
 Not a good quality product from Amazon.
 Wish cameras could be programmed separately.  Love the Cloud storage, that is FREE BTW, that holds the videos.
 This camera sucks!!!! Doesn’t work!! Says it’s offline. Returning it
 good product, I like it<br/><br/>storage space is limited<br/><br/>overall it is good solution
 They work great! Using at my cabin off a hot spot. Have 2 at home. Love them
 It was hard to setup to record but then it records every 2 min. Battery went dead after a week.
 Easy to install. Does it job perfectly.
 What a great simple and easy to use system , means i can keep an eye on things from oversea, saved me $1000's superb.
 Super easy set up, very user friendly.
 Easy to setup and pretty decent quality for the price! Motion detection actually works fairly well just have to play around with the sensitivity settings.
 Best purchase ever,can check on your home while away. Best if you can not afford monitoring fees.
 Easy to install.  Reasonable price
 This system is perfect. Wish I had bought it sooner. It’s easy to install.
 Added a second zone to our system. LOVE Blink!
 I love these cameras. They work great outdoors and they pick up sound very clearly. These are wonderful! I would recommend them to anyone.
 So easy to set up and use. It's been great see the kids get home, package deliveries and unsavory visitors all right on my phone!
 Great product. Very easy to setup and install.  Phone app is easy to use.
 I only have one camera at this time but it was so easy to set up and track that I will be buying more in the future!
 Very user friendly, cam feed &amp; alerts are fantastic, easy install &amp; hookup to my WiFi network etc...
 Better than the Ring.<br/>You cannot talk to people via camara but you can hear them<br/>Wide angles to see more
 Good little camera system I bought the one camera system for 79 on sale I'm kind of impressed by it .I wish the price would have stayed the same
 Love these cameras. I have 5 more on my house.
 Love this product. Purchased the 5 camera package. The installation is easy and the video is clear.
 great product, will recommend it all the time, excelent night vision
 They work really well.
 Simple setup and app works well
 wish there was a 24 hour continuous record option
 Not that great, motion detection doesn’t work that great. To bad this don’t record
 Easy to use and set up. These have been exactly what we wanted!
 So far working great, notifies us when packages or people at door.
 Works fine. But not sure about longevity
 I’ve had this unit up for 2 weeks and it’s telling me to change batteries. I thought they are to last 2 years. Not.
 Easy to set up and has performed beyond my expectations!
 Wish notifications were faster.
 Gives me a sense of security!
 The blink XT answers all of our security prayers!!  Seeing is KNOWING
 No wires needed works great
 I purchased this camera in June of this year and the battery is dead. I turn it off when I am home so cannot understand why the batteries need replacing.
 could be better for the price
 Excellent in all features
 Great camera a bit pricey but worth it. Got it quickly and so far a great customer service when I had a problem.
 Love these cameras.
 I had a hard time setting it up.. called tech support which were very helpful but even they couldn’t help me activate the camera..
 Great camera very easy set up
 One happy customer over here have four installed and working perfect
 Arm the camera, get alerts fast
 Works great
 Video quality is very good. Ease of use. App makes it awesome to access even if you are half way around the world.
 Camera works very well and offering free cloud storage was a big plus.
 Inexpensive and easy to set up.
 My camera doesn’t record or pick up motion in selected area it also doesn’t send notifications to my phone
 Excellent camera, setup is extremely easy and the app is very user friendly.  🖒
 Easy to install. App is fantastic with lots of options to customize. Good stand alone camera to watch for movement
 Quality product ,fair pricing, easy installation and setup,
 This has turned out to be a good camera and audio recorder.  The app works well as does the camera. It still triggers when nobody is there but it also records when folks are.  The battery life is not near what they promise.  You get 2 to 3 months typically.<br/><br/>I would recommend this if you need a camera in a spot no person or animal typically goes. If people or animals walk by regularly, the battery will die much faster than 2 years.  If a tree sways in the wind, the battery will die in a couple months. If the sun hits it, it will record and the battery will die in a couple of months.<br/><br/>Original post:  The motion sensor doesn’t work well.  It fails to turn on and record when my garage door opens and car drives out but it records the sun coming up many, many times over an hour and a half. It also turns on and records nothing several times a day but fails of capture the delivery guy dropping off a package.
 Battery definitely doesn't last 2 years I've changed ours out 3 times in 6 months
 Good product.  Would be great product with a higher quality mounting bracket.
 Wish it didn't lag so much. The response time lags other than that I love it
 Needing a camera where I have no electrical outlets this has filled the spot.  Great images and videos, very clear.
 Battery life was only 2 months maybe ok for a very low traffic area.
 Love it very easy to set up and very easy to use the sound quality and picture quality is amazing
 Easy set up, only fallback is that you can not reset remotely if it goes offline
 Love this product allows me to have access to home at all times
 Worked great for 3 days the wouldn't connect anymore. Not worth the time to troubleshoot
 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
 Great cameras, easy set up.
 Does not work like it says it does.
 Love this product.  Clear picture/<br/>Video. Extremely user friendly. Exactly what we needed.
 I have had 2 of these for less than a year and they are already broken.  They just make a clicking noise.  Do not buy!
 The Blink XT security system is low cost and easy to install.  Worked exactly as advertised.
 5 camera's came with my order and one of the indoor camera's is showing video in black and white, how do I correct?
 excellent product and easy to set up!
 works as designed and expected
 The batteries didn’t even last 1 month. Will return unit and order a new one. Hopefully mine is defective.
 These cameras are great ! They work well and the app is easy to manage .
 Camera failed to detect motion in my driveway when my car was burglarized on 12/20/18.  Guy was wearing all black.  Very dissapointed.
 very sensitive activation...easy to use and set up
 Es muy fácil de instalar eso me gusto
 Great for the daytime! However it only picks movement 5 feet from the camera at nights. Not what I expected.
 Work great! Easy to set up. No monthly fees.
 It didn't work had to return it
 perform as outlined, easy to use
 I love everything about this system. So easy to set up. You just need to remember to arm it daily.
 One of my cameras is showing red the other ones are clear what do I do
 Blink outdoor camera use to monitor both people and animals (deer, etc) that come onto our premises.
 Great Product.  Paid $300 for 5 cameras and two weeks later they want $500 for 5 cameras
 Great security camera if you have good Wi-Fi<br/>Pictures crystal clear and you can enlarge, no cloud to pay.
 Easy setup and video is clear
 Bueno
 The best investment I've made in a long time.
 Night vision is not as good as my foscam.
 Very good camera for the money . Really good material easy setup and good angle ! Nice home security camera !
 I wish it had audio that is the only thing that would make this a great system
 I love this security system simple to use
 Absolutely love these cameras. Very nice camera quality!
 Easy setup, even I could do it. Works great.
 Excellent product. Good for small spaces. Easy to install
 easy to install, would like to talk back to the people on camera.
 Great product, easy to install and set up.  Great range for the wireless camera.
 they work great with the phone APP.. I have both a inside and outside cameras ..
 These cameras are very clear and have sound also. I haven't had any issues with them.
 Inconsistent and restrictive in distance.  At times I must actually touch the lens in order to get it to come on
 Great camera, great price, and no monthly subscription.
 everyone should have it
 Camera works good.Easy to setup. Has about 20' range.
 The camera work great good picture. The camera mount is a little flimsy but I guess you can buy better ones
 System is very good and easy to install.  Great holiday sale price.
 Love Blink Cameras! Great Quality video and the app is awesome. I can view it from my phone while at work.
 Easy to setup and use. No wiring and excellent battery life. The motion capture is pretty accurate as well
 Software needs some enhancements, but all around a great system!
 these units have exceeded our requirements for our home security
 Easy set!up
 Very easy to set up and works well without issues.
 Highly recommend.
 Camera works great. We really like everything about it.  But the batteries said they last 2 years.  Ours are dead after not even a month. That was one of the reasons we bought this camera
 Love this camera. They work great day and night.<br/><br/>Just wish single camera prices were better.
 Wish this was clear before I purchased.  What a waste.
 Super easy to set up literally minutes. Works well for low traffic areas . Very clear , was impressed .
 I purchased two blink xt for my apartment but the cameras never work. All you see is “liveview failed”.
 honestly I wouldn't give it one star. I have 4 of them, was given two for Christmas an bought two more .I had to buy a Wi-Fi extender and still have issues. At best cameras have to be real close to wi- fi box ,like 10 feet which hard to do. I hate the system period, total waste of money. I can see why amazon bought them, gets you buying wi fi extenders and more camera blink wi fi boxes chasing the hope you can make work.If I could get amazon to refund my money I would.Please.Please don't buy this crap!!!!!!!!!!
 Work greAt easy set up
 Cameras work great. Day or night. You can adjust sensitivity and zoom in from your phone
 Setup was a breeze.  Works as advertised.
 Easy as 123 to set up
 Work well
 Good camera
 After scanning 2 barcodes, the system is ready to use. I like how easy they made the setup.
 Excelente producto.
 Thank you
 Very easy to set up. Great picture quality. Very user friendly
 Worst app ever. Live view fails all the time
 Easy to setup and use. Pairs great with echo show.
 I have only had the 2 camera package for a couple days and love it. Was easy to install and set up.
 Battery started draining after 1 month in one of the cameras have to change the battery every week
 Very good quality
 Clear video (night and day) and very sensitive motion detection. Have had it for a week or so, no complaints so far!
 Still playing with it, but very easy to setup and obtain video/stills. Still working on the alerts ...
 A great device easy to set up and install,
 in and out side of my home
 Worked then didn't. Connected then didn't.
 Awesome
 The product was defective. Blink technical support was also defective.
 I like the fact that it is REALLY wireless and very easy to install
 Blink dropped SmartThings support without warning and explanation, and now my Blink cameras are paperweights and a waste of time and money.  Blink has an unpredictable and self-destructive management and support structure, and I would not recommend purchasing any of their products.
 Outstanding product,very pleased with quality
 Cameras work well, I like the features and picture quality
 To complicate and useless , slow its a trash and something you have to return it doesn't deserve a 🌟
 Awesome quality, love it!
 Great value for the price
 Great interface and video.
 Using outdoors &amp; performs well. Would get another star if the sound option was 2 way rather than 1 way.
 Great night time camera picks up all movement...
 Best thing ever
 Awesome little security cameras very easy to install and watch from anywhere u are at anytime
 One of my cameras is showing up as purple? Is that normal? The other camera is showing normal colors.
 great security,very user friendly ,only thing would make it better is two way talking
 Exactly what I expected.
 Could not sync new module<br/>No response from customer support
 Works perfectly. Easily installed. Installation directions needs a bigger print/font. Nobiss
 A step-by-step instruction booklet with photos would be helpful.
 Works amazing. Nice clear pictures
 now it works every time. Reinstall app, reset batteries, relocate sync module and camera
 Wet easy to setup. This will make me feel better when I travel and have to leave my wife home alone.
 Camera would not connect to app for viewing
 It has a great picture for such a small camera and easy to use for the price.
 Night vision works good
 I love this camera. Even at night it has great quality. I have three already.
 THIS IS NOT TRUE  BATTERY LIFE IS NOT 2 YEARS  FOR  SURE  IT LASTED  ONLY  2 MONTHS
 Good
 These camera works great I would recommend them to anyone thanks blink.
 Love everything about these cameras
 Great for keeping track of weather!
 Couldn't have been easier to set up. It's only been a couple days, but it seems to be working great!
 Foolproof setup. Very useful camera system.
 Just what I wanted. In fact I bought three more.
 Works well but tech support needed when WIFI went down and had to reconnect
 This is the most perfect security camera you can buy. Best part is there no hitting fees.
 Reasonably priced and no subscription needed.
 easy to set up.
 It is a very good product that is easy to installation and easy to connect.
 I have ordered a number of these indoor cameras and a black outdoor camera, the range if area us limited, they are not reliable either I think because this product does not have jam proofing installed as some of the other surveillance cameras.  Unfortunately, a next door neighbor has started jamming my outdoor camera leaving it useless for her when she passes by my house, the camera is installed pointed toward my yard as I have had vandalism on my property, now I cannot rely on the outdoor camera to view deliveries if she has driven either going or coming in and jammed it up as she passes.  I have been writing off a number of times to Bling asking if these cameras are jam proof if not what anti devices are available, but to no avail.  The customer service at Blink is pretty aweful, that's the reason for the one star.  these are not cheap cameras when purchased as sets of three or more, search other products before decideing on this brand because they do not offer a contact number nor do they<br/>respond to email inquiries......today I got an email from Amazon sending links to Blink as though I had not used the direct Blink links.....duh!
 They work well but unfortunately didn't know they won't detect motion from behind glass
 Love the free storage and it seems to work well.  It's not weatherproof if using the power adapter though.
 I love this product, very easy to install and everything works as advertised.
 This is a great camera! Bought 2 thinking about buying 3!!
 Great product!! Battery life not quite as good as exapected but I have them in busy locations.
 Great for a small home
 I have 4 cameras and they are great. We've had them for over a year now and I plan to get more.
 Ease of installation and cost. May not do everything you want but for the cost you can't beat it.
 Good
 Works great. Easy setup.
 It stop working about 3 weeks ago and I got for my bf Christmas present 🤦‍♀️
 They work great with an exceptional view, I just wish they detected vehicles better!
 Easy to install.  Operational in minutes.  Works as advertised.
 The battery is not garnti for 2 years I bought blink xt but battery Dead at one months don't stay 2 years
 We love this system! We will keep adding cameras
 Very pleased,minus it having to record full clip before alert is sent
 easy to use and good picture
 The fact that the app does not allow take and save a photo is the reason to give 3 stars now
 Easy to setup and connect. This is an app only product, so there is no computer/laptop setup.<br/>Lots of options to customize within the app.<br/>Easy viewing and deletion of videos.<br/>Has a beta temperature monitoring and alert feature in the camera which seems to work pretty well.<br/>The audio is surprisingly clear and louder than expected.<br/>There is an option to switch to live monitoring.<br/><br/>The only issue I've had is an occasional disconnect between the base and camera as the connection isn't good. The base is near the wireless router at the back of the house upstairs and has an excellent connection. The camera is located on the porch and has a poor connection to the base. I've lost the connection twice and had to move the camera closer to reconnect.
 Perfect for what we needed it for. Highly recommend. Easy setup and super easy to use.
 Love this camera!!! Exactly as described.
 easy to set up
 works great. No monthly bills
 Easy to install and use
 These cameras are great but make sure you have good WiFi to have a good connection
 I like the cameras because they are wireless. I use them for outside surveillance.
 Working great
 best thing we ever bought~
 Great cameras, easy to set up and use. They need to redesign the wall bracket it needs to be much better. Customer service is horrific. It took me almost a month to receive my cameras and miss packaged my sleeves. When they reshipped my grey sleeve covers one was ripped. I never emailed them back because they don’t respond. So 5 star for camera 2.5 Star wall bracket and 1 Star for customer service.
 Great for my needs and no monthly fees!
 Need an alarm device to make the system complete
 So far so good. Just wish it had a rechargeable battery
 Awesome cam
 Perfect picture for outdoors and indoors-easy download and install. Can't wait until the doorbell camera is available!
 One of my cameras drains the battery 10x faster than the others, very frustrating  - definitely seems defective.
 Easy to install, no wires,no monthly fees. It works for me.
 I bought 3 and the work well except one has a pink color to it.
 Excellent product
 I’ve had these cameras for about a month now. Taking a lot of videos and still has good batteries. Haven’t missed anything. Good cameras so far
 Very Clear video, works great have had no issues. Going to add another soon!!
 Excellent quality camera and video quality. I would like to see a microphone implemented to talk back to a potential intruder like the doorbells.
 Great quality for the price. Incredibly easy to install.
 Mine works fine.
 So far working great just hope I don't have any problems their customer service is a 0
 Great little camera, easy to install outdoors.
 Pictures quality is poor, it not like read 1080hd.
 Used to monitor garage.
 If you’re looking for instant alerts this isn’t the product
 Simple setup once range of home base is established.
 Great picture quality and easy to set up
 Waited for the "outdoor" unit &amp; SO WORTH the wait! We do not consider this "a security alarm" but more of seeing what is happening &amp; documenting movements around our home. Ferrell cats, deliveries, solicitors - all on camera baby! Common sense set-up &amp; use! Realistic settings &amp; notifications. Seeing &amp; hearing the dog break out of his kennel during a storm. Very pleased with monitoring our home!
 Great camera in HD. I have 4 around my home in and out. Never had a problem yet in the 3 months I've had them. Love them.
 Batteries ran out very fast
 Easy installation and setup. No monthly fee. Low price.
 Brackets seem a little cheaply made
 Easy to set-up, good video qualit, wish the provided mounts were built a little heavier, I don’t believe the mounts will last outdoors.
 Sometimes it doesn’t detect  the movements and therefore it doesn’t  record.
 Cameras cant' continuously broadcast even if you plug them to a power outlet. It just shows 30 seconds and then stops unless you hit a "continue?" button on the screen. This is a major flaw on the design as the basic thing ANY camera is supposed to do is to broadcast live. Also, those 30 seconds of live broadcast have a delay of 3 to 4 seconds. These cameras are good only if you want motion detection recorded for a few seconds only. The brackets to secure the cameras are a joke, very week and the cameras can be detached from it with a very little force, making them easy to steal if they are placed outdoors.
 Awesome works perfect
 Product is okay, wish the video quality was a lot better and faster
 Very easy to setup and use.
 works great, has really good resolution
 So perfect in every way!
 Works as advertised no complaints
 Easy installation and great image quality
 Works as advertised
 Installation was snap, you just need good WIFI
 Da imágenes de buena resolución, el receptor de sonido es muy bueno y el programa de manejo me parece adecuado
 Easy to set up
 Purchased Dec 21st and the low battery light is already on.
 Definitely work the investment!  Love it so much I’m going to get 2 more!
 I purchased two cameras. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!
 Best cameras ever!
 Love it! Going to get a few more
 Free storage, reliable service.
 This camera is working exactly as advertised.  I really appreciate that I can fine tune the settings for sensitivity, clip length, etc...  I am going to get a couple more for other areas of my home.  I like the app notifications on my phone.  I have an indoor one too and it works well.  I really appreciate the fact that it's not breaking the bank to add this type of security feature to my home.
 It works great
 The best idea ever I love it clean sounds good easy install its the best
 Spend the extra money and get a ring system.
 Works good. Need to make reset time faster and it will be perfect.
 Easy to set up, one of the beat wifi cameras on the market for the peivw
 Batteries do not last 2 years like guarenteed.
 The motion pickup is too slow
 awesome camera
 Nice camera but did not come with wall mount
 They are difficult to work with and not reliable.
 Works great
 Very pleased with the cameras. Have had them up for 2-1/2 months now.
 Works good. Easy set up and install.
 Great product
 Sync module is very inconsistent always offline
 Good resolution , wide angle, &amp; quick to send notifications to your phone.
 I am very happy with this.
 Works great, Price is reasonable!
 Great all way around. JJM
 Very easy to install &amp; it works great!
 Slow to send anything to your phone. Batteries die fast!
 It says batteries will last 2 years. Mine went dead in one month.
 Easy to install
 Easy setup
 Very nice<br/>Bought it for myself and my friend
 Good product.
 Easy setup and works great.
 Works perfect and as advertised, easy to set up. Nice job people :)
 I purchased 3 more Blink cameras to add to my total collection of seven Blink cameras. Blink had been effective and reliable for my home. It was more cost effective than Arlo Pro. As for disadvantage compared to Arlo Pro, Blink's camera field angle of view was only 110 deg. Furthermore, the user can only access one camera at a time. For Arlo Pro, user can access all camera views simultaneously. It worked reliably well with IFTTT to setup automatic call to cell phone upon motion trigger or even sound an alarm by D-link.
 Great setup.easy to use.if you want some peace of mind?
 Love this product! Does exactly what I need it to
 Easy to set up, easy to use, good price
 Great investment. Easy to install.
 Easy set up and good video quality. Would recommend!
 This is a great starter camera. It was easy to set up and use.
 During initial setup, I uncovered the following problems: Unit would not trigger to record a video clip unless the unit was set to max sensitivity. Even set to one level under max the clip wasn’t recorded unless I was only 10ft from unit. Once one clip recorded, the unit continued to record clips until I disarmed the unit even though the unit was set to wait 15 second between clips. Then it started raining and the rain set it off. Returned unit.
 I used this product for security around my Home
 This product works great and was easy to setup.
 Great product and easy setup,right on time. Thank you amazon.
 So far so good!
 I am very well pleased with the cameras. They work better than expected.
 Very easy to set up and easy to operate. No monthly fees.
 These cameras are ok but not great. I have 4 cameras. The delay defeats the purpose of the camera. I can be home, get an alert from the front door, see that it’s the mailman and he no go to the door he is 4 houses down the street. There is no way to catch a thief or whatever in progress, they will be long gone.<br/><br/>Also the battery life is falsely advertised. I have had the system for 2 years and each camera batteries need to be replaced between 3-6 months.<br/><br/>Also it would be nice when you disable a camera for any reason that you can set a timer when it goes online again. Many times we are in the back and I turn off the cameras to save battery life, since they don’t last as advertised, and forget to arm the cameras afterwards
 Great product, super easy set up. Great to be able to see your home when your away on trips and to check in on pets when your away
 Does what it said.
 Easy install! No wires! Great quality!
 Easy to install, great clarity
 Sends notifications to phone instantly
 Watching wild life and people who call while we are away.
 Easy setup and great video/audio quality. Great value for the price.
 👍
 product does not meet expectations!
 Works great, would recommed
 Easy to set up, easy to use
 Pretty pleased
 Great
 Works well, will go off line , then come back up for some reason I haven't figured out
 IT WORKS GREAT, SAVING MONEY
 Great camera simple and easy
 Great system
 Doesn't even send video until motion has stopped.  By then it is too late.
 Excellent product, Better than I hoped.
 Mounts with cameras were hard to mount.
 All is good, satisfied.👍
 Lower prices, higher quality. Work well.
 Very easy to install and set up through internet provider
 Nice camera, reliable, easy, fast setup
 Really disappointed this product ended up only working for about 1 month.
 unable to fix WiFi connection problem;
 good  product, no wiring required
 Love it. So simple
 Works well.
 Night vision is not that good
 Hasn't been a year yet and it stopped working. Don't waste your money!!
 camera picture is very clear, we like it very much.
 For the cost, these little cameras work great!
 I can’t right a review when u get a empty box 😒😒
 Set up was extremely easy. Picture quality is good
 Not what I wanted. Not what thought.
 Works great and is easy to use and set up!
 I love this product, I have 6 now.
 Nice clearing result..
 This is the best camera
 As good as advertised
 Tough to sync with WiFi on occasion
 Very Simple to install. Great Value
 Almost two years and have not yet had to replace a battery.  The quality of the video is excellent.  The only thing I wish was different was that it had an infrared light for nighttime use, instead of the white light which comes on (it is bright, however, and does a good job of lighting the near picture....who knows...maybe it is better to have the light turn on and scare off an intruder.
 I like this product
 Everything I wanted!! it's perfect and works great. so easy to set up
 Texts go to your phone no payments
 Great product...works like a charm.
 Great camera quality.  Easy setup.
 One of the cameras came defective
 Batteries do not last 2 yrs I recieved mine January 24 and the batteries died already
 Easy and work well
 It’s wireless. Used for security
 excellent camera with motion detection.
 Works well
 Very cool had some difficulty syncing hub to WiFi, but factory reset of router and worked great.
 So easy to set up
 Very content with my purchase.
 Notifications will ruin your sleep. The system notifies you wehen you get motion alerts which I need. Scheduling preferences won’t allow notifications for arming and disarming to be turned off. They should turn on/off without having to send a notification. I’ve invested in 8 cameras but now have to upgrade to a system that won’t ruin my sleep. Sheesh.
 Best than I thought
 Works great
 PERFECT!! Please dont change a thing
 Not the best, not the worst... fair service
 Great camera system for the money. App is very ussr friendly.
 Good for the money.
 Great system. Easy to connect and monitor!
 These things are awesome for the price.

 Easy install. great video
 Love these,
 Buying more
 After it arrived it does not recognize the tf card at all. I want to return it but the ups will not accept the package as it continuously announces please insert tf card. UPS wants me to turn it off completely and there are no options to turn it off. The customer service of no help. If any body knows how to turn this off so that I can return it let me know.
 I hate it because it needs 2way Communication
 No lo he recibido
 Great For The Price!
 Easy to install, works really well.
 For the outside of the house
 I liked how system is exact what I ordered
 Works well
 These cameras are great.
 It’s fine
 Works perfect
 Easy to set up and easy to use
 Love it!
 The camera works well. Very easy to setup. One major flaw (worthy of a 2 star deduction)...<br/><br/>If you need to have multi-user access to this hub / camera, that's not an option unless you share your login with someone.<br/><br/>In other words, if you want to use blink cameras at your house, your co-worker wants to use blink cameras at their house and you want to both have shared access to a blink camera at your workplace, it's not yet possible unless you have a shared login. Huge downside that almost all of the other competitors have.
 Happy
 I love Blink products.  I keep buying more and more of these camera's.  The company is great.
 Excellent Product/ very happy with the 2 pack
 Very responsive
 First, these cameras are easy to install and setup.  No issues there.  My concerns are more around the operation.  The cameras have a lag in the recording.  Someone can enter the frame of the camera and be halfway through the frame before you capture them in the recording.  The cameras are also super sensitive to motion including shadows from trees being blown.  Yes, you can turn the sensitivity up and down, but then you lose the chance to catch action.  These cameras do not constantly record, they only operate on motion.  There is also no masking that you can perform electronically.  Masking would help all of this.
 There’s no 2 way audio
 A++
 So far wirking fine. 😆😆😆
 I really liked that there were no plug in necessary - no outlet needed... just place the cameras anywhere and that is it!! I also loved that we did not have to pay for storage.... that was a big plus in my opinion. We connected to the app just fine, better than others. However, the lapse in the camera's timing was a big miss!!  After we first placed one camera where we wanted, I walked around our property, but was not detected by the camera. I thought that once we placed the second camera, detection would improve.... I purchased blink to see what happens in our yard when we are not at home - on several occasions deer feasted on our plants and the cameras (2) did not detect them - it was a family of three and they were quite visible. Unfortunately these were returned
 Cheep. Crap
 Easy set up. Works as advertised.
 Our vacation home
 Love this product
 Disappointed with the camera. I had high hopes since it seems like a good idea.
 Love it I have 2
 Thanks very good
 they work
 works great!
 Great for my home security
 Great so far..... does exactly what it says
 Home security
 Worked exactly as advertised.
 Nice night vision, and, in general, the camera works well. My only complaint is that the motion detection range isn't very far. Probably like only five feet. So, I had to mount the camera facing away from where I assume people will be coming from so that they pass right under it to trigger it when they enter my property.
 sometimes work and sometimes not !

 Good Stuff
 Great system... Very easy to setup and even easier to use!
 Simple setup. Works great.
 Security
 Videos very good quality
 Great camera
 Works very well
 work great
 Easy to set up and great quality. I will purchase more cameras in the future.
 I live in a safe neighborhood but I bought this along with other cameras from the same company for when we go on vacation.<br/>We also have pets in the house, so we always get notifications when they are moving around the house.<br/>Pros: price, easy to set up, only batteries, no wiring.<br/>Cons: slow response, when multiple cameras detect motion at the same time, not all of them are recorded, so some motion-captured videos are lost (maybe this could be  fixed with using multiple hubs). Not as good as expected with more professional big company camera security.
 Works like a charm!
 Does exactly what it Said. Great value.
 :)
 Ok
 I initially purchased this camera as a trial.  I couldn't believe that it could/would live up to the hype I had read.  I had sold security camera systems previously in my career in the early 2000's.  They were very good quality for the home/business owner, but at a steep price.  This camera provides as good of day time quality and better night quality as the camera's I had sold and at a small fraction of the cost.  I will be replacing all my old cameras with these new devices..
 not quite enough wifi range
 Great product
 Love them
 Good quality!
 Great system!  After years of trying various hard wired cameras and recording systems, I threw everything out, and attached this to my front door.  5-10 minutes of setup and it is done.  Very well designed system, easy to setup.  It records to their cloud storage (hosted in the USA) and they don't charge anything for hosting your data.  You get notifications via an app on your phone from which you can stream the video clips and you can adjust the camera settings from your phone as well.  Perfect.  Done deal.  You can also add additional cameras and manage them all via the same interface.
 Gift
 A true wireless device that does as advertised.
 I couldn't believe how easy it was to set the whole system up.I have ordered in the past different home security systems which have been less than user or placement friendly.  I just said to myself " Give it time, technology will catch up with what you want". After 3 years of waiting,  I literally "stumbled" on to this system. I read it multiple times, read the reviews, etc. I decided to chance my luck and money one more time. It arrived as expected, I let it sit until the weekend came about so that I could use the entire day if needed.  I opened the box, the instruction where scant but clear. I downloaded the app ( I have a Samsung android). and opened it. It was very simple, too simple so I began to doubt my luck and the system. So I went to the web site and watched all the videos.. I wasted my time!!  The app was very precise and clear to follow. It looked too easy, and it was! I had the system from opening the box to fully installed in 2 hours ( That's because I looked at different video  out of trepidation and incredulous, or It would have been up in 45 minutes).  It was as simple as it said it would be.  My system is working flawlessly.  The night vision is better than I thought it would be. Even though I'm somewhat not computer or tool knowledgeable, I  was able to go through the whole set up without a glitch!  I'm still mesmerized at how easy it was to set up, how easy it is to work it.  Exactly what I had been waiting for and wanted.  My only regret is having wasted so much money and time experimenting with other systems!
 Excellent cameras!
 Easy to setup. Only hard part for me was how and where to position it. I had to adjust mine because it was some times picking up neighbors cars driving by.  Time will tell how long the batteries last. I got this because I wanted to know exactly who was at my front door without me having to get up.(I am lazy I guess haha). Also to be alerted when there are deliveries. As well as to let me know if someone has stopped by while I am gone. Hopefully I don't have to replace the batteries too often. There was a few times it glitched on me and then recovered after so long. So far it has been stable and has a very clear picture.
 I love my Blink cameras! Just as advertised, easy to set up, and work perfectly!
 Quick and easy to get started
 The camera works well, but battery life stinks and is way over stated. . Although it is in a high activity area and I have reduced clip length time and sensitivity battery life is less than a week. Kinda defeats the purpose of a wireless system. Also I don't trust the snap in mount on the XT camera , it seems not very positive and I and afraid it will come out of the mount , fall and damage the camera. Needs improvement to be a good system in those areas. However you can talk to Blink customer service to help with tech problems. Not available from some other camera systems..
 Perfect for our needs
 Decent quality, a little too sensitive..
 Not for use through a screen or storm door (I placed on the front door, because of our entrance design). In daylight, it responds to motion and renders images fine through the screen but at night, nothing. With the storm door, neither was possible.<br/><br/>This is better suited for indoor use.<br/>Perhaps this is not actually a security protection solution?
 Works well in present locations.
 Great
 I have a full bars reading to the camera, I have full bars to wifi, I have full bars to sync module.  With all of that, the camera only works 25% of the time. 3 out of 4 tries, i am greeted with “live view error”.  Kind of renders this thing absolutely and completely useless.  Blink: don’t bother responding and asking me to contact your customer support unless are going to offer me a replacement.
 Excellent product easy to install
 ***UPDATE: Battery life says 2 years; the original batteries lasted approximately 2 weeks :( I’ve replaced my batteries about every 3 days since then; which is frustrating. However; I do live on a busy street (triggering the camera around 100-150 times/day) but I figured if it says 2 years battery life I would get at least 6 months.*** Fantastic buy! Super easy setup and it’s truly wireless. You can receive notifications when the batteries are low, when the motion sensor is triggered, if it’s offline for some reason, etc...The audio is surprisingly good as well. I’ll report back on the battery life and overall satisfaction in a couple of months. So far I’ve had it in use for one hour and it’s great. It stores recordings for the set time you choose (up to one year). I’ll definitely order one or two more in the near future.
 Man I sure had high hopes for this thing. When I was setting this up it was very easy. I did run into a snag while installing with the sync module not being able to communicate through my firewall. So I basically had to turn my firewall off to get it to work since I could not find any way to allow it. After doing that I was delighted to see very clear crisp video coming from the cameras. As I was going through the setup it was very easy to get the cameras added and named. I had problems however when I was looking back through video. I noticed that the videos oftentimes would start after there was already some movement in the frame. This delay would sometimes not catch some of the action. I then made changes to the sensitivity on the motion trigger but this created more alerts. Also while setting up the cameras I found that I could not zoom the videos that were recorded so I could not pick out the details on my small Android screen. Then I looked for a PC app so I may be able to see these better and found there is no PC app for Blink. So now I have videos that I have a hard time seeing and I have a lot of them and the cloud service I have found no way to expand so I only get a few days worth due to the large number of alerts. Also the videos on a 5 camera system are all in one folder jumbled with no available way to sort them by camera. The app I would say is a dud. The camera's however I think are great but as to the battery life claim I do not believe it will last with the number of alerts. The claim in the advertising saying place it anywhere good for two years on 2 AA batteries is not correct due to some places creating a large number of alerts such as my roadside one and the app even tells you wont last that long. After I got to looking and searching trying to find a better use for this tI found there is IFTTT but it is limited as to how it can communicate with the cameras to only motion alerts. I hope that there is a much better app in the works for Android as the current one is pitiful. Overall I have given this three stars due to what appear to be really nice completely wireless cameras but a very poor interface system. I am hoping I will find a better way to utilize them, at which time I will update my review. But for now I would say there is better out there I'm sure.
 Great camera all around plain and simple
 This works great, connection sometimes falters, but doesn't last long.  Battery seems to be holding up well, we've had it Since October.  It's added comfort to me, being able to get notifications when someone walks by etc.  When it rains it messes with the camera's view and if it's windy it's pretty shaky.  I may have to mount a plate above the camera to shelter it a little.
 Easy installation
 Works pretty good but hard to adjust angle of camera once mounting plate is mounted.
 The white or regular cameras are not bad but these suck.  NO RANGE will not even go through my garage wall with receiver just 5 feet on the other side.  Bought the 5 camera pack. Even tried several different cameras to no avail.
 Set up was easy and fast.  Works great as advertised.  Fabulous support if and when needed.
 Mounting bracket was broken
 I liked it at first...but I am starting to get really annoyed. Do not buy if you live in an apartment complex or anywhere there is constant movement. It only records 60 second clips and does not do a very long live feed with out glitching. It does give a good picture and very great audio..however you will either have to constantly delete all the little clips it catches or turn it off due to the number of notifications you will recieve. If you have it on high quality it apparently runs the battery out a lot quicker. The "2 year battery" is apparently only meant for an approx 4,000 5 second clips....not worth the money at all. Oh and when the wind blows it, it likes to record videos of nothing. Not impressed. Don't get suckered. Look for another home security. Just my honest opinion.
 Absolutely amazing with 1st purchase!  Please get more in stock soon!
 please don't buy this peace of junk guys... trust my rivew... it will die after 2 or 3 years .. and also don't fix your camera under heater ventilation...it will broke... anyway this system is good for couple years only... don't buy....
 Like ability to control on/ off from my iphone
 Great if you don't mind not having reliable security.  My system is off line several times a day and it has allowed my home to be vandalized.
 These things are amazing. Pure and simple. Easy to use. No problems with the app. GREAT PRODUCT! Thank you Blink for making something totally affordable compared to other camera systems and so easy my 60+ father can use it no problems, and secretly I can keep an eye on my parents to know they're okay too. Gives me such a piece of mind, I would have paid more... but gotta stay competitive! I recommend to everyone who wants to keep an eye on their loved ones or loved things. Easy to manipulate the settings in the app to customize the system to record what where and on and off easy even without wifi.. i've done it over my cell service before and it works too. Amazing.
 great
 Batteries in this device, (at least in my experience) do not last 2 years, not even 2 weeks! More like 10 days on average. But worse than that, the company will NOT respond to my repeated requests for resolution of the problem
 Just doesn’t work well I tried to save $ on a ring and went with this cheap alternative, my bad this camera is useless very buggy sometimes it works but mostly not. Customer service rep tried to help and actually said “I know that from a customer perspective it dose t make sense but that is how it’s programmed “ not sure if he was just stupid but he said camera must be reset to motion alerts after every time you use labor ve view. Really? Then he said I need an upload speed of 2 Megabites not bits a sec in order for it to work right. This is pure junk get a ring and be happy.
 Absolutely perfect!!
 Very pleased with this system.
 Love it! Works perfect.
 This security system does exactly what I wanted it to do. I like that you can set the amount of time it records for and the time between events. We have had it a few days and have had no problems with alerts, or watching the live view. It was extremely easy to set up and required little effort or technical ability. The sound is great, I wish there was a way to communicate through the device, but have not seen a need for it so far.  The night vision is clear.
 amazing product
 This rating is based on product functionality as well as Blink Customer Service.  The cameras appeared to work well in the immediate porch area.  Frustration with this product is the poor quality of the mounting brackets and the customer service from Blink Customer Support.  I had the cameras up for just one month before the brackets broke in bad weather.  I have contacted Blink repeatedly to have replacements sent and have been waiting almost another month.  With only having these a little over 2 months, not sure I would have purchased in hindsight since the cameras are sitting on the counter awaiting hardware.
 Works great
 Bought this to monitor outdoor wildlife around my house. It does this if it's close enough. But it really depends on how the walls are constructed. I don't get but about 100 feet before the signal on the sync or wifi drops to low.<br/>IMO there should not be such a reliance on Both being optimal, either should work to provide command and control through the network. I work with outdoor wifi installations so I can put up a good outdoor wifi radio that will reach further than the sync signal, as it's outside the walls. And the mount broke fairly easily. Don't know, if you are doing your immediate house area it seems to work. Want to monitor the far end of a big yard, not so much.
 I bought these cameras for the easy way to monitor from afar, theoretically. Also, the fact that I didnt have to run power to each camera in our new home was the selling point. Very easy to setup, the only issue I had was lining up the cameras so they wouldnt trigger TOO often for cars driving by no the street as I knew the battery would be eaten up. Fast forward 6 months. They work decently well. A little slow to trigger the recording but not a huge deal.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe is the live view fails a lot or takes 5-10 seconds to start up so if someone were at your front porch for example, by the time you pull it up to see them live, they're probably gone (I hope their upcoming doorbell is a lot faster otherwise it will be useless!!).<br/><br/>another gripe is the low battery indicator is really disappointing. We were out of town Friday through Sunday. Friday morning I turn on the camera and I see a low battery indicator for the first time (yes I use lithium batteries like they suggest). Later that day it's completely dead and it turns out we accidentally left the garage open for 2 days, would have been nice to see if anyone actually went in our garage while we were gone!!! Need a better battery indicator Blink team! Let me know when it's even REMOTELY low or 25% power, so I can replace it and not find out it's low and then dead all in the same day!!!!!<br/><br/>Overall, it's decent. I think Rings cameras and system is deisnged a lot bette, Nest and Arlo probably too. Wait for Amazon to get their hands on future models though since it was recently purchased and I think the hardware will be improved. If you need a cheap fix or something to use OVERNIGHT or a random spot around your house these are pretty nice. But, if you're leaving for a week or even just a few days be aware that the sync module might need to be reset or batteries might die, yada yada. I wouldn't trust this system for legitimate monitoring, just casual use.
 The batteries only last the year it says if you keep it on the minimum everything settings. If you put the settings up at all, the batteries drain exponentially faster. That being said, I still like the system and will keep using it. It works exactly as described other than the battery life issue.
 Works just as advertised &amp; easy to set up
 Love it!  Is everything that it says it is.
 Perhaps one of the best purchases I’ve made on Amazon!  Super simple to install...and they work perfectly!  I love the ability to adjust the sensitivity by camera.  The front door doesn’t need to be as sensitive as the back door!  The front door camera was picking up traffic on the road until I adjusted the sensitivity...yet any movement in the fenced in back yard needs to be recorded.  These cameras give you that flexibility.  For the price...these can’t be beat.  Super happy with this purchase!  I’ve only had for about a month so I can’t comment on battery life...but I’m hopeful the 2 years that is advertised is accurate!  I highly recommend these cameras!
 I bought the system with one camera, installed it, then I was disappointed to find a significant price increase (30% in a week!).  I'm going to hold off on buying any more cameras until I decide if Blink just had a sale, or if they are just trying to jerk their customers around.
 Doesn't work,  spent alot of time with customer service.  Sounds like firmware problems are common.  Mine is apparently a bad motion senser.<br/>I was able to take pictures to test it and you can't read license plates from 10 feet away.  So even if the motion senser worked It wouldn't serve much purpose.
 Very pleased  and easy to install!
 I love the XT
 love these products and eagerly awaiting the doorbell system. I have 3 indoor cameras on their own module and two of these XT camera on a separate module. two reasons I didn't give it 5 stars is the night vision is not that great (but I may need to adjust it or something) and the mounting system is not that secure unless you are able to put it out of reach of potential bad guys. also one of the mounts broke when my power screw driver drove the screw in a bit too much.<br/>overall I absolutely recommend this product.
 Bought this package, 1 camera and sync unit, from amazon.  I have worked with cameras and surveillance systems for years which made me skeptical but got it anyway.  It is easy to set up, has a remarkably clear picture, motion detection works very well, email of captured video even works!  I liked it so much I bought three more (from Blink so I could get the discount).  I will be ordering another couple very soon.  For a change, something that works the way it is advertised.  Good product.
 Range is not as much as I would have liked... but overall I like the cameras.  Easy set up and installation.
 These security cameras were everything I wanted &amp; more. Took me maybe 1 hour to setup, mount &amp; get 5 cameras fully operational. Crystal clear day/night footage &amp; sound quality. The iPhone App works flawlessly. I truly recommend Blink XT!
 What good is a camera if it doesn’t work?  The mounting bracket needs work.  They are suppose to have a two year battery life and mine lasted less than a month
 Easy to setup
 Arrived defective.  There was an issue with the signal strength between the camera and sync module, even though they were feet apart.  Had to jump through hoops doing factory resets before they would RMA.  Replacement camera arrived and it was used with damaged packaging and was still registered to another customer.
 Really like these cameras.  But time will tell as to how long the batteries last.  I have four on my sync module and am having a little trouble with one staying connected.  I put it where the other camera is located and it still does not stay connected to the module all the time.  It comes and goes.  Have reset everything and still looses connection at times.
 I've purchased the 2 piece first from QVC to try it out. Liked it so much that AMAZON acquired it and offered the 5 piece kit I purchased that. And now I just couldn't pass up this deal here. No cloud storage fee, clear picture, personalize your motion activation. All I need now from BLINK is a PTZ camera and still waiting for the doorbell camera. LOVE IT!
 FACTS:<br/>The system does not let you easily backup video clips, you need to backup ONE BY ONE. No friendly backup features.<br/>The system automatically REMOVE video clips without your consent (Configuration: 'Auto-delete clips older than 1 year' set)<br/>The system drains the battery so FAST, I need to put a new one every week. (2 year battery? where the hell the scientific proof!)<br/>The system sends 50+ notifications in a minute, and those clips are not playable once every week. (Configuration: Sensitivity set at 6)
 Installed all cameras in outdoor and i noticed to many  faults Motion clips send , Manually disabled the motion then wait 30minuts and enable the  Motion  Detection same issue persist. Totally system disarmed and wait couple hours and armed again the same issue, One of my camera battery  only work one day because to many faults motion clips.  Totally disappointed no waist your Money.
 My review is for the seller more than the product. I was unable to try the product... First, I received 4 cameras and 2 syncs, not 5 cameras and 1 sync as ordered. Second, all the cameras had been opened, used, and then repackaged. The cameras were dirty :(<br/>No idea if these are even authentic products, they swapped out the batteries in each box for energizer batteries where the box set from the manufacturer came with generic batteries, seller resealed each box with a home heat shrink kit (plastic was thin and poorly fitting around box with misaligned trim), and then sold as a new product. There are too many layer of deceit to make me feel comfortable buying from this guy again.
 Been with Blink since their kickstarter days.  Fantastic product for a very fair price.  App is great, never a problem, and the cameras have lasted well over a year on 1 set of batteries.  I have recommended 12 sets now to various people all with glowing feedback.  This is their first crack at outdoor / NV so expect it to get better and better.
 See my other review on the Blink 3-camera home security system. I love these security cameras. I have two outdoors, and they work very well.  As noted in my other post, I integrated with Samsung Smartthings hub using Rboy's device handler and smart apps.  I like the integration a lot, much more flexibility than the Blink app itself.  I love no wires.  I have them for about a month now, and the batteries are barely below 99%.
 Package arrived quickly and contained my 2 XT cameras and hub.  Set up was easy and I had both cameras installed and working within 30 minutes.<br/><br/>I am still playing with various settings - like sensitivity.  I have a front and rear external camera and the front one can be triggered by a vehicle passing slowly - has to be over 20' away, so I think the sensitivity is great.  I had some contractors come to my house and the cameras triggered perfectly.  I am certainly watching battery life, as that was a concern I saw in comments.<br/><br/>However, so far I am really pleases with the performance and I am planning on buying additional units.<br/><br/>Update 31-Jan-18 : Still going strong, I really did not expect them to last through winter, but they are working fine still!  I would have gladly paid for something like this with a 3 month life, so I am really happy.  I have bought 2 more because of the quality and durability + the super easy App and free cloud storage.
 Motion sensor is garbage. Installed this to monitor my front door and the motion sensor would detect motion but nothing was there. Contacted support and they said try moving it to another location. Great advice move the camera, that fixes my problem. I guess if you wanted to monitor the inside of a closet this might be a good product.
 These cameras are the WORST. They are useless pieces of crap. Don't waste your money on them unless you LOVE buying batteries constantly. They only record a short clip rather than recording to the cloud constantly. These cameras only wish they were even half as good as my Nest cameras. So pissed we wasted money on these.
 What a waste of time! Pain to setup both the sync unit and the camera and even after that the damn thing would stop working and you have to go through the same process again. Extremely unreliable. I hate to return my purchases but this time they deserve both the return and this review for wasting my weekend.
 Works Great, needs a Web App or Desktop App to avoid needing to look at the phone if on a computer.
 Better have it in a good spot for your WiFi. Not a good camera for picture or sound quality. Doesn't show live video for long without having to hit the continue button often. If it has less than 3 bars it will burn through Lithium batteries in a month. I've gone thru 3 sets in 3 months and the camera is not that far from my router.
 Blink XT is the best camera system I ever had. Very easy to install. What I like the best is I get activations with a short recording showing me what’s up around my house all the time. I didn’t  believe the things that go on outside my house and business when I wasn’t there.
 We love the Blink cameras!  After learning, what we have, about these cameras, it’s exactly what we need and want. It’s great that you can easily control each camera separately, choosing to use or not use the audio or changing the sensitivity, so as to be able to pick up a shadow movement, little animals or if you prefer, you can choose to only pick up the movement of a human.  We can shut off a camera inside our house, when home, while leaving the outdoor camera on.  Even if there is no movement, you can snap a quick picture, just for fun.  We are thinking about getting another camera to catch the critters (skunks and raccoons) that roam our backyard.
 The cameras are to much work to get working consistently. constantly changing batteries and adjusting motion sensor, it is also not very reliable. there must be a lot of fake reviews because these just don't work very well, the only good thing about them is the size and hd video other than that a total headache!
 So far, at least, it's an amazing product. What's not to like about no hard wiring, cloud storage. There were some comments that storage should be local. That's nonsense. If' it were local, the bandits could steal all the computers in the house. There would be no trace. This is a product of smart minds.
 These are great. It does take a bit of tuning to minimize false alarms. But as someone who travels a lot, it allows me to keep a general eye on my home. I'll know if someone is skulking around the house.
 Doesnt work well at all. Purchased before long vacation, so have missed return window.  Also tried to  adjust  location to wireless to better the response but motion detection doesnt work well for outside unit. Also, tried multi locations where we walk to and from house and neighorhood and never captured that movement. Yet does catch trees moving in the wind.  Even,  on our busy street it only catches the occasional car driving by.  App is ok if it worked. Price reasonable as to the 2 stars
 The battery lasted a month. So much for the TWO year battery life. This camera is a joke. The video starts then stops while someone is walking in my yard and never started again. I would return it but it expired 4 days ago. The battery died 4 days after the return expired. Go figure.
 These cameras work great! You can set them to go on during a fixed time so you can always have someone watching your house. The app is really user friendly and easy to use too.
 So far these cameras are great compared to others I have used. The quality is nice, the options are good. I would like to be able to get the videos online as well as the app but the app works great too. Time will tell with the battery life. The setup of these cameras is insanely EASY.
 Works great - no problems.  Glad there are no monthly fees and we can download anything we want to keep, although the "free" storage has been more than efficient - we're still at 1% - just delete everything (cars driving by, wind blowing branches trigger) once or twice a week.
 I do like the Blink System.  This is our fourth blink camera and all of them work very well.  Great to have the peace of mind that your home is secure when you are not home.  My wife turns the system on when I am not home and she is going to bed.  Great warning system if someone approaches the house.
 not yet got there act together it will not connect to there server , and when it douse it keeps dropping it .<br/>there got do allot more work on software  before they put these things on the market .
 Well, the batteries lasted 2 weeks in an urban environment. I then plugged in via USB and it lasted 10 days. It is dead now
 What a novel idea. Unfortunately, it did not work for us. We do not live on a busy street, but the little bit of foot traffic we had caused the camera to burn through its battery in just a week or two. The functionality and quality was amazing. I wish it would have worked for us
 Camera lens attact insects and bugs, trying to go in, alarm is triggered each time
 Picks up flags flying, cars driving by and trees swaying but when I stand there waving my arms at it it doesn’t send me an alert! Kind of useless.
 this is a good premise BUT was not aware that there wasn't any live video streaming. So for us, it does not work. Set is fairly easy and quick. Very compact and inconspicuous. Love the no-wires feature. Would be perfect if it had live view.
 No Wires!!!!! Easy setup. Great functionality. I will be adding more cameras at a later time. Love showing people and bragging about Blink.
 Beware owners manual says will work on iOS version 8.1 , this is not true. The tech support line says only 9.3 or newer. They really need to specify this clearly on the outside of the box and change the literature. Would not work as a gift.
 I didn't want to get this camera at first because I thought I wanted 24/7 recording. I didn't trust relying on the motion sensor. Sfter having this camera for a while, I've never been so impressed. This is the number one camera on the market.
 One of the best WiFi outdoor wireless cameras I’ve seen.  Every time I get motion in front of one of my cameras I receive notification on my Iphone and a flim clip is created.  The wireless feature allowed me to place the cameras in areas that would have been hard to wire power.  I think the battries will last fine.  I’ll keep track of them and report.  I’m currently using them 24/7.
 These started out great but it was short lived. After 8 replacement cameras and months of sending non working cameras back and forth I am ready to give up and NEVER recommend or buy a Blink product again. I just threw out $220 out the window
 I was a little sceptical when I read the description on the product - completely wireless, install in minutes etc etc.<br/>It did take me less then an hour to install set up and start using this - So yes very easy to install.<br/>The picture from the app on my iphone is very clear and the recording feature is excellent!!<br/>I have recommended this product to many of my friends!!
 The trick with the outdoor  camera is aiming &amp; placement. If you have it aimed where there is constant motion  your batteries will burn down in a day.  I have 2 outside and 3 indoor cameras. I am a fan &amp;  I do recommend this brand.
 camera goes offline every time the temperature drops below 65F!
 It works perfect is the good thing about it batteries didn't last for 2 yrs as said had to replace
 I am very disappointed in the 13 day life span of the batteries.The camera is very nice.720 resolution on best setting. However,with 8 triggers a day the battery should have lasted longer. I am returning the unit.Thanks
 Laggy and super slow connection. Only upside is it’s easy to setup. Other than that it’s a poor app interface and slow connection. It does not connect via Ethernet which is probably why.
 Seriously! You need these.  I was slightly on the fence but I love them.  I wish you could also talk through them and record while viewing but over all they are stupid easy to install and use.  Best money I have spent!
 after a few months of having the camera it seems clunky... I has a huge delay and at times doesn't even pick up motion at all. But if you turn up the sensitivity you will pick up randomness like bugs and birds. Id recommend waiting to buy this camera until they figure out some problems.
 Don't buy this camera. They say battery lasts 20 years. Mine hardly made it until March 2018. I bought it in November 2017. So it only worked for about 4 months. On the other hand the video quality is poor! DON'T BUY!
 Quick shipping, easy setup, wide angle video!  We were hesitant to purchase these cameras, but now wish we had bought them sooner.  Very convenient to be able to monitor your home and property from your phone!  Easy to operate. Excellent purchase!
 Ive had this camera about a month now.  No issues and very easy to setup and install.  I plan on buying more in the future.  If you're looking for a security camera,  you wont be disappointed with this one.
 I'm a gadget guy so this is one of the best security camera I've bought here on Amazon.  I shop around and this is highly recommended by my co workers and I recommended this to my family.  I just need to buy add on camera for indoor.
 I'm a bit disappointed in this camera. It has 2 major flaws. The biggest flaw is you cannot continuously live view. You can only see live video for about 20-30 seconds. If you want to continue watching you have to keep tapping the CONTINUE button. Why would they design it it this way? Imagine if you bought a TV and had to keep tapping every 30 seconds if you want to keep watching. I'm the one paying for new batteries, why can't I decide how much to use my camera?<br/><br/>Also you cannot view your camera from a regular computer. You can only view through a mobile device. I want to have the live view running continuously on my computer's extra monitor while I work, but I can't. I have to pull out my phone and hold it, all while tapping CONTINUE every 20-30 seconds to continue watching. Bad design, just go for a Nest cam or other brand that don't have these limitations.
 Very easy to set up. Lives up to expectations. Wire-free. No extra charges for storing video clips in cloud. Very customizable.
 This was so easy to set up and install.  Video and sound are very good.  Instructions are very simple step by step.  Very happy with this purchase and expect that I will purchase a second camera soon.
 Updated 3/22/18<br/>Well I reached out and talked with Blink Support and they were great.<br/>Ordered a second outdoor camera and wanted to make an observation. While the cameras are working great, I noticed that being outside, they need to do some work on the motion sensing portion. I find the outdoor camera trigger motion for a variety of issues such as a leaf moving on a tree, to just changes in temperature with no actual motion. You can reduce sensitivity on the cameras but can not find a balance between eliminating minor movements such as leaves and still picking up real motion. I find that when I try to turn down sensitivity, I solve one problem but create a new one. The company needs to do some tuning on outdoor motion to make it more effective.<br/><br/>I want to break the review into 2 pieces as I want to be fair as each I feel I am judging on their own merit.<br/><br/>First the outdoor camera. I was very impressed with the camera especially since it runs on batteries as getting power to specific locations was always an issue and I was waiting for a battery operated product for a while. The software was easy to install and the camera quality is more than adequate for what I was looking for. While it is light on features overall, the free "cloud storage" and easy to use iphone app more than compensated for features. Product I would recommend!<br/>Now for customer service. As this is a new product, I am disappointed in the customer service as you can expect issues might arrive with something new to the market and would want feedback from the customer. I installed the product and it came online right away and worked fine for about an hour. All of a sudden I could no longer access the video and received a message " camera busy" This problem never resolved and after some time, I searched online at the companies web site and found steps I could take to resolve the issue. I followed each and every step but to no avail as the problem continued. I ended up deleting the camera and sync module and reinstalled them and poof, all started working again.<br/><br/>Now here is my rub. I took the time to send a request to customer service telling them exactly what the problem was and that I had followed the steps from their website, including placing a link to the article on their site and explained it did not work. I then took the opportunity to provide specific details on what I did to correct the issue. I received an email from support providing me the same canned steps to follow that I already told them I followed without any other information or indication of wanting to work through the issue. The analogy is the old " I went to the doctor and told him it hurts when I raise my arm to which he replied, then don't raise your arm" Problem solved thanks for coming in.<br/><br/>So the net net as of today is, great product I would recommend but poor customer service.<br/>The 5 star rating is about the product.
 THIS IS THE 3RD XT OUTDOOR BLINK CAMERA I HAVE PURCHASED AND HAVE HAD HAD ONLY PROBLEMS WITH OK TECH SUPPORT FOR A LIMITED TIME (THEN THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN PARTIES SEEMS TO HALT WHEN THERE IS NO SOLUTION - BUT TO BLAME THE WEATHER OR THE WAY I PLACE THE CAMERA? WELL THEY ADVERTISE. " Weatherproof. Water-resistant unit features temperature sensors to ensure clear, HD-quality video no matter what the forecast entails"  I LIVE IN FLORIDA AND IT GETS HUMID AND RAINS OFTEN SO I ALWAYS SEEM TO GET BLURRED FOGGY VIEWS FROM MY BLINK CAMERA - NOW IF THIS IS TESTED TO BE WEATHER PROOF WELL THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN - THEY TELL ME THAT BECAUSE THE RAIN FALLS ON THE UNIT IT BLURS THE LENS? WELL ITS NOT RAINING BUT VERY HUMID AND I CANT SEE OUT OF THE DAMN LENS - ALSO I GET FUNKY COLORS LIKE PINKS AND GREENS IN THE SKY AND TREES. BESIDES ALL THIS WHICH IS WHAT I CONSIDER DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS NOT READY TO BE RELEASED YET - THEY REALLY DO NEED TO HAVE A WAY TO MAKE ZONES THAT ONLY SHOULD BE ACTIVE FOR MOTION DETECTION, I KNOW THATS NOT SOMETHING THEY SAY THEY HAVE BUT IT IS SOMETHING TO CONSIDER - THEY PROMISED THAT WHEN I FIST STARTED TO BUY THE REGULAR WHITE BLINK CAMERAS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ETHERNET CONNECTION AS WELL AS OPTION TO RECORD ALL YOUR VIDEOS TO A FLASH DIVE FROM THE SYNC MODULE THIS WAS PROMISED ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO........
 Installed three cameras to date and they work great!  Taking away one star because the reason I choose Blink (now owned my Amazon) was they were suppose to release a video doorbell.  This still hasn't' happened.
 I have the regular blink camera and never had a problem. Bought the xt thinking it be better but its not. The night does not even work. Pretty disappointed. Will be returning it to amazon
 this item works great, only took me about 15minutes to hook it up, and get it set up outside then aim it down drive way....I had to adjust<br/>the sensitive , down some, cause cars driving by up the road, were setting it off,,so Ihad to lower the camera down more and adjust the sensitive<br/>as well....also I turned off the LED light,, so it dont come on when it starts to record...Works great, had it now 3 days ,, and has been storming and rainin like crazy, and soo far, it works wonderful.....gonna buy another one shortly.....put around back of my house.....I love it much soo...
 Blink is so much better than the competition because they don’t force you into a “subscription” to use their cloud.  I hate that business model like Nest, Kuna, Ring.  When will they learn
 Asked around and purchased this system upon recommendation from a friend. No extra service/monitoring fee, crystal clear stills OR video, EASY installation and system setup. Motion detector activation works fine as of now(just installed), time will tell about the dependability. The notifications to my mobile are a great feature as well as the ability to schedule the motion detector arm and disarm times. If this unit holds up I will add more cameras to my system.
 Crap, does work. Won't sync/connect to my wifi even though my phone, tablet and computer do. I do know and am using my correct password. I contacted support, they where able to tell me what to do without even reading my question. So that was a waste of time.
 Night video not good and It triggers a little late at times, so you just see the person passing already half way through.
 Love my Blink home security system,  and with my outside camera addition,  we can secure the back deck area. Highly recommend Blink for ease of use and free cloud storage.
 Super Champ. Happy I bought it and after a couple of month of use battery still up and running and the clips are very useful and it gives you a peace of mind when you are not home.
 It looks black and white in the basement but it may just think its dark and be using IR
 Easy to install and easy to use. We really like these so far.
 I’d like to return this product. It doesn’t register key events as movement and registers movement where these is none. When my return is authorized I will update my review. Please respond.
 The two year battery lasted three days 👎
 Super easy setup!  If we can do this, anyone can. The emails supporting installation were apppreciated and happy that we don’t have any monthly costs. Thanks Blink!
 High lag time.  Camera turns on to late when on auto. Best to set up 2 cameras pointing in same direction slightly offset to widen the cameras view . Good HD Though
 Perfect and easy to install. Through 3 walls, and 40 feet from the base, it appears to be at it's limit for distance.
 These baby’s are nice!  I suggest buying those adjustable magnetic car phone mounts to have more of an adjustable mount. They work as stated for sure.
 So far so good. Easy to install, directions are simple to follow, device works great, impressive resolution/clarity either day and/or night.
 Don’t listen to the 1 star reviews! This is so easy to set up it’s not even funny! Awesome product and much better than all the subscription services that charge you a arm and a leg every month! I only took 1 star away because I feel the mounting bracket isn’t all that wonderful.
 Horrible tech support....I do not recommend this product solely because of the tech / customer support....Its a good idea,,,just not reliable.
 Easy set-up, works well, EXCEPT the audio is only one way. I can hear the visitor, but he cannot hear me. Just what is the point of that?
 This product is very thing it’s reported to be. Easy to install, works like a charm and gives you a feeling of comfort knowing your property is protected. I would recommend it.
 U cant watch live when its recording the Ifiii or what ever it uses allows 100 texts a MONTH i used in a day returning tomorrow
 Works great but, I paid $119.99 in June 2017 and when I went back today to buy one more, I see that Blink has raised the price to $199.99 for the same single camera. Who does Blink think they are... Pharma Bro Martin Shkreli? What a rip off.
 So easy to set up! Great clarity &amp; this is my second set! I have them programmed on my same account with a pull down menu for indoor/outdoor. LOVE THIS PRIDUCT!
 Severe delay on motion detection. Poor quality video.
 Picture quality in low light is not very good.  Also when background light, sometimes you will notice a glare or bright whites that make the picture worthless.  Overall okay for the price, but could be much better.
 This actually takes a bit of work to set up and you must know your router password to use the app
 By far the best camera on the market.<br/>I bought 3 more<br/>These are perfect and no monthly fees!<br/>A+
 Wow....this is SO much better than the indoor white cameras...definitely worth a few bucks more.
 Bought for 500 went on sale for 350 8 days later.  Doesn’t pick up larger activity but will record every bug
 The Blink camara system is GREAT!  I would have rated it five stars if it had two way communication through the camera instead of just audio monitoring. The system is very easy to set up,  very reasonably priced, and the picture quality is as good as the other systems that I had installed by professionals. As long as you have a strong Wi-Fi signal, this system works well.
 Very Good Quality Video, however, there is no way you will get 2 years out of your battery if you record video of 10 seconds or more, and if your cam is located in an area that it will pick up a lot of movement.
 Super easy to setup and use.  I love the non-subscription model. It was a definitely a reason I went with this product.
 Update 8 months later...took my rating down to 2 stars and thinking about taking it down to 1 star. One of the cameras went offline when the batteries died. I have no issue with that, but replacing the batteries, even following all of the directions for resetting the camera with the power is not working. I effectively have a dead camera and no way to get it working and online again. I've contact customer support and having been waiting for any kind of a response from them. Love the camera, but it doesn't do any good if we can't keep it working.<br/><br/>Great little system and super easy to setup and install. Yes, the cameras are extremely sensitive, but it does have the ability to adjust that. For the overall safety and what we were looking for, these totally fit the bill.<br/><br/>Where we needed to install, there was no power available so we needed something with its own power source. We also needed these to be wi-fi capable and send alerts to our smart-phones. Again, not an issue. The cameras are very small and for the most part non-obtrusive and hard to spot, though we did look around to figure out the best spot.<br/><br/>We did all the initial setup using my smart-phone and then got the second phone signed into the account and there is absolutely no issue with both of us viewing clips, deleting clips, adjusting settings...whatever we need from either phone at any time.<br/><br/>We've got two cameras on the system right now and plan to add another two soon. We're very pleased.
 Monitors the front of my house and drive way. Have had no problems. Works great.
 I really like the blink cameras they work very good I have 3 outdoor and one indoor
 Does what it says it should, would like it to come in more colors, more discreet.
 Great system, good clarity, you can hear everything and the price was right
 So far so good, battery seems to be holding up, works great for what we need.
 Great cameras and very easy to install.
 This is the cheapest best thing we ever bought home security wise. It literally is so easy to set up!
 Customers I ordered for love them!! Has been my 4th set i have ordered.
 no wires. easy install. hopefully the batteries last as long as they state
 Works well, had it for a couple of months, will see what longevity is.
 Easy to install and very useful- good prices for the product!- Worth the purchase!
 Does everything as advertised. Hope they add two way audio in the future.
 Running like a champ, easy to install and set up!!  Completely Wireless!!
 Didn't have enough range
 Good product. Needs some work with settings but they are good.
 Added this to my existing system. Very easy setup and works well
 This is a very good system<br/>Easy to install and configure
 The Blink XT wireless camera is fantastic. The batteries last along time and the footage and audio are clear. You are able to see and set everything from your phone as camera sensitivity, clip duration and you can even see battery life and the temperature. I would recommend this camera system to anyone looking to purchase a wireless camera.
 Five stars because:<br/>1) super easy to install and sync<br/>2) high quality sound and video recording...crystal clear images and no fees<br/>3) love the app and alerts on my phone when motion is detected<br/>4) simple, easy to adjust settings<br/>5) within 3 days of installation, we were alerted to a trespasser while we were at work
 Settings aren't as good as the older models. But either cannot complain about pricing versus quality. Will be buying more.
 his camera is garable. it is horrible and never happy with this. you need to keep put on battery on it. it is no good. i want my money back. i don't recommend anybody buying it.
 The camera is great but don’t be fooled by the 2-year battery. It lasted a month. Also, only one camera will work at a time if they are connected to the same sync box. By them seperately if you have them near the same places.
 Product is good but the battery does not last long at all
 having a hard time syncing it to my indoor unit.
 Pretty good camera system,  works good and the price is right.
 Great product!  Very easy to set up and plenty of online support for any questions.
 Easy to use and good quality video. Put up  anywhere even has a  long lasting battery good for 2 years.
 This product is garbage. It worked a couple of times and then stopped. I even put the router, sync module, and camera together on a table and it still wouldn't connect. It would say Live View Failed over and over again even though the signal strength shows that it's excellent.<br/>Update: I rebooted everything and placed it back outside over my front door and it seemed to work fine for about half a day and then I started getting "Camera is Busy" and "Live View Failed" errors again. This product is good when it works, but it's so unreliable that I sent it back. I'm not always at home to reboot everything to get it to work again. I bought a Canary Flex today and it has been working perfectly so far. No errors! The picture quality is better too. So, for battery powered security outside the home I would recommend the Canary Flex over the Blink XT.
 Love these.  Own 4 of them.  Work great.
 Works wonderfully and gives us piece of mind
 Feel more at ease with this unit in place
 great system with no monthly fee
 very easy to use and to hook up.
 There are much better options
 Good price and very fast delivery.
 I was at first impressed with this system. So impressed in the first week that I purchased another set to have inside my house with a separate base so I could turn it off separately from the outdoor camera's.<br/>One of the things I was impressed by with this security system was the power source was 2 AA batteries, not wires or having to mount the camera's near a power source.  The company claims the battery lasts for a year and many consumer comments I read said the same thing.  The batteries do not last that long.  The camera's located outside have to have their batteries changed every 12 days or so and my camera's inside about every 20 days. Out door camera's are on for about 12 to 18 hours each day and my inside camera's are only on for about 6 to 8 hours.  The blink clip roll storage fills up quickly.  I have to check it every day and delete. This system really is not worth the price.  If you buy this system buy a good battery charger with long lasting rechargeable batteries with it.
 Good outdoor camera.  Lens fogs up a bit on very wet days but other than that, it does the job.
 Love these.  Work great..
 Great picture, easy to use.
 Didn't care for the mounting bracket.
 The real time access to my phone and I pad.  Would like to have capability of setting of alarm for intruders when I am away from home.
 weak battery lift
 We use it to keep on a dog run we use for fosters.  Very helpful
 Works like a charm
 Works very well outdoors!
 good price
 Excellent
 Awesome system!
 So far, so good. Only had them for a week. Will update review later
 no good, activity detection is iffy, and image quality not so good,
 it works great
 I brought the Xtmodel to put on a bird feeder it works great my grand kids really enjoy watching the birds feed excellent product I plan to get another one for a birdhouse in the spring should be fun watching them build a nest and have a family<br/><br/>Jim t
 Seems to be working great.  Would like to zoom in and have it stay there. Could use a stronger night light.
 Happy
 Works well
 Works for what I wanted it to do.
 Good
 Works great.  Lets me know what is happening at my front door.
 Awesomely easy!
 Great
 Very easy to set up.  You armed and disarmed on your cell phone. You get notifications on your phone when there is motion in front of any camera. The camera is compact, and easy to mount interior and exterior. I love the product and plan on adding on camera's.
 Good product. Setup easy and live view is great<br/>I thought the xt camera was 1080p
 Big fan of the Blinl system. After comparing all systems I settled with Blink. Best ban for the buck
 easy to install, good images.
 Could not get them to work, even with Blink tech support.  They should be easy, when Tech support asked me to do some IP address investigation, I knew I was over my head.  Sent them back for full refund.
 The camera system easy to setup. video quality ok. But after first month usage, batteries need to replace already.
 They are wonderful if you want wireless video cameras or video servalance however, if that’s not a necessity it isn’t the best option
 mounting outside is too far away to connect to internet. Kind of annoying.
 Mount is poor quality and camera shakes when wind blows. Camera doesn't support 5g wifi so that's disappointing. Otherwise, camera works well and being wireless makes it easy to mount.
 Installed for outdoor use. Simple to install and position. App is detailed and has good quality resolution.
 There is nothing but positive to say about this product I feel safe and it was totally worth it and u can have up to 5 cameras....
 We love blink. These XT Cameras are no exception. They work perfectly. Easy to install and use. We had the indoor set, and just used these to expand. Very satisfied!
 Truly amazing product.  The color and clarity are awesome.
 Great purchase! Will be ordering more
 these cameras mus make a sound that humans cannot hear.  Many birds approach them to stare into the lens and peck at the camera.
 Works great, no false motion alerts if you read how to properly mount and set up.
 I purchased the Blink XT along with a indoor 3pack. The system took me about 45 minutes to setup and install if that. Things I liked about the XT like the others is you can change the Retrigger time, adjust the Sensitivity, change the clip length from 5 secs to 60 secs also the enable Audio function. I have the blink app and it alerts me with a video literally 5 seconds after it captures and if I want to see more of whats going on I can click live video feed and watch or take a picture.<br/> I like that you can save the video to the phone or share with any email or messages if i wanted to keep it for later.<br/>I rate this product a 5 because its almost to good to be true but it really is that good.<br/>The install brackets come with screws but on interior cameras I used a very good quality clear double sided tape made by 3M
 Easy to setup and use as a surveillance system.<br/>Would like geo-fencing of home/away, then i would give 5 stars.
 Fantastic!  They work great and cover well.  had them up for two weeks so far and no issues at all.
 Works great! Very easy to set up.
 I have had this camera now for over 3 months.  I would NOT buy this again.  So far I have had to replace the batteries twice, and the camera won't work the way I want it to.  I can only get clips of 7-9 seconds.  Even though I have it set up for longer clips and have 4-5 bars between the camera and wifi and 4-5 bars between the camera and the sync.  Customer service is a joke.  Have to send them an email and then wait 24 hours to get a response back.  Then had issues with it not even going off for several hours.  Wouldn't even activate when i walked in front of it.  I WOULD NOT recommend this camera.  I am thinking of going to the Arlo PRO 2.
 Great
 The camera indoor doesn't show the images well or clear. Out door the cameras are excellant.
 Arrived on time and I am impressed with the video quality and ease of installation
 great stuff- only great!! Love it and recommended to every one!!
 I don't like the battery after one month are over
 Very easy to install for a non-techno person.  So far it has been in place for 3 months at my cabin in the mountains and keeps a close eye on the wildlife.
 Performs as advertised
 Awesome product
 Love it! Easy installation, works great!!!
 Great product it does well what is sopousto do, well responsive, easy to operate. Just be ready fo all of the clips you going to have go thru to actually review, and delete.
 Excellent:)
 Great security system great price see who's coming up the walk way
 Based on the reviews, I was very excited to get this camera but unfortunately the camera has gone through 2 sets of batteries in 2 weeks and has frozen 3 times!! My first thought was that the batteries were faulty but it appears that the camera is draining them really fast!<br/><br/>Also, it stopped recording and storing the old clips with the new ones. According to Blink support, after you reach your storage limit ( 7,200 seconds or 2 hours) the oldest alert clips will be overwritten by the newest automatically but that didn't happen as the camera stopped recording all together.<br/><br/>Blink team, you guys are on the right path but the product is not ready for prime time.<br/><br/>Thanks!
 Easy to install, and works as expected.  Would like better integration with Alexa.
 I am very upset. I was under the impression this would work with the echo show and that a door bell would be available “soon.” I just got a show and it doesn’t show the camera at all. It just arms and disarms. It eats through batteries as a front door camera. I really thought since amazon bought blink it would be incorporated into the product line but now they have also bought ring. I wish I had bought a ring. 😡
 Great product, very happy with the purchase!
 EASY INSTALLATION CAN ACCESS VIDEO LIVE ANYWHERE , NOTIFICATION IS PERFECT VIDEO QUALITY IS CLEAR OVERALL EXCELLENT HOME SECURITY CAMERA SYSTEM.
 I have 2 Blink XT cameras that work fie. I ordered a third, but it doesn't sense motion. I will be returning this defective item for a full refund.
 Awesome!!!
 My item had an invalid serial number
 i bought these cameras about two weeks ago and i put them up last week , very easy to set up and the cameras work great.
 Not that bad of a cam. The only issue I see is the night view isn't that good and it keeps going off every 2 minutes. Next time I will get the RING cam where I can control the motion area. Over-all great cam for the cost.
 Bought two cameras 1 quit working with in a week the other doesn't goes off when movement is there all the time
 Package thief!
 Connected for 36 hours then would not connect again.  Got replacement but that didn't work at all.
 Easy set up.  A few tweaks on camera angle and sensitivity and you good to go.  Camera picture is good.
 This was a total disappointment... It was not visible at night at all and it picked up sound but you could not talk through it.  No two way sound... but the night was just a snowy cloud like picture...you could not make anything out...its going back!
 Very cost effective. Just wish it would notify my cell phone faster.
 Works perfect
 didn't work half the time
 The best camera system out there for the money
 Does not have night vision. Too dark. No # for customer service help.  Canary is much better.
 to got it July its august and the two year batterys are dead not a good start
 Set up was easy and the Blink app is awesome.
 Works at a 75 ft distance from the wifi. Good for me.<br/>Nothing bad.
 Just what i was looking for
 Love these cameras
 The picture &amp; video is awesome.
 Will buy again
 Today blink abruptly decided to stop supporting their devices on smartthings. To many of us, this solution is now practically useless.<br/><br/>"On December 19, 2017, Blink is discontinuing support for all SmartThings integrations including the developer RBoy app. For your security, we recommend that you change your Blink password. We thank for your continued support of Blink and apologize for any inconvenience.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Blink"<br/><br/>I do not recommend this product if you plan to use it for home automation
 Thank you.
 Pros:<br/>Easy to set up<br/>Good packaging<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Sensitivity is a mess. Starts recording when there's no noticeable motion.<br/>Batteries dont last NEARLY as long as expected.<br/>Missing software features like rotating video orientation or specifying areas in the picture to start recording on.<br/>Doesnt have the ability to arm/disarm individual cameras<br/><br/>Would not recommend.
 I really wanted to support this company and had high hopes for their products. Despite constant application issues, cameras that only captured vertical lines from time to time instead of a video and shorter than expected battery life (although still very good) I put 8 in my home. I did this because they had the most open interface that allowed for integration into my SmartThings home automation system. As of today they have eliminated all integration with SmartThings with only a one day notification. If you are purchasing this with the expectation of using the video or motion sensors in any type of automated setup forget it. Arlo has better picture quality, by far, and supports automation. If you think you might want to integrate into another system in the future look elsewhere.
 Great camera.  Wish they had a website to view the camera when I am not near my phone.
 The motion capture is hit or miss. I have 3 cameras. Product support is lacking. You are unable to share videos. And Blink has shut down the Web pages for video share report.<br/>Other than that, the size and convenience and set up is incredible. Just wish the videos could be saved, and the cameras can be placed more than 10 feet from WiFi and the sync module.
 Blink monitoring is so easy to setup. I've had my cameras for about a week now and I'm very happy. I now have the new Blink xt camera. Just as easy to setup as the indoor Blink camera. I find this Blink xt very durable and this is why. I was installing the camera outside at about an eight foot height when I dropped the Blink xt. Barely a scratch! I was amazed. It has a nice rubber seal and hard outer black plastic cover. It also comes with the option of shutting off the record/monitor light which is a very small light in the front. This would give a person a visible indication they are being monitored or recorded. But maybe I don't want anybody to see the light at night, I can just switch the dip switch to off. Can't buy a better cordless monitor system for this price so far!<br/>Note, you need a good internet connection to your house or business.
 east set up and easy install, one screw and done. had to work on the sensitivity for a min. all the way up and a fly goes across my porch and I get a notification, so that took some work. but picture is great, app is easy to use. and the way the cloud storage works it awesome.. as you see a video you can delete it or save it. obviously one will delete almost all videos because of animals or people who are not doing anything, but very happy with the product after just a few days. highly recommend so far.
 Camera works fine and is easy to set up. BUT you cannot view the camera from  the fire tablet. The whole reason I got this was to not have to use my phone. Works with Alexa is very deceiving. Back to Zmodo cameras.
 had a very hard time getting a connection to the server,it would not connect till the next day,may 7 2017
 Dont wate your time here<br/> Unloaded the box all good untill tried to connect camera .Got error invalid Serial Number. They try to tell me I am using the wrong number. It's THE ONLY SERIAL NUMBER ON THE BOX AND THE CAMERA. Poor customer service. On its way back.
 This Blink XT camera works exactly as I thought it would.... it's the third one in my system. I had researched all the wireless outdoor camers and glad I settled on this brand.
 I have been using the exterior camera Blink XT for about 10 days and I am very happy with it. It catches movement from squirrel to delivery person and notifies my cell phone. I had tried Ring but my wifi couldn't get a good signal. No such problem with Blink XT.
 I bought these cameras because I'm having work done in my house and wanted to see what the contractors are doing when I'm not there. These cameras are amazing I absolutely love that I can set it up on schedule to arm and since it came with three cameras I can see all entrances easily.<br/><br/>It's been great to see who comes in and out during the day while they are working on my house. It definitely gives me peace of mind to know that while I may not be there I still know what's going on.<br/><br/> I also bought one of the new outside cameras, it took minutes to install it in my backyard on the gazebo and was able to set the sensitivity so not every gecko in the gazebo would set it off.<br/><br/> Would highly recommend this product
 These are great cameras.  Very clear picture day and night.  Setup was very simple (less than 10 min).  Reception is good considering the signal on some cameras is having to travel through 2 brick walls and 2 or 3 interior walls.  I have one camera on the back side of my brick detached garage and the module wifi router is in the middle of my brick house.  Never had an issue with it getting reception.  I see a couple negative reviews saying you can't arm/disarm individual cameras.  This is false.  All you have to do is tap the running man above each camera and that will arm/disarm motion detection on that particular camera.  No motion detection means the camera won't turn on unless you live view the camera.  Simple as that.  The only thing I wish they would change is the ability to record while live viewing.  I have some cheap zmodo cameras ($100 for 4 cameras) that allow this so these expensive Blink cameras should be able to do it also.  This is the reason for 4 stars.
 I have the camera in my window set to detect and record motion. You can walk right up to the camera and nothing records but there are times it just records clips and there is nothing moving. Don't waste your money.
 Came fast.  Havent installed  dont know if it works.  Looks ok
 I only received 1 camera.  Had to return.
 Battery life sucks
 Camera isn't working the way I anticipated. I was hoping to keep it indoors to look through window but it doesn't work that way. Blue light when recording shows when camera is outside in the dark. Distance is an issue maybe that's why it was inexpensive.
 cameras are set and we shall see how all things goes
 The best for the price!  Reliable every time
 cheep easy home security
 Do Not waste your money on this camera system as I did and purchased thru blinkforhome so, I cannot even return it as Blink Customer service says that this flaw is outside the refund policy which means you will be owning a totally useless system until they address the issue. Their PIR sensors are too sensitive and It ends up picking up shadows,sun lights pretty much everything and generates hundreds of false alerts during the day so you end up disabling the camera and having a dummy camera outside.This has been a common issue across many XT customers and If you want to know more about the flaw and other customers complains please look it up on the blinkforhome community as "blink-xt-too-sensitive"
 I love this thing!! it's the best value camera out!! And it's super easy to setup and install on a wall!! I only wish it had 2 way communication but besides that it's amazing!!
 It did not work with my wireless router.
 I have been using this for several months and I would highly recommend!
 Awesome product - have installed in both homes.
 Great 👍👍👍👍👍
 Very nice. Works well
 Had defective sync unit. They made it good, but spent 3 days trying to get it working.
 Pay the extra money and buy Arlos.
 Love Blink! Customer service by appointment call but very professional.
 The system is a piece of junk and I wouldn't use it even if it was free.
 NO WORKING!
 Camera Router does not work
 Do not place your sync module on a table. You need to mount it on a wall ! I know their are no holes for mounting it. And the way that it is made it looks like you simply lay it on a table. WRONG ! After I mounted it on a wall with some very strong two way tape. The signal strength went to max out put. After plugging in your sync module and using the full length of the cord for the correct hight. You will receive a better and stronger signal. ie. Camera to sync module. Sync module to wyfi. Five bars full strength ! I don't know why intermedia fabricated the sync module the way they did. It needs to mount to the wall. I hope this helps you guys ! You will notice a big difference ! Blink is the best camera to buy ! Excellent video with no fees ! ! ! No hard drives ! Down load what videos you want to keep !<br/>1080P quality ! Night vision ! Phone app ! And the list goes on ! Buy it !
 useless, too late to record.
 I received this June 1 2017. I went through the set up and came to the point where I entered the S/N. when I typed it in I received message Serial Number Not Valid. I tried with camera and came up with the same result. There is no way to contact the manufacture directly  I submitted an email question and got a quick reply. I should here within a working day.<br/>It is only 18 hours later but the working day is coming to an end. My biggest concern is not having and way to communicate directly for a solutions. This is a new product first release and I am sure it is a registration problem.<br/><br/>After purchasing hundreds of products through Amazon this may be the first one I have written a negative report on and my first return
 Blink xt does a great job during the day, but as a night camera it's very poor.  See attached photos.
 What I like the least is that one blink only work for a day or two. Then intermittently then stop recording. So I have concluded I need lithium batteries. Batteries included was to have a two year life not so. I am not in no hurry to buy the batteries. So battery was changed recorded about 10 views now completely offline. Only 1 camera work.I recommend to my neighbor now on second thought I will not encourage her.
 Great device
 Every time I try to access my Blink on my phone, I continue to have issues. I'm receiving a "handshake fail", "system is busy, try again later", "having trouble accessing cloud". This system is so unreliable and it is frustrating not being to receive any support or any solution. I've been having this issue for months!!<br/>I'm sorry I ever spent my hard earned money trying to help a small business such as this. The lack of response is shameful, at best.<br/>They have no tech support and are selective as to which emails they reply to. I have sent dozens trying to find a solution to these cameras. Now, I'm out a few hundred dollars. Don't do it!!
 I am a long time DIY smart home and security guy. I own just about every single security cam on the market today, Ring video doorbell (2), Ring stickup cam (3), Netgear Arlo (2) Pro (2), Nest drop cam (1), Kuna cam (1), Samsug PT smartcam (1), Piper NV (2), Canary (1) Canary Flex (1) so I am well versed in the competition. I have to say I was initially impressed by Blink's offering when I saw them on kickstarter in 2014 however I did NOT back them at the time as it seemed to good to be true but they delivered a nice 720p small form factor and cordless camera so I was impressed but still I waited as I wanted outdoor cam. Then they announced Blink Xt so within a month I bought a Blink 2 camera system and pre-ordered the Blink XT. I was impressed for about a day when Blink servers went down that is where a GLARING issue was discovered! Support or Lack Thereof. It is nonexistent and horrible. in my many many many, inquires to them during the outage, questions about my XT, order, and due to a recent issue on 06/08/2017 not once have they EVER supported me. With that said continue to the Pros as there is a lot and then watch the video. I hope this info helps.<br/><br/>Pros:Light weight and small form factor, cordless many options to mount in areas that cannot be reached with power cord. battery powered, purported to have 2 year battery life, easy to setup and user friendly app, 720P with 1080p coming in future update (1080p coming to XT model only), 110 degree field of view, Temp sensor, Infrared, built in mic, PIR sensor, support android and iOS, free cloud storage,works with IFTTT, integrates with Amazon Alexa.<br/>Also I like Blink's vision they have for their security camera as discussed at CES 2017 they plan to add a battery and Cellular backup WiFi module. This is great because if you lose power your module and internet will still work keeping the camera operable to monitor your home. Also a plus is for plans for home "Seecurity" where Blink will provide monitoring service and have accessory like siren, keypad, entry sensors. more of a DIY home security system not just camera monitoring system<br/><br/>Where Blink fails and they FAIL MISERABLY is in their lack of customer support. They have no customer support number, they only have email support and with that they never respond. They also do no respond via social media. So if you are not tech savvy I would hold off on Blink until they get REAL customer and Technical support. Sorry but to me it is a deal breaker. DIY home security is where we are headed and if you do not have the staff to support your vision you will be left behind! ( see my other Blink XT/ with module Review where I have included pics and an Extensive 11 min video!)<br/><br/>***UPDATE 06/14/2017***<br/>Sync Module connected to Blink XT has now dropped connected over 15 times since first setup. Also it does not want to update the firmware and there is no MANUAL option to update it. I feel module is the issue however thanks to Blink's Non Existent Support I cannot be for sure. They called 6/9/17 6:21pm and left a voicemail said will call back Monday. here we are Wednesday 06/14/17 still no follow up call no help received. Support is absolute Garbage! In Process of packaging and returning All blink cams!<br/><br/>**UPDATE 06/28/2017*** Today my cams kept sending notifications even AFTER being disarmed in app! IT was not a PHONE issue as this happened in Blink app on 3 different phones and a WiFi only iPad so it is an Blink issue. Tried to contact their NON EXISTENT SUPPORT and of course heard NOTHING back. I even posted videos on on their Twitter. still nothing the are the worst customer support EVER!<br/><br/>***UPDATE 07/01/2017*** After having the Blink XT less than a month and with settings as follows...Re-trigger set to 10 secs, Sensitivity 4, clip length 10 seconds, End clips early if motion stops ENABLED, IR control set to Auto, and IR intensity set to LOW, and Mic enabled ...the batteries are DEAD!!!!!  How do I know. well at 2am in morning it recorded on last clip during clip IR was blinking off/on then nothing worked after that. Funny thing was before I went to bed that night checked the settings and battery read "OK".  So XT DOES NOT live up to 2 year battery life that Blink Hyped! Maybe with Min setting and if the camera was in a closet and NEVER was triggered and it sits idle in a "controlled" lab batteries might last 2 years.  If you plan to use this cam OUTSIDE or in area of high activity the batteries will DIE fast so expect to spend a lot on batteries or, if an option, ( was not an option in my case) plug it to an outlet so batteries are not an issue. however this again is problem as it now REDUCES your mounting option as you will need to be near outlet. I have something I am testing now to resolve the battery issue that allows me to charge cam WITHOUT plugging into outlet. I WILL NOT POST MY FIX HERE..I am not doing Blink ANY FAVORS!!! if you want my fix idea which cost under $10. Direct message me.
 Very easy to set up and user friendly interface.  There are three major  problems with the camera,: 1) the delay between when motion is happening to the turn on of the recording.  For example, i walked a head of my wife to our front door, it did not record me and just a step or so of my wife. So it's basically useless if you want it for a security camera.  The lag is awful. 2) the motion detection is very spotty and the camera does not have adequate adjustment.  I had the camera for 2 weeks and have tried every setting and tried multiple locations, it just not consistent. Many cameras have an area that you can set for motion detection, this does not which is a major drawback.  3) Time between recording is excessive.  It takes a few seconds for it to be record between events.  I've also sent questions to the Blink customer support team with no response.  Its too bad, it has a lot of promise but it's definitely not ready for prime time yet.
 Before you invest into Blink system note that they have no interest in having a stable online platform for their service. Today they discontinued an advertised service, smartthings integration, that they officially supported without any notice. I would have given them 4 stars if they didn't do that but at this point I can't recommend this system to anyone as the company have shown no trust in maintaining their service.
 cheap and returned it

But there’s one that’s perfect for you based on your needs. For me, it’s the Blink system.<br/><br/>Note that I have both the indoor cameras and the XT outdoor cameras.<br/><br/>What I need and what’s important to me:<br/>·  Motion detection (record clips when there’s motion)<br/>·  Cloud based storage<br/>·  Quick motion sensing (no recordings where it starts when the person is already walking away)<br/>·  No monthly fees<br/>·  Low hardware cost so I can have more coverage (more cameras)<br/>·  Low profile hardware (doesn’t stick out like I’m a bank or retail store)<br/>·  Weather proof<br/>·  Battery operated (completely wireless)<br/>·  Phone app that works well<br/>·  Live view<br/>·  Night vision<br/>·  HD<br/>·  Plays well with other smart things<br/><br/>What I don’t need or what’s really not that important to me:<br/>·  2-way communication<br/>·  Cellular/land line connection backup<br/>·  Continuous 24/7 recording<br/>·  Sound detection<br/>·  Siren<br/><br/>The Blink system hits on all of what’s important to me (listed above).<br/><br/>What I like about the Blink system:<br/>-  Very quick motion response, this is super important. It’s in the top 3 reasons why I went with Blink (in less than a second, this thing starts<br/>  recording) What’s the use of a video clip that starts when the person is already back in his/her car.<br/>-  Low profile camera (people don’t even know I have cameras all around the house), although some do want people to know they have<br/>  cameras but I like it low profile. It’s a house, not a retail store.<br/>-  Completely wire-free and because it’s so small and low profile, you can mount these anywhere with just a command strip indoor or outdoor<br/>  double sided tape. I have mine screwed outdoors but just making a point that they are super lightweight.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-  While the alert on your app is quick, it doesn’t send it to you until the video clip is done recording. So if it’s a 60 second clip, you won’t know<br/>  until about 70+ seconds that something’s happening in front of the camera.<br/>-  You can’t use Live View when the camera is recording. When the doorbell rings, our instinct is to look at the app and turn on live view to see<br/>  who’s outside. But because it’s recording, it’s not going to let you. With that, Blink is coming out with a doorbell which I’m very excited about.<br/>  This will complete the system and I can just use the doorbell to view who’s outside at home and remotely while the XT records the video clip.<br/>-  The XT cameras have a really loud clicking/winding/crackling noise in the video clips. It varies by camera. I do have 2 of them that don’t<br/>  create the noise. But the rest are so loud that sometimes it’s hard to hear conversations. While this is very annoying, it’s not a deal breaker for<br/>  me. I’m not creating home movies of my kids or using the cameras for like a wedding or something. So the clicking, while annoying, is OK.<br/>  The indoor cameras do not exhibit any clicking noises.<br/>-  The mount is not good. A fat squirrel will knock down one of my cameras one day. The screw to the wall is solid but the “clip” from the mount<br/>  to the camera is very weak. Also, because of its design, setting the proper angle could be a challenge and some angles might be impossible.<br/>  It’s lacking a ball head mount to make angles more flexible.<br/>-  Two of my XT cameras goes offline line occasionally and I can’t figure out why. It just stops working for a duration of time, sometimes a few<br/>  minutes to a few hours. It’s not the battery. And it’s still communicating with the sync module. It just doesn’t want to record or do live view. I<br/>  power cycle it and even remove/re-add to module and nothing. But it will turn back on on its own at some point.<br/>-  One of my XT cameras (that goes offline line occasionally) sometimes will seem like it's recording continuously. It's basically stuck in record<br/>  mode and will create clips that contain nothing. I can tell it's stuck on record because the batteries will heat up and even the temp goes above<br/>  100 deg and I'm in the middle of winter. And then the battery basically dies. I've replaced the batteries 3x in 1 month on this unit.<br/>-  As of 12/19/18, they removed support for SmartThings. But the news was followed by Blink being acquired by Amazon, which not makes<br/>  perfect sense. I only hope this means good things for current customers.<br/><br/>A side story…<br/>I hesitantly give the XT4 and Indoor 5 star rating because of my ordering experience. The product itself I’m very satisfied with. But my ordering experience was an adventure. My first order was for a pair of XT’s. It seems as though the units were used or refurbished (lots of wear and tear evidence, even in the packaging). So I contacted Blink. They sent me some replacements. The funny thing was that the replacements were in worse condition. 2 things that proved they’re used/refurbished (1) the serial numbers were already registered to another sync module, so I couldn’t even install them. Blink did release the serial number. (2) The batteries on 2 units lasted only 1 month. Blink did make it right and rewarded me with some free hardware. So I’m happy I saved some money but at the same time I can’t help but think why Blink would send me used equipment 2x.<br/><br/>Overall though, I’m happy that they resolved the issue quickly. And because I like the system so much, I bought their indoor cameras as well. I’m excited they have a doorbell coming out soon. I will definitely buy that to complete the system and perhaps also buy some of their security (siren and entry sensors) hardware.<br/><br/>IN SUMMARY – Great system for my needs: (1) Low cost (2) No monthly fees (3) Low profile hardware (4)Outdoor use (5) SUPER FAST motion sensor (6) Nice app (7) Growing product offering to complete the system
 I'll update my review once my sync module arrives. Disappointed that as a first time buyer I could not determine if this was 'all I needed'. Nowhere does it say to purchase sync module separately. I only need 1 camera and this says '1 camera kit' and the first photo shows a module.  So now that I got the camera on prime.  I now have to reorder a sync module which is not available on prime. So instead of using it out of the box I have to wait a week to get the other part!  Disappointed thus far.  (Note: this also does. It say 'add-on camera' as I read on other items.
 Bought for friend
 I would LOVE to give this unit 5 stars.  My wife bought me a "KIT" with two XT Cameras and the main control unit.  I installed them, and they seemed to be great.  As a result, I bought three of these "Add-On" cameras to add to my system.  All five were working well, and then suddenly - one of the original two cameras that came with the initial "Kit" failed.  To say BLINK support is a pain in the #%$%&amp;^ is being too kind to them.  I don't really blame the people who work there, but needless to say, after you go on their website and open a CASE, you do receive an email from them with a CASE NUMBER, and then they ask you to do silly stuff (As all support organizations seem to do nowadays), but I "dutifully" did what they wanted.  I suspect the problems with Tech Support are based on BAD MANAGEMENT POLICIES.  I have been in the IT Racket since 1978, and I recognize terrible management of support departments.<br/>After a week or so of what I considered stupid troubleshooting, they gave me an RMA and sent a replacement unit.  The replacement arrived, "NEW" in a box, and it seemed to be fine.<br/>However, after a few weeks IT TOO began to fail.  So you can see why I would be upset - a failing unit has been replaced with yet another failing unit.  Once again, I went through the "PAIN" of dealing with their tech support.  Once we had gone through all the "Silly" troubleshooting steps, they decided to, ONCE AGAIN, give me an RMA for that unit and send me yet ANOTHER replacement.  So, I received a tracking number, and after 9 days of the status on the tracking number never changing beyond "the USPS Received this tracking number", I kept asking them daily - where the heck is my replacement??  So, finally they found out the USPS hadn't scanned it in or some such nonsense, and although it seemed to take forever, I finally DID receive this second replacement.  It too was sealed in a box, and appeared "NEW".  However, after opening the box, the unit was scratched and dented all to hell.  When I tried to add the serial number of the camera into my system, it failed and it stated: "THIS SERIAL NUMBER IS ALREADY ASSOCIATED WITH ANOTHER ACCOUNT".  SO, the "jig was up" - I figured out these replacements are somebody else's troubles - THEY'RE REFURBISHED UNITS!!!!!<br/>To me, when a "NEW" unit fails, you replace it with another "NEW" unit.  Dealing with their technical support, dealing with receiving shoddy replacement units, and the failure rate of these units has provided a "BLACK EYE" to them in my humble opinion as to the "Quality and Reliability" of the BLINK hardware.  I gave them 3-stars, as my other 4 cameras are fine and have never failed - at least NOT YET!  I am very cautious to give these cameras any rating beyond 3-stars which is sad, because I do like the app, I like the way the cameras work (when they're working), and I like the fact they are wireless and battery-operated.  However, one wants to feel their security camera system is "RELIABLE".<br/><br/>Here's the last message I just sent to their Tech Support:<br/>*****************************************************************************************<br/>  Thank you for all your help.  It still upsets me that you are using refurbished systems, as the ORIGINAL XT Camera was brand new.  When it failed, BLINK sent me a replacement – now I know the replacement was a refurbished unit – That seems wrong to me – and it indeed failed.  Then, I contacted BLINK support again, and once again; you have now sent me another refurbished unit.  So in summary, my BRAND NEW camera that failed has been “Replaced twice” with two refurbished units.  Do you see why that is upsetting to customers?  When a NEW item fails, it should be replaced with another “NEW” item.  I know this is not your fault, but it’s not a good business practice in my opinion.  I can only sit here now and “wait” for this refurbished unit to also fail eventually. ☹<br/>  OK – for this case, I DID receive the refurbished unit, now that you cleared it in the system, I was able to add it to my account, and it is working.  I guess we can close this case.  If this refurbished unit fails (as the one before it did too), I will not bother with using BLINK support again, as I don’t want another person’s problems (which is what you get with refurbished units), so I will purchase a NEW camera.  Thanks again, and close the case.<br/>  PLEASE pass these final comments of mine upward to your management – they need to KNOW how customers feel about getting refurbished units to replace NEW units.<br/><br/>Best Regards,<br/>A******************
 UPDATE: 2/2/19: we have had these for 2 months now, and all I can say is they are junk. The last day to return them was 3 days ago. So, we are stuck with them. One works intermittently at best, and the other camera's view looks like someone smeared something on it. It's not condensation or a dirty lens. It just sucks. The majority of the time, the motion sensor doesnt pick up anything or it picks up the leg of someone as they walk out of sight or the exhaust fumes from a car. I have walked back and forth painfully slow and it doesn't catch me or catches a small part. If you turn the sensitivity up past 7, it catches everything!!  Leaves, wind, etc. It goes off constantly and the batteries are dead within a day or two.  If a thief knows you have blink, they can stick an arm in view of the camera, then they have 10 seconds to do whatever they want. It wont retrigger for 10 seconds and only records 60 seconds at a time. And there is no way to record live view, so if you switch to it and saw a burglar or vandal, then you are the only person that saw it OR ever will see it. The mobile app has to be running in the background all the time that drains your phone battery at an exponential rate. If you close it in the background, you cant launch the app again.  The app just sits and spins until you restart your phone.  I only wish we could get our money back....please read my previous review that points out all the faults<br/><br/>I can only think that people who give this product 5 stars do not live in condos, townhouses or anywhere that there is actual traffic and people. I really wanted to like this product. Going to start with the multiple cons as i am Still trying to decide if I want to keep the two I have with mounts for $200+, I am on keeping them now with the idea that something is better than nothing.<br/><br/>Major, major Cons: first and foremost you have to constantly restart your phone when the app gets hung up constantly or the router or both. Which, is not exactly convenient if you are out of town.  Next, the 2 year battery life is an ABSOLUTE LIE!!  I have had the cameras for 5 weeks and changed the batteries twice in each one. Lithium batteries are expensive. 2 year battery life would apply to usage on a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere...maybe.<br/>Next huge flaw is the fact that the video clip will only run 60 seconds max at a time. Which, would not be a problem if it could start right up again upon motion or audio detection. The retrigger time is a minimum of 10 seconds. 10 seconds!!!!  Let me put this in perspective, I can walk half a block at a leisurely pace. So much can happen in 10 seconds that ANYONE familiar with blink would know that after 60 seconds (at the most) they could do whatever they want to your place in 10 seconds. This is a HUGE  flaw.<br/>Motion detection is hit or miss at best! I walked in and out 4 times a day for 5 days, and was caught on video 50% of the time. And the delay to catch motion is a joke at best.  All someone has to do is stop moving to stop the recording and they have at least 10 seconds to do whatever they want.<br/>The only workaround for the retrigger would be to buy multiple units and set them up to not overlap coverage areas. Maybe leave a sign for thieves and vandals to be sure to not step into an area where coverage overlaps? The retrigger limitation almost makes it useless.<br/>Also, it can take up to 4 minutes to get a notification. So, the damage is done before you would find out about it. If the maximum video time is 60 seconds, why does it take 4 minutes to get the notifications? Again, the damage is done.<br/>The audio detection is a great feature if: it's not windy, raining, leaves falling, dog in the distance barking, etc.  You get the idea.<br/>Also, There are some dumb thieves, but anyone could use some binoculars to see what kind of system it is, and look at the specs (or amazon reviews) to find out these limitations. It's not like they are invisible boxes or are camouflaged.  Unless, you just happen to have an all black house or wall outside. I just hope we dont get a smart thief.<br/>There isn't a desktop app available. so you cant view your videos on your pc without sending the video to google drive or another inconvenient workaround. Mobile app but not PC? Makes no sense.<br/><br/>Pros:  Easy to setup the account, sync, download the mobile software app, add additional cameras, and customize the app. It works well as far as the night vision and audio detection.<br/>The video clarity is good. But, if you cant catch a thief because they stop moving for a second it really doesn't matter how good the video quality is<br/><br/>Blink xt...please remove the 10 second minimum retrigger time!
 These are super easy to install and setup. I am not very tech savvy and was worried that it might be a struggle, but it had really easy instructions. The whole setup was installed and running within an hour.
 Nunca me llegaron y todavia sigo esperabdolas
 I bought Blink because of reviews from SmartThings forum. The camera itself is ok. But what makes it valuable is you get wireless Camera (ease of installation), use the PIR motion sensor and camera to trigger events in SmartThings, Nothing with the feature and price point does this with ST integration. However all of these goodies depend on Blink API being exposed to Smart Things. This API was a feature promised during their KickStarter days.<br/>However, this company decided to announce that it will no longer support SmartThings integration effective immediately which means they have turned off their API access to SmartThings. What that means is people who rely on Blink+Smartthings to secure their house at night, monitor elderly family members, get notified when their kids arrive from school, use this to secure their vacation/rental property are now out in the cold naked.<br/>They do have ambitions based of recent brink product development to be a company like ADT or ADT + SmartThings. This means they are going head on against SmartThings. There is nothing wrong with a company wanting to grow it's business.<br/>What's wrong is how arrogant and inconsiderate this company is. How hard is it to notify customers ahead of time before pulling the plug on a major feature that has critical impact to it's customer base. The email they sent had no explanation why they removed this feature. For the money they got from all of those Blink + SmartThings customers, proper communication is expected at a minimum.<br/>For a product that you would use for security, you would want a vendor that is trust worthy with a good customer service. Blink is not this company as shown by previous behavior of pulling features and giving the middle finger to customers. Will you still trust them ? Decision making is spotty and customer care does not exist. They prioritized releasing a feature that changed their applications "Color Scheme" instead of fixing API issues with SmartThings or creating a replacement API, Device Handler and App of their own. Heck maybe crafting a thoughtful email and release it ahead of time. But we're just customers right ?
 Never got them to work I think I. Edina was a fraud
 Purchased two outdoor cameras, one for front and one for the back of the house.<br/><br/>Positives:  Easy and quick to set up with the phone App - definitely download and sign up for the account, it makes the install easy. Longest time required was deciding exactly where to put the cameras. Love the wide angle of view (see picture), covers a pretty decent area. Sound quality was pretty good too, picked up my voice easily and was able to listen to all the insects buzzing outside the house. It even picked up a plane flying overhead at one point during my testing.<br/><br/>Negatives: The one thing keeping this from being a five-star rating was system speed. The system is a little slow to show video on the phone. In one test, I was already through the back door of the house but the video on wife's phone was still showing me coming to the door outside of the house. Understand the alert notice on your phone is not immediate, takes a few seconds if the camera is set up for motion detection notifications. Would be nice if you could talk through the system to the person outside but this system doesn't have that capability. I knew that in advance when purchasing so not a deal breaker for me. Also noticed that when my wife was viewing through the app on her phone, I could not view on mine. Hadn't seen that limitation mentioned anywhere so it took a little bit of testing to figure out. Again, more of a personal nuisance than major system problem. Remember, this is not most expensive, top of the line system so don't expect it to be.<br/><br/>Install Note:  I would recommend setting it up at night with porch lights on if you are going to be looking at your entrances. This will give you a better idea of where to install so the lights don't overwhelm the picture.
 First, when reading past reviews remember that this product has had numerous software and firmware upgrades. They have added and fixed issues I've had, and I've had the system almost 3 months. My experience based on purchasing a duel camera kit via the Christmas sale. So for I'm basing my review and usage based on Price. It's not the Rolls Royce of Security Cameras - Amazon has Ring for that. This is their B Team camera solution with unique features.<br/><br/>I purchased the 2 camera kit for outdoor use only. I don't want to run any wires or power. I just want to put the camera's up to watch the front door and back door (I may get a third one for the garage when it goes on sale again).<br/><br/>I also want to say, I have called Customer Support a few times. Yes I get new people, but they read the last issues, I make sure to have them read me back what they typed in their support system before hanging up, and get a support code number. I'm very technical so I've only called with technical issues which always revolved around one camera not working in the cold  for some reason, of the 2 cameras, when it was below 32, one camera would not activate, the other worked fine, we tried a number of reboots, and a fresh firmware install, it got better but 1 was still better then the other. I simply insisted that it's within the 1 year warrantee, and that it's a Prime purchase, to send me a new one. A slight pushback to ask to try more things, but I reminded them this was the solution I wanted, and they sent a new camera with 3 day shipping which I found funny/odd. The new camera needed a firmware upgrade, but both work the same now]<br/><br/>Overall - I'm keeping the system due to the price for an outdoor only no wire solution where a door bell cam is not needed. Also I was not going to buy Cloud storage. Amazon owns AWS, the idea that their own products cant include Cloud storage is a money grab to me (perhaps other products need cloud storage and have to buy it from a third party is understandable, but not an Amazon selling Amazon, same goes for Google and Nest storage).<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Free cloud storage: gives you enough and the ability to download clips you want to save<br/>- Battery - not recharge or cell phone battery or outlet<br/>- Daytime pretty clear images<br/>- Zone Trigger - This is new, so old reviews don't know that now you can select areas of your image don't trigger the camera. As stated I watch the front door. I zone out the public sidewalk so people walking their dog does not trigger the camera, but if the dog goes on my grass, I'm recording that activity.<br/>- IFTTT integration - you can arm and disarm the camera system when you leave the house based on location services. Dad has a flip phone, so he gets texts when someone activates the camera and later he will review the clips on the tables/Ipad or my phone. AND this is how I get it to integrate with my Google Home.<br/>- Sound: Picks up a lot of audio when triggered, all can turn it off in software<br/>- Lots of software settings like recording length, quality, arming, sensitivity<br/>- Size/Weight, though the mounting is not fantastic is does work, and I've used 3M double sided heavy duty sticker to mount the camera bracket to the house siding. Mounting is minutes.<br/>- Support - I've had good experience - Customer Support Forums<br/>- Firmware/Software improvements: I've seen them occur a couple for times in just 3 months, so they are trying.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Delay on Live: Viewing a live image takes to long. It has a nice feature for my Amazon fire, just tell Alexa, view my front door and it displays. They have a view that shows the feature. But it's edited. The image takes a while to display. Lots of factors play into that (see next con) but I hope this improves with updates and firmware<br/>- ** Base station/Hub placement: ** This was a tricky one that caused many issues ** It's a Dance. The cameras, for whatever design reasons, need to be able to get BOTH a WiFi and Hub signal of decent strength. And the Hub needs to be able to get a solid WiFi signal. The hub also needs to be near an outlet to be plugged in which adds to the dance. If you don't have all the signals in GREEN (the app shows you signal strength), performance/notification will be terrible and delayed. I pray they improve the HUB for greater distance, firmware won't fix it, it needs bigger/better antennas. 300 feet, with limited walls/floors is your limit from Base Station to mounting location.<br/>-Not good for door bell replacement cameras: Though you will get notified if you face the camera at the front door and someone walks up. The delay is too long for it to be proactive. There is NO talking out from the camera. Maybe they will have a new product some day<br/>- No Website browser Image Viewing: I want them to build a PWA app instead of the app they have, it would solve so much. That's an app that works in a browser AND as a smartphone app (Twitter is a PWA app for example as is YouTube on PC's and you smartphone browser, try them on you smartphone browser)<br/><br/>Conclusion: Evaluate what your use is. Realtime-whose at your door- this is not a solution. Security - who came by or is lurking around the house - it's a good secondary solution to an existing security system. Nanny Cam/Watching a specific area, possibly. Business Security: No, you should know you need something more robust. Big House: not for you at this time.<br/><br/>Suggestion: Depending on when you read this vs when I wrote it, call Blink and ask about new features and what the latest firmware or upgrade has done. They also have an online customer support forum.
 OUTDOOR CAMERA:Obviously the manufacture's of this product did not test the outdoor cameras in the deep south where the temps get in the 110+ degree range for several hours a day, the 2 year battery only accounts if you set it where there is never any movement, I am lucky to get 30 days from 2 AA batteries from my outdoor camera. The system works ok, but don't expect to get an alert right away, it takes several minutes for the alert to come over, then a little time to see it through the slow cloud. Chances are anything that recorded would be over with by the time the alert came through, it also false triggers in the morning if it is facing east, it seems to pick up the movement of the sun peaking over the house, I had 97 false triggers just this morning before I got up and shut the thing off (and yes the sensitivity is set correctly). All in All this is just an OK system, not a system for you if you want instant viewing.<br/>INDOOR CAMERA: The indoor cameras are ok, except when the cameras trigger a bright light turns on letting the intruder know exactly where the camera is??? Battery life depends on movement, but you want get two years out of it unless you place it in the attic and hope a squirrel doesn't set it off.  Not unlike the outdoor camera, it takes a while to get the alert and view it.
 Customer of 3 outdoor units. Cameras are pretty good, and I bought them for their smart home integration with the SmartThings.  But Blink executives appear to prefer a "dumb home" instead, or at best a walled garden where their stuff doesn't talk to other devices. (IFTTT doesn't count fellas)  So for the misleading advertising, false promises, and the terrible communications; these guys are a zero.
 The cameras have issues working at night.<br/><br/>From Blink:<br/>"Unfortunately there is no fix for this in near future. This issue is due to a very unique set of environmental circumstances and the way the camera manages power. If you wish to verify this, you could swap the location of this camera with another. The only steps I would be able to recommend would be trying the camera in a new location"
 Terrible programing, Unfriendly user settings, Low quality camera, if it could be bad it is. Do not buy, you will only spend more money on something better. Arlo has done really well at the house, although a bit expensive (200+ depending on what you get and an $50 per battery if you want extra batteries) but honestly worth it.<br/>Again do not buy this system.
 This system is WIRELESS. It works on 2.4GHz WiFi. It needs to connect to your home wifi router as well as the Blink hub successfully to work. No cables! Though you can purchase USB power cables if you want to plug them in. They also DO NOT RECHARGE. If you have them plugged into the wall, they will run on power, then if the power goes out it runs on the remaining battery power. They also sell a solar panel that allows it to run off of solar during the day, then switches to the batteries at night. I could not find anyone who has tried to test the battery life with a solar power system for their Blink XT.<br/><br/>Blink XT is 1080p and weather proof<br/>Original Blink is 720p and NOT weather proof.<br/><br/>There is no monthly fee or subscription. It is on a rolling cloud based storage system It keeps your clips for 14 days before deleting the oldest clips first. This is a great solution but a nano memory card solution would work for me as well.<br/><br/>Each cam takes two double AA Lithium Ion Batteries. Energizer is the only brand supported by the product.<br/>This is supposed to last 40,000 - 10 second clips, which they figure with average use of 10 - 10 second clips a day is equal to two years. Of course getting a screen capture, streaming live video, and constantly updating the settings will affect the battery life a bit.<br/><br/>We monitor our front porch and walkway, it works flawlessly. At night, after the lights go out, there is an IR light and you can see the area of coverage in pitch black darkness.<br/><br/>There are two lights on the front that come on when it senses motion and when it comes on. One is blue. You can switch this off with a physical switch beside the first battery in the cam. This blue light caught a lot of people by surprise as it switches on as someone walks into the field of the cam. At night, there is a red light on the bottom, below the IR blaster, that turns on. You can't turn this one off. They are both really small lights. I turned the blue LED off so as not to surprise visitors and possibly save a tiny bit of battery life.<br/><br/>It tracks temperature, they have a motion zone beta that seems to work well, you can set the clip lengths, and also set how quickly to reset the cam after a clip is recorded. I had it in the sun on a fence for a couple days... I quickly got temperature warning that the camera temp was getting high. I bought mounts and put it up under the awning of the roof in the shade. No problems since.<br/><br/>The motion detection works well and has enough settings to provide more than enough for anyone looking for monitor. We've caught squirrels during the day and cats in the middle of the night set off the cam.<br/><br/>When the cam and bundles go on sale, I think it's worth the price. It's not as pricey as the Arlo 2 and has a longer battery life. However, the Arlo 2 does come with some nice features as well and looks nice.<br/><br/>We also picked up some silicone covers for the Blink XT cams outdoors as well as mounts. The mounts that come with the units work but if you want something to match your paint or stick out from the wall or awning, you may want a 3rd party mount.<br/><br/>Very useful. Gives us a peace of mind. We will be setting up a UPS (uninterrupted power system) with the wireless router and fiber modem so the Blink XT system will continue to work amidst a power blackout.<br/><br/>Solid 4-stars for an easy to use solution. I can easily see us using these for indoor and outdoor use. On a side note, I dropped the cam once while trying to put it up. The pic samples came in red during the day, as if the IR blaster was stuck on. I took the batteries out the put them back in, restarting the cam, and that seems to have fixed the problem. It's back working normal. They are small and nifty but can take a fall from the roof, I wouldn't recommend testing that though. :)
 Aging and looking for solutions to connect my son and I easily, if needed, and provide two-way voice to him or someone else if I'm incapacitated and can't get help. This is great for what it is. If you're looking for a listening nanny cam or just to watch your dog, I think it's great. For our needs it's so far from useful. Great video to a degree and really great in low light.<br/><br/>I'll be watching Blink for the future. As my needs grow I hope it will too. Disappointing for now, even with Alexa connection which is why I tried it. Never could get that to function.
 UPDATE 11/22/2018<br/>My apologies to all the people at Blink and huge thanks to tech support for their help and patience. I discovered that the Wi-Fi password on one of my routers had been changed without me knowing. Once I corrected that, all cameras have been performing flawlessly.<br/><br/>UPDATE 10/29/2018<br/><br/>I upgraded my rating to 4 stars. Tech support was very quick to respond and after I stopped arguing and did what they said (I'm pretty hard headed), everything started working. It is not a perfect system. Reading the reviews from other people I doubt that will ever happen with any system. :) People want conflicting things...<br/><br/>I purchased three Blink XT one camera systems (with the sync module) on Prime day. Of those three, all of them have decided to no longer support live feed or snapshot. I also have one non-XT version that I purchased approx. one month ago. That one works flawlessly (so far). As to motion detection: of the three XTs, one has been intermittent at best since I installed it. One works reasonably well except that sometimes the video for motion alerts includes absolutely no motion at all. As of the last time I had motion enabled on the third, it worked well with almost zero false triggers and multiple real triggers.<br/><br/>The mounts included for these are a complete joke. It would take a 4 year old about 2 seconds to remove the camera from the mount. Further, the included mount is extremely limited as to positioning the camera.<br/><br/>Next,  if you choose to use the camera in wired configuration, they are not weather proof without the addition of third party products.<br/><br/>I bought these specifically for outdoor operation and they don't seem to be handling the great outdoors very well.<br/><br/>I am giving one star because I have four of their cameras and one works perfectly. I have related all of this in a ticket on the blink site. If their response manages to resolve these issues I will update my rating appropriately.
 I SOOO badly want to give this 5 starts.<br/><br/>First off, I must say that I really do love this camera &amp; system.  It's super easy to set up &amp; to use.  It definitely makes me &amp; my other half feel a lot better to be able to see what's going on at our front door.  We've caught the mailman several times &amp; a random AT&amp;T guy that came to our house.  Even a few birds.  I will say that the motion sensor is pretty sensitive.  We have a MASSIVE tree in our front yard, so it casts shadows over our front porch.  So, we get a TON of notifications throughout the day.  We get more on a windy day.  With that being said, the only issue we seem to have is with the battery life.  Like I said, we get a lot of notifications throughout the day.  I'm not talking about 20-30 a day.  It's probably closer to 100+.  Again, massive tree...shadows...wind blows...the leaves move &amp; we get a notification.  We've had Blink XT for maybe a month &amp; we've already gone through 2 sets of batteries.  The camera indicates that it has no wifi signal, we've had some problems with our internet so we thought that's what the issue was.  However, that wasn't what the case.  There was no indication that the batteries had already worn out.  Where you're able to set your sensitivity &amp; what not, it tells you if the batteries are "OK" or not.  Never once has it said anything else other than "OK".  Eventually the camera says it's offline.  We've had to break down &amp; get a micro usb cord &amp; plug it in.  Which is our biggest thing any way because of where we want to put cameras, we have no way to get power to them.  But, we made it work.  If you need to place your camera in an area that has a lot of shadows, or is a high traffic area, this might be your issue, too.<br/><br/>The microphone is super sensitive, too.  We live a little over a mile away from an AFB &amp; at night, we can hear Night TAPS playing over the camera.  We can hear people talking while they're standing in the drive way, around the corner, or even next door.  We can hear music from cars as they go past our house.  We can even hear the dog barking that's easily 4-5 houses away from ours.<br/><br/>Video quality is great.  It's a clear picture &amp; would be easy to make out any facial features, if need be.<br/><br/>All in all, I really do love these cameras &amp; have recommended them to anyone who's looking for a home monitoring system.  We definitely plan on getting more!
 The actual camera and sync hardware seems great, included instructions were clear and I was up and running within an hour of opening the box with an auto-arm/disarm schedule set and getting clips and alerts on my (Android Pixel 2) phone.<br/><br/>Fast forward 3 months and I want to set the app up on a second device (Lenovo Android tablet), but I can't authenticate with the app on this new device for some reason. The Blink website has a support FAQ which refers you to a non-existent "Forgot Password" link on the Android app, and Blink's web ecosystem has at least 2 "Blink Accounts" you can sign up with (one for store, one for support) neither of which seem to link up with the account the app uses, so resetting a password is impossible there. There is a "Forgot Password" link in the Android app ONCE YOU ARE SIGNED IN but that doesn't seem to actually do anything.<br/><br/>After discovering all this, I googled to find out how to contact Blink support, who replied via email that there is no account registered to my email address, despite the fact that my phone still shows me signed in using that address, and I still have hardware registered to that address.<br/><br/>I can't sign into this account anywhere other than the phone I used to register all the hardware with, and Blink says no account actually exists so they can't reset the password. Which means the cameras and sync module I have are registered to and tied with an account... that doesn't exist.<br/><br/>The fact that something like this is possible with Blink's system ought to give you major concerns about purchasing the hardware. Thank diety I hadn't lost/reset the phone or deleted the app before I decided to do this.
 These cameras have no downside. I am so happy I bought them. I did find a better price for them on qvc but I still bought a few extra. they are so worth it. I’m putting a few in my cape house to make sure I’m not flooding or the temp isn’t going too low in the winter. Their perfect!!
 I got this direct from Blink.<br/><br/>For me, it did what I wanted, but, it just didn't do it well enough.  Here we go......<br/><br/>Pros -<br/>- no monthly charge.  I didn't know other products actually charged a monthly fee to host your data.  Stay away from that.<br/>- wireless.  Yup, it is battery (2 2x A Lithiums) powered.  Supposed to last 2 years...time will tell.  It is dependent on how you set up the product.  No doubt this is like the EPA mileage ratings.  I'm hoping for a year.<br/>- Outdoor use.  So, mount it anywhere you want.<br/>- video is 720P.  Daytime is clear.  Night, not so much.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- battery compartment is tough to open.  The mount has to be removed to open the compartment.  I don't think the mount will last too long.<br/>- the mount is flimsy.  Anyone can snatch it off the mount.<br/><br/>UPDATE 9/2/2018  The tension on the mount is not adjustable.  I ended up using wire to hold the camera at a required tilt down.  Also, I find that you cannot turn the camera left / right and up / down.  You get to chose only one adjustment - it's either up/down  OR  left/right.  A ball type mount is probably your best bet.  For additional $$ you can buy one on Amazon.<br/><br/>- infrared video is not very clear.  You can tell it is a deer, or a person, but you cannot tell who the person is.<br/><br/>Overall OK.  I would wait a while for some improvements.
 I’m an ordinal Kickstarter supporter. I bought cameras and used them outdoors before the XT camera (made for outdoor use) existed. At times they would exhibit weird behaviors in Texas heat or unusual cold, but all of the originals would recover when normal conditions returned and are still working.<br/><br/>When they released the XT camera, I was fully on board and bought two. They were MADE for outdoor use! Somehow, my XT was the first camera to fail. The display turned pink and the camera would fire off 20 clips within a few seconds when motion was detected.<br/><br/>This led to my first support request (yesterday) after six years. They asked about the batteries - I tried three brands, one of which was recommended. I was offered a replacement, but then that was retracted and only replacement batteries were offered. When I refused the batteries (no need to pay shipping on AA’s, I have them), I was told the camera was out of warranty and they could not help me.<br/><br/>My basic Kickstarter cameras have lasted 6 years! The “new” outdoor XT camera lasted less than 1/3 of that.<br/><br/>DO NOT BUY THESE CAMERAS - since Amazon took ownership they have apparently gone down in quality and they will not last at all.<br/><br/>I’ve always bragged on these cameras for their value and performance and my family has trusted them for our safety, but apparently that does not apply to new models. I am extremely disappointed.
 The configuration and setup were easy and straight forward, but there was a HUGE design flaw upon trying to install the cameras. The issue was that Blink provides these cheap plastic mounting hardware for what's supposed to be a full fledged OUTDOOR security system. After installing the mount, I snapped in the camera and then adjusted it to a 90 degree angle...that's when the mount dislodged from the base. There is no way an outdoor security system should provide such poor hardware. The cameras are fine, but I must return this system because the cameras will not stay in place. Furthermore, since this is a battery operated system, I cannot imagine the plastic mounting clips lasting thru too many battery changes<br/><br/>Blink is an Amazon company, so please get funding to fix this flaw!! You should be providing strong magnetic mounts such as Nest and Arlo.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R3ASHL0EXGIXLY"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81l7uCIjwCS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AL8kgrd4S.png"/> After only three months of use I noticed the IR on a camera had quit (see the video sample). This made me check the remaining 4, only to realize another had also quit. A quick Google search showed this is a known and common issue, so I followed the steps to remedy it. That only worked until nightfall. I reached out to Blink support who had me remove and replace batteries repeatedly, hook up to external power, and delete and add the cameras - all proving futile.<br/>I have requested twice to simply return the system, and asked if there was a hardware or software update. That was never answered, but they say they will replace the two bad cameras only but won't even answer with what. More cameras with the same issues? Refurbished?<br/>To sum up, I should have stuck to a company with a known reputation instead of being lured by specs and the "An Amazon Company" tag line.  Anybody want to buy my system cheap?
 Before I purchased these I did a tremendous amount of research on wireless in-home security cam systems.  It came down to Arlo &amp; Blink as the final two contenders.  Due to the prime day sale and overall "value for the dollar" I opted to go with the blink 5 camera set.  I've had them installed for 3 days now and they seem to be working quite well.  I opted for 1 facing the front door outside, one facing the back patio, one facing out into the back yard, one facing the front door internally, and one that faces down through the living and dining room.  Inside the house I mounted them with the simple single screw mounts that they come with, and outside I purchased 3 screw mounts by Wasserstein that allow for much more mobility (<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Metal-Wall-Mount-for-Blink-XT-Outdoor-Indoor-Camera-Adjustable-Indoor-Outdoor-Security-Metal-Wall-Mount-by-Wasserstein-3-Pack-Black/dp/B07DL79NSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Metal Wall Mount for Blink XT Outdoor &amp; Indoor Camera - Adjustable Indoor/Outdoor Security Metal Wall Mount - by Wasserstein (3 Pack, Black)</a>).<br/><br/>Here are the biggest downsides to these cameras for those comparing to Arlo:<br/>NO Geofencing: the cameras will not shut off when they realize your mobile device is in the vicinity of your home or business<br/>NO Activity Zone Control:  These cameras do not have Grids or Zones you can control from the picture the camera is recording.  So you need to focus on placement or you will pickup undesired movement (especially outside with cars passing by).<br/>NO Two Way Audio<br/>The set only comes with one Sync Module  This means all the camera's will need to be on the same timer set (see attached picture)  If you want to split the cameras up to be armed at different times, you will  need to purchase a 2nd module.<br/><br/>Overall, for the value though I am very happy with the product.  Stick to proper placement and set arming and disarming times intelligently and you'll have yourself a fine product.  TBD on battery life and outdoor wear and tear.
 This camera is cheap and unreliable.  It is very easy to set up and install, but almost impossible to keep it working.  It has a separate component "sync module" which is separate from the cam, so starting with that is odd that its not 1 piece.  The hinge to adjust it is so flimsy and loose, I cannot get it to stay in place.  I had to use Lock-Tite glue on the hinge to get it to stay where I want it to.  The worst part is that I cannot get it to display the live.  Each time I click play, it says "camera is busy" after a while., so I cannot get it live to be able to aim it where I want to.  Not sure if that is bad software or hardware, but I had to take it down, it simply does not work.  The WiFi range is also very poor.  I had to update to a stronger range wifi router and move the sync module closer inside the house to get it to recognize it and it still fails to connect the live feed.
 To make Blink cameras what they should be, they need to make the following improvements:<br/><br/>1. Add a provision to compensate for bright backlighting. I attempted to use the camera on my porch to be able to see people walking up to my front door. But because the porch is shady, and the background across the street is bright sunlight, all I could see was a dark silhouette of the person approaching. And there is no way to adjust the Blink exposure to compensate for that kind of bright backlighting. That is an essential improvement that needs to be made. If you can't see who is at your door, what is the purpose of even having the camera?<br/><br/>2. Allow recording while viewing live. The camera is designed to automatically record when it senses movement, but you can also use the app to turn on the camera whenever you want, for a live view of what the camera sees. But unfortunately, you aren't allowed to record what you are viewing, which sort of defeats the purpose. I could envision a situation in which you see a burglar on the camera, and watch him entering your house, but are unable to record his actions. They need to fix that. This is another necessary improvement: you should be able to record what you view live.<br/><br/>3. The motion sensor does not work through glass. I attempted to set up my Blink camera so that it looked out through a glass window in my front door, in order to capture images of people walking up to the door. But the motion sensor doesn't work through glass, so it didn't record anything when someone walked up to the porch. Granted, I could've set the camera up outside, but then the viewing angle would've been off to the side, rather than getting a front view of the person's face. The same was true when I tried to set the Blink camera in front of a normal window in my living room. It still doesn't react to any motion outside, because of the glass. They should try to find a way around this limitation. It's not as essential as correcting that flaw about bright backlighting, but it would be a great improvement.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the camera works very well, with a reasonably sharp color image, a wide-angle lens to capture a fairly sweeping view, and an app that works reasonably well when it comes to viewing live action even when you're miles away (unless you want to record it). And the price is relatively low. But they really do need to fix that backlighting problem, and allow for recording during live viewing.
 These cameras were just what I was looking for. I picked them up on Amazon Prime Day and the price was great. The installation process was extremely easy. I had all five cameras up and running in less than 10 minutes. The video quality is good however there is a slight delay in detecting motion. For areas where you require the camera to be off to the side of the area you want monitored you'll need an aftermarket mount because the supplied mounts do not allow for side to side adjustment. The software has an obvious needed upgrade to allow multiple user accounts on the same system. Currently everyone has to sign in under a single user's email and password. Overall I am really happy with the system and with a few needed upgrades to the software it could be close to perfect for my needs.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>No wires<br/>Extremely easy to install<br/>Good video quality<br/>Cost effective compared to other systems<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Software needs to allow for multiple users<br/>Delay in picking up motion<br/>Mounts only tilt up and down and do not allow for any side to side adjustment
 The system showed up dead on arrival. The main control module was defective so it would not connect to the WiFi. The only solution is to go through an RMA process which take so long, you will be out of the 30 day return policy by the time you receive the replacement parts, send back the broken parts and finally get the unit set up.<br/><br/>Other issues:<br/><br/> - The set up and installation process is far more difficult than the advertisement suggests. It can be done, but it takes several hours longer than suggested and the amount of skill is more than the marketing material implies.<br/> - The battery cover on the cameras is very difficult to remove. Expect sore fingers.<br/> - The support staff admits the older firmware is to blame for several issues yet the firmware is not updated before shipment. The firmware bugs prevent the unit from connecting to the Internet.<br/> - The firmware can only be updated with an Internet connection. The unit has a USB port on the side, but it is not used<br/> - The Blink for Home app crashes on Android tablets<br/> - The Blink app assumes you are on a phone even when you are using a tablet
 Before buying this camera, think what you need from it.<br/>This is NOT a security product for many reason I will describe below.<br/>If the need is to track your pet, see if a package was delivered, maybe. Only if you agree to have multiple false triggered recording and maybe no recording at all of the event you are waiting for.<br/>(pictures attached)<br/><br/>The Details:<br/>I had this system for about a month. I bought it after reading reviews, watching the review on youtube, etc. These reviews that you see on youtube are by non professional, and maybe paid for by the company. It is clear that they are just reading from the spec and never actually experienced how the system works.<br/><br/>For a start, keep in mind that the triggering for the capture is by a sensor, not an image. This causes both false alarms (of course you can't define active zones) and it also causes late triggering. I actually had a package delivered, the recording started after the person was at the door and stopped before he left.. worthless. at least he wasn't taking the package - that would be very annoying to see this video after that.<br/>This is not fixable by software as some people claim.<br/><br/>Another problem is the the camera will start signalling that the battery is empty (reminder - I had it for a month, and I saw the same in 3 cameras) when the temperature goes under 15F (spec says 4F lower boundary, which is also rather high depending on where you live)<br/>I knew the battery was not empty, though it was really hard to explain that to their support.<br/><br/>You can take a snapshot of what the camera is seeing at the moment, but.... you can NOT store the snapshot ! great feature.<br/><br/>The video capture is sometimes corrupt (more that once, in more than one camera). You can't see anything. Hopefully it's not the video that captures the thief that just got your car.<br/><br/>And I would say worst of all is the customer support, maybe the worst I have ever encountered. They are not responsive, and not knowledgeable.<br/>Be ready to take your batteries out, reboot, and power cycle allot. If they get back to you.<br/><br/>I have returned my system and waiting for a refund, or any response back from their customer support.
 The picture and sound quality is phenomenal but the wall mount is not as adjustable as requested so we struggled with getting a good angle of the front yard. In addition, the camera's sensor is either too strong or too low between level 6 and 7 so if I set it to 7, it captures every car that goes by during the day (which I don't want) but if I set it to 6 it does not capture anyone walking up to the steps. (Very frustrating!) To make it worse, the 10 second delay in motion settings doesn't capture the actual motion if someone walks quickly enough.
 I searched for months tying to find the right security cameras that would work best for me. I finally found them with Blink and I got them on a Prime Day deal which made it even better. I love that they’re battery operated so no wires necessary. They are incredibly easy to set up and the video quality is excellent. There are lots of options to customize each camera to your specific needs. There are no monthly fees and the cloud storage is free. I have recommended these to everyone I’ve talked to about it. Hopefully in the future they can make them to where you can speak through the app and your voice will be heard by whomever is there. Be aware that you can only see videos through your phone, it’s not available on computers. However, you can have it on several phones.
 Warning...before you purchase any Blink device, be advised that they have a ridiculous security flaw: their systems purposely will NOT connect to a hidden WiFi network. Yup, that's right, Blink cameras require you to remove a level of security from your WiFi before you can use their camera systems. Ridiculous.<br/>(Yes, I know that with some work hidden WiFi can be discovered by a hacker...but every little bit of cyber-security helps, and to use Blink you have to strip some of your security away, for absolutely no good reason.<br/>Since giving up one piece of security to add one piece of security leaves you exactly where you started, IMO don't buy any Blink products until they fix this ridiculous and unnecessary flaw.<br/>I'm returning my Blink system tomorrow.<br/><br/>2-12-19 UPDATE:<br/><br/>Updating the above, I found a simple way to resolve the "no hidden WiFi" issue...but, more to the point, it was a hack that Blink tech support didn't know about or didn't care to offer.<br/>I then decided that Blink worked well enough - and there is no monitoring charge - that I would purchase a second system for a second client site. Amazon refused to ship to our POB, so I contacted Blink to order directly. I have called every day for the past 4 business days without success. I make the menu selections for "new orders", get transfered to Tech Support overseas and am told thjat there is nobody in Sales to take a call. (Wow!) Just tried 5 minutes ago and got a message that they're closed and that I'm calling after business hours which are until 11 PM (it's 7 PM right now).<br/><br/>Added 1 star, for a total now of 2 stars, because the product actually works. However, left the rating accurately at 2 stars because, clearly, if you need to contact Blink for any reason, you're screwed. All Blink products are, based on my repeated experience, at best 2-stars.
 Bought 1 to test. Very nice video and great night vision. Very easy set up took about 10 minutes. Ok so it makes a video of someone approaching. But if Im a 100 miles away and I show someone, hey look I can view my back door camera. But wait there comes someone over the fence but I cant take a video or picture while viewing live so all I can do is watch,hummm. I hope this is something they can add. Also if you dont set it up so you dont get to many alerts there is no way the batteries will last 2 years. Mine said after 3 days that there were many alerts and batteries wont last. Im on the fence whether to buy more. Update: batteries lasted only 2 months on 1st camera, and thats having it armed for only 6 hours per night getting about 4 to 5 alerts.
 I bought the 2 pack on Prime Day as it was a deal I just couldn't pass up.  I had been researching camera systems for a long time, but just didn't have the money to invest in one yet.  I was really interested in the Arlo, but the cost was too high for me.  Make sure to read a lot of reviews on these to get a clear understanding of what they are capable of.<br/><br/>I've had a good experience with mine.  I mounted on the front and back porch of my house.  I've had a couple false triggers where nothing is in the video or a cloud quickly passes over the sun.  After adjusting the sensitivity, the flowers and leaves blowing in the wind no longer trigger the cameras.  They are a few seconds late to pickup motion, but with the position I have them in, they still show who or what is in view.  If I get a knock at the front door, I'm getting a notification 10 seconds later so I can see who it is before opening.  The night vision isn't very good, but if the porch lights are on, it's ok.  I've only seen the camera is busy show when trying to look at live view once and that was because it was recording motion at the time.  I have a small house so the wifi coverage is great and I have had no trouble with these staying connected.  I had one power outage, but when power was restored the system came back up and cameras connected without me having to do anything.<br/><br/>I bought these because of the low price, no monthly fees, and they are battery powered.  I'd like to someday have a full alarm system with cameras and monitoring, but that just isn't affordable for me right now.  I mainly use them to screen who is at the door to know whether I should open up or not, to know when packages arrive, and then I'll know on the off chance someone starts trying to break in my back door or garage when I'm not home.<br/><br/>If you don't want to spend much money and are looking to get started with a basic camera system, I highly recommend these.  Blink is continuing to update the firmware and the app, so I'm sure they will continue to get better and hopefully see more features in the future.
 Pros:<br/>Very easy to install. I bought a five camera system and from the time I opened the box to the time the last one was up and running was &lt;1 hour including the time spent mounting them. The technical part of setting them up could not be easier.<br/><br/>Excellent picture and sound quality. Hopefully, I’ll never need to use the videos as evidence for police, but there is little doubt in my mind that the images would be more than adequate even at night.<br/><br/>Very customizable. Numerous settings to change to make the alerts and sensitivity exactly how you want them.<br/><br/>Cons: limited safe operating temperature. The web site says 2-113F. That might sound good but where I live, both will be an issue. Temperatures &lt;2 occur several times per winter. Temps &gt;100 are rare for me but it is a black outdoor camera. Poor color choice as it absorbs heat. Today is 77 degrees and partly cloudy, the cameras that are in the shade are reading 84 and the one that is not shaded is at 94. On a sunny 95 degree day (again, occurs several times per year where I live) there is no doubt the camera will get well over 113. The big question is what happens outside those temps, does it ruin the camera or just wear out the batteries faster. Unfortunately I’m likely to find out. I’ll update when I do.<br/><br/>Limited Alexa abilities. Basically she can turn the system on and off and that’s it. It would be great if she could control individual cameras (turn off the camera on my pool for instance when the pool is in use to save battery). Also it works through a third party app so Alexa doesn’t recognize the Blink system as a smart home device. This means Blink control can’t be incorporated into a routine. It would be great to have a routine where Alexa can deactivate the system when I come home and activate it when I leave but it does not
 I waited seems FOREVER for the outdoor model to be available. Ordered one set of the module and one cam, plus a second cam. I received notification that order had shipped and then order when it was supposed to arrive. By the way, ordered through the Blink company, but order was fulfilled by Amazon. When package arrived, the second cam was not in the package. I looked and looked for a phone number to call Blink. A phone number does not exist. I called Amazon, since their packaging was all over the carton and the blue tape. They said they had no record of my order. Finally, after maybe two hours on the phone with Amazon, I was told they just mailed it to me, so they had no record of the order. I sent message to Blink, saying second cam missing from order. No reply. Then a couple days later the cam showed up, also in Amazon packaging. Setup wasn't too bad, except the cam that came with the module was extremely difficult to take off the back, to install the batteries, etc. and then it was a nightmare to snap the back back on. I had to fold up a towel, set the cam on the towel and press down repeatedly with tons of pressure to get the thing closed, BUT I did not have any problem opening or closing the back on the second cam! Soon I realized if ANY little thing BARELY MOVED it triggered record. Even though I tried lowering the sensitivity, it didn't help, so I had to reinstall both the cam on my front door patio and the one on my back door patio in a different location and rearrange all potted plants, remove a wreath from my front door, because the ribbon on it and two little feathers on a Mardi Gras mask were triggering record over and over again, when they so barely moved in a slight breeze. On the back porch if leaves on a potted plant barely moved, same problem. After rearranging my entire patio, cam record was still being triggered by leaves maybe thirty feet away in my next door neighbor's yard, so I had to turn sensitivity down  to 4 to get that to stop. Also, I had to re-mount the front cam so the arm is not extended and the cam is flush against the wall, because the cam itself kept recording and recording if there was even a slight breeze, the cam would jiggle and record over and over again. Another negative: Doesn't have a Windows app! I am visually impaired, so the phone app is pretty much useless to me. I'm almost always sitting at my desktop pc or one of my laptops, but I need to carry my iPad from room to room to have access to my Blink app, which is very inconvenient! PLEASE MAKE A WINDOWS APP... SOON. Also, since cam needs batteries replaced, and I cannot climb a ladder, I had to install the cams within my reach, but they are not secure in a way that would make them difficult and time consuming for someone to just grab in two seconds and walk off with it. Plus, if it was up high I fear it would only capture an unidentifiable image of the top of a thief's head or hat or hoodie. Other than all those negatives, once I dealt with all of the above, both cams are working well and the images are very clear, both in daylight and after dark. A delivery guy put a package near my front door this morning. The cam started recording very quickly and I could see what he looked like very clearly.
 + Easy setup through your 2.4Ghz wi-fi<br/>+ App is basic &amp; easy to use (needs more flexibility with scheduling individual camera, motion zone detection, etc.)<br/>+ Live view is nice<br/>+ Video image with daylight &amp; decent lighting is clear (IR at night is just ok, not great) - field of view is about 110 degree wide, large enough for a 2-car garage drive way or a small-medium size backyard.<br/>+ Free cloud storage / no monthly service charge<br/>+ Battery-operated so you can place virtually anywhere (within the specified wifi range)<br/>+ Reasonably priced (was on sale)<br/><br/>- There's a recording lag -- depending on your sensitivity setting -- I set mine at 5-6 and there's about 1-2 seconds lag from the time motion detected to the actual recording...  so essentially, I would miss a few seconds at the beginning of the recording !!!  It's irritating .. You can set the sensitivity too high but then you can't control the motion zone, so you might get a lot of false alarms ...<br/>- The mounting came with the system is simple but flimsy and not very flexible to adjust (there are 3rd party mounting available)<br/>- The scheduling is currently for the whole system not individual camera.  You can arm/disarm each camera manually.<br/>- Audio is one way.<br/>- There's also a lag/delay notifications (about 15-30 sec.) and when viewing recordings from the cloud (sometimes, I would get the "can't view the clip" at this time message ....)<br/><br/>NEUTRAL:  Battery-life claim of 2 years and system reliability (will update when batteries need replacement under normal usage)<br/><br/>PS:  I've contacted Blink via emails and they have prompt responses. The individual scheduling (hopefully will be added in the future) but the recording lag issue wasn't addressed.
 This is not a security system.  If the safety of your family or property relies on it, look for another solution.  Call it what it is....a home monitor.  Think of it as an extra pair of eyes the same way you ask your neighbor to keep an eye on your home when you go away.  Just like your neighbor, they are not always watching your home.<br/><br/>The Blink system is very unreliable.  You will get "false" positives from the wind blowing or no recording at all even though a person is walking and moving directly in front of the camera.  I have the sensitivity set on maximum and even tonight a delivery person opened my gate and delivered a package.  They crossed the path of 2 cameras but I have no recordings of the event.....  also, I've had the system set to record for 15 seconds and it only records 4 seconds.  I don't have it set to stop recording if there is no motion.  I then set it for 20 seconds and it records 8.  I have to keep resetting it to make it record the 15 seconds.  Night vision doesn't work....at all....<br/><br/>Overall, I have accepted what it is...a home monitor and with multiple cameras set up I can catch most things...just not all things...that happen.  The software is very buggy.  This may work for some people and I'm keeping it until I can find a better solution.  I still think it's over priced for a glorified trail monitor like you would use for hunting.
 I have had two of these cameras for about a year. At first I was not really impressed but because I was used to continuous recording at my old house. I have not had to change my lithium batteries yet. The system now works well with Alexa. I can now ask my Alexa Spot or Show to show the back or front door and she will bring up a live view. I have just bought 5 more cameras to cover my whole house. Blink is an affordable way to cover everything without having to use a lot of wires. The system works well with my Blink app and is easy to schedule. They are working on a beta system to block out small areas in view of the camera so it won't be triggered constantly (ex. Cars going past my house are in a small field of view). I can bring up a live view at any time on my app. It also has free cloud coverage. If you cannot afford a system that would take a lot of time and expense to install this is a great way to cover your house and have peace of mind. It is very user friendly.
 I have setup several different types of security cameras and this was by far the most cumbersome. Although I didn't get any error messages, the instructions were very confusing and I encountered long delays in the process. It was not intuitive.<br/><br/>There is no SD recording available.<br/><br/>The sensor module not only has to stay plugged in continuously, it must be located near your router. I did not realize this when purchasing as I've used other wire-free cameras that don't use this type of technology. Minor complaint, but it's yet another piece of e-clutter taking up space.<br/><br/>What does record provides good audio and video, depending on lighting. But there is severe lag performing nearly every function, including viewing live video (I am running this on a brand new phone, newest Android, with turbo-boosted WiFi).<br/><br/>The mounting options leave a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>I like that it uses rechargeable lithium batteries because they are easy to get; however I will not find out about battery life because this unit will need to be returned.
 This is a nice little system for the price. The cameras are nice, easy to install and easy to hide. Two huge problems. First, someone can simply come and pop the camera off of the mount and walk off with it. Easy as pie. It literally would take 30 seconds to steal 300 dollars worth of equipment. So, you have to put the cameras way out of reach (which is good practice anyway, but still, make it so they don't pop off immediately). Second, the motion detection is absolutely TERRIBLE. I have tried every setting on the stock lithium batteries, so don't listen to the corporate garbage about those items. It will either pick up the tiny motion of leaves blowing or huge garbage trucks. Nothing in between, really.  I actually wanted this to pick up people letting their dogs poop in my yard, etc., but to no avail. I can't recommend these cameras until they fix the motion sensing. Pretty sad if this "passive IR sensor" is really just garbage that can't be fixed.
 cameras are easy to set up and install. video and sound quality are pretty good as well. the biggest issue is that the motion sensor does not always pick up a car coming in the driveway, but will pick up a car driving down the road 20 ft farther away. Same with my entry way camera, it wont always pick up motion as soon as someone enters the view of the camera, it'll be delayed and only catch the tail end as they're leaving or on the edge of the camera view. I've adjusted the sensitivity and all of those settings and still have the issue. Otherwise it seems to hold up good
 One of the major faults I find with this product is the inherent nature of the IR illumination used to light the scene at night.  IR light in total darkness tends to whiteout the subject making identification all but impossible.  I contacted their customer service who referred me to their customer forum where I discovered that the issue is part of the nature of the beast.  They did however offer to replace my two units.  Here is how I solved the problem as I posted it a few minutes ago on their forum:<br/><br/>I finally solved my issue. Apparently the boneheads at Blink don’t understand their own product and the characteristics of IR light in total darkness with its tendency to white out subjects. They offered to replace my two cameras which would have been a waste of time and effort for all involved. I purchased the Mr. Beams light (available on Amazon) that I showed earlier in the thread - a 35 lumen, battery operated, motion detection light meant to light stairways etc. By turning off the IR light in the camera and placing the light on my front porch, any person now activating the camera is clearly shown in color. I think their alleged engineers need to re-visit the drawing board!<br/><br/>Bottom line:  The cameras do work okay, but if night security is of interest to you, either get a security camera that functions properly in total darkness (unlike these units) or purchase an ancillary motion detector light that will light the scene when the camera is activated being sure to set the internal IR light to off in the settings.
 Update- I installed a camera at my front door and the battery lasted 2.5 months. The part that annoys me is that I didn't get any kind of warning. I woke up this morning with a notification that the system failed to arm, went to the app and saw that the battery is dead. That's it. This sucks, I feel the system should be smart enough to tell you that the battery is about to die and give you a heads up Of a few days, perhaps a week. I won't be able to replace the battery for another 2 days.<br/><br/>Granted, the battery has been on 24hrs/day, people do come in and out of the house, and I have the camera record 15 sec clips. Maybe that's a reasonable duration. I expected the batteries to last about 6 months given the average 2 year estimate that is mentioned in the specs. That said, it makes more sense to plug it in if possible.<br/><br/>Original review-<br/>For the price I paid on Prime day, and the fact that the storage of recordings is free, I'd say that it's an OK system. The wall mount is horrible, they could have spent a bit more and provided a somewhat decent mount. The video quality is nothing to write home about. There are no bells and whistles, it's not possible to adjust much when it comes to the video settings. I'm sure the next version of this camera will be better.
 The Blink XT is very basic. You may see who stole your packages and maybe get a glimpse of someone on your property but you won't be able to really monitor anything because 1) very limited ability to set zones for motion detection 2) no way to set schedules for individual cameras (only the system) 3) Night time motion vision is very limited. 4) long clips will wear down your battery and take forever to load.<br/><br/>Everything is cloud based which can be a good thing but that also means you are at the mercy of the internet to see your files. There is a lot of anxiety that comes with getting an alert and not being able to see either the file or a live view because "System busy" or it just won't connect.<br/><br/>The mounting brackets that come with these outdoor cameras are also woefully insufficient. You will have to buy 3rd party mounts or your cameras will flop around with any wind.<br/><br/>On the plus side, they are very easy to set up and easily movable.<br/><br/>Hopefully Blink/Amazon will continue to add features. Basic software features such as desktop aps, more camera controls in the mobile ap, etc. would make this product more user friendly.

It is weather proof though, so I moved the cameras outside. I've only had it for a week and am loving it. It was incredibly easy to set up, like 5 minutes for 2 cameras and has worked flawlessly. Really easy to mount too, I used one sheet rock screw and it took 5 seconds. I even found out that I have a COYOTE problem! The chief of police was excited to get some real proof and great night video - see attached!
 Ok, blink customer service promptly replaced one of my defective units with a new camera so I am upgrading to 4 stars.  Why not five, because there are a few shortcomings that I find almost deal breakers.<br/>1, wifi dependent creating a security vulnerability if the wifi goes out.<br/>2, motion detection is not optical meaning it won't work through glass or distance.<br/>3, the mounting bracket is both garbage and risky.  It does not securly attach to the camera. You could easily loose a camera from a detach fall.<br/><br/>Other than the above 3 shortcomings it's a pretty good set-up for the techno dunce.  My recommendation if you have access to an actual outlet just go with an outdoor zumodo.<br/><br/>So far not so good.  I have the 2 unit system and continue to have multiple connection failures from 20 to 40 foot ranges.  WiFi is full bars but sync module is very week.  It's obviously a failure in design and knowing that blink should include 2 modules in a 2 blink system.  I'll continue to position the module but if I can't get it to connect soon it's going back.
 I have two camera systems. The Ring Spotlight monitors the front of our house and the Blink is set up in our alley. I’ve found the Blink to be far inferior in many ways. First, it is not as securely attached. While mounting it fell several times and could be easily knocked off or stolen by a passerby in our alley. The Ring comes with an adjustable mount that can be tightened and needs to be firmly pulled to unattach from the ball socket. Second is the inconsistency in recording “events” in our alley. It will record several clips of leaves blowing but completely miss people walking by, cars, etc. It catches about 50% of the activity back there and I’ve fiddled with the settings for about 3 weeks. The Ring has not missed any activity. Third it is impossible to get a live feed. Every. Single. Time. I have tried to view a live feed it has failed and given me a “live view failed” response. My router is closer to the Blink than the Ring so I know that is not a contributing factor.  While the price is right on the Blink it fails to deliver in many ways.
 We got a two camera system to monitor our front door and outside of our house after a couple of thefts around our house.  The system is quick and easy to install.  At first we had some issues with transmission and reliability, but I was able to overcome this with an inexpensive wifi repeater located close to the cameras and the hub.  I looked at some wired and some wireless systems.  This one offers the lowest possible cost of use and ownership--not only because the up front cost is low, but also because there are no monitoring or storage fees associated.  You won't get that from most systems or a security firm.  The only lacking feature is two way audio, but after thinking about it, that's a feature which really held little value for us.  If you just need to know what is going on at your home in real time, I do not think you can do better.  It really could not be any easier to install.  I did contact support once for advice, and had a quick response that addressed the issue.
 These cameras are so flexible and the quality is excellent. The videos get stored in the Amazon cloud and away from intruders who want to destroy footage of their work. They can be controlled by Amazon devices as the company was bought by Amazon so its fully integrated and cloud storage is free. They also allow you to turn on the video and have access to audible sounds through an app on your mobile device so you can always check in when away from the house. This also will give you alerts when there is any motion detected within 30 feet of your camera. You cant talk to people like "Ring" but you can hear what they are doing to compliment the video.<br/>Edit: the reason the batteries last so long is that there is a base station that needs to be plugged in to a power outlet and configured to talk with your WiFi router and all the cameras connect to that base station.
 This is most likely the simplest system to set up and use. It's completely wireless and provides high quality motion detected video. With simplicity comes a lack of functionality and features. The app that controls the cameras only offers a plain and simple "all cameras attached" to be active or off. You cannot have one camera running while another is off via the schedules. You need to get another hub ($$) in order to control cameras differently with schedules.<br/>The cameras do have the ability to show live video with sound, but you cannot record the live video. You have to rely on the motion detection to capture video. Ring allows you to capture live video on demand and you can talk back.<br/>One of the best feature that makes this system so easy to set up, is that it is completely wireless. It runs on batteries so no need to run electrical or to the cameras. Just put in the batteries and screw in the mounts. The biggest draw backs to this system is, that's right, it runs on batteries. Let me be clear, THE BATTERIES DO NOT LAST LONG. if you have a medium to high traffic area you might get 3 months out of the batteries. If you're camera is in an area where it's only on at night and rarely gets triggered, you will get the long life the company touts. Another thing to note, it requires the premium "ultimate lithium" batteries. These batteries are not cheap. That being said, the company is very responsive and will do their best to make you happy. I have had several communications with them and they try to make it right.<br/>There is a limited storage allowance which is free but a huge complaint of mine. Let's say a thief steals something from your front porch at 7am, then there is a high volume of traffic throughout the day (gardener, mailman, painter...) the video from the morning will get over written with the activities from the latter part of the day. Erasing all evidence of the morning robbery.<br/>Given the chance to do it all over again, i would get the Ring video doorbell system. It allows for unlimited storage and no need to constantly change batteries. A cost savings over time.<br/>Pros:<br/>Cheaper than most systems<br/>Very easy to set up<br/>Wireless, can be installed absolutely anywhere (within wifi router range)<br/>App allows you to view and download recorded video<br/>Limited video storage is free<br/>Customer service is fantastic<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Battery life is extremely low (1-3 months) in high traffic areas<br/>App does not allow capture of live video feed<br/>App does not allow individual camera schedules<br/>Limited storage of video, oldest video gets overwritten<br/>Must be within range of both the Blink hub AND your wifi router.<br/>No computer access to app or app features
 If you're looking for a product with lots of bells and whistles. This isn't it. For me, thats ok. It's super easy to use and serves its purpose wonderfully!..We'll be purchasing another camera soon!...The plus side, theres no monitoring fee and the videos can be saved for up to 1 year (as long as you don't run out of storage) and to prevent that any video clip can be added to your phones picture section. You can also just delete any clip you don't want to save on the app. I've noticed people complaining about the battery life...Not sure about that yet as our system has only been up for a few weeks and I "disarm" the system usually when we're home. Also, if you decide to watch the live view,the system wont record at the same time. To me, thats not a big deal at all however the good news is the company is working on a possible fix to that. :)....The system doesn't have a "talk back" feature to where if theres an intruder inside you can tell them you're calling the police. That would be a awesome update but maybe they would have to start charging for that feature and if thats the case I'll keep the free version. The cameras are in HD and the sound quality is good.

I’ve literally recieved 4 notifications in one minute that activity is happening on the camera. Oops now 5. I’m on a sensitivity setting of 4 and even the ANTS down on the grass are like,  “ WTF man, we aren’t even moving, we tryin to sleep. Take that thing back homeboy or your ass is gonna get robbed again!” Check that, moved sensitivity button to 3 and we are now up to 12 notifications as im writing this with absolutey NO activity on the video. And yes that’s right, we left a vehicle unlocked and some spode tweaker punk ransacked a baby bag out of our car. Thanks so much BLINK you POS!<br/>I’ve tried giving this thing a chance and have troubleshooted for about 5 months. The lithium batteries also went dead after 45 days. The best part is when i put the sensitivity on 10 and then go outside and wave my arms like a complete moron to trigger the sensors, I get absolutely nothing. No wait I lied, I get my neighbors pointing and laughing. This product clearly sux wang so please save your money. PS , 20 Notifications popped on telling me that there was activity and still nothing except maybe the neighborhood cat shaking his head in disgust.
 This is so mad and dump. So they waste ton of energy if you want to use the hd setting which is about the same as best quality and you have to wait 10 second till the next recording start by them your f becuase someone might do so much in 10 second like break in to your car. This happen to me. This cameras haven’t safe me yet :((((. They poor quality, and their a pain to open. When the battery are replace you have to wait about 10 second or something like that for the battery replacement notification goes away if you do not do this the camera still not going to work<br/>I got the “best recharging battery for this and I can’t use them” - also my cameras keep blinking used to be solid blue light now they blink<br/>No idea why and sometime half the screen show the. Other have look random and I can review the view gives me a error. I should had got Arlo but I was trying to be cheap :( my car as been broke into 3 times and while having this cameras.
 I have purchased two cameras from the Blink and right from the beginning I noticed image distortion on both cameras, I contacted Blink customer support and this is where the nightmare started. Blink either have issues with tracking emails or open cases or they hire people that incompetent for the Customer Support position. I've been accuse of not replying back to Blink with the information needed, that will get your blood flowing especially when in fact you did reply back to them. I've purchased a second set of Blink cameras thinking that I may just got the faulty unit (again their customer support did not assist in the return process, I had to fight for my rights to return the faulty hardware) Second purchase of 3 cameras had exactly the same issue with all 3 cameras and again I had to contact their incompetent *customer support* They made feel that I've purchased the worst product. All cameras had the yellow stain right in the middle (see the attached pictures) I've been asked to clean the lease from grease. Like I didn't think of that before they said that 😏  Constantly faulty motion alerts that will annoy the heck out of you, one camera had a blurry image display, it was pretty bad that I could not recognize an object and that beats the point of having "security cameras"  Two years ago i've purchased a Chinese no brand doggy cam 720p for $25 and it still works and the image quality of the 720p camera is a lot better than the Blinks "1080p"<br/>I see that some people have had good experience with these cameras but unfortunately I didn't receive good quality Blink cameras and their Customer Support was a nightmare to deal with. I'm in the process returning all 5 cameras back to Blink and will be buying something else.<br/>Arlo Pro perhaps?
 I chose this system because of the wireless functionality, 2 year battery life, and IFTTT support.<br/><br/>Battery Life of 2 years: the first camera went offline within 2 months. After replacing the batteries the camera lasted a week<br/><br/>IFTTT support: These are supposed to be compatible with IFTTT. I have made multiple attempts to set up automatic arming and disarming of my system based on my phone's location. I cannot get the event to trigger. I have contacted Blink customer support on this issue and although they created the IFTTT applet they cannot advise on how to use it or to troubleshoot any issues. They will only refer me to IFTTT support which is only accessible by e-mail and most often do not respond to requests..<br/><br/>To top it off, the mounts for these cameras are terrible. The camera's keep falling off the mounts.
 This was for a 3 camera system. We didn’t buy this from Amazon. The good part of the camera was the very easy setup. We had really hoped this was a good outdoor camera to go with our indoor cameras that are from a different brand. It came on a Wednesday and up and running within a half an hour for all three cameras that came with the bundle. It was the black XT one. We should of read the review first but we didn’t. It does not record thru a window pane, you only get a live shot, it’s not recording. But since they were going to be outside it wasn’t a problem.  The first camera attempt outside, didn’t go well, it was set up to far out of range of the module, so we moved it closer. The alerts are at least 15 seconds after the event, that’s bad. Only one person at a time can look at the alert.  You have to refresh the 30 second button constantly when looking at it. The images are much smaller on the camera compared to the exact shot taken by our indoor camera. It did not record a personal walking on our sidewalk in front of the house, nor the cars passing the house. It keeps a record on you smart phone/tablet of past recordings, getting rid of the oldest to make room for the newest when you reach the max time allowed. We didn’t like the idea of the delay when there was a alert.  We were not happy with it and so 4 days after we got it, we sent it back. READ THE GOOD AND BAD REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING
 1 mo update..have four now.. all good.. weve found balance between recording a lot and when to back off.. for the cats we turned off the ir illuminator  because it clicks and has a red light to bolster its night vision ( many reviewers copmplained this was their cam goin haywire!???. Its not) i didnt want to annoy them and they clearly notice it so doing that changes a super clear infared pic to a lowlight day looking one but they are happy and if somethin is happenin that i need more clarity , i just re enslable it briefly..)<br/><br/>I see a lot of folks complaining about cars and wind.. thats Any cam.. get used to it or face it a diff way.. if its very windy i smtms disable briefly.. if you lower sensitivity its not going to catch motion as far as well..<br/>We have a front facing porch on usb and a side facing tree so we catch a lot.. if really windy i often give tree some downtime whileb porch goes to town.. both catch cars.. tree one i could turn more towards house diirection if i need it to not detect cars.. cars are hot so it can detect them further than people so u hafta do the people test to know where it will trip..<br/>As far as clips w no action.. often a second clip that caught the end of event triggers and a lot of times its a cat or squirrel that trips it but then jumps outa view.. mine have never gone off for no reason..<br/>Also i noticed in website qna theres a specific way to set up if u have a second extender wifi..<br/>  I really think a lot of the negatives on here could have been solved by working with the cam and reading through those qna.. i dunno.. maybe theyre fake negative review?.. we r very happy so far..<br/>Update..<br/><br/>Been a week..<br/>Bought the wasserstein 16' weather resistant micro usb for my porch ( opening usb part makes it not as weatherproof but i have a covered porch)..<br/><br/>and some wall mount 360degree weatherproof w sun visor hard plastic mounts for both cameras.. Verrrry happy w both.. The plastic cases have 5 tiny screws but they are recessed well so they fall right in the little hole all lined up so easy ..the cases have a hole  for usb but its small and the weather res. usb is thicker n flatter so heres what i did..<br/>#First i drilled the hole out to fit cord..<br/><br/>#Then i tested cord without batteries to be sure its not a dud..<br/><br/>#Then i put brand new batteries as backups ( the others were fine but theyre cheap and id like to go as long as possible without messing with it<br/><br/>#Then i made sure usb tight and screwed closed being careful not to tug on cord<br/><br/>#Then i used electrical tape around cord hole and also put 5 pieces over screws to prevent moisture.. I folded little tabs so i can get tape off agan<br/><br/># Then i made sure i had plenty of slack so i could screw on camera to mount without loosening usb.. I also made sure the cord is up over something like a hook ( i used shutter) so the weight wont ever pull on it<br/><br/>NOW THAT IVE READ UP ON MOTION CAMERAS AND READ ALL THE QNA ON THE BLINK SITE I LIKE THEM EVEN MORE!<br/>I think a lot of problems people have are<br/>1) they dont understand how motion sensor works ( u didnt)<br/>2) they have them positioned badly or sensors not set right<br/>3) its only as good as your wifi si signal strength and placement of sync and caneras really matter ( my sinc is halfway from cable box and halfway to cameras).. Its stuck up in front window w 2 sided tape so theres not a lot of building it has to go through.. We also have 3 of those lil octagon plug in  signal amplifiers in the house and a good strong wifi ( sufficient for gaming)<br/><br/>Motion is triggered more easily from walking across vs straight at so keep that in mind<br/>Youll likely have to pkay with settings on sunny days n rainy days to get whats right for you..<br/>  I have found when i change setting.. I note it by changing name if canera for ex: i put 5 night 7 day.. Then i know if i look back at a clip that those were the settings ( and obviously i can tell from clip if it was day ir night)<br/>Then i save certain clips for comparison later..<br/>  So far ive found i like a 5 @ night and 7 day..as far as a person at your door thats a lot if body heat so even in a 2 they trigger it when close.. Our access to door requires they walk parallel to the house then turn to go up to door.. This is particularly good because they trigger it walking parallel because its facing straight out ..<br/>  Ive also found i like to set it up on a schedule that goes overnight but goes off at 8 when theres a million cars in neighborhood driving by..then i enable it whatever time in morning i want when i alter day settings<br/>  And lastly i myself prefer to set my porch one higher sensitivity and resolution since its not using battery.. but disable the alerts on my phone so it doesnt drive me bonkers.. Then i check in on the app a few times a day or when im expecting a person or pkg.. Its easy enough to quickly view n delete.. Ive also found its common to have a clip just following event that doesnt show the trigger ..usually bacause it just caught the end of the motion on previous clip..<br/><br/>Please please read all the qna etc.. On the site..even if you think it doesnt pertain to you there is so much od info!<br/><br/>HOPE THIS HELPS!<br/>-------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>...much much sooner... They really arent that expensive..they are 12.99 for 12!!!! Bout $2 per camera!!!!<br/>.....the site says avg use is about 5- 10 second clips a day.. Wich once you get it set right and fine tune the placement and settings is probably about right..<br/>HOWEVER...<br/>When you first get it 3 things will happen<br/>1) youre going to move it a hundred times till u have it just right<br/>2) youre going to have to check out new spot ( now dumb me..i kept using live view vs snapshot at first) as well as the testing of new settings!<br/>3) its a new toy so whoever has access is gonna keep checking live feed cuz uts just cool and fun!<br/><br/>When you live feed or motion detect you are cutting into battery life!!!.. Once its set you wont do it so much<br/><br/>+++++Why i bought it...  Good reviews.. Ok price..wireless ( wich means that sometimes if you have an issue.. Its placement of sync device or your internet and not the camera) easy installation and setup.. If i wasnt overthinking it prob would have been 10 min.. Realllyyy easy and im not good with that stuff☺+++<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Cons...<br/>@Cant use w computer yet ( dont forget they are always working on updates)..  I use smartphone and 🔥fire tablet),<br/>@You cant record during live view ( again i believe theyre working on it)<br/>@You have to balance how long and close together clips with battery usage<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/> Pros<br/>❤ So easy<br/>❤no hardwiring.. Easy to move around<br/>❤great pic quality. Wide view<br/>❤weatherproof<br/>❤if inside ( cuz youll lose waterproofing) you can buy a micro usb and never use any battery!!!<br/>❤peace of mind when away or if you want to see whats happening if soneone unknown is at your door ( you cant talk with them but you can asess if youd even want to<br/>❤check on pets,kids, sposes,or elderly parents<br/>❤some very cool features like blurring out zones that might trip motion<br/>❤affordable price<br/>❤can have up to 10 cameras on one sync<br/>❤settings are super quick on fire tablet to change so you can adjust for night..wind.. Schedule...i just set it before i go to work<br/>❤you can share vid clips<br/>❤you can stretch video of live feed to zoom<br/>❤small and descreet<br/>❤ Lots of accessories like 360mounts with little sun\ rain awnings skins<br/>❤an amazon company<br/>❤free cloud storage<br/><br/>So the ❤❤❤❤ for me outweigh the @<br/><br/>Overall if it doesnt stop working ,i can totally live with the cons and i do believe they will update and improve<br/><br/>Lets face it.. If you want 24/7 live and constant record and you're after mastermind criminals this prob isnt for you  but you're going to be payiin a lot for that..<br/>...but if you wanna maybe catch some dumb ones or even deter them .. And are mostly looking to keep an eye on things n people n pets i think you'll like it..<br/><br/>I ordered the 2 camera system because they offered for it to be in 3 monthly installments and i guessed i would likely want two even though one civers a lot!!..<br/>Well i was right.. Now i want one more at least for inside<br/><br/>So my advice is buy a bunch if batreries right away..( Not recharge not reg not ion) the rught ones.. If inside use a usb.. And taje time to watch and read all the info on the website.. I learned a lottttt on there ( i suspect a lot of problems are from people not learning enough about the device)<br/><br/>I will update!
 Do Not waste your money on this camera system as I did and purchased thru blinkforhome so, I cannot even return it as Blink Customer service says that this flaw is outside the refund policy which means you will be owning a totally useless system until they address the issue. Their PIR sensors are too sensitive and It ends up picking up shadows,sun lights pretty much everything and generates hundreds of false alerts during the day so you end up disabling the camera and having a dummy camera outside.This has been a common issue across many XT customers and If you want to know more about the flaw and other customers complains please look it up on the blinkforhome community as "blink-xt-too-sensitive"
 I actually bought a 4 camera system from QVC because the price was lower and they offered installment payments, so I will not show up as an Amazon verified purchaser, but I do own the system nonetheless.<br/><br/>This camera system is not for serious home security, it looks like something Amazon threw together and marketed without serious design work. Here are some of the myriad reasons this is NOT a serious home security camera system.<br/><br/>1) There are apps for phones and tablets, but nothing for desktop or laptop computers.<br/>2) Live viewing is limited to 30 seconds before you have to click an acknowledgement to view another 30 seconds.<br/>3) You cannot record from live view, recording has to be activated by the motion sensors, so if you see something  you want to record, you are out of luck.<br/>4) Recordings are limited to 60 seconds with a minimum wait of 10 s before recording can be restarted. So you better hope that the crime is finished in 60 seconds or less.<br/>5) If a crime takes place, you will not know about it until the recording is finished, stored on the Blink server, and a notification is sent to you. Since my recording time is 60 seconds, that means I will not be notified until more than a minute after the crime has happened.<br/>6) The recordings have to go to the Blink servers where the are stored, which has positives and several negatives. The positive is that you can access the recordings from anywhere you have an internet connection. The negatives are, you can only access the recordings on a phone or tablet. You do have the option to email the files or store them in Dropbox, among other options.<br/>7) There are no time and date stamps on the recordings. The file name has the date and time, but that would be useless in court since file names can be altered.<br/>8) There are no options on locations to save downloaded video clips. It goes to you "movies" folder and if you don't like it, too bad, Amazon doesn't care! I moved my storage to my SD card and next time I checked Blink had moved it back and was saving video clips in intenal storage agains.<br/>9) Camera settings change without the user changing them. I found the settings for, clip length, retrigger time, and end clip early option all reset to default modes on several occasions.<br/>10) Clip length end early, even when the end early otion is turned off.<br/><br/>So if you thought you were getting a system that you could leave on to monitor your home, with the option to rcord suspicious events, you will be disappointed, this is nothing like that. In addition to that, Amazon apparently resets your settings to suit their needs and not yours.<br/><br/>There is even more, but you get the point, this is a gimmick item, that should not be advertised as a serious home security monitoring system.<br/><br/>I do not recommend this item, except as a novelty item.
 Setting up these cameras has been one of the most frustrating things I have done in a long time. Out of the box, the central hub would not work. It took literally 3 days of troubleshooting back and forth over multiple conversations with the customer service team over at Blink to get my sync hub working. I finally get that working, and one of the cameras that was included in my package was a dud and completely non-functional. I know it wasn't a user error, because I had already set up the others, and went through every troubleshooting guide I could find for them online. Still waiting to hear back from Blink on if they are going to replace the malfunctioning camera.<br/><br/>In terms of functionality (you know, once you spend several hours of your life talking to customer service to get this stuff working), these are pretty decent. It's a simple system, but the sensitivity seems pretty good and the image quality is definitely acceptable for its purpose. There is a rather significant delay between motion and notification though-- a solid 30 seconds or so.<br/><br/>The other thing is the actual use friendliness of the app. If you are wanting to do perimeter cameras around your house that will always be on or off, perfect. Great system (other than the setup annoyances). However, being able to individually control the cameras is tedious. There are no options for "scenes" or sets. If you want one camera to stay on all the time (like if you have a side door or basement door that you always want monitored), you will have to go in and manually turn all of the other ones on or off each time. If you link some of the Blink interior cameras to the system (or use some of these as interior), you will have to always be switching between which outside cameras you want on and which inside cameras you want on, because you cannot program sets of cameras. There are significantly less expensive options on the market that will let you do basic scenes ("home" mode where only outdoor ones are active, "away" or "night" mode where all are active, etc), so it is shocking that Blink-- a company owned by Amazon for goodness sakes-- wouldn't have this option. One would think that with as much advancements as they are making in home automation with their Echo products and their acquisition of Ring, they would allow for such a basic programming function.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't know that it would be worth the hassle to send these back after how much time I spent getting the system working and the fact that I am reasonably pleased with the cameras that do work. But, I cannot honestly say that I would purchase this system again after my experiences with it so far.
 This camera is easy to use and has a great app. I use it to monitor my front door against vandalism and/or theft. It works great! The size is small, the instructions are great.<br/><br/>However there is one downside that I communicated with the manufacturer. The mount that the camera comes with it not the best. With one little screw, it screws into whatever you want easily. Then the camera just "snaps" onto the plastic mount. The issue I have is that the camera can very easily be removed with one hand off the mount—for instance by a thief!<br/><br/>I feel that the mount should at the very least have a latch so that you would need two hands to remove the camera. OR better yet, have a way to lock the camera onto the mount. The way it works now, someone can easily knock the camera off the mount with a stick or a pole. The way the camera "snaps" onto the mount is weak. This is something the manufacturer needs to revisit.
 These cameras are super simple to set up but there are 2 major flaws: (1) the lack of location based arming. The system should automatically arm (cameras should be ready to record) when my connected phone is a particular distance from the base. It’s too hard to remember to manually arm the cameras every time I leave home. (2) the system should give the option to stay on (recording) all the time and without the indicator lights. The reason for #2: what if I’m home and there is a home invasion. I don’t have time to arm the cameras.
 So far so good. Arrived today, Installed app, set up account and had all cameras up and running in about 20 min.  Installing cameras outside took longer than expected due to experimenting with camera locations and angles. I am impressed with this system. If the batteries last just 75% of the advertised lifespan, I will be happy. Daytime picture quality is great and night time is also very clear. THE ONE NEGATIVE IS THIS SYSTEM WIL NOT WORK WITH AMAZON FIRE. So I deducted one star for this. Since Amazon now owns Blink it should be a no brainer for Amazon to provide an app for the system to work with Fire. HINT HINT AMAZON
 Internet is an issue in rural country. I have satellite with crap service but we have a fairly good range to the router/modem. Our upload is never at 2gbps.<br/>I found out the hard way with the module is, if your internet speed doesn’t stay 2 gbps higher - you’ll lose the module. It’s not specifically stated any place on the box for specs and unless you located one of their erranious PDFs online - you’ll be annoyed. The app won’t tell you either. It’ll just keep you in the setup loop of disconnecting over and over. I wanted to pull my hair out.<br/>The second issue: I have VZW - got an air card. The dang module is 2.4 GHz. In 2019, I’d expect companies to move to 5. I gather 2.4 is what majority have but there’s too much interference on that channel. Hence why 5 is available now.<br/>The third issue: the module disconnects from internet and camera every time after two hours of being connected. The range on the module is atrocious. I have the air card sitting 3” away from the module. I have a camera 8” on a tree about 20” away from the module, doesn’t matter if it’s under our HUGE picture window crows fly to the tree, the signal drops. There’s nothing in between the devices. I’ve tried placing the module outside, straight in front of the camera, no dice.<br/>It also will not keep the internet.<br/>Coupled with those three issues I’d pass on this camera if you rely on anything other than coax or fiber for internet, these camera will fail. Their cheap for a reason.

If you want a truly wireless camera that doesn't cost a fortune this may be it. The setup was easy; everything is controlled/accessed from the phone app. Take my advice--if your home network acts up, you may find the whole system missing when you open the app. Don't mess with any of it till you have rebooted your modem and router.<br/><br/>I found the included mounting bracket to be a joke--aftermarket ones are readily available and inexpensive. Even the aftermarket ones depend on a "crush-fit" snap-in device. These cameras can easily be stolen. The perps would (hopefully) have their images on the Blink servers. They give you quite a bit of free storage, which is monitored from the app. The app even lets you know if a camera is using resources needlessly, so you can tweak the aim or sensitivity. You can also turn off and on the motion-detecting feature of any camera on your account for any length of time.<br/><br/>I have two cameras each at least 100 ft from the sync module with no signal issues. I even tested one about 200 ft away with no problem.<br/><br/>My 5th star is missing for one main reason--you can't currently view or save videos from a computer. So you have to choose to download any video to the phone from the cloud, then move the video to your computer. It would also be better to have a mounting system that would make the camera more secure.<br/><br/>My sample video shows how the birds found this camera to be fascinating. The squirrels are afraid of it and leave it alone.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R1ZCHPN70DHHU9"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Nl9lsbQ4S.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/9128bPIxZqS.png"/> I found that if these cameras see a lot of movement ( cars going by or more than 3 notifications a day. ) the battery will only last a few months. Cheap and easy enough to change $3<br/>Like I don’t need power. I mounted one across the street on a tree. It will even pick up a cat in My driveway. Or the guy that didn’t pick up after his dog. I like when I see a package is delivered when I am at work.
 First - QVC is selling a pack of 4 XT cameras and a sync module for $250 right now.  I bought two of them - it's the best deal out there.  Black Friday had some good deals on Amazon, but QVC was better.<br/><br/>Okay, I received my 4 packs, and I loved how easy the setup was.<br/>I will say that a lot of reviewers complain about the range.  I bought two setups, so I have two sync modules, one connected to my main wifi router, and one connected to my wifi range extender that has better reach to my back yard and far side of my house.  I have several cameras connected to each one and I have cameras at the back corner of my backyard 80' away, and other corners of my house with no problem.  If you have a large house with wifi deadspots, or your router isn't centrally located, or you have an older router, definitely look into upgrading your router/model and get a range extender.  Use speedtest.net to make sure you put your sync module in a good spot, and use the Blink app to make sure all connections are solid.  The nice thing about using more sync modules is that you can disable all the cameras assigned to a sync module if you don't want them recording.  So if you're home, and you have your interior cameras all assigned to their own sync module, you can just turn off motion and recording, but leave the outside cameras active - the more sync modules, the more control you have and the more range you have (as long as they have good wifi connection).<br/><br/>My biggest concern is about the mounts.  Unless the camera is far up high and out of the reach of would-be vandals/thieves, the mounts aren't going to protect the camera at all.  I'm looking into solutions including third part external mounts to make it more robust - I may even Jerry-rig something in a hardened case in some parts - though it will look ugly.  Note that really anything short of a detention-grade vandal proof IK10 rated camera is going to have this issue, but i don't want my house looking like a prison.  The design of these is clean and small, not bulky and vandalproof.  I will likely buy some third part outer-shells and paint them the color of my house so they're less noticeable.  My problem is my porch camera is easily within reach of anyone coming to my door, so it can easily be ripped off and stolen or damaged.  Again, any brand of camera can be damaged.<br/><br/>I'm also looking into buying extension cables to hardwire them to an outlet inside of my house/garage - I don't mind drilling a small hole depending on location.  I don't have any illusion that the batteries will actually last two years. Battery life will depend on how many times the camera is triggered, how often you access it, how high the quality is, how long the clips are set to, etc etc.  I will definitely be better off with external power in most locations.  I even see a solar panel on Amazon that's set up for the Blink, and I may look into it for my backyard corner cameras if I can't get power out there.<br/><br/>Video quality is good.  I do have to turn down the IR illumination sensitivity down if I want to see someone's face at night when they're up close within 4-5 feet, otherwise it will wash out.  So my rule is this:  If my camera is out of reach (10' high +, I set to medium or high power). If it's in an area that doesn't need a far IR reach like my front porch or tool shed, I set it to low so it doesn't blow out the image.  I'm seriously looking into third party IR Illuminators to cast IR light into my driveway or far parts of my yard.  That way I can set the cameras to low power for up close, and they'll pick up the IR light from my external illuminators for a far view - good ones can get expensive though.<br/><br/>I'm going to be trying some different mounts and other tweaks to the system, so I'll update if I come across anything that works well.<br/><br/>For the cost and ease of use, this is a great system (especially at the QVC price).  Ring, Arlo, etc all have their problems, but at least the Blink system seems to have good support, they are working on updates according to their forums, and have a decent selection of third party accessories.<br/>Would love to see motion zones fully implemented - I see instructions on their website for it, but i don't see how I can use it in my app.  Also, looks like they're making a 105dB Blink Siren so you can scare away intruders when you're gone.  Would love to see that come out for sale.<br/><br/>Hope this helped anyone contemplating buying this system.
 I Wanted to wait to write my review until I have had the system for over a month based on some of the other reviews listed here. I found the system to be easy to install, very good quality of picture, and works as advertised with capturing motion activity.<br/>Install was a breeze. I followed the directions and didn’t have any problems with connectivity or camera recognition. My house is larger and the cameras are set up across multiple levels, through walls &amp; floors &amp; have no issues with connecting. I DO have a Google wifi whole home system which helps with signal strength. I tested the cameras at each location prior to mounting to ensure I was capturing what I wanted, and then mounted. The mounts are fine, easy to install with one screw. I haven’t had the issue some others have had with them being loose and flimsy.<br/>Battery life was another on Erin as many complained of having to replace within a week or two. I have one camera set up in a high traffic area (expecting that I would be shortening the battery life). It probably catches 20-30 events a day (our dog sets the motion off often). I received an alert after two weeks that I was shortening the battery life with tips on how to correct. A month in and still going strong with the original batteries in all five cameras. We are in the middle of the country, so weather has been in the 20-60 degree range for the time we have had the cameras operating.<br/>The alerts are fine, a little delayed but I knew that going in. We have one camera that pics up “moving steam” at night, on normal sensitivity. The quality of the pictures are great for our needs and it does pick up sounds. We laugh a lot as the cameras pick up bugs walking across the lenses, birds flying by or landing on the camera, and even a neighbors cat passing through. The live view is nice as you can watch as long as needed. The ability to adjust video clip length is great as well, as we have various l ngths based on positioning. Night view is as clear as night view is (think local news night view traffic cam) but fine for our needs.<br/>I have recommended this system to my family and friends and would to others as well. (See two photos)
 I've bought the 1 outdoor camera kit with sync module. Setup went well enough, and it works.<br/><br/>Pros: You can put batteries in it, or use a micro USB for power (and your batteries inside then become a backup option).<br/>This does work. You can go online when you setup your account, to settings, and have recording time from 5 seconds to 60 seconds, set the quality of the video, motion sensitivity, etc. These all work well, and the camera can be as high quality  as 3mp. You only have so much space, so how high quality determines how fast you use it up. It then rolls the oldest recordings off to make room for the latest.<br/><br/>The quality is decent, simply, I have no real complaints about that part of it.<br/><br/>Cons: no Micro SD card option. It needs to have at least to 128gb to be useful to me. Anything less will only loop a couple of hours of good quality footage that these cameras are capable of. Also, it needs 2 way audio options added.<br/><br/>One of the good things is you can disable the blue light in the cameras so nothing shows when it is recording. I'd like to be able to disable all lights (there is a red one I believe is the color that is a dead giveaway to the camera's location).<br/><br/>I'll keep the one. But, will go with other options for more cameras so they have micro SD storage for when wifi goes down, 2 way audio options as well. I look forward to the improvements made with the Blink system hopefully, so I can expand this system as well.
 This is a good, basic security camera that does exactly what I wanted to do: it watches and then notifies me if it senses motion. I haven’t had any problems with it having false alarms because I have it pointed away from the street and towards my front door. One thing that you don’t really see any of the pictures is that inside the camera there actually is a mini micro USB port so that you can connected to power if that’s available. But even if you can’t, it notifies you when the batteries are low. And oh boy, does it chew up batteries especially if it senses a lot of motion.  I have mine mounted inside a birdhouse so that it’s not immediately available as a security camera but then I also have a sign-up warning people to smile! You’re on camera! I will probably buy one or two more of these for outside of my house. I do think they’re a little overpriced for what you get, especially since the angle of you is pretty narrow. But for just watching doors or a certain small area it’s good.<br/>UPDATE: After working well on my front porch in sub-freezing conditions, I moved it into my garage.  I did't drop it, or jostle it. Just put it in there and plugged it in.  Big mistake! It hasn't worked since.  It says the battery is "OK" AND it's plugged in.  Still won't work.  I get "camera busy" and "Liveview Failed" and "Thumbnail failed" . It simply won't work.  I need to know that something is reliable, especially at this price.  This is a $40 camera, at best.  I guess I'll go to Nest - their stuff seems reliable.<br/>PS: IF I can't get it working in the next 48 hours, I"ll drop it down to 1 star.
 So I have Arlo. After drilling almost 6+ holes in my front porch to get the 'exact' motion trigger enabled, all i got was backs of folks leaving or empty clips. It would be an 'event' if arlo got the motion triggered on time. The base of arlo is huge and needs to be physically connected to the router. The batteries for arlo are out of ordinary and i spent more than the system to replace batteries that seemed to expire every other month.<br/>So I happened to come across Blink during the prime day. I did not have high expectations given my arlo experience but boy, what a change. AA batteries. The motion trigger is awesome. Even captures people walking on the road. Trigger is immediate..and I did not have to drill any holes. Doesn't have to be at an angle, doesn't need motion to be across the screen. Just find a place - anywhere - and it works beautifully. And has lots of cloud storage without needing to pay for it.
 So easy to set up. Just follow the setup guide and prompts on your phone app. I purchased a 3 camera outdoor system and it took me about an hour to install, setup and adjust the entire system. It seems to work very well with the motion detection and video quality is excellent, day or night. Easy to fine tune the system and adjust sensor zones and sensitivity to avoid things like cats on the deck setting it off. Nighttime video quite clear (first night showed a cat walking by our basement door around midnight before I adjusted the system). My system is in a 2 story house with basement and the camera to WiFi and camera to hub signal strength is good on any floor. Router and hub are on top floor and even the basement door gets good signal on both. You do have to check the camera location for signal strength before final installation. I first installed the deck camera underneath a metal roofed gazebo and signal strength was too weak due to the metal "shield" which I should have thought of. Overall I am very pleased with all aspects of the system. Now to see how long the batteries actually last and the durability of the system itself. One thing you don't have is the ability to talk through the camera (like a ring etc.) but you can hear via the camera. Batteries are rated to last up to 2 years and if they last 1 year under daily use I will be happy.
 I am glad I bought this 5 camera system on Prime day. If I had paid full price I would probably return it. After having it installed for 2-3 weeks, here is my review.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/>Easy to setup. Wireless makes it super easy to install wherever you want.<br/><br/>Cameras are small and seem well made. I have a couple outside that have been through some hard thunderstorms and they work perfectly still.<br/><br/>Free cloud storage is nice and the alerts come pretty quickly.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>Motion detecting is very short range. I have one pointed at my driveway. I can pull in the driveway, walk around my car, and not until I am in front of my car and within 10-15ft of the camera will it turn on and start recording. I also have one in my living room, and again, if you are more than 10 feet away, it will not pick up movement. Yes, I have adjusted sensitivity, which only matters if you are trying to record lint and small particles in the air. So if someone breaks into my car in my driveway (again) or my shed out back, this camera will be no help at all.<br/><br/>Picture Quality. Ok, maybe it’s HD, maybe it’s not. You’ll never know because the interface lets you take a picture but there is no way to save it or download it. So a full size HD image is half the size of my phone screen. You can download a video that motion detecting captured, but still images or videos you take from the interface cannot be saved or downloaded, and there is no way to even have the size increased on your screen. I guess you can screen shot the tiny picture and then zoom in, but that quality will not be very good, and the software should be able to do that. Please update this if you are reading Blink!!<br/><br/>Other notes:<br/>Night vision is hit or miss. Overall its decent I think but I have seen better for sure. Some areas with light to dark contrasts make the quality horrible.<br/><br/>Audio seems fine. I can hear things pretty clearly.<br/><br/>Motion detection doesn’t have a feature to select areas to not record motion from. This makes sense. I believe the camera only comes on to record after it detects motion. This is how the battery life lasts so long. So the motion detector is the only part running, and when it detects something the camera comes on.<br/><br/>Would I buy again or recommend? No.
 This system is terrible. Personally, I feel like it was a waste of money and is outside of the return period, so I’m stuck with it.<br/><br/>Pros: very few come to mind, but definitely the fact that it is battery powered is its strongest feature. Also, they are fairly water resistant.<br/><br/>Cons: there are many of them. The mounts are cheap and function poorly. The casing and general look of these make it seem like these are cheaply constructed and of a lower quality caliber. The app itself seems to have functional issues and is difficult to navigate. It only stores roughly ~100 minutes of video capture on its cloud service. The range of these cameras are pretty awful and I require many more of these to get adequate coverage of my exterior. In order to get the best picture it should be mounted at 5-6ft off the ground which makes it susceptible to theft. I’ve tweaked the sensor on the app, but it doesn’t seem to affect it much. The sensor is by far the worst part of this as it frequently refuses to trigger or activate when actual activity is happening right outside my door, but I get notifications sometimes if the wind blows. Also, be prepared to get zero useable footage on sunny days if the sensor is actually tripped as it doesn’t register light well. The price point is way too high for these cheap doodads. You should be able to get twice as many of these for this price.<br/><br/>I bit the bullet on this because it was an Amazon owned company and I really needed cameras like these for my incredibly old house, but they are overall more trouble than they are worth. What is the point of a security system that only works half the time?
 It was easy to set up,installed faceing driveway and front door.im glad I didn't install in the house the cat would have drained the batteries in one day.the batteries lasted 4 days one day it wasn't armed so basically 3 days.recorded about 20 20 second clips about 2%.thats not much.when they say they will last two years.can not get any response from blink called twice during hook up no answer was on hold for 1/2 hour,emailed no reply.sounds cool but they shouldn't be released to the public .big waist of time and money
 I did not purchase this on Amazon.  QVC had a better deal but since Blink is an Amazon company, I'll leave a review.<br/><br/>I was looking for a camera system for the front and back doors of my townhome.  The Ring would not work as I don't have a doorbell in back and really just wanted to record anyone approaching as they shouldn't be there anyway.<br/>The set up was EASY!!  I was worried but shouldn't have.  It was up and running in 5 minutes.<br/>There are two negatives which is why I give 4 stars.  Many reviewers complain about the mounting brackets.  I agree.  They are cheap.  I bought better mounts, in white to match my outdoor trim, with covers.<br/>The other negative is a small thing but there should be a way to fix it.  I want the camera in the back to be activated 24/7 but want the front to be on a schedule.  You see, the 2 year battery life is only achieved if there are not a lot of recordings.  I want to time the front camera so it doesn't catch my normal comings and goings each morning and evening.  There does not seem to be a way to schedule one camera only.  The schedule applies to the whole system.  So I leave the back camera on 24/7 and have to remind myself to activate/deactivate the front camera.<br/><br/>I love that there is cloud storage and no fees.  This is my first security camera and overall, I'm pleased.
 I ordered 5 of these cameras to set up all over my home.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>I like that they are waterproof (for outdoors), have night vision, and can run off a battery for "2 years" or be powered via micro-USB.  All cameras sync to a home module, and the connection seems stable.  Video is captured by motion, as opposed to recording full time.  Footage is saved on cloud storage, and viewed in the app.  The amount of storage allowed by Blink is more than adequate, even with 5 cameras running. Best of all, cloud storage is FREE. If you own cameras from Nest, Ring, or other companies you know that you pay a pretty penny to store video clips beyond 24 hrs. All of this makes Blink very affordable.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>The app is trash.  As mentioned above, video is captured through motion detection.  The motion detection is only turned on when the system is armed.  What if you only want to arm one camera?  You have to turn off motion alerts for ALL OTHER cameras, then arm the system. If you want to undo this later, you have to go through settings for every camera again. Allowing users to selectively arm cameras should be such an easy fix, I have seen so many complaints about this. There is no response from the Blink team and it is extremely frustrating.  Additionally, SmartThings integration was discontinued last December.  SmartThings had a 3rd party app that made the Blink system much more functional, now it is all unusable.  You may use IFTTT to set up programs, but it has limited functionality.  Other minor issues include slow loading of video (expected for most wireless systems) and unable to view remaining battery percentage in app.
 I bought a XT 4 pack, simple to setup and i set 2 on my frt &amp; side porch.  Front porch turns on at about 2' (sensetivity) set to #3, lower settings trigger by street traffic (30-40') so i got tons of false alarms. After setting to #3,  i get the see people leaving my door, so i'm changing the angles to see if its better, but no luck so far.  On the side covered porch, i had it 10' past my door @ a 90° angle, but even set to #1, it only picks up as someone gets to the door, then when they turn to leave i get the back view great.  I then moved it to the entry side of the porch, which they have to walk by it, then 14' to the door and guess what, it has only triggered after my packages are dropped and they walk out; saw his ear &amp; collar though.<br/><br/>I then mounted the other 2 on my ranch houses rear soffit to pick up animals or burglars.  Again, set to #1 at 7' off the ground and they only pick up movement when you're within 5-6'. If i walk past them they come on when i just pasted them, so i get the side/backside of someone.<br/><br/>The videos i watch make it seem that they are the cats meow, so i'll keep repositioning them, but as of now, they're a great concept, but a poor reality; i will follow up this spring with updates.
 I really had high hopes for these cameras. I have given them nearly 6 months and now I am finally ready to provide my verdict on them, they are junk. First, the battery, no matter what settings you choose will NOT last anywhere near two years. The first set (that came with the cameras) lasted about 1 1/2 months. Now at that point I thought I could actually set these things to capture video when they detected motion, well that is not the case if you want any battery life at all. After the first set I tweaked the settings so reduce the motion sensitivity and dropped the clip length very low, I also set the quality to the lowest setting. 3 months out of the next set of batteries. Now I am on my third set of batteries (expensive lithium batteries) and now I am having all kinds of problems with the cameras. Sometimes they work, sometimes they dont. I keep deleting and re-adding them, but I get an error whenever I try and capture video or even a picture. The cameras are obviously connecting to the internet and are actually detecting that I am trying to capture a video because the LED light on the front comes on right when I click the video button, but I just get an error in the app. It does this on all devices connected to the system. Nice try Blink (Amazon), better luck next time, these cameras are seriously flawed.
 We wanted something to put up outside to see when the kids got home from school.  This is better to watch the back yard or somewhere people should not be.  I ended up taking these down and putting up light fixtures with cameras which are hard wired, much better for seeing everything.  I move the Blink cameras around, like in the house when I am out for a long time, the back yard when I am not going anywhere.  They work great I just would not recommend them for constant watching.
 Easy to use, great monitors with super sensitive microphones and camera.<br/>Pros: Wifi, battery operated, easy to mount, 180 degree wide view<br/>Cons: Cannot remotely pan, tilt or zoom on camera. Prefers only lithium non rechargeable AA batteries. The camera is not fast and does not capture motion when it first happens-this means you have 10-30 secs of motion where there is no video recording and a lot can happen that you miss!  Also it is a super sensitive camera that detects even wind moving leaves, at times can be very annoying and eat up cloud space and battery life.<br/><br/>This camera is not recommended for high usage.<br/><br/>I have had to replace batteries on one camera twice in 1 month simply because of all the traffic coming in and out of the house while workers are doing repairs. The battery life should be far better then going out every two weeks for high use.<br/><br/>Overall, it is great for a remote camera system that is good for alerts and such. The price is a bit high for the quality of camera, however the free cloud server is factored into it and it is weatherproof and uses batteries. It does have a micro usb port on the XT cameras that allow an electrical connection for power.
 I’ll start with what i don’t like.  1. Video quality doesn’t seem like HD...close but not quite.  I can’t read license plate numbers from 30’ away or so and facial recognition is poor too at that distance.  Digital zoom just gives me a bigger blurry image.  Yes the protective plastic is off and the lens is clean.  Yes it’s set for highest resolution (“enhanced”).  And IR night images have annoying horizontal scan lines.  2. Motion detection doesn’t work well unless object is moving across the field of view.  So pointed straight down a driveway may not trigger it.<br/><br/>What I do like: 1. Price...pretty reasonable for what it does.  2. Easy set up.  3. Free cloud storage.  4. Decent feature control from a smartphone app.  Oh and temperature sensor so you don’t have to buy a thermometer.<br/><br/>Overall decent.  But without ability to get HD image of license plate and facial recognition it won’t help me catch a burglar.
 Works flawlessly as it’s sebsite and all the videos Claim. Super easy set up. And I’m going to say the best value for wireless cameras on the market that actually work, isn’t complicated and the longest battery life I could find up to 2 years. Depends on what your needs are. But this has a temperature sensor built in with alert to your phone. Motion activated alerts, and night vision that is way better than I thought. If they come out with the wireless doorbell soon, I’ll definitly get it. And if they create window sensors that link to the alert system, then it’ll be perfect for me. I gave it 4 stars because the XT only has one way sounds. So I can hear what’s going on at home. But if it was 2 way it would be better. And I know when they do implement 2 way sound and voice, it’ll be on the next generation camera. Which I would have to buy. Not a fan.
 Got the two camera outdoor set for Xmas. I was really excited to finally get some nice wireless cameras set up.<br/>The only good thing about this system is no extra fee for web storage.<br/>The motion detection is awful. They tell you to try to set the cameras up so objects move across the field of view, not directly at it. Even when doing this the camera does not detect movement until it is very close, within 5 feet of the camera. Then if it does trigger it will stop recording because it thinks the movement has stopped even if the subject is still standing at the door (still moving mind you). So you have to set it up so it doesn’t stop recording when movement stops.<br/>I have included pics where you can see packages on my porch that were delivered and my camera never triggered.  So obviously if someone were to walk up and take the packages it wouldn’t record either.<br/>Even a car coming down my driveway will not trigger the camera until it is very close and starts moving across the field of view.<br/>I also get lots of false recordings which are very frustrating. I’ve played with the settings a bunch but st this point I don’t know if I’ll ever get them to work correctly.<br/>I would not recommend.
 I purchased these to monitor my father's home.  Dual purpose: monitor for intruders and to be able to check on him as he is elderly.  The system is easy to set-up. I had it online and running 3 cameras in under 30 minutes.  The user interface (phone app) is so easy to use that even my elderly father is able to navigate the app to arm/disarm/review videos on his iphone. I put these up December 2018 and they have had zero problems. I think the Blink system is the best value on the market. My research made me Leery of some of the other options...it seemed that their apps were invasive of privacy with the permissions they asked (according to other reviewers).  Given that chance, and the reasonable price, no subscription fees - I chose the Blink cameras.  I am more than satisfied with my purchase. I can't think of any way that it was a disappointment.  The app can be downloaded by everyone in the family so that multiple people can see what's going on. We have family in different cities so we can all check on the house and my father.  I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a simple home monitoring camera without any additional fees. I hope your experience is as positive as mine!
 My house was being shown by realtors one day when I was not home as agreed.  I armed Blink remotely and went about my business.  I was notified when someone entered the zone so I let the system capture it all and later when I viewed the video clips I saw something interesting:  Two cleaning ladies were there as I asked, to clean my home, but unbeknownst to them they were on candid camera.  One opened the freezer and with her mouth took out an ice cube and then put it back into the tray.  Another used a cleaning towel on the floor to mop up and took that same towel to wipe the Corian kitchen counter.  But this was the kicker:  As she was cleaning the kitchen sink she was spitting into the sink, blowing her nose into my kitchen sink and coughing up something.  All captured on camera.  Two cameras actually.  So does Blink work, ha --yes!  I showed the video to the owner and she was aghast, and the rest of what happened is another story.  I have Blinks in my house and outside, have recommended it to friends and while it's not perfect, it does the job.  And yes, this was gross, unprofessional, unsanitary and disrespectful.  So beware of what you might see!
 The indoor cameras arrived without mounting brackets. When I attempted to contact Blink, I discovered there was no phone number available and had to respond via email. What followed next was a series of emails from different senders all asking me to do the same thing- complete an RMA form to make the parts request, all of which came after an email advising me that new mounts would be sent. Clearly the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. So customer service is a concern, particularly for a security product. As for the cameras, they were easy to set up and install and work pretty well. However, in just over one week's worth of use, the Blink servers went down once and then the cameras are worthless. So long term reliability may be an issue- we'll see. Fortunately, I have a hard wired CCTV system as well. The system was developed in the USA, but is assembled in China, which may or may not be an issue for some buyers. I try to avoid Chinese products and technology products in particular. As a current security professional/consultant, I'd give these cameras a cautionary recommendation only at this time. As long as you know what it is and what it isn't, you should be OK.
 I have looked at tons of security camera's.  Ultimately i decided that i wanted wireless and i had to worry about the price tag!! I've only had this set up for 2 days but so far I love it! For the price, it's better than i expected!! Super easy to set up... I did buy a wifi extender to avoid any connectivity issues because my router is in the basement of my home... but i had the system up and running in minutes. I also bought the mounting brackets that provide a "housing" or extra protection for the camera's and I'm happy I did. I plan to buy at least 1 more add on camera and its great because everything is wireless so adding on is simple and fast! I have a schedule set so i don't have to worry about forgetting to turn it on at night. The options are simple and its exactly what's needed for a simple security system. If you want a camera that's constantly running - this is not for you! If you want a camera to alert you if there is something going on outside while you're not home or asleep - this is perfect! I'm very satisfied so far. Pulling the cameras down to change batteries will be a small pain in the butt but if they last even half as long as advertised, I'll be happy! I mounted my camera's high enough so they cannot easily be tampered with! I'll add on to my review if anything changes but right now, i highly recommend this system if you're looking for a simple fix to feeling safer!
 We started off with a two camera system and then bought another two camera system to supplement it.  It was cheaper to buy the two camera pack with a sync module bundled than to buy two "add on" cameras separately.  This was fortuitous, because it turned out the second sync module came in handy when one of our cameras was blowing through batteries faster and faster (initially every four months, and eventually every couple weeks).  Tech support thought it was because our sync module was too far away.  So we now have the house divided into two zones so that all the cameras can be closer to their sync modules.  As it turned out, something seems to have actually been wrong with that camera.  After much back-and-forth, Blink replaced it free of charge.  (Of course, we blew through a number of not-inexpensive lithium batteries in the interim, to say nothing of my time and energy.)<br/><br/>It's nice being able to see packages get delivered when we're away from the house, and I generally appreciate the added situational awareness of what's happening on our property.  Placing the cameras well can take some work.  Each one monitors only a relatively small area, and each time you take one down to replace the batteries you end up fiddling with the mount a lot to get it back into just the right position to monitor the area well.  There's inevitably a slight delay from when motion occurs to when it starts recording, so someone could probably sprint past without getting identified quite easily.<br/><br/>I wish there were an easy way to just disable a camera on demand for an hour if we're going to be doing something in that area.  You can turn it off manually, of course, but then you have to remember to turn it back on.<br/><br/>This system produces short video clips, and can't record continuously for very long, which would presumably consume too much power.  But that's the price you pay for a battery powered system.<br/><br/>I'm annoyed that if I'm brought to the app by one of its motion notifications, it brings me to a list of video clips that hasn't been refreshed--meaning I can't actually see the video clip that triggered the notification.  Tapping the back button in the app seems to be equivalent to the back button on the phone--it exits the app entirely because my previous screen was not viewing the app.  So I then have to navigate to my home screen and reopen the blink app to get to my video clip.<br/><br/>Clips have occasionally gotten garbled too.<br/><br/>I read something that lead me to believe they're going to start charging a monthly fee for premium features.  I hope this doesn't degrade the experience for free users.
 I picked up a pair of these cameras on prime day when the price was about $90 off and is about the right price.  I love the cameras, their ease of set up and the picture quality are excellent.  So far, the only thing I'm not thrilled about is the mounting system, but this still doesn't warrant less than a 5 star rating.  I have a 4 mp hardwired system and I added these to be able to get away from the house, pointing back towards my house because they are completely wireless.  Comes with a sync module that connects to the cloud and the cameras interface to it forming their own network.  With 0 changes to my firewall, my smartphones have access.  I love that I can move them around outside and not worry about rewiring anything.  Battery life looks promising,
 I bought a pair of these after being robbed by a couple of a-holes who would rather take other peoples stuff than go to work like the rest of us. The only reason i bought these over a real security setup is the ease of installation. These are so easy. They are good for the most part but have some serious shortcomings. 1) the only record for 60 seconds max. 2) you don’t get notified until the recording ends. 3) you can’t view a recording while it is recording. Combine 2 and 3 and you can pretty much forget catching someone in the act. You have to run outside when the notification pops and before you can actually view the footage if you want to catch someone- usually to find a spider or moth triggered it. Other than those things, they are pretty good
 I have been in the market for outdoor wireless security cameras for a long time and hesitated to buy for many reasons. I have read negative customer reviews, negative articles, horror stories of bad customer service and support and thought I would just wait until a good system comes along. Well there has been one in front of my face for a while and I never bothered to research it. BLINK. I could not believe what I was reading and finding out in my research. Could this be true?????? Well I broke down and bought the system, installed it and was surprised how simple it was. Setup was even easier. And last but not least, IT WORKS just as described.<br/><br/>I am in love with this system so much, I bought an add on camera for my back door. I would have given them 5 stars, but the camera mount leaves a little to be desired. Don't get me wrong, It is nice, but it fails to position itself right where I need it to look. Thank god there are tons of aftermarket accessories available. I bought camera cases with swivel mounts and now all is well. I would recommend these to anyone looking for ease of installation, setup and use. So far it is a very reliable system and meets my needs fully.
 As the title states better brush up on your IT skills, because it's not a Plug and Play or a 1..2..3..<br/><br/>If you have a service provider with a Router and Modem in one then yes it's as stated above... Now if you have/host your own modem and router with no help from a provider be ready to work, and understand networking because you're about to go on a ride.<br/><br/>Story..Short but sweet<br/>1) Installed router on Fri after 4 hours of trying to install it and searching the net to find out you need to open a port or make a Firewall exception for 443.<br/>2) Was able to get it working without the port being open somehow, Fri<br/>3) Sat night around 10pm went offline wouldn't come back on. Next morning I was able to contact support they recommend me hotspot to see if the port was the issue which it was it connected with no issue.<br/>4) With my modem had no Portforward or Port Trigger options only my router. I was able to get my port finally open and checked it online. After two attempts trying to connect it finally came back online<br/><br/>Overall Pro and Con<br/>--PRO--<br/>Image Quality<br/>Quality of Camera<br/>Packing<br/>Customer Service<br/><br/>--CON--<br/>Scheduling Mode<br/>Instructions for Advanced Users<br/>Mounting stand<br/>Lag<br/><br/>The product overall is better than Arlo by far, I'm happy about the system when it's up and running. I believe a few more updates to the APP and a site login to edit/view would be great.
 First, I was overall happy withe the performance of the cameras. I bought 2 2 packs so 4 cameras total. Setup was fairly simple and it works with Alexa as advertised.  I did however need to install a network extender for one of the remote cameras since it does need pretty decent connectivity.<br/>Now for the cons;<br/>1. The camera does not record anything prior to motion detection so I often only see people walking out of frame and not into frame.<br/>2. Detection only seems to work for items crossing the field of view, not approaching. Since I have one camera pointing down a long driveway, IO often only get notified after the person gets out of the car, not driving down the driveway. I can fix this by changing sensitivity but then it trips on everything, killing the battery.<br/><br/>3. One of the cameras had a bad very bad image that showed a color aberration covering more than half the image. I called for support, even though the service agent saw and acknowledged the problem, they said it was working fine and refused to take it in for service. Unfortunately, I was outside the return window so now I'm stuck with 3 out of 4 cameras.<br/><br/>As I said, overall a decent camera. Customer service is non-existent so I have to recommend searching for another supplier. This company does not care to help.
 I have a lot of packages delivered to my home which is very close to a heavily traveled road, both cars &amp; on foot. I decided to get a camera to watch my porch since the delivery drivers often leave packages right at the edge of the top step, I feel that it is only a matter of time before something is stolen. So I bought this Blink XT last week. Not on Amazon, because they were out of stock when I wanted it. I liked how small it is and that I could mount it and angle it very easily. The slim, small design allowed me to set it on the window sill in my kitchen. Making it handy to access. I set it up and it took most of the day to figure out the correct angle and sensitivity for my needs. I encountered a lot of "camera busy"  notices when I would try to look at the live view even though there had been no triggers or alerts to justify that. But the biggest reason that it is going back is because it took so long after the camera caught motion to alert me.  I would see the mailman out my window and the camera would alert me 4-6 minutes after the camera triggered motion from seeing him. That is useless to me.<br/>I also bought an Argus2 - I did get that here on Amazon. It is great &amp; it sends me an alert immediately. The Argus also supports a micro SD card and has a solar panel available to purchase at a very reasonable price if I want to add that on. I will also say that the Argus 2  has much better picture quality then the Blink XT did. I am returning the Blink XT and already purchased a second Argus.
 I purchased 2 of the Blink XL on Amazon Prime day for a total of $166.90.  The cameras were easy to set up and to mount. However the mounting hardware is pretty flimsy and will shake if wind hits it which will give you some false alarms.  I have strong wifi which extends to the front of my house so the cameras don't have a lot of delay in processing videos.  The quality of the videos are fair to good at the "best" quality setting and can be increased to a larger resolution/quality at "enhanced" but that will use up more bandwidth and battery.  The thing which probably bothers me the most is that motion detection from a front on motion will rarely get caught till it is too late.  So you have to mount the cameras at an angle to what you are trying to detect and will not get a totally clear view of the face.  I have my camera over the front door and unfortunately it gets alot of false alarms as it detects motions on the road from passing cars.  I used electrical tape over part of the sensor to reduce sensitivity from the road. This does not have an area of focus feature as I wanted the sidewalks to be the borders, but you couldn't filter the road out. The duct tape method does work but it is not accurate as I can't really get the front sidewalk to trigger anymore.  The other camera is on a utility pole looking down at my driveway and the front of the house. Again there are bushes nearby which move with the wind causing false alarm recordings.  I have again used the electrical tape method but it doesn't seem to work as well as I still get false alarm recordings.  Night vision is pretty cool as I have caught animals at night.  The battery sensor only shows OK and not a precise measurement of what percentage or time of life to the batteries.  The motion sensor is the area of improvement. If they can get it to detect straight on movement and provide an editable "area of focus" it would be really helpful and will become a much better security camera solution.
 Some of the reviews here boggle my mind.  I’ve have only had a two camera system setup for several days, but I am very happy with the results.  The system is very easy to setup with the exception of doing a good job of deciding where and how you want your cameras mounted.  The image is very sharp and clear all the way up to 1080p if you want.  People need to take the time to understand how the camera functions and what it needs to trigger properly....In particular, how it needs to be positioned to pickup the motion area you want for recording.  Stick to what you only “need” to see.  This is a home monitoring system in my opinion. Expecting a $500 system for $185 is a rediculous  expectation.  There are a lot of settings to get things running the way you want.  With up to 60 second recording, retrigger time settings, motion detection sensitivity, infrared control, video quality settings, audio recording and scheduling...what’s not to like for the money.  I get a notification within a few seconds after recording has taken place.  This alert along with the accompanying video on my phone will keep me up to date as to what is happening at my home when away.  As far a battery life, I was able to put both of my units neatly onto USB power by running wires into my garage so battery life is not an issue.  That wiring is available on Amazon as well as some better mounts.  They tell you up front that battery life is based on 10 seconds of recording time...10 times a day.  If you change to higher video quality or longer times you are not going to see 2 years on the batteries.  If you are looking for more bells and whistles, 24/7 continuous recording, unlimited cloud storage (that you will probably wind up paying for) you should looks elsewhere and expect to pay a lot more money.  You should have done some reading and research before you bought the system.  You may need to buy a second sync module if you want to control different activation times on indoor and outdoor cameras as well as compensate for a long distance between sync modules and cameras.  I checked out my one sync modules range and I could still communicate with and control the cameras 80 feet away from the sync module.  I mainly wanted this system so I could monitor my front entrance and rear entrance of my house.  In particular, I wanted to monitor when packages are delivered to my front door and try tondeter someone taking one...something that hat not occur yet.  A security system is not a guarantee , but it “may” help deter a thief.  This system will meet the needs of most people.  Again, read about the systems capabilities before you buy.  If it meets your needs you won’t be disappointed in the quality of the video or the systems adjustability.
 So I finally broke down and ordered a two camera system and it was super easy to install. Camera quality looks good, we shall see how they perform at night.<br/><br/>Update: 02/05<br/><br/>So I had a little problem with the infrared reflecting off the side of the building and blinding the camera at night but I rotated the camera 90 degrees and make sure the infrared emitter was on the far end away from the building and that made all the difference. I have another mount that I bought it might put the camera a little bit farther out from the building I'm not sure if I want to bother yet.<br/><br/>I jacked up the video quality and the sensitivity and the infrared all to the max I don't care if I have to replace the batteries every month.<br/><br/>Seems to be doing the job.<br/><br/>At the max level of sensitivity though one raindrop seems to set it off but I would rather be safe than sorry.<br/><br/>Update: 02/06<br/><br/>Well everything seems to be working perfectly. For the money this 2 camera system was perfect for my needs. Good price point, no subscription fee, easy to install, 1080P and night vision, and the app seems to work flawlessly.<br/><br/>Update: 03/10<br/><br/>My front door is in a high-traffic area and I have all the settings jacked up to the max so the batteries only lasted about a month on the one camera and I had to replace them. Still I'm pretty happy even if it's eating batteries like crazy. I can get 8 AA alkaline batteries at the 99 cent store for a dollar LOL
 I'm being a little generous here by giving it 4 stars. It should be more like 3,5. The camera itself is pretty good. Nice quality, easy setup, However, the wall mount is a complete joke. The mount got loose after a couple of months so the camera would not stay at the right angle anymore.  Also, the original mount limits the setup of the camera and I was always afraid that one time the camera would just pop out of the clip and just land on the ground. So all in all, I had to order a much more superior wall mount compatible with blink camera from a third party producer and that fixed the problem. The box came with 3 mounts for $12. In that case, why does blink make such cheap and useless mounts that come with product?
 Not the camera system I was expecting when it came in and I looked at a lot of different types. I chose this one because of the outdoor and indoor capability and wireless range of cameras.<br/><br/>First imaging depends on where you place cameras. I purchased the multiple camera outdoor version of these. The images are washed out from light sources when used indoors. I had to point the camera away from the windows because I couldn’t see anything. Now the lamp in the corner washes out the image at night. Night vision indoor is decent but if someone was in my house they better be closer than 15 feet.  Outdoor image is better so I think they are made more for outside.<br/><br/>Physically mounting of these is absolute garbage. If you have kids don’t mount them near a door. Kids slam doors. Slammed doors cause these cameras to fall off. I now have two cameras with marked up IR generators/motion detectors.  It would take one grab to pull down and steal them, so mount high up. All you’d have to do is hold down the reset and they could easily be reconnected to a different system.<br/><br/>Video clips can have significant delay on start and end early sometimes even though there is still motion. This is done to conserve battery life I guess.<br/><br/>As far as stealth goes, these cameras are prob 3”x3” square so not very small and when motion is detected a bright blue LED lights up showing the location of the camera. I wouldn’t hide this on a tree or a fence post because it’s an easy steal.<br/><br/>App is good and since being bought by amazon should get better. The real u fortunate this is the automation. I am not able to arm cameras to separate on / off times. So my outdoor and indoors will alert only on same schedule. So if I want all my cameras on when no one is home but want outside on after kids are back it’s not possible.  Hopefully this is addressed by Amazon in the future because they did add motion zone control to help with pet movement.<br/><br/>Good things and reason for two stars.... cloud clip management with reliable alerts on movement. Recently bought by amazon which means now I can watch my cameras on fire tv. Have handled extreme rain and snow with no issues, wind will move camera if angled the right way and screws aren’t tight.  WiFi range is superb and about the best thing.
 I have had this camera since June of 2017. It cost me $120 and I purchased 2 to add to the 5 standard ones I already had inside. I would not recommend purchasing.<br/><br/>Up until about 6 months ago it was a perfectly fine camera. It did it’s job as expected. It recorded video every time the package delivery people delivered a package. The video was a tad grainy but it’s a cheap camera. It had a hard time with lighting in the day since the background was bright and the foreground was dark. It would always expose for the background and thus underexpose the foreground, you know, faces of people.<br/><br/>It also has a hard time lighting for the infrared. Faces would often be overexposed. Luckily I never had an issue that required me seeing a face. I know all the cats of the neighborhood by fur pattern now.<br/><br/>6 months ago I started experiencing rapid battery drain from the unit. I was putting expensive Energizer Lithium Ultimates into it every month. I finally decided to ask Blink for help. The only help they could provide was to replace the unit. However, being just over a year old places the unit out of warranty and they won’t stand by their product.<br/><br/>If they had replaced the unit I would have given 3 stars. Perfectly acceptable units, not amazing, but work.<br/><br/>I will be switching to Arlo for better camera and picture quality.
 Not bad, really. My biggest complaint is the snapshot feature. When the doorbell rings, I like to pick up my phone and use the Blink to get a quick shot of who is there before I get up or open the door. Pressing the snapshot icon on the Blink app produces 10-15 seconds or more of rotating dots before you get your snapshot. That doesn’t seem very long, but it is. Pretty low resolution. I’ve used the motion detector some and it seems to work fine as long as you follow their suggestion and mount the camera so that motion will be crossing its field of view, not just approaching it head on.
 Update 012819<br/>Well, for some weird reason, my sync module, died, after testing they sent me a replacement which worked fine for a couple of week, now it comes and go in which i have to reset the camera and module, just happened and after two days is gone again, I have as well a two camera kit that worked fine together, since the module problem with the other camera for some reason only one of the cameras will catch videos, if my driveway camera stops the backyard will start recording but not both??????<br/>Compare to my very expensive 4 pairs of RING cameras, solar panels and had to buy two extenders to make them work since RING SAYS THAT MY WIFI SUCKS, well these cameras prove that to be very wrong.<br/>I purchased the two camera kit during Prime Days and I wish I had these purchased all along instead of the $1000 wasted on very poorly made cameras for surveillance. My sisters owns the doorbell and that works great but these stick and spotlight cameras suck unless you are almost in front of them and they still freeze and then jump again down the road.<br/>These are very quick to start unlike RING that takes 2 minutes fromn the alert to view and then it starts with a blinding light till the video focus, these do not. No black outs grey outsm freezes, Sound much clearer.<br/>What I miss is solar panels attached to these and the app doesnt that extend out completely to view better, otherwise I wish I had blown my money on these
 I had actually order this system after doing a LOT of research.  Just an hour after I placed the order, I saw the same thing on QVC (except it was 4 cameras and on sale for $249.96) for only 264.98 + they had a first time customer discount for $10.00.  I feel so bad leaving a comment like this, but that is a significant difference.  An add on camera is about $120.00 so it still doesn't add up to $500.00.<br/><br/>Other than that, I would give this four stars.  The system is GREAT!  It only takes a few minutes to set up...even faster if you download the app prior to receiving it.  I had to play around with the sensitivity levels because just the snow blowing off the roof would set a couple of them off that are right under the eves.  The range of view is truly amazing for such a small little camera.  I basically have all of the property in view all around my house. (trying to attach videos, but it's saying there some kind of error)<br/>So far, the only CON with the system itself is, it can take a while for the video to load sometimes.  I'm not sure if it's a signal thing or if the system gets busy and it takes longer.  I do know that if you have poor service, it won't download at all.  I only experienced this when I was at a very remote location in Alaska.  Speaking of which, there are thermometers in the camera.  You have to calibrate them initially but it's a nice feature to have when you are concerned about cold temps.  That brings me to another great point about these cameras, we had a steady 15-18- below over the weekend and the batteries are still holding out.  We haven't reached our typical -30--50 temps this winter so I don't know how they'll hold up then.  I'll let you know.<br/><br/>All in all....I'm very pleased with the Blink XT.  I also bought the indoor one camera system to have inside and I am just as pleased with it.  Again, you have to play around with the sensitivity on it...the indoor camera was literally picking up dust settling.<br/><br/>I'll try to get videos loaded, we'll see.  I highly recommend the Blink system though.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.
 Got one of these for Christmas, set it up that very day. In January (read: less than a month later) our car got broken into and everything was stolen from it. Imagine how relieved we were when we remembered we had a camera that was alerting my phone with 40+ notifications a day to show me videos of leaves or birds flying by. We told the cop that arrived with confidence that we had a security camera and would have a video and picture of the perpetrator. Imagine also our surprise when, after spending 3 hours reviewing footage, we come to realize that it was mainly good at providing videos of cars passing and the wind. There was not a single shot of somebody breaking into our car. Now, keep in mind the attached image - our car is the blue one on the right. Could it BE in a more perfect position for this camera to catch it? Cars passing, people walking down the middle of the street (even on the OTHER SIDE of the street) routinely set this camera off. There was not a single video of the crime...so what exact good does it do as a SECURITY CAMERA? What a waste of money; the one time we need a security camera, we actually HAVE one, and it did exactly diddlyshit. At least if we didn't have any security measures whatsoever we could chalk it up to the game, not waste hours of our lives looking over footage of the leaves rustling across the street. There was an 8 hour gap where there was no footage whatsoever, not even the municipality garbage trucks picking up recycling. It must have taken a nap; I'm glad it's getting its rest. We, on the other hand, lost over $900 of possessions.
 I bought my system from Blink's website. I have two interior cameras on both my front door and back door. I arm them when I go out. I have 5 XT exterior cameras mounted around the building, covering both North/South and East/West. The house is completely covered. I had an issue I caught a woman from the neighborhood in my hallway and neighbors hallway. She is probably stealing mail/packages. I spoke with another neighbor and one of his tenants had a credit card taken from the mailbox and 1,500.00 in charges. The next day I mounted my cameras outside, with aftermarket mounts I bought on Amazon. The aftermarket mounts have eliminated false triggers from wind/weather. In the day the picture is perfect. At night the infrared illuminators reflect off the brick building. So I had to change the angle away from the building for a better picture, the glare is still reflecting off the building but not as bad. I wanted a completely wireless system and this fit the bill. I run a tri band AC wifi router with  a wifi mesh extender. My wifi signal is strong completely from one end of the house to the other. I use one base module for the 2 interior cameras and another module for all the exterior cameras. I have had ZERO issues. I just bought another set of XT cameras to cover the garage and interior foyer where the mail gets delivered. Whenever Blink releases their DOORBELL! I will replace the foyer camera with the doorbell. But all in all, Im satisfied. I knew going in that this system was not going capture license plates or faces for facial recognition. I just wanted a system to monitor the house,  alert me VIA cell phone, completely wireless, and reasonably priced. Having an elderly mother with stage six Alzheimer's disease, this helps to monitor her movement if she walks outside. My only issue is the software doesn't allow for real time viewing with the option of recording video or a snapshot.<br/>So adding an update, the cameras survived our first blizzard. Only 2 cameras were frozen in ice. I made sure I mounted the cameras within reach of windows  I simply opened the window reached out unscrewed it from base mount and steamed off the ice. I took stills today during a torrential down pour and posted them. Picture is clear except one camera has water on the lense. I will probably change position so it angles more downward. All in all it works fine. The update for zone sensitivity helps with false triggers. Because I'm in the city, the amount of ambient street lights, I have turned off IR illuminators on a couple of cameras. They record in color and the faces don't get IR reflection. So far so good. I'll update after winter to see how they survive.
 Update:  after having these a few months I am revising my review.  These cameras don't catch anything in action.  Some guy rummaged through my vehicle at night (which is parked directly in camera view) and all it caught was the last few steps he took as he ran away.<br/>People park in my driveway- again in camera view- and nothing. Walk up to my door, nothing.  I get a ton of false alarms throughout the day but they never catch things when I actually want them to. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.<br/>................<br/>These have a good quality picture and are easy to set up and use. I have 3 installed outside my home.<br/>The motion detection is slow (why I took off a star). I'm able to walk right up to my front door (long walkway leading up) and ring the bell before it actually starts to record.  I often get the tail end of people coming and going because of this. Although it has caught a couple Amazon delivery drivers throw (literally) my packages onto the porch.<br/>I get a lot of false alarms. I'm assuming bugs or something went by and the camera didn't catch it. My phone is constantly going off during the day.<br/>Other than that, they seem to be working well.
 Overall it's a good product, setup is easy, picture quality is quite decent, settings are adequate, the app isn't clunky... One glaring issue that I am fighting with is the motion sensitivity. If I set it to "4" I can do jumping jacks in front of the camera and it will not trigger, no matter what. If I set it to "6", the tiniest leaf moving in the wind sets it off, and I get constant recordings and alerts. If the sensitivity controls/presets could be improved - and especially if Detection Area (or Exclusion Area) features could be added to the app - then it's be a 5 Star product, hands down. But as it stands, the sensitivity settings/lack of Exclusion Area boundaries does leave this product slightly lacking...
 I got one camera on sale with the sync module.  I am going to get another eventually.  I own POE cameras and monitoring software as well.  What I like about the Blink XT:  Batteries last forever.  It's very to set up and very little if any maintenance.  If  you lose power the camera still works, but there's still the dependence on wifi and the internet connectivity.  I think the camera buffers what it can until the connection comes back.  The video quality is fine.  The night vision is really good.  The phone app is easy to use and notifies you when the camera has something for you to re view.  You can send clips via text message if necessary.
 I was quite disappointed at the range these cameras can be from the sync module and the wi-fi. I had to spend quite a bit of time finding and placing the cameras and module where both cameras could have a stronfg enough signal to function properly. And the bad news is I live in a ranch that is not all that big and wide. When I contacted customer service I got a representative that was simply reading instructions off a screen in front of her and didn't have a clue how anything worked. In the twenty years I've been using Amazon it's the first time I've experience any problem with customer service, but I wanted to choke this one. I do have them working using a wi-fi extender and placing the sync module right in the middle between them. I have the minimum signal that will let them work. If you don't get at least that the other camera will give you a lot of system busy reports when you try to access the camera with a good signal. They work great in the house and have a very nice picture and decent app for the Iphone. They need to get the fire tv support going so you can check your camera on your tv. I got a good deal on prime day or I'd send these back and get just the indoor ones. That or buy the starter kits so you have multiple sync modules you can place around the house.
 I've had the white, indoor version of Blink cameras for a couple of years and have had no problems. The XT we purchased last year, and it worked fine for about 8 months, now all of a sudden it started eating one battery of the two in a span of a few days to a week, twice now. Research online shows others have had the same issue and like me they get the run around with support. Nice they are sending me a set of replacement batteries but there is something obviously wrong hardware wise considering it's just one of my cameras doing it.<br/>I'll be researching replacement cameras.
 They work good, but there is a caveat and I have not figured out a workaround. If a camera is actively recording due to motion, you cannot log in and view the camera because it shows busy. The night vision is below average for heights above the second story. I am getting infrared white out, which I need to adjust, but have been too busy to get my ladder out. I have heard that two cameras that are projecting infrared towards each other can cause this white out. I have two cameras that are generally covering the same area and may be causing this issue. I will re-adjust and see if it solves this issue. It is not perfect, but it is doing what I need to do. There is a delay in picking up motion so sometimes you will only see someone entering an area briefly or exiting that area. It should be good enough should you need to have it to identify someone, but it should start recording sooner much like what law enforcement uses with their body cams. The set up was easy and the installation was also easy. I do plan on purchasing the white covers to blend into the house a bit better. In summary, I'm glad I got them and it is great you don't have to deal with a DVR/NVR, wires, current, and difficult installation.
 I purchased these cameras and installed them about a year ago. But, I did not set them on motion activation because I live on a busy street and was worried that I would get too many false alarms instead of the specific foot traffic that I want to be recorded. This worry was because of various reviews I read online about false alarms from shadows or the sensor being too sensitive. During this time I just used the cameras on manual mode and they weren't very useful. Then one day I had a package stolen and I was kicking myself because I did not have the cameras enabled to record upon motion. I was mad at myself because what was the point on spending good money on cameras that I don't activate.<br/><br/>So I activated them for the past 3 months and I haven't had a single false alarm based on the default settings of the camera! The connectivity to my wifi is great, as are the recorded videos. I should have just trusted the system and not all those internet reviews and made any necessary adjustments.<br/><br/>My only gripe with the cameras is that their system for accessing recorded videos/images is primitive. You can't view records online, you have to view on the app. This may not be a problem for some of you, but if my phone isn't on wifi I don't want to use my limited cellular data plan to view high res videos. Another significant issue is that users can't set multiple accounts to access the app. Each camera system is tied to a single email and password, so all members of that household that want to access the app have to share that login information. This is a significant security risk, especially if you live in a home with non-family members. You should not share your private password information with anyone else. This is also problematic for a user like me that has the system installed on multiple homes. It's easy enough to view both of my properties using a single email, but, members of the 2nd household that have the login information can also view cameras of my primary home. I do not like this. Say for instance you have renters in the second home and you also want them to have access to the app for their rented home. If you have the same email for that rental as your primary home, then they can view YOUR system's cameras!! A workaround I had to do to is to have dedicated email addresses for each system, but I should not have to do that for a quality system under the Amazon brand. They should be able to set multiple user access accounts to the same system and allow the administrator to manage access. I hope they address with a software update, but many users online have been clamoring about this and Blink/Amazon has taken no action.<br/><br/>Bottom line - Great cameras, even at default settings I don't get any false alarms and important traffic areas are recorded with good quality and great battery life. But without being able to view records on the web or set multiple user access accounts the system does not deserve 5 stars. If those issues don't matter to you then you should have no regrets with the system.
 Initially setup of my 3 outdoor camera setup looked like it was going to be simple.  However, after I mounted my 3 outdoor cameras I realized that the WIFI signal was not strong enough to the cameras.  So I purchased and installed a fairly expensive WIFI extender and resolved that issue.  I've had issues with all 2 of the 3 cameras.  There are times that these 2 cameras just don't send any video.  I know they are working because I can directly view video from the cameras but they don't pick seem to pick up motion.  Then they start working again.  One of the cameras already has a low battery after 2.5 months...so much for the 2 year battery life.  Prior to getting this system I had a Lorex DVR system for years which finally failed.  The quality of the video from the Lorex cameras were superior to the Blink system, especially at night.  However, the ease of use of the Blink system is better...when it works.
 Decided to try this one after not having good luck with a RING. The thought of it being weatherproof and placed outdoors most anywhere was good. The problem I have encountered is that it doesn't send an alert fast enough, if at all. I can walk right in front of the camera and there's no alert. I have it outside on a bird feeder looking at my driveway and house. I left the house in my vehicle and it took 2 minutes for my phone to alert me. When  my phone is in the house, it still takes too long. My Yi indoor camera mounted in a window looking out works right away for notifications. I have very fast wi-fi and the proximity to the module and my router are very close foth the Blink. Very disappointed. It has a clear picture but the response time is just too slow. I tried deleting the app 2x and resetting everything at Blink's suggestion, but no improvement. Will be sending this back.
 Installing our five camera system and fine tuning the camera locations, aim and settings took me several hours but that was mostly my fine tuning the aim and location of each camera.  This system is just what I hoped it would be. I did have to relocate my wi fi router in order to get stronger wi fi to the front of our house but I had been needing to do that anyway. Motion sensing is quick with little delay.  False notifications do sometimes occur due to insects or birds but they can be minimized with sensitivity settings.  We set up one camera with motion sensing off  in our sunroom to see our dachshund while we are out of the house. Reassuring to see he is ok. I configured our Amazon Alexa to be able to say “Alexa, ask Blink to arm the Home monitor system” as we leave. We can do the reverse when we come back home too.  This does result however in one camera motion detection notification each way though.  Better to arm with your cell phone as you drive away and disarm the same way as you drive back in. if you do get one of those self induced notifications it is very easy to dismiss.<br/>It all works remarkably well for what we paid.
 Camera is only very basic for a security camera. Motion detection is not reliable. Night video is low quality. Haven’t found out yet about battery life but 3 months of use at optimum settings and still displaying batteries ok. Battery operation is a plus. Displays temps at camera. Free Cloud storage is a plus. Buggie at times and you can’t capture live videos if intruders are detected while watching live views and motion detect hasn’t picked them up. Delay in relaying motion detection to your phone. Snow doesn’t seem to bother the operation if lens is slightly shrouded from direct exposure to weather. Easy to set up and operate but very flimsy mounts included. I bought better, sturdier  mounts.<br/>Three stars is my opinion of these. At the recent price there are other maybe better cameras available with better options for usage have rechargeable  capabilities.
 Based on the existing customer reports, the most complains are about the battery life time. So, why do the batteries die so quickly?<br/><br/>According to the seller's answer, this camera can record about 40,000 sec on one set (2) batteries, which is about 11 hours. That's it! How they have managed to estimate that, in the average household, this should last for 2 years (less than 1 hour a year and less than 10 sec a day) is truly enigmatic. Of course, many people have reported that the batteries last for 2 weeks instead of 2 years, which is not unreasonable for rechargeable batteries. The bottom line is: these cameras, must have been intended for a very peculiar use of sporadic recordings and being idle most of the time.<br/><br/>Also, with all the hype about free cloud storage, they provide only 2 hours of recording. After that the new clips will override the old ones.<br/><br/>So, if these two conditions are satisfactory, the Blink system might satisfy your expectations. There are some other complains, like unstable Wi-Fi connection, but they can, probably, be attributed to a specific network configuration and set-up rather than technological flaws of the cameras. But, since this system is not compatible with any means of local data storage, the reliable connection is absolutely vital for its operation. And, finally, incompatibility with any Internet browser adds another inconvenience.<br/><br/>An obvious conclusion is: in most cases there should be better choices.
 For the price I absolutely LOVE this little unit. While I did purchase it for an outside camera it became wildly apparent that it would not serve that purpose. This was to go outside.... attached to the deck...facing the sliding glass walk out basement door but the receiver (needs to be in a close proximatey) couldn’t handle it. Our router is on the the third floor and cannot be moved so the WiFi simply wasn’t strong enough to keep a connection to the receiver and then keep that close to the camera. It was really the perfect storm of “no can do”.  For now it’s sitting and keeping the living room and kitchen uncertainty surveillance. Another downside is that it cannot see through glass so don’t think this would be a purchase to put in your window looking outside. There is something with the lens that won’t allow it. While for us this proved to have more cons than pros for the intended use....it wasn’t a deal breaker. Next purchase will be something that CAN view out glass windows.
 Not very happy with these. The screen goes purple at random times. Motion detection works but when I go to check the video clip it takes like 10 minutes to load. That is useless if someone has broken in as they would already be gone by the time I could even see the clip. I have one camera set to record for 45 second clips. Only records for 15. (And the “stop recording of motion stops” option is not on) the hardware included with these to mount the camera is very cheap and flimsy plastic. A strong wind blows the cameras out of position constantly. Camera quality is supposed to be hd but I don’t think it is.
 The one star is for customer support.<br/>I purchased and setup the cameras about 3 months ago, and the most used camera ran out of battery.  It took me a couple of days to purchase another set of batteries and after I replaced them I noticed I hadn't been getting the daily barrage of alerts from that camera... When I checked the folder in the app, it became apparent I had no new videos for days, from any of the cameras.  Being tech savvy,  I checked all the usual suspects, made sure all the cameras were good, unplugged the sync module, and plugged it back in,  reset the wifi... but from the app, I could connect to each camera, watch live video, change settings, and I could test each camera by walking in front of each and see the blue "triggered"  light activate.  Up to this point my experience with the blink system was a bit above average compared to other systems... Clunky app, no Web Access to cams or recordings, but not bad, good set of features and customizable settings.<br/><br/>When I tried to get in contact with support it was difficult.  My plan was to just email support and I figured they'd have some reset procedure that would fix everything and I'd be back up after some setup...  but I couldn't, initially, find supports email (here it is in case you are looking support@blinkforhome.com )... I only found a "you can call us any time 24/7" link so I called and a recording told me to leave a message... so I did.  A few days later I went through the online forums, found nothing to help and so I called again... left another message.<br/><br/>A few days later, I searched online again, found the email address and sent a detailed email stating all the things I had checked and tried.. later the response came in... "make sure the system is armed" ... well, of course it is armed because motion triggers a recording, as I had put in my initial email.<br/><br/>I have had about one response per day, if I am lucky, from blink support. And none of them have been helpful.  "Check the sync module is on" ... run a diagnostic tool... the last communication I had from them was yesterday morning in which the technician said, "there is a problem with your wifi, contact your service provider" ... so all of a sudden, my wifi access point, which I own and setup 3-4 years ago, is not working? None of my other devices connected to wifi are having an issue and  I can connect to these cameras from inside and outside my network...they just don't upload their recording or they don't record...<br/>I asked the technician twice to share the logs of the third party diagnostic tool they had me run on my network...and I have gotten no response. I have done a hard reset on the sync module and attempted to do a fresh setup... and the cameras act normally and  are triggered, seem like they record but nothing gets into the recording folder...<br/>I was tempted to buy more cameras during the black Friday sales, but with the system not even working...and so little help from blink / amazon I am glad I did not and  I would not recommend buying into this system yet. Normally tech support is not one of my factors because I can usually figure out a solution or find one in forums...  but in this case I have needed tech support and it's been a frustrating and unproductive experience!
 Great price. Love that they are wireless. They work well outside and at a distance from the router. I get updates directly to my phone when motion is detected. They are easy to put up. The only downside was the app was not as smooth as expected. It was difficult to figure some things out even after reading set up. App was confusing, but works ok now that I figured out a work around. It doesn't display the sign on page right away. It was a hit and miss and a few emails to the help desk to try and find the sign on page. It still does not come up like it should but I am used to the workaround now. It also does not set up a shortcut icon when downloaded. I am still struggling to do that on my different viewing devices. The help desk was prompt and seemed concerned, but I should not need a help desk as much as I did. The app need to be upgraded to overcome those kinks then my review can be a 5.
 Got as a Prime Day deal. Now that it's here, the CONs list is far longer than the PROs list, so it's not likely I will keep it. Not for what it cost me, even on Prime Day. (I have a $20 camera which, while needing a wall plug, does most of the things the Blink XT will not.)<br/>CONs<br/>- Cannot get the IFTTT integrations to work with Google Home.<br/>- No native Google Home compatibility (not too surprising, being an amazon company, but come on, get over it already).<br/>- 2–3 second delay in live picture.<br/>- Cannot view on desktop (frankly shocking).<br/>- Cannot record on demand (also shocking).<br/>- Will not work with a network that needs a user name for login.<br/>- 1-way audio only (which wasn't a feature I was concerned with, and would be useless with the delay anyway, but bears mentioning since it does have a microphone).<br/>PROS<br/>+ Small, lightweight, unobtrusive.<br/>+ Set up easily with my home network.<br/>+ Picture seems decent (although I haven't really tested it in real-world conditions, with motion activation and all).
 You get what you pay for. Easy to set up, easy to install. The motion detector could use some work, you will not get it perfect. It will be to sensitive and go off for stuff you can't even see (wind blowing a piece of grass) or not sensitive enough and will go off when the post man is about to set foot on your porch. You have to compromise on what you actually protect. I will be buying one more (makes it 4 total) so I can watch my drive way as well so I can see who is pulling in and out instead of just when they get to the door. All in all, I would buy these all over again.
 2 years battery life??  Maybe 2 DAYS!!!!  Mine did fine for a couple months then began eating batteries in 2 days. I emailed blink and did what they recommended to no avail. Now my Blink camera is garbage.
 I like much about the system, but for me there is one critical design flaw.  My Blink property is located where weather-related power outages are common.  Following an outage and after every other WiFi device has automatically reconnected, the Blink system remains offline.  To operate properly I had to manually power it off and then back on.  This wouldn’t be a serious issue except for the fact that I travel frequently and for extended periods of time, and for large blocks I had no idea what was happening at my property.  I contacted Blink support looking for a strategy to remotely reboot the sync module myself or to have the folks there do it.  Initially, I received stock responses from Blink support but finally heard from two support members that no form of remote rebooting was possible.  I had to be physically holding the module to reboot, or as one support person suggested, maybe I could find someone else to regularly enter the property and do it for me.  Now, I may be alone in this, but I don’t need a system that rings my cell to tell me I have an intruder when I’m physically on the property.  I need to know what’s going on when I’m not there.  Right now it feels as though someone has saddled me with a puppy that requires constant attention.  I am no software engineer, but I have difficulty imagining that a solution to an issue that clearly effects many Blink owners could not be developed.
 I bought this on Prime Day because it was a decent deal for a truly wireless outdoor camera. After using it for a few weeks, I have had a few frustrations with it. The mount that comes with it is completely worthless. It will not stay in the position I set it to if there is any kind of rain or the slightest bit of wind. It ends up pointing at the ground every couple days. This makes the camera worthless because it's not catching anything unless someone walks right below it. The next frustration is not being able to set a motion zone. The Ring cameras allow you to only alert for motion in certain areas. This thing alerts for motion on pretty much everything in the field of view. If I want to see my entire driveway, I end up getting alerts for people walking along the sidewalk. On the plus side, it's easy to install, you don't have to pay for a subscription, and the picture seems pretty good at day and night. If they would include a better mount that will hold the camera in place, I would probably rate this 4 stars.
 I was thrilled to find these on Amazon Prime day on sale. I have been using these ever since on the front and back of the house. The idea was to use them as a security system. Pros: cheap, longer battery life, decent picture quality, night time view, free recording<br/>Cons: included wall attachment was flimsy, when tried to view live, constant error messages "camera busy, Live view Failed", hit or miss motion detection (for example: there were no recording from 12th of this month to 19th (today) - this is despite people constantly go in and out, kids play in the front yard, vehicles moved etc.)<br/>I tried various tweaking of the camera settings (sensitivity -9, trigger time -10 sec, end of clip early -off) based on user forum suggestions. Despite that 7 days of actions were missing.<br/>These are okay as a deterrent for someone, but my impression is that Blink cameras are not yet ready for consumer market.  This was surprising that as an Amazon company, I expected a very good customer-oriented product.<br/>Same day (Prime day) I bought an Amazon indoor camera. Software/camera responses of Amazon vs. Blink systems are like Day and Night.<br/>Based my experience, I would not recommend Blink system as a security camera system. I am still waiting for a true wireless camera system that has a longer battery life, and that does not break the bank.
 I have spoken to Blink Customer Service and they seem to tell everyone that calls with complaints, the same thing.  They blame the issues on the homeowners  router/wireless system.  I can attest that the issue is with THEIR product, NOT my wireless.  I am a govt contractor who has a 24/365 required service that has to be up and running constantly.  Our system DOES NOT GO DOWN,  so to tell me that it is OUR service is pure BS.  That aside the issue is that you get  "live view failed",  or when switching from live view on one camera to a second or third camera,  the system will not shift to the other cameras.  What concerns me the most is that I know people are using this to monitor their home for security.  How would you feel if you got a notice that something was happening at your home, and you got "live view failure" and the camera would not engage.  Much less if this involved children etc.  For Blink to tell any homeowner right off the bat that this is their wireless system,  is disconcerting, disrespectful and UNSAFE.  I as a security professional  can not in all good faith recommend this product.
 I would love to give a better ratting, and depending your usage this might work out fine... I setup a blink XT and while it seems to work fine (module has randomly dumped wifi which is strong, a couple times, also setup could not see my ssid even though it's broadcast) it's sadly missing two key functions every outdoor camera needs IMO<br/>1. Zones of detection for record triggers.<br/>2. Intelligence filtering (people not cars).<br/>Without those the signal to noise ratio is just awful making alerts useless.<br/>Oh and the plastic out door mount has zero security, so if you don't want somebody waking off with your camera plan to break out the ladder.
 After reading the many critical of Blink’s customer service I wanted to add my two cents. I don’t have a LOT of experience with support, but did just have one of my cameras (indoor) fail on me after several months of trouble-free use. I tried an assortment of things before emailing Blink (reset, replace batteries, uninstall/reinstall) and had pretty much determined it was a hardware issue. Blink support had me go through the same troubleshooting steps and came to the same conclusion. The entire process from my initial contact to their resolution took less than a day. They had a replacement camera and an RMA label in my hands in about a week, and the replacement is working fine (along with my other cameras - both indoor and XT outdoor). I’m satisfied with my system and Blink’s support. My only criticism is minor - the iOS app doesn’t support iPad in native landscape mode and I live on my iPad. Battery life has been great - I’ve had most of my cameras for almost a year and haven’t had any batteries die yet. Blink’s servers have been down (maybe?) three times since I’ve been using their gear (that I’ve noticed) and one of those times was a widespread outage which couldn’t be blamed on them. Acceptable service, especially considering it’s provided at no cost. I’m sure you can buy better security cameras, but I don’t know of anything better, easier to setup or more flexible for the price.
 We bought this product hoping it would catch anyone outside our door, but it can't even do that. It missed every person that came by, but would record if it heard the train that ran behind our apartment. The failure rate was worse in the evening when it was dark, but we have a light that lights up the area where we had the camera pointing, so there was no reason it couldn't see, as it never needed to use the night vision. I even stood in front of it, making a ton of movement, and yelled at it and it didn't catch it. And yes, we did make sure several times that it was armed and the settings were set appropriately, so we gave up and returned it. I'm not sure if it was just a lemon or what, but it did not work anywhere near expected.
 I purchased this camera for my parents.  It took some time, but we got it hooked up to their iPad and figured out how to use it.  It can run on batteries or be connected to an outlet (if I recall correctly, you have to provide your own cable, but they include a cube).<br/>My parents are able to watch live on their iPad and it is set to record when it senses motion.  They receive a notification on the iPad when that happens.  It does not motion detect through glass (they tried leaving it inside looking through a window onto the porch).
 Easy to setup, you get notifications fairly quickly. You are able to manually view or automatically detect/record from each camera individually. I setup a camera inside to check on older dog. Takes good night time shots. Does have slight issue when coming towards camera but very good at detecting if they cross. The sensitivity adjustment helps here.
 These suck. The battery life is a flat lie, you can't view if it's recording, and it won't record if you're viewing.
 Bought a 5 pack of Blink XT exterior cameras. Installed and configured all of them in less than a day. Easy to set up and "these just work" as long as you do not place them too far away from your WiFi and its Sync Module.<br/><br/>Video quality is excellent.<br/><br/>The one caveat or rather issue I have with this system is that these ALWAYS miss the initial activity that caused the camera to trigger in the first place.  Based on where cars show up in the videos and when the wife exits the car and walks up to the front porch, I estimate that you always miss at least 3 to 4 seconds at the very beginning of every single clip saved.<br/><br/>You don't know how many hours of video I've captured without any kind of explanation as to why it got recorded in the first place.<br/><br/>I would have posted a video that demonstrates this issue, but I have not figured out how to get video clips out of their cloud system yet.<br/><br/>Nice Try Blink, but you didn't take it all the way home. :(
 I love my Blink cameras. Unfortunately, you can only have 10 cameras attached to one sync module.  I wish we could attach another module to my iPhone downloaded app, so that I could add on more cameras.<br/>  I got creative. I downloaded the app to my iPad and used a different email address, then added on 10 cameras to that device. Violá.  More rooms and spaces covered by Blink.<br/>  Also, a BIG reminder, it uses AA lithium batteries.  Alkaline batteries barely work and the camera is usually off-line or yellowish in appearance. Apparently, reading directions escaped me on the packages. But, I did see my error and I ordered my lithium batteries, installed the rest of my cameras and I’m HAPPY.<br/>  The XT cameras that weathered the -20 winter temps, worked PERFECTLY!  Very satisfied customer
 Initially I planned to put the cameras on the north side of the house by the driveway and on the east side where there is a side entrance.  My home is a single level 1600 square foot home...not that large I would think.  The internet goes into my office which is on the west side.  The garage is on the northwest side of the house.  I had to put the camera more to the west side of the garage.  There is no way I could use the second camera on the east side so I put it on the west side just to use it but from a security perspective I need something on the east side...<br/><br/>So, all that said, once installed the system works fine...I called and spoke with technicians twice and they were professional and knowledgeable and used a vocabulary I can understand...I just wish I could use the cameras all the way around my home.  My initial plan was to purchase two cameras and then add some .... well none will be added....
 The positives of this camera are well documented so I'm going to focus on the annoyances that not everyone may be aware of.<br/><br/>1) As with many of these types of cameras, they often start recording many precious seconds after the subject has moved into view. The problem is really noticeable at my front door where it often starts recording AFTER the mail carrier has dropped off a package at the door and is heading back to his truck. All I see is their backside. And I also don't see how they treated the package while dropping it off. The recording starts too late. This behavior isn't improved by adjusting the sensitivity settings.<br/><br/>2) The camera view is limited. It's a pretty narrow view compared to other cameras  that have a wide-angle or fish eye effect.<br/><br/>3) The motion sensor is not aligned with the camera view. It often triggers on movement beyond what you see in picture causing a bunch of recordings with nothing to see. This is somewhat alleviated if you lower the motion sensitivity down to 2 or 3 but that creates other problems with recordings not triggering until it's too late. There just doesn't seem to be a good sweet spot.<br/><br/>4) I wish the app had an individual camera scheduling option instead of all or nothing. There are some cameras I wish to constantly monitor and others that I'd like to only monitor during the night.<br/><br/>5) Finally, the last gripe is the lag. There is lag in everything that this camera does. Motion triggers might take around 10-15 seconds before you're notified. Arming and disarming takes awhile. Pulling up a live feed is painfully slow. Mind you my wireless connection from the cameras to the hub and to the router are all showing excellent and I have a fiber gigabit connection with an Orbi wireless mesh networking.  It's frustratingly slow.<br/><br/>I may have been spoiled by some other wireless cameras I've used in the past. Blink isn't all bad. It's biggest feature is easy installation and setup and will work in a pinch until you've got something more substantial setup. You also don't have to pay for cloud service. But treat this as more of a temporary not a permanent solution to your security needs.
 You have to realize the facts of batteries and the laws of physics can't be changed.  I have 3 of these cameras.  The do an "okay" job for where I put them, but the 2 year life battery claim is only valid when you run the camera on the lowest resolution and back off the sensitivity to around 3 (meaning someone will need to wave a flag and jump up and down to set the camera off.)  The night vision follows the same game: as long as you have the area illuminated by an external light source, the lowest "night vision" setting (to conserve battery life) will just produce a grey "fog".  Kick the setting to the max and you'll get great HD night vision but you'll be replacing the Lithium batteries once a month.  It is what it is... like a Christmas toy that eats batteries, it's part of the deal.  No wires and extremely easy to connect to a good signal-strength router numbs the issue of dealing with batteries.  Oh, and don't forget the wipe the lens after a lot of rain and dust.
 2 years not even on a good day. Batteries died in 2 months. It's probably because I live in a townhouse and it picks up other neighbors and the parking lot. But still this isn't acceptable. Have tried different settings, and the sensitivity is quirky. How can it pick up someone by my door, but not walking down the sidewalk towards it? Would be a nice system though if it wasn't for the battery problem. I think I'll try rechargeable although they say only lithium batteries. It's pretty useless now anyway and I'm not buying lithium every two months.
 We are very happy with the Blink cameras.  Easy to set up.  Easy to mount.  The motion detection triggers fantastic and I like that you can adjust the sensitivity.  I placed mine outside but in spots where the cameras won't be exposed to the elements.  I have them plugged in via a micro USB so I will not be going through batteries.  I also like the free storage.  There is a limit to how much footage can be stored but I don't see that being a problem.  I have only had them running for two weeks but overall they have worked well.<br/><br/>2 month review:<br/>The cameras work good, sometimes a little to good.  After the cameras are triggered by motion, they continue to re-trigger 3-10 times, even though there is no motion to activate them.  I have adjusted the sensitivity and they just continue to re-trigger.  I am glad that I have these cameras plugged in via the USB port in the back of them or I would be going through batteries at least monthly.  Other than that, we have been very happy with all of the other features these cameras provide.
 I bought a total of three cameras. I love the versatility, size, and that they are wireless. I also like that they pick up sound. I would give 5 stars, but one of my cameras it after only 6 months, I’ve replaced the batteries 3 times!!  Duracell LITHIUM!!  I’ve read that others have this issue, and I think I’ve discovered why!  I moved the camera to capture the antics of new kittens. I heard a clicking noise - just a few times at first, and it disappeared. Then it started clicking rapidly and I found that it was the camera!  The shutter, it appeared, and it wouldnt stop. I turned the camera to face the wal...still clicking.  I disarmed the system...still clicking. I had to take the batteries out to stop it!  Incidentally, when I checked for clips, it did not record during the time it was rapidly clicking non-stop. I need information on return/exchange!!
 I did a lot of research and picked the Blink XT. It is a completely wireless system which eliminates the hassle and expense of wires, the battery life and event storage sold me. The setup is really easy if you read the instructions carefully, I had a little trouble but it was my fault, I didn't read the instructions correctly. The Blink Team responded to my emails promptly and  had me up and running in no time. Since I already have a monitored indoor alarm system I just wanted a visual of the outside of my house and to be alerted of any movement around the house when I'm was away or  sleeping. Arming and disarming is fast and simple and the video is pretty good. My only issue is the default alert tone, which can't be changed. I would like to be able to change the volume and make it louder (my iphone alert volume is maxed out) and also change the tone to one of my choice. Other than that I am happy with the Blink XT system and would recommend it.
 The Prime Day price $79 was too good not to give the Blink XT a shot.  Getting the account, sync module and camera up and running was pretty straightforward.  Default camera settings have worked well so far.  The motion detection works great for my coverage area.  No unwanted triggers with swaying plants or cars passing in the far background.  Facial recognition with Med IR intensity is a bit difficult.  Scheduled arm/disarm has worked perfectly as well as manual arm/disarm.  Alert notifications are reliable however none will be received if you happen to be signed out of the Blink app.  I am powering the camera via USB since a power outlet was nearby already.  Haven't tried any of the integration/IFTTT functionality yet.<br/><br/>Biggest weakness found so far is the flimsy mounting.  I used a couple zip ties to ensure the camera was secure in windy conditions.<br/><br/>Overall, the Blink XT has done everything I wanted and will likely add one or two more for full coverage.
 My review.<br/><br/>Pro's : Great picture, Zoom is nice, Sound quality is amazing. Very easy to set up, Small and can fit almost anyplace. Will definitely purchase more<br/><br/>Con's :<br/><br/>1: Mounting brackets these cameras come with are straight garbage  I would recommend buying some better ones . Its not a deal breaker but it is a -1 star in my book. These are expensive outside cameras, the default equipment provided in the kit should reflect that.<br/><br/> 2: Motion detection on app is sometimes rather slow.<br/><br/> 3:  This product could really use a browser app so people who use PC's or Macs could monitor cameras without having to have my phone on/out.
 I have four cameras, 3-XTs and 1- Indoor camera on one sync module that has run flawlessly for almost 6-months.<br/><br/>The indoor camera is in my garage by the entry door.  Two of the XTs are monitoring the back patio and front entries from outside.  The 3rd camera is under the eave on the blind side of my home, and monitors the entry gate to our fenced yard.<br/><br/>The sync module and IP modem is on my UPS, so the cameras continue to operate normally during power bumps.<br/><br/>I was concerned about using the indoor camera in the garage due to excessive heat buildup from the cars during the summer, but it seems to continue to work fine.  It's been just under 100 degrees at times. The camera registered 98 degrees a few days ago.<br/><br/>Batteries are doing well so far,  but I keep forgetting to turn off motion detection when doing yard work,  resulting in a long list of recordings.<br/><br/>I purchased them from Blink prior to Amazon assuming ownership.
 Blink removed SmartThings support without warning. Now, cameras are missing features which make multi-zone usage (e.g. always have outdoor cameras on, but only activate indoor cameras when I leave) impossible without significant cost and complexity. I'm really disappointed in Blink's current feature set, as well as their behavior.
 Originally loved my 2 camera system and was going to buy a 3rd camera when on sale.  However, one of the key features I used initially no longer works as it should.  I was using IFTTT to turn on the Hue light near the camera immediately following motion detection - to notify whoever triggered it that they were noticed.  However, there is now a &gt;30 min delay between when motion is triggered and when IFTTT registers it to turn on the light - this delay is apparently on the blink servers end and renders this integration feature useless.  Perhaps they will fix it soon, but be aware before purchasing.
 I have about 8 of the regular white Blink Cameras and i'm very happy with them. So when I ordered the Blink XL I couldn't wait to get it. Boy was I disappointed. Installed it in the front of my house and during the day the picture was great, but at night in the dark not so good. The IR does not work  well. Maybe the one I got doesn't work properly, its the only one of the XL I have. Ive changed the settings on the IR and no matter what i set it to it really doesn't make a different.
 One out of three modules is faulty and the battery wears down after only a few weeks. They insisted it was my fault even though I have a higher traffic camera with the same batteries that has lasted a year. Bad customer service, but I think it was due to the changeover when they were bought by Amazon.<br/><br/>In addition, there are too many false positives to be truly useful as a security camera outside, unless you can isolate the motion area. It frequently gets triggered by bees/spiders/bugs as well as shadows cast by tree branches. They really need to work on their motion sensing algorithm, and allow us to choose parts of the field of view which can be motion hotspots. The mounting they give you is really flimsy and causes further false positives due to anything over a light breeze jostling the camera - I strongly recommend others buy third party mounts which will be sturdier.<br/><br/>I have one indoor and three outdoor (would like to add more) so 1/4 being faulty isn't that bad, just disappointing. Can't wait to see what the third generation will look like!
 The price may have been great on Prime Day, but the camera is nearly useless to me.  I just came home to find that it didn't arm even after it said it had, and even when it does arm properly the motion sensor is not able to pick up something as big as someone walking through the front door when about 20 feet away.  It often does not activate until roughly 6-12 feet from the unit even when set to 8 out of 9 sensitivity levels (when set to 9 it just constantly goes off with no motion at all.)  Often when I try to view live, the delay to get it to work negates any functional use I could have.
 I purchased the 3 camera set. I have had them a week and will update if things change. But here is my review so far:<br/><br/>Overall - they work really well and are pretty cool to watch. I definitely think they are well worth it if you are looking for a completely wireless solution.<br/><br/>I won't go through all of the pros/cons because I believe you can see those on their website and the amazon description. But I will go through some of the things that I have noticed this first week.<br/><br/>1. Set up is very simple...if it works. I have a very secure wifi connection and the sync module would not connect to it. I had to do a hard reset on my wifi and reinstall it with less security settings to get this to work. This is why I gave the product 4 stars. My phones, computers, etc have no problem connecting to this wifi but the sync module did. So beware if the sync module wont connect you might need to reset your wifi to get rid of little settings that may be blocking it. I believe my error was a DHCP setting with OpenDNS that I was using. Anyway...<br/><br/>2. Support - I sent them an email on a Sunday night about my connection problem and did get a response Monday morning. So that seems like good support to me.<br/><br/>3. I like that I can enable/disable certain cameras, that way I can shut off my backyard cam if my kids are playing out back or whatever.<br/><br/>4. Live mode is pretty cool and seems to work well.<br/><br/>5.  I am still playing with sensitivity. On 10, I was watching bugs fly by so I had to set it down to avoid that.<br/><br/>6. I am noticing wifi interference from the sync module. This is not something most users will ever notice but if you are doing high end compression/gaming you could notice lag in your wifi if you are not hard wired. I am not sure why its happening but I assume as their wifi unit firmware improves these kinds of issues will go away. Again, my kids/wife do not notice this at all, I just do because I monitor it.<br/><br/>Otherwise things are going well. If I have problems I will post them. I will say that a lot of the older reviews I read on the white cams are not relevant now as the features have changed so much since then. I think if you do your research you will be happy. I swear a few of these reviewers didn't even look at the products website or anything as some of their comments don't even fit the product.
 Love the camera, clear and sharp in the daytime.. at night the IR output levels seem a bit "hot" even on the low setting.. so that takes a bit of fiddling so that faces aren't washed out. It seems that if you have a low light level exterior light.. you may not need the IR on at all; as I said takes a bit of experimentation to get it set up for good quality IR night viewing. One thing I will say is that the night time IR radiator is pretty potent for such a little camera, imho.<br/><br/>Lastly... I spend a lot of time at my PC and I'm not always glued to my smartphone... so they need to create a PC app (Windows/Mac) that's as nice as the phone app. Ya, I know they make Droid emulators, etc. but that seems to me to be a sloppy way to do it, imho.<br/>But all in all.. I'd buy another one for sure...a great deal.
 I had purchased a four system camera package elsewhere and was so impressed I purchased this one camera system for my daughter so she could watch her dog during the day when at work. This is so very easy to set up and the quality of the picture is remarkably good. My only wish is that Blink had two-way audio.  I've seen package delivery, neighbors coming over and many animals in the yard I didn't know we had...…..so fun. I do not hesitate to recommend this product for your home and the price is very reasonable.
 2nd update - when one camera triggered at night it switches rapidly off and on for minutes at a time, burning through batteries within a week. Customer support is awful. They keep telling me there's an issue with the firmware and just replace the batteries. After several calls they told me I'm using the wrong brand of batteries. After more calls they sent me replacement batteries instead of a new camera - dead ones.<br/><br/>Video timing is awful. Cameras trigger well after the subject is in the frame so videos make it look like people teleport into view, as suddenly they're just there. Bought a Nest instead.<br/><br/>Update - We have 2 cameras. One (less than 100' away from the router) has inconsistent WiFi connectivity - sometimes ok, often poor, even after we moved our router to accommodate the camera. Cameras don't always alert, and when they do, it takes too long to connect to and review the video to see what's going on. What good is a multi-camera system if you can't space them out around your house?<br/><br/>Also, one camera is mounted on our garage. We got a notification from the app that the camera picks up too much activity (the battery is draining fast) and we should move the camera to a spot that won't pick up so much motion. Right - so place the camera where it won't see anything...  If the price is too good to be true, then it is!<br/><br/>Original -<br/>The camera picture is good, even on the middle quality setting. Night picture is good as well. Fish eye provides wide field of undistorted view. App offers user activated real time video in lieu of video recording.<br/><br/>Set-up was easy, but be sure to write down the camera id as it’s not stored anywhere in the app. If it has to be re-entered you have to dismount and disassemble the camera to get the number. Reasonably priced compared to other systems. Price was right on Prime day, but not sure I would buy at full price because of the following concerns:<br/><br/>* Video playback is delayed after app notification, sometimes for minutes. Too long to see who’s knocking on your door, stop someone from stealing you packages, or quickly determine who’s creeping in the middle of the night.<br/><br/>* Both the camera and control station radio range is limited - more so than my other mobile WiFi devices. Be sure you have GREAT WiFi coverage in your planned mounting spots or you’ll be buying an extender/mesh to make them reliable.<br/><br/>* Motion detection range is shorter than expected - concerning if you’re mounting the camera up high, like under an eve to offer some additional weather protection. Camera view far exceeds motion detector range (videos often start after the subject is well in the frame).<br/><br/>Some other points - they only come in black. If you want to change the color, you have to pay extra for a silicone cover. If you want to use a wired connection to keep them charged, they are no longer waterproof. There is no internal video storage - if there’s no WiFi, there’s no video, even after connection is restored. You can hear but you can’t talk.<br/><br/>This system is probably best suited for collecting evidence rather than providing real time info. Good for notifying you of activity (possibly delayed) when you’re not home so you could call the cops...
 The Blink 2 camera system we purchased is annoying because the motion detection is very inconsistent.  We must set the sensitivity to 6 or 7 to detect people and cars in our driveway and sidewalk, but then get tons of false alarms.  Seems very sensitive to bright sunlight, causing many false alarms.  Wi-fi range is poor and made more difficult because the cameras have to communicate with the hub and your wi-fi simultaneously and the hub range is poor.  We had to add a mesh network to our home (3200 sq. ft) to get the blink cameras to work consistently.  After all the expense, the motion detection is inconsistent and very frustrating.  On the plus side, it is an easy system to monitor and manage.  Just wish the motion detection worked better.  Note that battery life is nowhere near 2 years either.
 They work ok.<br/><br/>PRO -<br/>1. Easy to set up.<br/>2. No subscription needed.<br/>3. Wireless set up which is convenient.<br/>4. Clear video<br/>5. Good motion detection<br/><br/>CON -<br/>1. The batteries really last 8-10 weeks.<br/>2. One serious design flaw if the CLIP that attaches these to the wall. They have limited movement to get the right viewing angle and they are SO flimsy that if you touch the camera at all it falls off. Every time I have to replace the batteries it takes me 20 mins to put it back on the wall correctly.<br/>3. The contrast gets messed up about every 3 weeks which results in the nightmare of taking the camera down and  putting it back on that totally awful wall clip<br/>4. Lack of snapshot photos when motion is detected. This is something cheaper camera do and is really convenient
 This is my first camera that I set up around my house so I can only speak for that. I looked at customer reviews about the Arlos, the Nest, and the Ring cameras. I went to Best Buy to look at the different cameras and talk to a salesman about them. The particular guy I dealt with didn’t even mention the Blink cameras. I asked him about them and his response was that the Blinks run off of batteries and how did I know if they would make those particular batteries anymore. Keep in mind they run off of two AA Lithium batteries which are plentiful and pretty damn cheap. AnywAy.... I went with a Blink camera and set it up for my particular need in my back yard. It took me a little while messing with the settings and camera angle  but I was able to set it up to where it starts recording as soon as someone steps into my backyard down my driveway. This is what I wanted and needed. The set up is easy and the video is pretty damn good. Ive had one issue where the camera acted up but I reset my modem and it was fine after that. Other than that the camera responds quite well to motion in my driveway and it picks up motion at about 30 ft for me. So far I’m very happy with this camera and I plan on purchasing another one. If you are looking to get a pretty damn good camera without dropping $300-400 this is a great buy in my opinion.
 No live notifications when motion is detected. You only get notified after its been recorded and saved. Not a good surveillance system live is only when you click to view not when triggered by motion. I purchase this to watch when people come to the house when I'm away in live but it does not notify when they actually there. App is also very slow with notifications.
 I really like this system. There are a few elements I would add, but in the interest of keeping costs lower, can sacrifice those. I was impressed with how little effort it takes to set up the servers and the cameras. Adding on cameras is also very easy. I have very little experience with security cameras, but I do understand wifi. One limitation is the wifi connection, but in our small-mid sized home, each camera has a solid connection. Weather does not seem to affect the cameras, even though the mounting brackets concerned me at first. It seems a little light, but the outdoor cameras have held up well in the Oklahoma winds, storms and interaction with critters. Wasps and Bees might be attracted to them as they tend to trigger the cameras more often than any other motion event. I am very pleased with the range and clarity of the cameras, although at night it is a bit limited (but that is to be expected). I love being able to check the action out via my iPhone and share it with others in my family. I do wish that you could have multiple accounts on the same system (sometimes others will delete the videos before I get a chance to review or save them.
 I had high hopes, but this product is just not ready for release.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Decent video quality<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Android App crashes intermittently<br/>- Viewing short clips takes 10-20 seconds to load before you can view, most functions take a relatively long time<br/>- The system is constantly busy, this one is the most frustrating<br/>- Constant "Command failed to complete" when trying to update settings<br/>- The system goes offline fairly often<br/>- No integration with Alexa, Seriously..! (or at least it just doesn't work when trying to arm or disarm)<br/><br/>I have a very fast internet connection, the module has a good connection, but the system is just flawed. I will test for another week but most likely they are going back...<br/><br/>UPDATE: One camera failed and customer service plays email-tag, will not replace camera after 6 months of use.  STAY AWAY..!
 Pros:<br/>1. Small<br/>2. Battery Powered<br/>3. No Wires<br/>4. Okay For Special Situations, But BUYER BEWARE, This Is Definitely NOT A 24/7 Recording System<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. It Can't Record  24/7 So You Can Very Easily Miss Critical Shots.<br/>2. Motion Sensitivity Isn't 100% Reliable<br/>3. You May Have To Sacrifice What You Can See (Camera View) In Order To Get The Motion To Trigger Reliably. It Appears to Trigger From Side To Side And Doesn't Trigger Very Well Coming Straight At The Device<br/>4. In A Higher Traffic Area, It Will Wear Out The Batteries Much Faster<br/>5. You Might Miss An Important Shot Because the Triggered Video Clip Might End And Not Re-trigger Fast Enough To Capture A Critical Video, So You're Left With Only A Partial Video<br/>6. I have My Bink XT Mounted Above My Garage Door, So If The Door Gets Slammed Hard Enough, The Camera Moves Downward On It's Swivel Mount And Doesn't Stay In The Spot That I Originally Set It.<br/>7. If You Have Notifications Turned On, Then Every Time A Camera Is Triggered, You Get Alerts. Multiple Cameras Equal Even More Alerts. That Could Get Very Annoying, Especially In A Higher Traffic Area.<br/>8. If A Theft Or Incident Occurred At A Specific Time And You Wanted To Go Back And View It, If The Motion Sensor Doesn't Trigger, Then You Won't Have Any Video To View<br/>9. It's Way Over Priced For What You Get<br/><br/>Conclusion: It's Works For Certain Situations, But I Wouldn't Trust It For A Mission Critical Location
 Disappointed. Just bought three of the XT after having indoor Bllink cameras for nearly a year.<br/>The XT was widely promoted to have 1080p resolution. I don't believe it. Daytime  image apparently no different from the original Blink (which isn't bad).<br/>The XT night vision is the worst of any night vision camera I've tried. I hoped using IR illumination would be more stealthy, but it just replaced the bright white LED with a bright red LED. The night image of the original Blink is far superior IMO.<br/>Still no two-way audio (but I knew that)<br/>The ability to turn off the record light seems like an after thought. It is done with a physical switch inside the battery compartment. Why isn't this controllable through software like the night illumination?<br/>Still no ability to record during live view (but I knew that also).
 For the prime day price we bought two of these, they are okay. They take video and save it on to a cloud based system and alert us on our cell phones.  However, there is no way to designate zones that you would like the video to focus on. Therefore, every car and wind blown plant triggers the system.  Now the system is warning us we are going through the batteries too fast. But if we set it to a less sensitive mode, the camera never records. So we are stuck with incessant alerts. The Nest system owned by my son is far superior but more costly.
 The camera is good but it could be better. Getting the sensitivity is hit or miss, either it goes off for very rain drop or it misses people coming and going. The picture could be a little clearer faces are hard to see unless you screen shot the paused video and zoom in that way. I do like how its wireless but the range isn't very far. There is no way the battery will last 2 years with how often we get it coming on for false alarms. We have moved the camera 3 times to get the best possible area and have adjusted the sensitivity to many times to count. This camera will be moved to the back of our property as a just in case someone should decide to have a face off with our pig. Not a very good front door camera, or high traffic camera. I purchased on primeday for a great deal, I won't pay full price for this setup!!!
 I bought a couple of these with the intention of using them for outdoor security cameras. I decided to set them up inside first to pair them but I was never able to connect to both cameras consistently. The first camera I connected to would eventually stream video but then the second would never connect. The video was never great, often laggy and took a very long time to show up in the app. They both showed as having poor wireless signal even though they were right next to my router. I'd blame it on my wireless network if any other device I use was having any problems, but they were not and I've never had any issues with the other cameras I've used. I think that these cameras have a long way to go before they're ready for everyday consumer use. I returned them the day after I got them.
 My experience with the blink xt has been nothing short of an exercise in futility. The cameras fall short in just about every category I can think of. That is not even including the slow, and mostly unhelpful costumer service they offer. Expect weeks of trouble shooting and waiting on responses when, (not if) you have to contact costumer service. The shipping is the slowest possible method that they can find. On a scale of 1-10 their costumer service is about a 3.<br/><br/>Here are the reasons you should look elsewhere if you are serious about home security.<br/><br/>1: Conectivity. The cameras operate through your home network and a “sync module”, both the camera and the sync module must be connected to your home network for the camera to operate. Good luck trying to get them to connect together unless you live in a shoe box. We live in a modest ranch house with a centrally located router. We can’t even get a reliable connection on our garage. No connection no camera.<br/><br/>2: false triggers and no triggers. On the average we get between 4-20 false triggers each day. Half the time they don’t trigger at all. Which is the real deal killer. Most of the time When they do trigger about half the time the person, vehicle or animal, has already left the cameras field of view. This is absolutely unacceptable. There is a major flaw in the mechanics of this unit and no amount of software tweaking will fix it.<br/><br/>3: Battery life. They lie, or at the very least, mislead people about the battery life. We had to replace the batteries after 3 months of operation. Their 2 year battery life rouse is based on temperature and amount of triggers. So if your camera is in a high traffic area expect to be replacing the batteries frequently.<br/><br/>After 4 months of testing I would not recommend this product to anyone. It’s Inconsistent and unreliable. Add in the poor customer service into the mix and you have a unit that should be dismissed out of hand. This is a novelty item at best. Not a security camera. I will throwing ours in the trash where it belongs.
 The BIGGEST waste of money! I bought 3 external and 2 internal cameras. The internal ones work OK, at best. The exterior ones are the worst. 8/10 attempts to live view fail. When one attenpt fails, you have to wait 2-3 minutes otherwise you get the dreaded “system busy” message. What good is this if I have to wait this long to be able to get a live view around my house? It sure gives potential intruders more enough time to get their operation done by the time I succeed at getting a live view. I often end up giving up all together. My Ring on the other hand, which is located next to one of the 3 Blinks, never fails at live view. Garbage! Wish I wasnt past the return window. Biggest waste of money. Already started replacing them with Ring cameras. Dont waste your money!
 I purchased these cameras after having several items stolen from my college apartment. I received real-time notifications and video clips of activity in my room while I was away. Even though the footage was captured at night, the video was still remarkably clear with the IR illumination.  With this footage, I was eventually able to recover the stolen items.
 My wife and I purchased a three camera Blink XT package a week ago and are absolutely loving it!  It was super easy to install at the house.  You literally just plug in the base to any wall socket, scan the QR code on the back of the base station and three cameras to register them with the app, place the cameras and you are ready to go!  The base station is smaller than a hockey puck and the camera mounts only use one screw.  Some say they are a bit flimsy but my experience so far has been positive.  I could see how a really strong breeze could cause them to vibrate and maybe set off a false motion alert but so far, that hasn't been the case for me.  I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a high quality, yet relatively inexpensive wireless security camera system.  Did I mention it's wireless!?  Heck of a product.
 As a previous reviewer mentioned, the cameras especially the XT are great! The thing that is missing is the ability to talk on the camera. Example someone came to my door, I was not at home and could not ask what the purpose of the visit was. Since it has a microphone that pics up sound I do not know why a speaker cannot be added.<br/>The function and color of the camera is awesome.
 We have 3 Blink cameras.  We have consistently used 2, but couldn’t get the third one to motion detect.  As we were in the middle of a several month remodel we put the camera away.  We recently had our wifi checked and put the camera up again...again motion detect not working.  I emailed customer service and they responded within hours.  They gave me some things to try and I wrote back with my results.  Again, I heard back within hours.  Long story short they determined it is a hardware issue and are sending me a new camera.  We really like the other 2 cameras we have and have been thinking of buying a couple more.  Customer service just cemented that for us.
 I purchased 5 BLINK cameras in July 2018, The plus, have not replaced batteries yet, Wifi connetivity is easy, Picture is great, Cameras are very easy to use to view, review and to change settings.<br/>The negative, Need access to BLOCK motion zones to eliminate falses alerts, "too block tress or flowers"<br/>FYI, I purchases a small battery backup for the Internet router and the Blink system, this allows the cameras to function when the powers is off or and stops the cameras from cycling during power surges.
 3 Blink. XTs and a. monitoring module for this low price is unbelievable when compared to the High Price units out there.  Best thing is it is Wireless!  Only 2 double A batteries in each camera - Amazing.  easy set up once you take the hardness out of your head.  Quit trying to make it so hard.  Set up the module to your network - piece of cake.  Add a camera, give it a name and voila!<br/>think the 'hardest' was getting camera set up to get 3-5 bars in the sync module and network.  A little tricky, but not hard.  We have 3 right now, one outside front porch, one inside, and one outside back porch area.  You can set the sensitivity, I haven't figured out the temperature part yet, but everything else is pure common sense.  We are looking at purchasing another camera to add on to the back yard area.<br/>Find out you don't need to spend $600 or more to get good quality security.  They are working on the 2 way communication.  Right now there is audio to hear what is being video taped/recorded.  You can set it for specific times.  It does keep videos to play later.  We are extremely satisfied with Blink!  Put our sticker on the window, 2 are mounted, one just sits where it can't be seen - takes in majority of living room, can watch on your phone from anywhere you are traveling, can even control it from there with the Blink app - Best way I finally got husband to get a security camera.  Luv it!
 I'm extremely disappointed with this product. I purchased five of these XT outdoor cameras and the long story is the quality is poor, the motion detection is either too sensitive or not enough, the batteries don't last anywhere near as long as advertised, and the system cannot be counted on for security. The cameras frequently miss activities. The resolution and range are insufficient to read license plates in the driveway. It's difficult to get the videos off the phone (5 inch screen) onto a larger screen to get the benefit of HD. This is an immature technology and I'm embarrassed to say I fell for the promise of wireless cameras. I have never been so disappointed in a purchase and I would not recommend these devices to anyone.
 Easy and fast to set up and ea sy to use. Video quality is much better than I expected. Audio is nice but for outside monitoring not that useful. I mean I don't really care if I have audio if somebody is breaking into my house. Good wide angle perspective. After a few weeks of use, response to motion activity is good, while I like the ability to adjust sensitivity. I also like the ability to schedule when it's armed and disarmed. For example I have it automatically arm every evening, like when I disarm when guests come over. Painted the camera in front of house to help camouflage. I obviously didn't paint the motion detector, camera lens, or microphone. So some portion of the black unit is not camo.
 I have been looking for security cameras for my home, but was worried about setting it up myself. This was very easy to set up, very effective, and good video quality.  A few drawbacks are though, you can only use the app on phone and not on a computer and there is a 10 second lapse from when motion is sensed and video recording stops; only 1 minute recording time and then motion sensor must be triggered again.<br/><br/>Great - NO MONTHLY MONITORING FEES!!
 Purchased this device after the price drop and could not be happier with my choice. I was looking at the Blink XT vs. Arlo Pro 2. AP2, in my opinion can match specs with the XT, but is way, way overpriced. I have Verizon FIOS 150 Mbps and run my camera in enhanced 1080p resolution. The application allows you to view, edit settings and even email an event  from within the app. Clarity is the best that I have seen so far and the night vision is so impressive that I have included some pictures for comparison. I am in a very rural area where the only glimmer of light that the inside of my garage can see at night is from the distant lamp post and occasional drive by other than that, total darkness. The night vision is very impressive. I plan to purchase a few more. From what I understand, once you have the one camera kit, you can add 9 additional cameras to the network. More than enough for me.
 Have used these extensively and are very happy with their performance...only wish the outdoor  ones had been heat rating then 90 degrees...doesn't work in Arizona that well...lol
 Captures video and sound well, easy playback through the app. Free cloud storage is the best feature! Would have been 5 stars; however, their 2 year battery life claim is beyond laughable; I barely squeaked 3 months out of mine (received it on 8/2/18 and batteries died on 11/13/18. If it wasn't for the price paid as a Prime Day purchase, I might have given it only 3 stars because of the poor battery life; however,  because of the "deal" and the other "positive" features, 4 stars it is.
 I previously had purchased about 5 cameras and returned them all for one reason or another. So needless to say I didnt have much hope when I purchased blink. However I was pleasantly surprised to find it does everything it says it does. I like the fact that it works on AA lithium batteries, so there are no wires. I gave it 4 stars only because the mount is not as adjustable as I would like it to be. I actually purchased an Echo Spot and can now ask to see my porch  when someone knocks. That way I know if it's a solicitor or one of my friends.
 I can't imagine anyone putting these outside unless they were located very high off the ground. All you have to do to steal it is pop it off the mount - a child could do this or anyone with a broom handle. Also - I live in Phoenix - beware - the "all weather" Blink has a maximum operating temp of 113, not high enough for the desert.
 I set up my Blink XT with an advertised 2 Year Battery Life only to find the batteries had died in a month and a half. Because I dont check the recordings everyday, honestly who has time to do that, when I actually needed to go back and review my security camera footage I was unpleasantly surprised to find the dead batteries and no footage.<br/><br/>Now less than two month later, the camera has totally stopped working. After hours and hours of working through the trouble shooting advise, the camera needs to be replaced. 3 months and my Blink XT has failed completely and it only recorded a portion of the time it was up AND completely failed to work the one time I needed security camera footage in the last three months.
 I can't quite firure out what is up with the negative reviews. Maybe Amazon has made improvements to the system. I bought two cameras almost 2 months ago and they are both inside my house. They were simple to install and set up. The resolution is not the best when I view video or pics on my phone, but I can always use my IPad and the images are much better. Possibly more improvement on a regular computer, but that's only a guess. I recently figured out that when watching a live video that it can be magnified fairly significantly- I hadn't seen this info anywhere and it's a nice thing to know.  I have no problem with the storage. As stored videos are reviewed, they can be deleted or saved as necessary. I was also worried about the batteries, but after two months they are still fine. I would recommend purchasing extra batteries so you have them available; they have a long shelf life. FYI: Energizer is the only company that makes these AA Lithium's (each camera takes 2 batteries.) Also, I did try putting one camera outside, but streetlights and car headlights put off such a glare that it makes it hard to view anything. To maximize outdoor use the camera needs to be away from bright lights and close (within 5-10') to what you need to view. If you're expecting perfection you will need to spend more money. I feel that these get the job done for what I need in just being able to survey my domain ;)
 I bought 5 camera XT directly from Blink website. This product is hit or miss. If your camera works, you will be extremely happy and you get loads of features for free compared to Arlo or Nest. In my case they didn't work!<br/><br/>All the features advertised are great only if it works. Out of 5 cameras, 2 wouldn't work. I reported to Blink support and they told that my wifi reception is poor. Spent $100 buying wifi extenders and made sure all the cameras has full coverage. The two cameras still wouldn't work. wall mount which came with the product is terrible. It can be easily knocked down by strong wind. These cameras are supposed to be mounted externally. It should have better build quality compared to the existing flimsy plastic mount.<br/><br/>Customer service is great. They agreed to ship new cameras blaming the ones I have as manufacturing defect. I am sending it back to blink.They need to improve their quality assurance process before shipping these products out to customers. I feel like I did beta testing for them for last 10 days!
 While this is a nice little camera it is not quite ready for the outdoors. (1) By far the biggest issue is the lack of motion zones. It either is too sensitive or not sensitive enough. It is useless without zones. (2) It does not consistently grab the moments before the motion. (3) I can find no way to backup the images to somewhere else. (4) When watching live you can't record. To me these are serious deficiencies in the product and make it almost useless as an outdoor option.
 I have the indoor and outdoor cameras. Have had the indoor about a year and a half and the outdoor for roughly a year. I also have a Ring doorbell.<br/>Pros: quick to respond for the most part when I go to live view; quality is decent; easy to set up; easy to install; easy to use.<br/>Cons: batteries don’t last as long as they say; currently defective at 9 sensitivity level and get lots of false notifications; some issues with the system such as it going down, not connecting to internet, etc.<br/>Having said all that, I prefer this to Ring. They are much more responsive and I don’t have nearly the lag time when a notification goes off. I can’t speak through the cameras which is a drawback but as a whole, I am pleased with them. If I had to buy them again...I might look around first. There are a lot of wireless options out there and I would like the talk option.
 This is a ok camera but there is no way the batteries would last 2 years unless it is somewhere that nothing ever sets it off. Ours goes off a couple times a day and the batteries have lasted about 2 months. The only reason we bought this was because of the supposed battery life. We also have an Arlo in a different area and the batteries last longer in it. The Arlo also has better night vision. The night vision on the Blink is super fuzzy and no way to make out any details. The Blink has also just randomly stopped working and I had to reset it to get it to work again.<br/><br/>***Update*** Motion detector not working at all now. I stood in front of it and waved and it did not come on. You can still view live video but that is it. Garbage. Plus, maybe the battery will last longer than 2 months now that it never comes on!
 Set it up according to instructions. Worked for an hour, and then stopped activating and recording. Called Blink. They were very helpful, but couldn't get it to work either. Sent me a new one, and gave me an RA for the old one. Painless process. Installed the new one. Worked for a few minutes, but will no longer motion activate.<br/>UPDATE: I moved the location, deleted and reconnected it, and everything works fine!<br/>Picture is very clear with only medium intensity and Best quality settings. I use a 10 second retrigger time with 5 sensitivity and a 20 second clip. I will buy some more to connect and use in other parts of the yard.
 I've been using cameras for a week only so can't comment on long term usage yet. So far they work OK for wireless, battery powered cameras.<br/><br/>- Setup was fairly easy although first try for sync module failed but second try worked. Adding cameras is very easy afterwards.<br/>- Video quality is very good both at night and day<br/>- Getting live feed is a slow process but that's expected with any battery powered camera.<br/>- App is OK to use but can use a lot of usability<br/>- Waiting to see what battery life will look like.<br/><br/>What can be improved:<br/>- They seriously need integration support with other smart home systems such as Smartthings. Right now the only option is through another developer RBoy but you have to pay it. Fortunately I had already paid for his device handlers, smartapps so Blink integration didn't cost me extra but I wouldn't have been a happy customer if I had to pay extra for it.<br/>- 1080p support is still coming but I think it has been a while since they stated it.
 Great for keeping an eye on pets as well as everything else. I was looking at a larger and more expensive hardwired security camera system for months before pulling the trigger on Blink. I got 5 outdoor and 5 indoor cameras. The storage I get from a two module setup is plenty. I delete the video clips every few days and the most I’ve used is 7% of storage. Read all the Blink instructions and noticed prior to purchasing as this system my not fit your needs.
 I am a proud owner of 5 indoor Blink Cameras + Sync Module, and I have now added 4 outdoor cameras. I had been using the indoor cameras outside, under cover, and inside successfully since they were released. Once Blink announced the addition of the outdoor cameras with true IR technology, I knew I had to add them to the mix. No more blinding light at night when it detected motion! I love my Blink outdoor cameras and have recommended them to quite a few friends and neighbors. I have a large-ish home- over 3800sqft. I have placed the sync module on the first floor in a central location, and the rest of the cameras are placed around the perimeter of my home. I have not noticed the battery life claims of "2 years", but then again, I do tend to have a lot of motion and alerts for my specific application, which is what I intended. However, the batteries do last longer than I even imagined they would. Changing the batteries is a breeze, and the ability to place these in any location without wires is well worth the hassle of batteries draining a a tiny bit faster than anticipated.

There is a buffering issue with the new Echo Show, limited in functioning there. Set up was a bit rough. I tried 3 devices and found a lot of issues. I finally got a Fire Tablet to connect and complete the setup. Adding cameras is very easy once Blink network is set up. Great picture and has night vision too. No wires to fuss with, so mounting isn't a issue. I wish it had a computer program. Will work with android cell phone, Amazon Fire Tablet, Limited on echo Show, due to buffering problem. Set up cannot be done on Echo Show.
 Idea is great. Received 3 defective cameras- could not use with batteries (power could not be maintained even with new batteries simply to connect to the system) Tried to activate with USB and was successful. Requested 3 new cameras as all tests show these defective when using battery power. Customer service at Blink HORRIBLE. Phone rep nice and helpful but when he asked permission to replace, supervisor said no. On phone for 2 hrs with multiple supervisors at Blink and none interested in helping to replace. Would suggest alternative camera system
 I can see these cameras working at the front door or near a door. I set these up to watch main street on two sides of our house and either they recorded everything or nothing. And even when they did record everything they had a delay so for example a passing car was recorded almost leaving the picture. I also had to replace batteries every week. I ended up returning them and buying 4 wireless WiFi cameras  (wired for power) for the same price.
 I had to change my Wi-Fi settings so the device could pick up the 2.4hz instead of 5. Then, I had to change the password requirements because the device doesn't work with special characters. The website says this was fixed with newer models in a specific serial number change; mine is in this range and it was not fixed. There is no customer support. The mounting hardware is sub-par. Can easily be broken. The only mounting hardware is a little screw. I haven't even found a way to mount this yet, but it gets 1 star just for the nonsense of getting this far.
 I paid 152 but I thought I was getting a camera with audio and videos after spending 152 for just one camera I didn’t want to have to pay additional money that s crazy
 BEWARE HORRIBLE SERVICE FROM BLINK!!<br/><br/>I have ONE of 8 cams that seems to be defective. It alerts every few minutes even with sensitivity set to the lowest setting of “1”.  Even while in an empty room, inside of a box..  so I contacted blink tech support, it takes days to get a response, and only receive one line responses that don’t help my issue. The cams that do work are fine and serve their purpose. The app needs some updates to get some basic features. Like reordering the cams. Currently you are stuck with the cams in the order that you installed them.
 Bought this on QVC for a better deal than offered on Amazon.<br/><br/>4 stars for a couple reasons.<br/><br/>The XT camera case feels a little cheap physically.<br/><br/>There should be a way to secure the camera to the mount that is more theft concious.  Very easy to just take the camera off the mount.<br/><br/>I have SimpliSafe for the interior of my home.  The blink camera is a better deal for exterior.  SimpliSafe does not yet have outdoor waterproof cameras.  They do have the doorbell, but at $179 it is pricey.  I was able to get 3 blink XT cameras from QVC for $200.  So 3 angles of viewing around my home for $20 more than one SimpliSafe doorbell? No brainer.
 I bought 3 cameras and sync module from the blink website. Overall, I am satisfied with the simplicity and quality of installation and use. My biggest complaint is that you do not receive a motion notification until after the clip is finished recording. I bought these cameras to feel safer and if someone is lurking around the house, I'd like to know that instantly. But hopefully if someone wanted to break in, it will take them longer than 60 seconds (max clip length) and I can address the situation in time. On the upside, they do show interest in improving the product and hopefully make good changes within the software specs soon. The camera itself is awesome and they're going to have a doorbell this year that I will definitely buy.
 Great system and easy to install. Would have given 5 stars if each camera had its own notification setting. Would be nice to get notification on motion for front door camera versus backyard where I know my dogs are running around. Currently notifications can only be set at the application level so they occur when any of the cameras detect motion. Other than that we love these! We hope the company will release a security system and doorbell to integrate with its cameras. Great company.
 This is a good product. The cameras have good resolution, even in night mode. I wish it had two-way talk. It's a good product at an affordable price.<br/><br/>UPDATE 1/20/19 One of the cameras no longer connects to the Sync Module. I have followed the instructions on how to reconnect with no luck; it still won't connect. Contacted Blink Customer Service, actually have been emailing them all day; they keep going back to which batteries I installed, I installed the batteries they recommended, and the camera still won't connect. Customer service told me to install a cable to the micro usb port. I have the cable connected to the camera and the sync module but the camera still won't connect. I haven't heard from customer service in a few hours. I am starting to regret buying this system.
 If you don't mind changing batteries a lot it's not bad. But for a home security camera you obviously want high quality and longer than a few seconds clips. I had the quality turned to 1080 with sensitivity higher but not all the way and 10 second clips and would get about 2.5 weeks battery life out of the thing (not quite the two years). With these settings the storage would also fill up pretty quickly with just 1 camera.<br/><br/>I would get so many false positives, squirrels, neighbor cats, spiders, etc that it would trigger so many times a day and lol the battery. I obviously know this effects battery life with the settings I had on it but it should be able to tell if a squirrel or car is going thru my driveway. I was also not impress with the night vision. Overall hard to read any license plates clearly in my driveway unless I had a long recording and tried to pause it multiple times.<br/><br/>I got a good deal on this on prime day but no way I'd pay full price for this. At this point considering Arlo or nest, both for hard wire options and Arlo for the onsite storage option.<br/><br/>Overall probably wouldn't recommend, to get the best quality and longest clips the battery just doesn't cut it. I didn't test high end batteries (just used good Duracell/Energizer) but according to their marketing that shouldn't be a requirement to get the 2 year battery life.<br/><br/>I'll be spending more and getting a more reliable system.
 The system is ok. I think the value for the price is ok, but the company is lying by saying the batteries last for two years. I've had the three camera system for 6 months now and I've replaced the batteries in each of them 3 or 4 times. Makes me wish I would have saved the money and set up something wired. I don't think completely wireless cameras are an option, but they lie to you and say the batteries will last 2 years with regular use. Apparently regular use means not using them at all.<br/>Also, the app sucks and there isn't a web interface, which makes no sense to me.
 I originally tried to post a review for this system only to get redirected to the panic system. Today 01/04/2019, after 14 months, 2 lithium battery changes and a whole lot of missing clips. One of my cameras died. It sat on my balcony undisturbed keeping watch over my trash area, in the shade! Quite a cushy lifestyle and it just gives up on me. I’m disappointed. My logi circle cameras (that I stupidly gave away) are still working. I can’t wait to get a new system.
 We installed these for security and because our driveway has a curve which eliminates our ability to see the driveway clearly. These cameras have exceeded our expectations. We have been able to know when vehicles are in our driveway, deer passing through and even 2 runaway horses from our neighbors. The batteries do not last 2 years; 6 months and that is acceptable to us.
 Seemed great at first, but at some point i needed to change the Wireless network, and the result, it seemed is that it no longer validly recognized my s/n.  The horrible part is that this made the device totally useless, and a waste of metal and plastic.  That's (only one small part of) the problem when software makes cameras inside of your house DEPENDENT ON THE CLOUD.
 I like the video quality on day time only.<br/>I was surprised how bad and so unclear the video on night quality.<br/>im disappointed:(
 This system was TWICE ptovided with a defective hub AND was extremely difficult to setup WITH an expert on the phone guiding me.<br/>That said, the system now works great and is excellent. There are MANY sophisticated features that will serve one well if they learn how to use these features through trial and error. Doesn’t take long and the results are extremely rewarding.<br/>If your budget is lean, THIS is your system.<br/>I hear complaints about battery life. These are unrealistic because IF you stick to the parameters<br/>(simple math=4000 activations @5 seconds each, )it will meet specs. For what they do, Lithium batts<br/>are inexpensive and don’t leak (that I know of)<br/>Just make sure you hear the “click” when closing them up. Original mounts are not very good.
 i bought the 4 pack with the module. I have changed the batteries more times than i can remember, since i purchased this past July 2018. There's a delayed reaction when it comes to notifications. I've tried adjusting the sensitivity of the cameras, but no matter what number i put it on, i can't seem to add more battery life at all. The delayed reaction on the notifications are horrible. I've tried to contact customer service because 2 of my things on the back to mount the cameras are broken and i can't seem to reach anyone. i wish you could change the position of the cameras to be used sideways or something else, but not possible either. i am disappointed. I boutht these because i thought it was better than the other ones on the market, but i am really disappointed. I wish i knew the exact number i should have it on to save the life of the batteries and to not have notifications all of the time for dumb things, such as wind.
 I have been a happy Blink customer since 2016.<br/><br/>I am holding off on purchasing additional Blink cameras, a siren and the Video Doorbell until Blink provides additional information about plans to re-integrate with SmartThings. My most recent purchases of an additional indoor camera and two external cameras were in large part due to compatibility with my SmartThings hub. The removal of support with zero notice and zero explanation was very disappointing as I was a loyal customer who has recommended Blink Cameras to many friends and neighbors.<br/><br/>I suspect the purchase of Blink by Amazon or a security concern may have had something to do with cutting off the existing integration but as a customer it is a reasonable expectation to receive some type of explanation and/or information on your future plans to reintegrate with your own app, a amazon app or reauthorized 3rd party app. Otherwise I feel like I wasted money by purchasing additional cameras for my Home Automation system that was advertised as compatible with SmartThings by Blink but is now not compatible thanks to Blink pulling support of the 3rd Party integration without any notice, explanation, or alternative solutions.<br/><br/>Blink as a stand alone camera system is great, but the integration with a Home Automation system (like SmartThings is why I chose to purchase additional Blink Cameras). Although Blink cameras do have some advantages over some competitors (i.e. battery life, price, size, etc.), if not for the compatibility with SmartThings, I would have gone with an alternative solution that was compatible with SmartThings (despite any shortcomings). All things being equal I chose Blink but if Blink is not or was not compatible with SmartThings, I would have definitely chosen a different camera ecosystem.<br/><br/>Now I'm stuck, waiting for more info ... desperately hoping Blink will provide a solution for integration with SmartThings so that I can have the best of both worlds. Blink Cameras (that I don't have to return and/or try to sell) and using my existing Home Automation system (SmartThings hub).<br/><br/>Up until 2 weeks ago I would have rate this camera 5 Stars.  Still a 4 Star without integration to be fair but currently a very unhappy customer!
 Does exactly what it claims. Very easy to set up and install. I haven't owned it long enough to know for sure about battery life. I have three outside cameras and one inside. The most distant outside camera is about 75 feet from the hub and has several interior walls and one exterior brick wall between camera and hub. It only shows one bar on the signal indicator, but works fine. The specs for the system indicate a 1 Mb/s upload internet speed is required, but mine works fine with a 760K upload DSL.  When in motion sensing mode it takes around 30 seconds to a minute for an alert to be posted to my phone.  The picture quality is great, though the wide angle lens will, of course, cause some distortion and you may need to zoom in when looking at a stored clip in order to get a good look at something far from the camera; however, the resolution is good and that works fine. Overall, I am very impressed, especially with how well designed the set up and user interface are.
 Purchased this system under the promise that a Blink doorbell camera was going to be released.  The doorbell cam was delayed and then permanently put on hold.  I believe that a Blink doorbell cam will never be manufactured and now I have to find a new system.  Not happy.  The two-year battery life is a joke.  I got about three months life from each of the batteries that were provided.  So, don't put your cameras in a hard to reach spot - it is likely you will need to replace the batteries sooner than two (or even one) years. On the plus side, the cameras do work well (so long as they are close enough for WiFi connections) and have good images.
 Easy to install, good video day or night, but if you put them in high traffic areas (like my front door) you will need to replace your batteries every couple of months.  I use the proper batteries for these, but more traffic that triggers them the quicker the batteries run out.  Worth it though.  I love the fact I don't have to run power cables to these cameras.
 Using outdoors can be tricky if you don't have a strong Wi-Fi signal outside of the house. Both the plug-in base station and the camera have to connect to the Wi-Fi network it seems. Would be better if it was a standalone camera and you didn't need the base station.<br/>Live view can take 10 seconds to come on sometimes.<br/>A bright blue light on the face of the camera turns on when motion activated clip recording starts, so it isn't stealthly.<br/>Batteries dead after 3 weeks.<br/>Clips are stored in the Cloud. Who knows who has access to them.<br/>Meh. It's ok for $80, but not a penny more. $50 is really what it should be selling for.
 I got this camera off my wishlist for Christmas . I had zero issues setting up the camera and getting operational . My biggest complaint is delayed alerts and it's sensitive to everything , except when needed . I get alerts from passing vehicles , but literally does not catch my daughters coming in the door up the sidewalk  until they are almost in the door. The point of a security camera is to catch people lurking . Fix your firm ware so you can tweak zones because The activity zone feature is garbage. Doesn't work one bit. Picture is clear and the storage is included . But would love ways to tweak its its sensitivity so it performs as its needed !
 I am sorry to say the battery life is about 4 to 6 weeks at most. If you have a lot of traffic at your front door it may be less. I don't understand why you cannot use rechargeable batteries. It is a great camera as far as clarity, but the sensitivity is very hard to get right. It either sends false alarms(5) or misses a lot unless they are very close. (4) Easy to install and sync but.......
 We’ve had Blink cameras for about a year. We have four cameras and have all of the areas and doors covered at our house. One of cameras was malfunctioning and we called customer service. After they tried to troubleshoot the problem and could not be resolved, they sent us a new camera. Customer service has been helpful. The battery in the camera won’t last long if you have the setting set for enhanced. You need to decide how important the video clarity is important. The standard setting seems to work well for us.
 We live in an RV full time and needed a way to keep the RV secure, monitor pets, and temperature rig.  We use a Hotspot on the RV and our Macbook Pro that is setup as the RV Wifi.  We were able to get this setup and working in less than 30 minutes and it works great.  Only thing that would be better is if it had 2 way audio and an audible alarm.  Also not convinced it is sending Temperate alarms to my phone yet as I set the threshold that should trigger an alarm and it never sent a notification.  We will work with Blink Tech support if unable to get that to work.  Otherwise great solution for our RV life!
 I like this camera because it was very easy to set up. The phone app is simple to use. The videos are good quality, the alerts on my phone usually take about 45 seconds. I bought the additional bracket &amp; silicone cover for it because the camera is not under an eave. One thing I found is that heavy rain will leave big water drops on the lens that obscures the video.  I may have to mount it under an eave to avoid this.
 Great system for our needs.<br/>PROS: Completely wireless, EASY to install and easy to expand your system.<br/>VERY affordable compared to ANY of the other systems I researched.<br/>After buying my first set of four, I have added 5 more cameras since and it was easy.<br/>Simply auto connect your camera to the module and stick the cameras anywhere. I mounted one on a tree.<br/>You can see a snapshot or video from any camera at any time.<br/>You can easily hear audio from any camera.<br/>We have a VERY long house, and with our Wi Fi and control module in the middle, I've installed cameras outside at least 200' away and through several walls.<br/>We are able to monitor the system on both, my and my wife's iPhones &amp; iPads.<br/>You can individually arm &amp; disarm individual cameras.<br/>GREAT motion detection at long distances. Even at night. System said 25' but that must be for night. I pick up our small dogs or cat at much farther distances in the very corner of the scene.<br/>1-2 years between battery changes.<br/>EASY to individually adjust the sensitivity of each camera, along with other parameters of each camera.<br/>EASY system to install, learn and manage.<br/>NO MONTHLY FEES!<br/>FREE storage of clips.<br/>After doing a LOT of research, by far the best system for the money.<br/><br/>CONS: Does not have two way audio so you can talk at each camera position. (Not an issue for me)<br/>While the video quality is VERY good for me, (and I own a video production company), other products have slightly better night vision, but at more than double the price. i.e objects very close to the screen are a little over exposed compared to other units, but that helps smaller farther objects be seen better.<br/>Slight delay in triggering. On occasion we'll miss part of our cat or dog running through the lens view. But someone walking through will be picked up and recorded. (Typical for all wireless systems).<br/>I bought other mounting brackets with a lens shield to protect from rain, and that you can more easily remove for battery replacement. $25 for a set of four.<br/>If you need to go more than 200 feet from the control module, you might want to buy a hard wired system.<br/><br/>TIPS: Most of the negative reviews said "too many triggers". I saw those people had cameras pointed at high traffic areas like their street. Do NOT point at the street! ;-)<br/>Plan the camera installs in a logical order around your house to make monitoring easier. (But you can easily change the order of your cameras after the instal or after adding more cameras.
 Sadly these are a very poor choice for security cameras, in my opinion, they are too expensive and unreliable. We set these up because we were going on vacation. First thing we noticed was no zoom in the camera. One day after we left for vacation the sync module failed and we lost all contact. We thought it was our WiFi or the camera batteries but it wasn't. When we got back, I spent two hours on phone with support, they promised to send a new sync module. Here a week later, I still don't have it! What good are security cameras that do not work!<br/>UPDATE: As promised the company sent a new sync module! That was my whole problem. Suddenly I have clear, zoomable live video with clear audio! This is the system I wanted. Evidentially I bought one with a bad sync module. I stuck to 3 stars for all the aggravation it caused me by not working properly out of the box! Going on vacation again, see how it works remotely and update
 Purchased this system through another vendor. This is an OK system for casual use, but if you are having issues and need reliable video retention, this isn't for you. Motion activated recording is hit or miss at best. Image quality (daylight) is good to very good. Night time image quality is fair. Technical support is not very responsive. Im using the system because its OK and because I have it. When the time comes, I'll most likely replace it with something else.
 Received the 5 camera system in two days as promised.  Packaging was great.  Simple setup with loading batteries and linking console to internet as well as linking cameras.  No real instructions that I found for attaching the mounting bracket to the camera, but I figured it out in about 5 minutes.  Just push it into the hole in the back and it clicks in. Same for taking the arm off the mounting bracket.  Single screw to mount the camera to your preferred location.  Wish the bracket could swivel  360, but others said this as well.<br/><br/>I have a good internet speed and all cameras work great.  The iphone app works well and is easy to use.  I don't know how long the batteries will last, but I have had the system now for 2 weeks and it is great for the functionality and price.  I will get another system for another house I have in another state, so I can monitor it 24/7.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this Blink outdoor system.  I assume the indoor cameras will work well.
 The Base Unit that connects to the cameras and your home wifi will just stop communicating at times. Eventually, it will just stop all together. I'm an IT professional and can confirm that it just broke. They value one camera + base for $129 and 2 cameras + base for $229, so logically they would sell me a replacement for $30, but alas, that is not available.  And, since I've had it longer than 30 days it is not eligible for a refund.<br/><br/>Oh, and icing on the cake, someone stole my bike from my garage, the very thing I was hoping to avoid by getting these cameras. Thanks for nothing.
 I have had this camera for about four months and the camera will not detect me if I am more than five feet away.  The camera is only working half of the time and I can literally be standing a foot away waving my hands like an idiot and the camera will not activate.<br/><br/>I contacted Blink customer service and after back and forth emails, the Blink customer service representative that I was communicating with stopped responding to my emails for help. Instead, after fully explaining that the camera is only working half of the time, the person tried to hint that I was the problem and offered no solutions. I changed the settings, changed the batteries, rebooted my system, did an upgrade, and the camera is still not responding when I am beyond five feet.<br/><br/>At this point it is of no use if it can't detect me six feet away and only works half the time. What's the point of a warranty if they will not honor it? It's just a marketing scam to get you to buy something that they will not replace if it fails. Don't buy this junk.<br/><br/>I recommended this thrash to a friend and I am about to tell him to return them (he got more than one) before they fail and his 30 days get closer. Don't want him to be stuck with a piece of thrash that not even the company that makes them wants back. Stay away!
 Very glad I bought this product!  You can't see our driveway from the house so I always wanted a camera overlooking it, but didn't want to hassle with trying to run power.  This product is the answer.  Even if it only runs 1 year on the batteries that's fine.  It's one screw to mount it and set up is pretty easy.  I have noticed it can be late to pick up something moving directly at the camera, which the instructions warned of, but otherwise it works perfectly.  My only real complaint is that my older Fire HD8 does not work with the Blink XT camera.  A new HD8 is relatively inexpensive, but still..... really?
 4 cameras worked from the git go, number 5 had problems from day one. They will not replace as asked they just want to play with them remotely. I just want it exchanged, It does not perform like the others end of story.  Now i have another one that burns through 3 sets sets of batteries in three days. The blue light stays on all night. Finally I pull batteries for an hour and it seams to be working for now. At this rate i will have a 50% failure rate in 6 months. I have cameras systems in all 4 of my business, all outside, all exposed to rain, snow ect. I may lose one a year out of 64. Guess when these get down to a couple maybe somebody will have one that really works as advertised. One star because 0 was not an option.
 Love the fact that I am not paying a company to monitor these alerts for me. I have 3 outdoor cameras for now over a year. My front door, which points to a busy street, is the only one I have had to change batteries on yet. I will say that changing the batteries are a pain in the butt! They are sealed very well and I couldn't open up the case on my own. They did just do an update to the software that allows you to "ignore" spots of the field of vision. Once I did that the car traffic doesn't trigger the sensor anymore but as soon as my front gate is opened it is! Works wonderfully!
 We bought these for outside on the recommendation of a friend.  I should have done more research.  By the time I get the notice whoever was here is come and gone.  My husband left for work this morning and it didn't pick his truck up.  It picked up someone yesterday driving up the driveway but then didn't get them leaving!  We're going to replace these after doing research.  Lesson learned...do your own research.
 My wife and I thought that the price was very reasonable for all of the features that come with the cameras.  Wireless set up took a bit of time to get going, but overall wasn't too difficult.  We have our cameras set up within our house and outside house.  As for battery life, I have found extreme cold will shorten battery life, and if you set "sensitivity" to "high" to capture anything that moves within the camera's motion, your battery life will also diminish quickly.  But we both love the daytime and night IR features.  There is a blue light that comes on when the camera is activated, and a red light that comes on when the IR is activated - you can see both at night.  So, what I did was to cover each light with a small piece of black electric tape. I placed my cameras in the shadow areas around outside of house.  So, if someone was snoop around house or try to enter our house, they wouldn't see these blue and red lights come on, and the cameras would be completely concealed in the dark.  The other camera in our house and being so small, it can be placed practically anywhere.  Otherwise, when the batteries are running low, it's super easy to change-out to fresh ones.  Overall, we are very pleased with our Blink Security Cameras!
 If you have Xfinity, the module will not connect to Wi-Fi.The module won't connect to my home internet. It worked on my mobile hotspot, but that's not realistically doable in the long run.<br/>I'm a month in of trouble shooting. I followed the emailed instructions. However, my internet provider (comcast Xfinity)  will not do what blink customer service has asked me to do, because of liability  and internet security issues. Here's the email sent from blink:<br/><br/>"Thank you for contacting Blink Technical Support. We are more than happy to assist you today.<br/><br/>Regarding with your query on the connection of your WiFi, I was able to check here on your account that the sync module could not established a connection on the WiFi. I suggest to call your ISP (Internet Service Provider) to let them do this things.<br/><br/>*Firewall - Turn off<br/>*Parental controls - Disabled<br/>*Port 443 - Open<br/><br/>Once you can connect to your wifi network with your sync module, call them back and let them turn on and enable does  things that are mention. "<br/><br/>Comcast Xfinity will not do those things and after an hour with customer support, it is not going to happen.
 Though I purchased mine on HSN, I can not say enough great things about this camera.  I live in NYC and had gone to companies that sold and set up security cameras and the prices I was quoted was ridiculous (thousand and more) , plus they couldn't hide it discreetly with my home situation.  I felt discouraged as I needed it for security reasons that I can't explain in details.  I feel soooo much comfort NOW having these cameras.  Very simple to setup.  I have mine set up on a automatic timer to turn on during the days I'm away from home.  I also get a chance to check in on my pet.  I've been using mine for about month and no problems.  It really is simple to monitor with the app I downloaded for my galaxy 8 phone.  For the price, size, camera clearity, motion detector, app simplicity, fast customer service. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG!  btw...I wasn't paid for my review it's real.
 I've been buying these cameras over the last couple of years to monitor my animals. I have four cameras installed in the yard and four inside. The XT outside cameras have survived really well this last winter. We got a very wet California winter these cameras have not failed. One camera has hit the ground about a half dozen times. it's a little scratched up but still working great. Very durable! I like mobility of the cameras. You can move them as needed to suit the situation. The app is really easy to use. Takes a little tinkering to get the cameras right. Once you understand the settings it's kind of fun. Plus, they they have an outside audio feature you can use. And they have a temperature sensor in the camera it gives you the temperature. All in all a great system.
 Excellent color pictures during the day and good infra red pictures at night.  My cameras survived 50 mph gusts and rain the other day. They still work like new.  I love the free cloud storage.  I can access the camera and the saved clips from anywhere that I have internet connection to. The phone app works flawlessly.  I had to find the right place in my house to place the receiver module in order to pick up the camera signals that came from outside the building. The best part is that I can place these anywhere!  I even placed one in my vehicle parked nearby once.
 Love it!<br/><br/>EXTREMELY easy to set up. Install the app, and it walks you through everything. The app works great, the video quality is a decent quality, the sound quality is good, I am happy with the motion sensitivity, and the range of view is excellent. I haven't had it up long enough to review the night vision,  or the battery life... so I can't speak to that. Overall, I am happy with this purchase so far and would likely buy more of these at the sale price.
 I bough my Blink 5 camera system directly from Blink.  It did not reach 100 feet as advertised, I was lucky to get 30 feet.  Trying to get a return based on their 100% satisfaction guarantee has been troublesome.  So far 13 emails have occurred. At this point I have contested the purchase with my bank.
 Pros-This unit is easy to set up and use,it also has pretty good picture quality !<br/><br/>Cons-This system has a real delay,a serious delay,If they can fix the delay problem,I would give this system 5 stars,I have a arlo system also and it’s super quick with better picture quality,just a tad bit more expensive,but in my opinion the (Blink Outdoor)system gets a 3 at best!!Thinking about sending it back and just getting another arlo pro camara!!
 I had high hopes for these cameras. The setup is easy, but the reliability of the cameras is terrible. At least 70% of the time when you try to take a snapshot from a camera, you get the message  Thumbnail failed]. The telephone app does not allow you to zoom in on a thumbnail picture and finally there is no desktop/browser way to view the cameras. Very expensive product for very limited capabilities
 I have had these for more than a year now. I have 2 of them near each other. They are very inconsistent with picking up activity. What one sees the other should also but that isn't always the case. Many times they won't even see people walking by within 15 feet. At other times it will pick up every car that goes by in the street 40 feet away. They will take video of nothing quite often. I only have these scheduled to record from 9 pm to 7 am so the batteries have lasted a long time. I am happy with the video but not how inconsistent they are. I would look for a better product in the future.
 1. Need a way to watch live feeds or access recordings from a computer and not just your phone.<br/>2. Need to be able to mute notifications easily for a set period of time. This would be helpful when you are working around they yard or the kids are outside. My phone blows up with notifications and I don't feel that I should have to build complicated schedules. A simple mute with options for the number of hours.<br/>Otherwise this is a good product with not fee's for cloud storage which is a huge plus.

You do have to tighten up the screws on the brackets for a sturdy mount, those who complained apparently didn’t tighten them. We’ve had as low as -14 F weather and no problems. Just make sure your base station is in reach of your WiFi and you cámaras are well linked. So far no problems.
 I have tried a lot of security cameras in my home and in my studio. The technology is probably about the same for most of them. Where they break down is in software support. Ivideon comes to mind as a poor choice. DLink is also glitchy and undependable. Blink has an excellent interface and has only one small fault: there is no way to set the area for which motion detection is available; this results in false positives. It's a small thing compared to the overall reliability of these cameras and the software behind them.
 This product is not fit for environments in which heavy-duty security cameras are needed.<br/><br/>A) The delay in recording from when motion is initially detected means you will only catch people lingering in view.  If anyone is moving around with any sense of urgency (such as one might do after committing a crime), you'll be lucky to catch anything more than a blur.<br/><br/>B) Based on the current state of the product, no motion exclusion zones (Motion Zones?) means that you cannot have this camera facing a street, sidewalk, or any plants prone to swaying in the wind.  I imagine that a software update can cure this, but there's no telling if that will be free, as there are hints that Blink will be moving to a "Freemium"-type model.<br/><br/>C) The included camera mounts are lame, no offense to its designers.  The cameras will move in the event of anything more than a light breeze, causing motion detection to trigger depending on sensitivity settings.<br/><br/>That being said, it is a great, portable product for light-duty scenarios.  I find that video quality is great, the app is decent, and the free cloud storage is a nice touch.  I use this product exclusively indoors to check on my house, and the scheduled system enable/disable feature is quite handy.
 This is advertised as "Blink Now Integrates With Amazon Echo!"  However, I can't find it with Alexa.  I asked Amazon and they said "I've researched "Blink Home Monitor App" and found that it isn't available in the Amazon Appstore at this time. We're constantly adding apps to our selection, and apps unavailable now may become available in the future. I hope you would understand."  Which means it does not work with Alexa.  I was hoping that since I have Alexa both on my Kindle Fire and Fire TV I could use those to monitor my security, but nope!
 One of my xt camera didn't work (I bought two). I contacted the support team and started my more than two weeks troubleshooting process, which is ridiculous. The support agent kept asking me doing things that didn't solve my problem (somehow the motion detector didn't work, the other one works perfect even that one was further away from the module/wifi also on lower sensitivity setting) and finally he requested a replacement for me, but something even more ridiculous happened.  Initially when we started trouble-shooting, I gave him a wrong s/n number but I realized and corrected the number after first couple conversations. Now I received an email asked me to return the camera with first s/n. I wrote back and asked the agent to refer back to our previous conversation and modify the s/n. The agent wrote back and asked me to do the trouble shooting again with the correct s/n all over again, which I had been doing for the past two weeks..... I'm very very frustrated. I felt I paid for torture, not for peace of mind.<br/><br/>Update: From the previous review, looks like I'm pretty lucky to get a replacement. Thanks God the agent modified the s/n for me without going through the lengthy trouble shooting process again.
 I bought 8 cameras and 3 sync modules.  Indoors, Outdoors, and Always On.<br/><br/>The no-wire (battery op) feature is WONDERFUL!  The app is flexible with more features promised.<br/><br/>The motion detect is excellent, and (unlike 24/7 wired units) you only have to review the clips that actually show something.  Efficient.<br/><br/>Images are good.  Night vision is amazing.  Cost is astounding!  No monthly!<br/><br/>The web site has extensive info - take the time to check it out because you will be able to tell if this is the one for you.  For me, it was the ability to put these cams up (inside and out) with NO WIRES.  Total install time (ladders included) about 2 hours for 8 cams.  And it all works great.
 I searched hi and low for a battery only camera.  Blink XT is really worth buying.  It works Great.  Only a couple of things you might consider before buying this.  It only has one way voice but I have a Night Owl doorbell so I did not need the 2 way.  The camera works great for night vision I just wish I could have a bit longer than 20 to 25 ft of activity motion.  Wish angle was a little bit wider but still does a good job with 110 angle.  I wish I could record when in live view mode but not a deal breaker for me.  I have no issues with the 3 cameras I purchased.  Set up was easy.  App easy to use.  Push is great and very easy to control.  I probably will buy 2 more.
 The video quality is not that good. I can see that someone has driven into my driveway, can usually make out the model of the car, but that's about it. Forget about seeing the license plate number. Also the motion detector is slow to react. Battery life is not great either. Have had my units for less than 5 months and the batteries in both units are already dead. They are ok to see what's going on but I wouldn't want to rely on them to identify anyone or anything should something go wrong. They are what they are - a cheap wireless camera system.
 I have my camera mounted so that I can view those approaching the front door. As I said, the camera does capture the event. The problem is that from the time the event occurs, they are at the front door and ringing the door bell for a couple of seconds before I get notification on my cell phone. Any suggestions on improving the response time, any option settings etc.? Also if I attach the Echo Spot or Show to the camera does it make any difference to the response time between the event and the notification?
 I first purchased a single camera through the Amazon Home Security service.  After a few weeks I purchased a second and now 2 months later through Prime Day I ordered 2 more, for a total of 4.  These camera's are great and gave me peace of mind when I had contractors in my home, and caught one of them snooping.  I was easily able to share the clip with the owners and they took action.  I deducted 1 star because you are not able to view video online (like I can with my Ring Doorbell), but only through the app which uses a lot of data when I am at work and not able to connect to wifi.
 I have my real estate office in a detached building on our farm.  We are rural and I have a number of other valuables in this multi-function space.  The internet is slow here as we get our service via line-of-site dish, but it does an adequate job.  Infrared could be a little better, but the price justifies the system any day.  The peace-of-mind is priceless. I dread the thoughts of power outages if we are away.  Highly recommend this product and I AM a verified user.
 Alerts are not coming on the app unless a moving object is very close to the camera. No matter how I position the camera there are few alerts and also the same alerts show up every 30mins or 2 hours. Trying this camera indoor to test it out before placing outdoor. I have placed the cam at the entrance door, many people walk by and does not even recognize the motion. It alerts only when I go very close to the camera.<br/>I would not recommend this camera and there are far better cameras available.
 I was apprehensive about mounting this camera at an elevated location (but then, it's where you put surveillance cams) due to the flimsy looking mount. And indeed, after a few weeks, the thing popped off and fell. The camera somehow survived this and still functions, but that was blind luck. Other than that the cam is fine, but you might want to wait until they fix the crappy mount, or buy a third party case.<br/><br/>--update a few months later: after a cold and wet winter all cams still working fine. Motion detection and infrared work well.
 I just sent my ring stick up camera back after three weeks of dealing with customer service. The motion detection was terrible. It would start recording when people are halfway through the frame. I decided to give this one a shot after some decent reviews on CNET.com<br/> I am not disappointed. The motion to Texan works very well. It starts recording as soon as someone gets in the frame. The video is nice and crisp, better than ring.<br/> Set up was easy. I wish the push notifications had a distinct sound on my phone.
 They seem to work fine, but as a previous customer stated, there is a second or two delay in capturing the video, so you're getting the person, or animal as it's exiting.  I also bought the white accessory covers because my house is white and figured they'd blend in better, and they do.  I also thought the cover would help insulate it from the weather.  Overall, I'm satisfied with the product, but keep in mind it's more of a monitoring system.  You can see an intruder, but you'd have to be the one calling the police to report it.  If you weren't home when the intruder was there, the police might have difficulty entering your home as well as catching the thief in the act.
 My husband wanted this system and I kind of resisted. I figured it would be hard to set up - hard to connect to wifi - hard to connect with our phones. I couldn't have been more wrong! Unbelievably easy to set up. The video is amazing. Makes me wonder why banks and convenience stores don't use these. No blurry unidentifiable people on these cameras. The only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is the sunlight issue. At night, we set a fairly high sensitivity and don't get false alarms. But during the day if it is sunny, we have to reduce the sensitivity down so far that it sometimes misses things. And that is on cameras located both in the sun and in the shade. Other than that, it is great!
 I love that there is not a monthly fee. The system is of high quality and very easy to set up and install. I love that the cameras are wireless and equally love that the batteries of the camera(s) last up to two years! I love that I get notification on my phone when motion is detected via one or more of the cameras. There is a short lag time from when motion is detected and I receive an alert on my phone; it would be nice to have a shorter lag time, but it's not too bad currently. I wish BLINK would add a device which could be purchased separately to boost the WiFi signal to and from the cameras. The signal strength is good unless the camera is far away (on the other side of the house) from the WiFi source and the BLINK connection module, which is why I would like to be able to purchase a WiFi signal booster I could install closer to the more distant camera(s). I like that there is a temperature sensor in the camera and that you can have temperature alerts sent to your cell phone, but it currently does not allow an alert below 40 degrees F, especially for the outdoor XT camera.  It would be great to be able to not just hear through the camera(s) but also be able to speak to someone through the camera via your cell phone. Perhaps BLINK will add these desired features in the near future - these are my only reasons I did not give a FIVE STAR rating. I would give BLINK a 4.5 STAR RATING.
 I don't like the bug with time zones in the app. Every time I try to change the times in to the one that is correct for me, the application will crash. However, I have no complaints at all about the actual hardware. These cameras were so easy to install and connect to the sync module. Once I tuned the sensitivity settings, they have been great at detecting visitors and the occasional bug. I love that I do not have to constantly change the batteries or have power ran to each camera. I opted to up the recording time to 15 seconds.
 Well....I heard about Blink before they were on the market and preordered at a nice discount.  So...the performance has been flawless and exceeded expectations. The initial role out did not include setting times, so...I either turned it on or off...as needed and with plenty of forgetful times, thus, when the upgrade to setting on/off times came, I was most appreciative.  I have only had one minor problem,  my wife dropped one and it barely survived. Some surgery rescued it...but not to full effectiveness.  Now I am considering an additional camera or two...one to replace and another for outside. I highly recommend this system due to it's cost, simplicity and effectiveness. Just be careful handling...they are a bit tender as most electronics are!!!
 We have this set up above our garage so we can see anyone approaching our house, which sits about two car lengths back from the street. What sucks this device is it takes quite some time for the sensors to trigger an actual recording, then it records a blurb, then you get a notification, THEN you have to go review the video. So by the time it starts recording anything, the person has already walked up the driveway and is out of view by the house. When my husband comes home, I will get a notification of motion, go to review the video and it shows his van just sitting there. It takes that long to trigger and start recording, for him to pull into the driveway, gather up his belongings, get out of the van and walk into the house. If someone comes to my house, they are knocking at the door before I even get a notification that someone is there because it takes so long for it to trigger motion, start recording, then send you the notification, then having to check the video to see who is there. There is a live feed but it takes about 30 seconds to load up which is frustrating when I want to see something going on outside and have to wait that long to see who might be out there. Because theres no saved video feed besides the little blub, you only get about 19 seconds max and then there will be a huge gap before it gets triggered again and starts recording another section. I think there are a lot better devices that do more for the money. This thing is pretty much worthless.
 It is January in Chicago and my camera had been acting up and not working as well.  I went out to look at my Blink XT Camera and the plastic dome on the outside front was cracked all the way around.  I reached out to Blink support and they have been less than helpful.  I purchased the cameras in July 2018 and they are saying that I have to buy a new one and they will only discount 50% off.  There is a 1 year warranty on the cameras, and, I find it hard to believe that this camera should not be replaced.  In addition, the cameras only work well when they have a close proximity to the main hub.  Mediocre product, terrible warranty/customer service.
 So far, only had the two units one day, I very much like the cameras and the feeds I can access.  Set up was very easy, everything worked just as it was supposed to.  I ordered the two camera system on Prime day and it took 4 weeks to get to me but other than that very happy with my purchase.  I've tested the motion detection and it works great, live feed is very clear. I purposely located the cameras far from the hub to test connectivity and I'm getting great signal strength so happy there too!  I also had to drive to another town 20 miles away and had no issues with accessing the live feeds.  Once motion is detected I received alerts and video clips for review,  it even caught a pair of shorts drying on my deck which were swaying in the breeze slightly so motion detection is very good!  We'll have to see how the batteries work outside in the cold north so hopefully this will be a good experience over the coming months.  I will be looking to add to the number of cameras purchased!
 Why did you discontinue integration with SmartThings?  I would purchase these (I received one as a gift), and I would buy more if they still integrated with my existing SmartThings home automation and security systems at two locations.  I would probably give it at least a 4, as a standalone product.  but many of us already have SmartThings or other platforms installed.  I think there is an additional ready made market for this item if it would integrate with SmartThings.
 IP battery cameras still not ready for legit security systems.  Getting pretty close, maybe 3-4 more years of advancement.  Needs software to either narrow field of vision or exclude areas for motion activation.  Can't adjust to eliminate cars in front from setting off motion because field of vision is so large.  Somehow my car from the side shot is not setting off motion as I pull in and out of driveway yet card driving by on the very corner edge of vision are setting it off every 10 minutes.
 When I ask Alexa to show my the front door camera she replies “sorry, that doesn’t work on this device.” The battery life is also not nearly as long as they advertise, my batteries went dead in less than 6 months of use. The sensitivity of the motion sensor is off also. Many times the camera will record When nothing is moving, but won’t record when people walk up the sidewalk and onto the front porch. If I had the chace to purchase again, I would look for another camera.
 So I bought (3) 1 Camera systems. It was cheaper than a 3 camera system at the time. All reviews are on the highest quality setting.<br/>The day time camera quality is excellent in overcast situations where there is no contrast in lighting. In sunlight the images are too high in contrast. What’s are too bright and shadows too dark. Night images are much worse. Lights or light objects are completely blown out and shadows are near black.<br/>The IR light in the camera at night has a sweet spot at around 7-12 feet. Anything closer is a white blob anything further is to blurred and or grainy. I have spent 3 weeks changing settings, angles, different lighting...<br/>The key is even lighting. If you don’t have outside security lighting, the images are a blur with any normal movement (walking). Any shadows caused by security lighting end up black, you can’t see any subjects in the showdows. My solution is adding 3 more light sources to the 2 light sources I already have. You have to FLOOD the area with light to get a usable/identifiable image at night.<br/>The camera works best at my front door with my porch light off. The camera and internal IR light is at the correct distance.<br/>The audio is amazing! I can hear conversation outside 35’ away!<br/>With 3 cameras on 1 hub, I regularly get 2 clips recorded even if the subject passed in front of all 3 cameras. I also have inconsistent clip times regardless of my clip length setting even with the &lt;END CLIP EARLY IF MOTION STOPS&gt; app switch turned to off position.<br/>I also get tons of false triggers from wind, daytime shadows, and apparently ghosts. I have tried every sensitivity setting and day vs night situations react differently.<br/>Conclusion: EASY initial set up. Very difficult to get it dialed in. Better used in evenly lit areas between 5’-15’. Everything beyond 20’ is not clear enough even on the highest quality setting. 4K is needed for video beyond 20’. It’s probably great indoors
 While testing them out and attempting to access them remotely, they were not reliable and failed several times.
 This camera is great for a location where you don't expect much movement. I had it at my front door, facing out, but it would detect every car that passed by and eventually gave me a "high usage" warning indicating that the camera's  battery life would be impacted (makes sense). It also sometimes starts recording late. I may need to tweak the settings a bit on the mobile app to fix that. Speaking of the app, that's the only interface with the device that is provided (OK, technically there is a switch under the case to turn off the recording light). There is no native Web interface to view live video or watch clips.
 Interesting. I received a note from Blink asking for a review on Amazon but anything less than perfect takes you to their website and away from Amazon. Nice trick.<br/><br/>The set up is HORRIBLE if you are using a tablet. I can not comment about set up on a phone but it took me HOURS to get it to work on an Ipad. Even when Blink contacted me they gave me wrong information.<br/><br/>There is NO phone support at all.. Zero, you are on your own.<br/><br/>Once working the cameras are not bad but the battery life is short. I don't know what else is out there but I am not sure I would recommend this product without some adjustments to their customer service.
 I purchased these cameras due to the claim of 2 year battery life. Simply Not true...not even close. I change these batteries every month. And I do use the Energizer Lithium batteries. I only have these cameras on after 5 pm and I have them on a medium sensitivity. I want to see when a car pulls into the lot. It doesn't go off when a bird flies by. Videos run for about 20 seconds. Can I use rechargeable batteries?
 I have 5 of the xt cameras around the outside of my home. I had to adjust 2 of them so the wifi signal was strong and constant. Now I'm confident when leaving the house I will get notified when there is activity. Occasionally it picks up the cat or it lets me know when I get a delivery. Hopefully I won't be seeing any would be intruders. The pictures or videos are  crisp and the night video works better than expected. highly recommend this, just need to have good wifi coverage.
 Beware, this is NOT "completely wire-free" as it's advertised and labeled on the box. My purpose in purchasing this was to provide some monitoring of our RV while we are off-the-grid. Yes, the camera is wireless. Yet the sync module, necessary to run the system, is not. That module must be plugged in. My hope is that I can power the sync module via a portable power bank, typically used to recharge cell phones.
 Love the camera and easy to use app. The mounting brackets are absolutely horrible. Each of my 4 blink cameras has fallen off the brackets and some have multiple times. Every time they fall I have to get the ladder back out and snap the blink camera back onto the mounting bracket clip. I finally decided to purchase outdoor blink camera brackets from another vendor. I can’t believe I have to order secondary brackets. The brackets that come with these outdoor blink cameras need to be improved.
 I spent a great deal of time and energy troubleshooting these cameras.  Talked to tech support multiple times and learned way more about Port 443 and other router issues then I wanted to  but in spite of all my efforts, we could never succeed.  All my equipment (phone, internet speed, router) are up to date devices.  I have sucessfully connected 5 other smart devices to my wifi so I really think it is them, not me......<br/>So whatever the bug is, I'll never know.  It all sounded great and I wish I could have made it work.
 As both a Nest and now Blink customer I will say that I am impressed with the Blink XT outdoor camera.  When people ask me which is better (Nest or Blink) I have to say they are just different yet have the same end goal in mind.  Both are good at what they do, they just do so in different manners with different limitations.<br/><br/>The Blink has good quality of video.  The batteries however will not last 2 years depending on the settings you assign to the camera.  I have a friend who also has one and due to where he put it the batteries lasted 2 weeks.  When I am home during the day I "disarm" my Blink camera in the app to help save batteries.  The one thing I wish they would figure out is a "look back period" whereby when the camera notices movement the (maybe) 3-5 seconds of previous video would also be captured in the video clip.  There have been several times when I get a notification and the camera shows nothing.  I have done some testing and this can as simple as a person walking right past the camera.  When it turns on, they are gone or you capture just a tiny clip of their shirt as they walk out of camera view.  The camera is good though for cars or longer movement (say up a driveway etc.)  Another thing that would be nice for Blink is to have the ability to login to see your camera(s)/video clips and notifications online, NOT just through your mobile device.<br/><br/>The plus points to Blink are the video quality, the lack of monthly payments like Nest has, a lack of cords (especially for an outdoor camera) and also the set-up and outdoor mounting are really easy.  The build quality seems good.  When it gets cold here in Wisconsin I will be curious to see how it handles the weather and how the battery life suffers (if it does).<br/><br/>What would give this 5 stars?  You buy these types of cameras wanting to capture what is going on around your house.  Oftentimes things (people/cars) come and go quickly.  In my mind it is important that the security camera you buy catches them.  That is for sure one thing the Nest has on Blink, that is the "always on and always recording" feature.  In full disclosure I do pay $200+ a year for Nest feature(s) and gladly do so for the piece of mind it gives me.  It is still cheaper than a security system and the notifications (for Nest and Blink) are almost instantaneous.  The other thing to give this 5 stars?  The ability to view the camera online and notifications through a website.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great camera.  You do need good Wifi for it to work so realize that when you plan where you will place it.  At some point I likely will be buying another Blink XT camera to go along with the first one I bought and the Nest cameras I already have.
 This is a terrible product. Bought this thinking it's a great home security solution but I was wrong. This solution is useless. App is buggy. The sync module 802.11 chip shows 4 bars when it's right next the my router. Live video and snapshots(thumbnails) never worked after syncing with the module.<br/>Do not buy this product.<br/>I've fully read the configuration instructions and all online help videos available. Still can't get it to work. Go with Amcrest security solution. It's reliable, super fast response rate, has more features, worth every dime. Big plus in my books with Amcrest, store 24/7 live videos w/o subscription. So I have 5Tb of snapshots and live video saved on my external HD.
 this camera worked fine for less than 6 months, now, it is a piece of junk that hangs up and the shutter hangs up.  I came home 2 nights ago to frazzled dogs because the shutter noise was continuous and I did not know it.  Now, it works for the first couple hours after I arm it, but then it starts doing the same thing again.  My poor dogs...  I only got this camera to keep an eye on them while I am at work, but it stressed them out terribly with the malfunction of it.  I will be contacting the manufacturer to see about a replacement.  I had thought I would get a few more, but not now :(
 My home was just robbed and my 3 month old blink cameras with the 2 year batteries failed to operate as the batteries expired- you cannot rely upon the 2 year warranty on these batteries  I lost family heirlooms and personal possessions in the 6 figure range.  Great product bad batteries-
 Continues to need a hard reset at the slightest disruption of power... very disappointed and takes forever to get customer service... no phone or chat... email takes day or so.<br/><br/>Will go to Ring
 Within 24 hrs of having this camera, someone did try to break in to our house, but the camera never caught them coming up the stairs to the door. Instead it started the recording when they were walking away with their back facing the camera. Disappointed in this system. I do get a ton of false alerts from the wind though, but didn’t get an alert when someone was at my door until it was too late. I wish I put my money towards a better camera system.
 I called Blink support as I only had this camera for 2 weeks and the battery is completely dead.  This is common if you have a high traffic area. I was also told that it will only record from left to right not from straight up and back, so I cannot pick up someone walking beside my vehicle which is my main intent for this. Also very difficult to open due to being waterproof  sealed, the rubber nub can be broken off easily.  The camera picture quality is outstanding though.
 Great little weatherproof camera. I am in Phoenix, Arizona. I have a camera mounted to an outside wall which gets sun all day. The camera has held up to the sun and monsoon rain storms. I have not even had to clean the lens. If you have patience and set your motion detection settings just right along with camera physical placement you will get a great return on your investment.<br/><br/>I see a lot of commentors stating that they wish it was possible to record live to their home PC. I record all of my video to my home PC because I installed an Android Emulator. If you are computer literate this should be easy to do. If not there are websites and Youtube videos to do this function.
 Very easy to set up and user friendly interface.  There are three major  problems with the camera,: 1) the delay between when motion is happening to the turn on of the recording.  For example, i walked a head of my wife to our front door, it did not record me and just a step or so of my wife. So it's basically useless if you want it for a security camera.  The lag is awful. 2) the motion detection is very spotty and the camera does not have adequate adjustment.  I had the camera for 2 weeks and have tried every setting and tried multiple locations, it just not consistent. Many cameras have an area that you can set for motion detection, this does not which is a major drawback.  3) Time between recording is excessive.  It takes a few seconds for it to be record between events.  I've also sent questions to the Blink customer support team with no response.  Its too bad, it has a lot of promise but it's definitely not ready for prime time yet.
 I don't know why anyone would not write a five star review about this system unless their camera was damaged in some way. As a security professional of many years I can tell you this is the best camera system for the money.  A few months ago a few national technicians were installing some security hardware for me and they saw how this operated.  They were amazed and said their system cost very much more and the quality of this is much better.  For the money this is the best money can buy, in my humble opinion.  I have two installed in both my homes and they give me much comfort knowing who is coming and going while away (cleaners, etc.).
 Bought the bundle of 3 Blink XT Cameras as soon as they became available on Amazon. Was a little disappointed from the price point (expected similar price to the regular Blink camera's) but I can't complain, considering that Blink XT is still substantially cheaper than Arlo Pro (though less feature packed as well).<br/><br/>Overall I am happy with the cameras though there is still some area for improvement.<br/>Pros:<br/>- Very easy to set up<br/>- Motion detection works with little delay.<br/>- supports Amazon alexa and IFTTT.<br/>- Great daylight picture<br/>- Snapshot option and live view<br/>- Easy to set times for arm/disarm<br/>- Reliable connection during the week plus I have it (much less bandwidth demanding than Ring doorbell for example for the same picture quality)<br/>- Can choose between battery operation or microUSB power.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Live view takes too long to load (over 10 seconds at times).<br/>- Picture in night mode is sub par for a 1080P camera (my $60 960P Amcrest camera's perform much better night mode).<br/>- No ability to zoom in which renders the 1080P resolution pretty worthless.<br/>- Flimsy mount.<br/>- No way to set different schedule for different cameras.<br/>- I was really hoping for official smartthings support like Arlo and Ring (would be great to use as multi-sensor).
 I was torn between giving this system 3 stars or 4 stars.<br/>I really like the ease of setup and the way these cameras work.<br/>Also, being able to set them outside is a big plus.<br/>The picture is clear enough, and I knew the resolution going into this. However, higher resolution would be useful.<br/>I REALLY wish you could view the video through a web browser on a computer, or AT LEAST on a true iPad app.  Right now I use my iPhone and iPad to monitor, but using an iPhone app on an iPad is less than satisfactory. Im at a computer most of the day though so viewing through a browser (or computer app) is probably my biggest wish.<br/><br/>I've had the system for about two weeks now and the base unit went offline once. I needed to delete it and add it again. Hopefully this is not a chronic issue. If it happened again I will update this review, and contact customer service.
 I took a while to install this camera over my front door.  Couldn't have been easier. The set up of the wireless was simple as was the adjustment of sensitivity and night vision. Provides a field of view plenty wide enough for a small front porch. The included cloud storage has also been more than enough for my needs, which are only the usual mail/package delivery and the occasional visitor. Have not even used 5% of available yet, but I monitor and delete periodically.
 I purchased the Blink XT 3 camera system.  One camera had poor image quality out of the box.  I contacted tech support through email and received troubleshooting steps within 2 hours.  After completing the steps provided, it was decided that the company would replace the camera.  I had the replacement camera 2 days later.  The RMA included shipping - I only needed to drop the return package at a UPS drop box or store.<br/><br/>When I was considering purchasing the Blink XT system, I was hesitant due to negative reviews of their support process.  I was very pleased with the way they handled my support issue.  They responded quickly, provided reasonable steps for me to troubleshoot the issue myself, and quickly mailed a replacement camera.<br/><br/>The system was extremely easy to set up.  Once the camera is in place, all the configuration is done through their app - no need to physically touch the camera except to replace batteries or adjust the angle.<br/><br/>If you are placing a camera on vinyl siding, I found the following hangers work well (the screw included with the hanger fits the Blink bracket)<br/>No-Hole Hooks Vinyl Siding Hangers<br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00GMKKZM0/ref=pd_aw_fbt_201_img_2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=VJGZ6P786T41NPXWKS58
 I was hoping to use this as remote camera to capture cars and license plates, which is really required to identify break-ins after the event. Unfortunately we could never get it to work well enough even at 50’.<br/>I wish Blink would offer a more powerful camera and sync module to reliably handle 100’+ range. If they used 18650 LiION batteries in the camera, it would have MUCH more power to work with. The camera module and sync module size doesn’t matter as much as the range.<br/>It does work well however for short distances
 Love our Blink cameras.  My husband and I use them to check in with our two dogs when we are away from home.  The clarity is wonderful, very clear and the audio is awesome, you can hear our soft music playing in the background.  We are very happy with our purchase.  They were easy to set up and my husband and I are not very electronically inclined.  We thought we might need help but, once you download the app you just follow the instructions and it was easy.  We are so happy we purchased these cameras, it gives you peace of mind when you see your furbabies are doing well when you are not home.  Love the fact that they are wireless and you can move them around and no monthly fee.  Don't be afraid to purchase.  You will Love them!!!!!
 Like many things about this camera. Especially that I can just trip a picture when I want to check something in the store I work at. It's very useful when I need to check up on the occasional shoplifting customer. However, the color skews sometimes which could be a problem for identification in case of an actual crime. The motion detection doesn't seem to have a large enough range for our needs. The lightness and easy positioning (without a mount) is a plus. However, the mounts it came with are useless. Completely useless. One of the cameras fell off its mount not once but 7x in 10 mins. I ended up putting them up with command strips. If you're spending the money on these cameras please invest in a half decent mount.
 I recently bought one of this camera to monitor the front of the house because recently my car got hit an the person that did it run away. Anyways, so I bought the one camera and for the price it had a good picture quality and the wifi aspect helped a lot since you don't have to be making holes or running wires left and right. one thing though that I was a bit disappointed that in order to get the motion detection to work it had to be placed outside and I really didn't want to run the risk of having someone steal or break the camera. also, my believe was that the camera would be on live all the time or at least most of it , but it turnout that without the motion detection part it really didn't do what i need it for but overall the few time i activated the life feed it looked well and no issue notice. I did however return the product back for now.
 Complete junk
 I cannot believe they actually call this a "mount." For an outdoor camera, it is worse than nothing, as it loosely snaps in to the camera and a light nudge will kick it right out. Not to mention I had to search around on the web to figure out how the mount attached...it could be considered "intuitive," except the design is so poor I'd have never guessed that was ACTUALLY how it was SUPPOSED to attach to the camera.<br/><br/>I could certainly see the indoor models not even coming with a mount, but you just shouldn't market something as outdoor without a way to secure it, and this DOES NOT secure it.
 Picture quality is pretty good for the camera and video but the motion detection is not good. A car will pull up in my driveway and it doesn't detect motion then I get 100 alerts in a row because a tree limb across the street moved or a bug flew by. As a camera to just look at what's outside when you want to see it's great but not as an actual security camera to catch things happening when you aren't looking.
 I have four cameras.One interior and three exterior.  First off the batteries do not last a year. If you leave them on 24 hours a day like I do they only last about a mouth or two. We use them as live security around our house, this way my wife when home alone can see what is happening on the exterior, day &amp; night.  I do live in the woods with only five or six cars a day pass by. The picture quality is great. Sometimes the camera does not pickup motion till it is to late. Other than the battery life, I really do not have any other problems. One thing I would like Blink to do, is make it possible to view the cameras on my computer.
 The camera had great video quality.. But don't believe the batteries will last up to 2 years.  Bought mine on Amazon day and today the batteries died!! Less than 2 months!!!! Reason for my 2 stars.
 Clearly all your cameras need to be in range of your home Wifi - Understandable.  However they also need to be in direct range of the sync module.  This works fine if you live in a small house where you have no Wifi blackspots.  However in our medium sized house (&lt;3000SqF) where we need a couple of Wifi access points for good coverage I cannot get this system to work with one camera at the front door and the other covering the rear yard because although they are both comfortably in my home wifi cover there is nowhere reasonable to place the sync module so it can also connect to the 2 cameras (it works when in the middle of the hall on a chair!).<br/><br/>The need for independent airwaves connections to the cameras seems unnecessary - why not pass all the traffic across the home wifi?<br/><br/>Regarding Amazon blocking reviews - When I tried to put this review against my purchase I got the following message:<br/>"Sorry, we are unable to accept reviews for this product. This product has limitations on submitting reviews. There can be a number of reasons for this, including unusual reviewing activity"
 I've attempted to load "blink" 15 times now.  Only once did it load, acknowledge the cameras and try to take a picture.  But the pictures failed to load.  It's 8' from the router, good wifi signal, so no reason there.  Now it won't show the green light or flash the blue so I can attempt to load it for the 16th time.  It's junk and 8s being sent back.  There's got to be better systems out there.
 Do Not waste your money on this camera system as I did and purchased thru blinkforhome so, I cannot even return it as Blink Customer service says that this flaw is outside the refund policy which means you will be owning a totally useless system until they address the issue. Their PIR sensors are too sensitive and It ends up picking up shadows,sun lights pretty much everything and generates hundreds of false alerts during the day so you end up disabling the camera and having a dummy camera outside.This has been a common issue across many XT customers and If you want to know more about the flaw and other customers complains please look it up on the blinkforhome community as "blink-xt-too-sensitive"
 Pors  Super easy to set up  very easy to mount and install  App and entire system user friendly  very convenient no wires  gets the job done👍🏼 cons  there is a lag on the motion sensor of a few seconds  I really don’t like that  and  can’t  Record when you were looking at the live stream .  Pros out whyes the cons overall satisfied so far
 These cameras seemed ok for a couple of days, then randomly the IR stopped working, so at night you saw nothing but black.  Easy enough fix, take down the camera that you mounted, bring it close to the base station and remove the batteries and replace them.  That, however, is just the beginning.  Now, for whatever reason, the iPhone app on all 5 cameras say live view is not available.  When armed, I can trigger a camera (I see the indicator come on, so I am sure that it triggers), but no notification comes to my phone, no video is uploaded to the cloud.  Also when I tell my Echo Show to view one of the cameras (any one of them) I am lucky if it works even 10% of the time.  Alexa after a few minutes says hmmm the camera isn't responding.  I have checked all signals, all are great.  Simply put, the cameras are not working.  If a security device doesn't work, exactly what good is it doing you?  Luckily I got them on prime day so at least I did not pay full price.
 I have a total of five cameras. Never once have had a problem. Now my husband and I are having problems with the app. If you can finally load the video, it takes forever. This is frustrating. What's the purpose of having the camera if you can't view them on the app. Look at the reviews on the app. It's going down each and every day.
 I wanted 24/7 live monitoring, there is no known way to do that .... Yet. I had trouble setting up to my iPad, then found the simple solution. There are many things, little things, they could have done better to help set up and installation, but all in all, so far, they have been working great. For the money, this is a good deal. Not perfect, but if they continue to develope, it could be someday.
 Quite low cost and the promise of 2 yr. battery life is very compelling. I won't use the night illumination feature to save batteries. The most annoying thing is the camera image is only about 1/3 of my phone screen and won't rotate or expand while ads show a full screen cellphone image. I see no way on my Galaxy S9 to increase camera picture size. Is full screen only possible on an iPhone?
 I got this extra cameras as I have a 3 set and they work perfectly . Battery life it excellent so far. 8 mos. and shows battery power still good. I may have jinxed myself. we'll see. I just may put this looking out my back yard or use as a replacement if one of my 3 fails. Love these cameras, I have the Arlos and the batteries are expensive and do not last, Video quality it a bit better, but not worth the difference in battery life.
 Works like a charm.  And I hear alarm/siren coming out by end of year as well as a 4G independent sync module to boot.  Just when I thought it couldn't be better.  I love this product and have it set up indoors and out.  The only issue I had(and this is no fault of blink) is the intensity of sound and vibration on the push notifications. I didn't want to always have to be aware of the notification sound or feel phone vibrate. I solved this by purchasing an inexpensive smart watch that I could adjust the vibration intensity and always feel a notification(found Martian smart watch which I purchased and now I can even be sleeping and get woken, if I were to wear it to sleep)-I get only a few a day due to only having the perimeter of house active otherwise all cameras are on.  And battery life---is fantastic--looked for a long time and finally decided on this system.  Oh and no monthly charge!!!!  What is there not to love?
 I ordered a 5 camera kit and liked them so much, I ordered 3 more.  They all work great.<br/>My only complaint is, I wish I could turn an individual camera off and on without effecting the other cameras.  Of my 8 cameras, some should have no traffic at all and others ( like the kitchen) have a lot of traffic.  One of my cameras in my workshop with all my tools.  I'm sometimes not in there for a week.  I would like to leave the motion detector on all the time.  What would really be great is to be able to Alexa to disable tool room cameras.
 Have been impressed with the camera system for the price. There are 5-10 second delays in motion to notification on my phone. Do love the fact that I do not have to pay a monthly subscription. If I were looking for a more responsive, high functioning camera I would look elsewhere. For my purposes of simply driveway viewing, it works good. Would buy again for only needing to monitor less worriesome areas but not for higher protection areas of my home.
 It’s a great system so far, have had it up and running for a few days and it seems to be working correctly. I do wish the brackets to install them were more rugged, someone could try to just steal one. I put mine high so they’d need a ladder to do so. They do sell some better brackets on amazon from 3rd parties which I may eventually do. I’m not experienceing false alerts, like others. I did make it a note to position my cameras in a way where false alerts were minimized. The install as far as unboxing and set up goes was fairly easy and took me all of maybe 15-20 minutes. Getting them up and positioned appropriately Was was took the longest for me. As far as battery life goes they are still fine after about 5 days. I will update on that  once a longer period has gone by if I feel like it’s not to par. 11/5/18
 To preface this review, I have both the Blink XT camera and a Ring doorbell (the original version.) In my opinion, the Blink camera is superior to the Ring camera for several reasons: first and foremost, the Blink camera has much faster response time to motion. Whereas Ring almost always misses the capture of passing cars and even people walking directly up a 20 ft path to my door, Blink kicks on immediately when it senses motion. You can even set how long you want each video clip to capture. Blink also comes with free storage, unlike Ring. I love Ring's feature of two way talk via the doorbell, but I believe Blink also has higher end models capable of this. My only gripe with Blink is the battery life. For constant use on a corner lot, there is no way these batteries will last 2 years. However, even if I have to replace the 2 batteries monthly (that hasn't happened, just arbitrarily throwing out a number,) it still beats expensive security systems by a long shot. Additionally, installation and set up is fast and easy, just make sure you have a good wifi connection. I have fiber and have had zero issues with set up or performance since. Highly recommend!

 We did not want to buy a security system where we had to pay by the month, but it would be good to be able to contract with a monitoring service for periods when we're away. Not an issue when we're in the US, but when we go out of the country we'll have to either rent a smartphone for that country, buy or rent a SIM or sign up for international service with our cell service provider in order to have internet access when we're outside away from WiFi. This service would mean signing up with a service for a limited time. A third party could provide the service. You would just need to provide them with the app and one or more phones.<br/>Little bit of review: they were easy to set up and worked first time we tried them out. No intruders so far, though...
 Very upset with the battery life of these cameras.  I have them set on the lowest settings and the batteries still died in 3 months... I emailed the seller and never received a response.  I tried purchasing regular AA batteries and they lasted a couple days.  I cannot afford to continue buying batteries at this rate just to use these.
 I took their dumb little survey to help improve their product, and they asked all the wrong questions! we're here some advice for you Amazon, allow the USB port on the sync module to be hooked to a hard drive for storage. that would help 1000%, also allow cameras to hook to the Wi-Fi through the sync module so you don't have to have a mesh wi-fi system in your home which cost over $250!!!!
 I have the XT camera. I can't find a way for it to be usable yet. The problem is the camera adjusting the exposure. When mounted at my front door, it sees the door, in the shade, and the driveway in the sun. The camera adjusts the exposure to deal with both and leaves the part of the photo by the front door massively underexposed and the driveway overexposed. No way to identify a person with that low of an exposure. I am about to remount the camera so it doesn't see the driveway, but I had wanted that in the shot.
 I have an outdoor Blink camera and am very disappointed.  First off, the battery life is TERRIBLE.  I have gone through 12 sets of batteries since July, so don't believe the two year battery life they advertise!  I've tried everything from moving the camera to a less busy place, changing the settings and sensitivity and nothing works.  Also, I am not impressed by the clarity when in night vision.  I have a cheap 20 dollar camera that gives me better images.  Overall, I am dissatisfied with this camera.
 These things are junk. I set them up as per instructions, they successfully updated firmware. I placed one on my front stoop another over the driveway. The base has a great signal to the wifi (that it is within 5 feet of). Everything in the app looks good. Strong signal on everything. Streaming works - feed looks good. Motion detection is at 9. Both are armed and connected. Little running guy icon isn't greyed out. But i'll be if these things wont alert. I went out and danced on the front stoop - I did a 3-point turn in a freaking car in my driveway = NO ALERTS. I have however gotten 3 random alerts - WHEN THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING GOING ON IN THE VIDEO.  Bought on Prime-day; maybe they are broken refurbs...  No, I'm not calling support because I have set up plenty of motion sensing camera systems in the past that worked without a hitch - and no I'm not going to restart my my network, my cameras, my everything... It should just work without jumping through all that mess.
 The camera should have at least a 180-degree viewing area.  The 140 degree is not enough to make full side to side coverage of my house.  It leaves a large area that can not be seen in the 40-degree shortage.  My Ring Door gives much better side to side coverage.  I do not feel it should be advertised as a security camera system since it does not give a complete view of the 180-degree area.  Very disappointed.
 I will give it 5 stars, but, I have one that no matter the switch position the blue light comes on. Another, stopped motion sensing and I had to reset the system. Overall, I find the response a bit slow, people can make it all the way to the door before my front door one triggers. Set was a snap and I like the app and they were inexpensive and the battery life is nice though. Oh and super bonus they tell me outside temp.
 I got these on prime day for a decent deal and was excited until I saw they are garbage.<br/>First off I pay Xfinity for the top of the line data and wifi package and have their alarm with cameras as well. I do live in a big home with wifi coverage all over the house no issues. When I when to add the XT outdoor cameras outside theu would shut off and not get signal. I put them right next to xfinity cameras running on same wifi to see and no signal. What good are outdoor cameras that cant go outdoors. I do live in a brick home. So I called support an indian accent answered named John (Sure). With no answers telling me it was probably my wifi (Top of the line with best router on the market). Offered no help at all on weak signal. I bought the 5 pack and its useless. Save your money and get something else. If you want something that offers technical support this isnt it!
 The cameras often do not pick up normal motion. They can good 8+ hours and not record. I did notice if it is to hot or to cold they do not work. I also have one that I change the batteries often. I did have one set of batteries that does last longer but still have to change them often. If I had the choice I likely would have got a different product knowing this now.
 Great cameras! The picture on these Cameras are awesome! Love the addition features- night vision, motion sensors, temperature gauge, recording with storage, sound and so much more! These will not disappoint you. Setup was fast and simple. Would recommend to anyone.
 We have had this unit setup outdoors at our mobile trailer located at a rural airfield. The unit has been very reliable and after tweaking the settings battery usage is as advertised. Few area where improvements could be made: 1. The mounting bracket is quite flimsy to the point we housed the unit in plastic electrical enclosure. 2. An option to have better external antennas should  be built in to allow for greater range between cameras and base station. 4. Stand alone DVR capability in the base station in the event internet connectivity goes down would be a huge improvement.
 I was hesitant getting these as I have the sky bell video doorbell which seems to have trouble recognizing motion. These cameras have really surprised me! Very easy to setup and the video quality is nice. I rarely get a false motion alert. I also needed to swap out one camera and customer service was very helpful and sent me a new camera quickly and free of charge. For the price, these can’t be beat.
 I have a 3 camera system with good wifi reception.  Problem is, every time I get an alert on my phone and try to view the video clip, I invariably have to wait a minnute for loading and then get the message "unable to play this clip at this time."  Happens constantly.  Blink obviously has kinks to work out with their servers possibly being overloaded.  What's the point of using this as a securuity system if you can't view the clips after getting an alert?
 We have had this system outside for over 6 mo. and decided to add another camera to watch the wild life that comes across our back yard at night. (raccoons, coyotes, possums, etc).  The camera in the front is in a tree and we have full view of the house and part of the neighbors.  Battery did not last 2 yrs only because when the wind blows leaves into the view it sets it off-not a deal for us.
 Sound is great. The sensitivity is very inconsistent, daytime picture quality is nice. Nighttime picture is useless, battery only lasted 2 months. Had to repeatedly reset the sync box because of lost signal, 10-15 times a month! Free Cloud storage is awesome. It's ok I guess but I wouldn't really recommend it.
 I now have 5 Blink XTs, the only complaint I have is the advertised battery life.  Mine only last 3-4 months, depending on the amount of motion.  Just think Blink shouldn't advertise a long battery life when normal use will drain the battery quickly.  That being said I am very happy with the image quality and performance of the Blink XT, the only reason for the 4 and not 5 was for the battery life.  If you are looking for a good wifi security camera that is easy to set up and use, I recommend the Blink XT.  The free cloud service is great.
 I have one indoor and one outdoor camera for over a year.  Both cameras work well, good resolution. They do not zoom in but I've never tried viewing them on my computer.  My only con is the outdoor camera.  The lens fogs up easily and when it's wet the picture is useless.  My solution was to build a plastic case to protect the camera and it works better although it still fogs up sometimes. The audio quality is also very good.  I'm very happy with my system.
 Setup was super easy--my indoor and outdoor cameras were working in minutes.  It helped that they came with batteries and mounting brackets.  I love that I get a notification on my phone whenever the cameras detect movement.  You can set your cameras up to record video of a length of your choosing, and you can adjust the sensitivity of individual cameras.  I also love that a light goes on on the cameras if they detect movement in a dark room.<br/><br/>The system and the Blink app are extremely easy to use and navigate, and because you are not tied down by cords or cables, you can mount the cameras anywhere.  This system is exactly what I was looking for and I am very happy with it.
 I have a 3 camera system with good wifi reception.

What's the point of using this as a securuity system if you can't view the clips after getting an alert?
 Blink states its can see 20 feet away i disagree. Camera  does not always get cars or people coming towards the door where the camera is even if its 6 feet away from the camera. Not sure i will continue to purchase more from blink. You can not set this up to other devices other then your phone. No beeping sound and can not use your voice like ring.
 Easy to follow instructions for set up.  The town I live in, the wifi sucks...but this Blink system works perfectly.  The night vision really works well.  I love how clear the video and live shots are.  Really remarkable.  My family enjoys it.  I love the extra benefit of this telling me if my teenagers are trying to sneed out!! :)  High recommend this to anyone.
 I had no problems with picture quality or reception in a 5,000 sq ft home. Very pleased. My mother also bought a set of four and within one week of set up we caught a woman trying to push her front door open and use the key code box to break in when she wasn’t home. I was able to show the video clip to the police and email it to them to add it to the report. It also alerted us that our dog had accidentally got out and was sitting at the front door. Love the peace of mind.
 One over driveway and one on tree pointed at the house. Both working great so far. I appreciate the ipad app is full screen.
 I would give this a 5 star if it wasn't for having a low amount of storage, especially when you have 4 cameras on the system.  We have a hard wired system at our home that provides much flexibility, but we had a few blind spots and this system works well.  My one big issue is it has to be connect to Wi-fi and doesn't run off of cellular.  Overall, the clarity is great, and it's so easy to install.
 I bought a 1 camera system to check it our for function to replace another camera system that has constant problems that don't seem to be resolved by the manufacturer. After a learning curve I am very pleased so far. If it continues to function well I will expand the Blink system and entirely replace the other system. All functions seem to work very well. Hoping for it to continue without problems. I am happy that I can talk to tech support with Blink, a service that does not happen with the other camera system.
 Great cameras! Very easy set-up and installation. We ordered 2 of the original and 2 of the XT cameras. Now we wish we had ordered 4 XT's since they include night vision. The original cameras have an awkward flash that goes off when the motion detector is triggered in the dark. This seems silly if you want to be discrete. The XT night vision is totally worth the extra $30.
 Motion detection is not good. Software is lacking. This is a promising idea but not ready for mainstream yet. Maybe the next iteration will be better quality after amazon puts some more time into it. Just a bad system and not really useful at all. The motion detection is the only way it will record and it only picks up humans within a few feet on the highest setting but non human objects from very far away. I tried messing around with settings for hours but just nothing really works for how I want it to. Unless you want to make a lot of compromises I would not buy this item.
 Purchased 3 XT cameras and the pictures are clear but my concerns are, it's not real time, when you get notification sometimes the video isn't available, access to viewing is often unavailable and there is only 1 way communications. I expected more from Blink. I've had my cameras up 1 monthand it's already telling me to change my battery. What happened to 2 years???
 I was skeptical about this working in severe weather but I tried it and I love it.  Even in below zero temps it was working and continues with great battery life. Love all the features.  Have had for about 6 months now.  I have two cameras that I put out at camp to monitor conditions and it is worth its weight in gold.  If we have severe weather I can just check the cameras to see if I need to go out and tend to fallen tree limbs, snow build but etc.  Not to mention the added benefit of security.  Gives me peace of mind.  Going to add at least one more out there.
 DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA !!!!  GO AWAY FROM ANY AD SAYING THE BATTERIES WILL LAST FOR 2 YEARS!!!  PRETTY BAD QUALITY!! Batteries are drained in less than a month using a pretty standard configuration... it will last for 2 years only if you keep the camera off all the time !!<br/>Customer service is horrible, and be prepared to wait an hour in the phone for a support... no refunds and no exchanges are in the Blink portfolio... So, to not suffer, I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO STAY FROM ANY BLINK CAMERA... It does not worth a penny !!
 Some reviewers have commented on ease of set-up. This has not been my experience. Using the same router set-up and password I've had for 2 years the Blink sync module and XT camera will not allow me to access the Blink servers. I've tried all the suggested trouble shooting advice Blink offers and still no connection. I'm very disappointed with Blink. Even the pop-up (781) help number that I was served after multiple failed attemps to connect doesn't work. Right now I'm casting a wary eye on the Blink product.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I've found Blink customer support to be responsive. Adding 1 star. I was finally able to connect after discovering that Blink is not compatible with 5G router. I was able to connect the Blink hardware to their servers using a slower router. Jury still out on this possible purchase, I'm keeping all my original packaging just in case.
 Bought the bundle of 3 Blink XT Cameras as soon as they became available on Amazon. Was a little disappointed from the price point (expected similar price to the regular Blink camera's) but I can't complain, considering that Blink XT is still substantially cheaper than Arlo Pro (though less feature packed as well).<br/><br/>Overall I am happy with the cameras though there is still some area for improvement.<br/>Pros:<br/>- Very easy to set up<br/>- Motion detection works with little delay.<br/>- supports Amazon alexa and IFTTT.<br/>- Great daylight picture<br/>- Snapshot option and live view<br/>- Easy to set times for arm/disarm<br/>- Reliable connection during the week plus I have it (much less bandwidth demanding than Ring doorbell for example for the same picture quality)<br/>- Can choose between battery operation or microUSB power.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Live view takes too long to load (over 10 seconds at times).<br/>- Picture in night mode is sub par for a 1080P camera (my $60 960P Amcrest camera's perform much better night mode).<br/>- No ability to zoom in which renders the 1080P resolution pretty worthless.<br/>- Flimsy mount.<br/>- No way to set different schedule for different cameras.<br/>- I was really hoping for official smartthings support like Arlo and Ring (would be great to use as multi-sensor).
 This product is great for what we need it for watching the kids and our driveway. The only thing I dislike is the motion control with it being up High it doesn’t pickup on some of it depending on how they drive into the driveways but what’s nice is it picks up most of what we needed these cameras for. We mainly got them for our backyard, driveway and inside and they work amazingly great. I was very hesitant to purchase the 4 cameras, which we also got 180 degree wall mounts for outside. The work great if anyone is on the fence I would get these for sure. Since we have our cameras up higher than most people we did that so they weren’t noticed and it’s doing it’s job for sure.
 I have had the 5 camera Blink XT for 2 weeks and I am extremely happy with the video quality in good lighting and it is decent with basically no light.  I had no problems with customer service trying to make special shipping arrangements.  The only 2 things keeping it from 5 stars is that the signal for the sync module is not as strong as a standard netgear wireless router so I had to centrally locate the sync module in my house rather than in the office where I wanted it.  Other complaint is that I haven’t been able to find a way to disable motion detection on a specific part of the viewing area.  Our front door camera picks up every car on the street 50 ft away unless I have it pointed almost straight down.
 I bought the Blink one camera system on Prime day and got a great deal.  It replaced another wifi camera that had stopped working.  The setup of this system was orders of magnitude easier than the previous camera and the fact that it's battery powered gives tremendous flexibility in mounting.  We've been able to observer many wild visitors to our vacation home with this camera.  It's a great buy even at the regular price.
 The system is really awesome once it's installed I had difficulty with set up though I tried following the instructions that came with it and did everything wirelessly but for some reason between my router my laptop and the blink system nothing was communicating properly.  The phone sync up wasn't working. My wife realize that there was a phone Jack USB port in each camera. She plugged in the phone to each camera with the cord that came with our phones. Once she did that they started working without any other input!  I just wish that the instructions would have been a little more clear in this area.
 This system works great for what I need. I have it set up in the backyard for the dogs. I have it set in three places so I can see where they're at all times.  I just needed something basic and without all the bells and whistles.  I am going to buy an extra camera and have it set up at the front door.  I just don't need a whole lot of extra.  Just need to see my dogs and who's at the door.  Overall this is what I needed and it's serving my purpose. My only concern is the bracket that holds the camera are somewhat not secure enough for me so I took some zip ties and I have made sure that a easy breeze will not blow them over.  Overall very happy with the cameras.
 Last July, I bought our Blink XT to monitor our backyard. Liked the idea of it being battery operated as there was no way for us to use a hardwired camera. The clarity is excellent and it was fairly easy to setup. Just a small problem in getting connected to our home network but got it when I moved indoors closer to the router. The biggest issue we have had is with a ton of false alerts. Apparently the camera cannot distinguish between a person and the motion of shadows caused by the movement of our shrubs and trees. This will I’m sure drain the battery. Wish they would correct this problem. Very annoying to keep getting these alerts and shorten the lifespan of the battery.
 So disappointed with the entire system. In theory its a great product but well, its not. You cannot control them individually without ordering a separate sync module for each camera. That is insanity. I want to love them but just cant. Some cameras I want on all the time and some only sometimes. Terrible execution. Ill be finding a better product.  Not individually controllable.. :(  FIX THIS BLINK!!!!
 I am speechless.  You can ONLY see the feed or recorded history through an app, on the Android, or an iPad/iPhone.<br/><br/>Go get an Arlo instead from Amazon instead.  Works on browsers as well as apps on the same devices.<br/><br/>Why?  Why why would they put such a limit???<br/><br/>So far every test I've done, has recorded my back as it takes it too long to start recording.
 These devices are absolute garbage. I have had the 5 camera system for just over a year and have had nothing but problems. Customer support is incompetent and totally useless. The range of the cameras from the base is extremely limited, the app regularly has difficulty accessing the camera feeds, and theses things eat through batteries (no matter how the settings are optimized for battery life). Stay away, total waste of money. Would give negative stars if I could.
 Only one of two cameras functioned. The camera to WiFi was weak for one camera so it could not video or take photos. Disappointing. Maybe the Ring system is better and I will try them Nxt time a deal comes up,
 Cameras are fast and easy to set up but work very well. The low light sensitivity is good. I can see into my totally unlit garage and cellar very clearly. Looking into a bright backlight makes it hard to see faces, though. Motion detection is very sensitive but being a PIR detector it will not work through glass. Audio monitoring works OK but is just one way. Blink's Customer Service Dept is top notch if you need assistance. All this and no fees for storing video in their servers.
 Warning! Since December 2017, Blink has discontinued Samsung Smartthings support.
 I have had 3 xt  cameras for less than a year and 2 of them need new batterries already.  But when they worked I was very happy with the system.
 I bought the two camera indoor system first and loved it… Then I bought an outside three camera system and super love it… Now I plan on buying a five  camera xt system because the XT has 1080p and better picture quality.  Bought a couple of two camera systems for my parents and in-laws for Christmas. I recommend!!
 The module for this system is trash and this system will only let you use one WiFi connection.  If you are living in anything larger than at 1400 square foot house it’s not going to work without a booster.
 Very easy to install.  One screw is all it takes.  Notifies me every time there is a motion.  I have 3 doors where packages are left and I never knew until now which door I needed to go to.  Now, it's no secret.  Even if I am away from home, I know when I get a package.  I take medicine that is very expensive and has to be refrigerated as soon as possible.  I am relieved that I don't have to stay at home and watch the door for my medicine.  I referred my friend to buy the system and she did.  She loves them too.  I highly recommend Blink XT
 It took two weeks to get the motion detector to really detect. It does not detect when walking straight towards it. I had to place it so that a person crosses the detector and it picks up a profile only. That’s certainly not what I expected but the camera video is crystal clear day and night. I’m 80% happy with it.<br/>Can’t comment on the battery life yet.
 These camera's are wonderful! They work great outside and the picture/video are very clear. It even captured a curious bat and we could see the detail of the bats face and wings.  I will order more. Also the web site is very user friendly. The only thing I wish could be improved is to zoom in to capture a license plate number. Other than that, its all good.
 Both of my cameras have an unbearable green tint after the update on 02.03.19. They worked great before but now I can't make out anything it records. I would not buy one until they sort this out, especially of you plan on using it for security like myself.
 You guys really need to come clean on the battery life you’re bragging about in your product description.  You get nowhere near 2 years of life, unless of course there is never anything going on for the camera to actually record!  What good is a camera if you can’t use it?  Totally false advertising.  “Ultra-affordable” is complete BS!  I’m replacing my batteries every 2 weeks on a camera that records nightly, which is completely normal in every day life.  I’m warning my friends &amp; family to steer clear of Blink.  The cost of batteries is outweighing any supposed benefit or convenience.  I’ve now spent more on batteries than the price of the camera, and I haven’t owned them for 2 years!  Totally disappointed.
 I purchased the 3 camera XT system and it was easy to mount and install. The locations for the cameras was easy but getting the sync mode in the right location took some time as my router is a long way away from the camera locations. But this was not difficult, only time consuming. Reading the comments, I also am getting some false triggers due to sensitivity, but am still working on adjustments.<br/>A link to my computer would also be a great feature.<br/>Picture quality is good and the sound is better than I expected.<br/>I would recommend this product and think it is a great value.
 have tried this. wasnt happy as there is no local storage or storing. you have to have a constant internet service. do yourself a favor and if you dont want your storage online get a good 4mp camera like hikvision or reolink
 We love the cameras but we seem to be having a heck of a time with one of the cameras connecting to the app. It'll always fail and then you have to try it again and then it'll work then. Gets frustrating but overall we do like the camera system. We were planning on getting the outside camera but I'm just a little worried that it will do the same thing since it'll be a bit farther away from my wifi router. Does provide a pretty good video so no complaints there.
 I bought one camera at another store then found them here and ordered more.  After putting up my 1st camera, I found a cat walks across my porch at night.  This finally solved the mystery why my dog barks at night for no reason!  Another benefit is knowing when family members enter and leave the house.  Now that Amazon owns the company, I'm looking forward to deeper integration with Alexa!
 I love it.  I only use one camera at my front door and I monitor when packages are left and when my kids come home.  It's great for that. I get notifications right to my phone which is great too.  I like the scheduling function too, it helps with the battery life.  I'll be buying this as a gift for people this Christmas.
 I really like these cameras. Ive had mine for over 6 months. Replaced batterys on one of them already but that was due to some yard work that was going on for two days. Several workers triggered it all day long for two days. And I had the video set long. I should have turned it off during that time. The others still have the original batterys. Placement of the cameras is key. I had to adjust two of them so that passing cars are not in view. Delivery people are detected and lets me know that theres a package at the door. We also have a Home Depot solar flood light at our garage eve. It really lights up the driveway with motion detection.
 Have 4 of them, installed since Christmas.  Overall, good cameras and nice video quality.  The one thing I don't like is the UI is only on a phone app, so making changes on a laptop or desktop i snot an option...kind of limiting (needlessly) in my opinion.  Would have 5 stars if it were not for that.
 I wanted some type of real camera system to monitor my river house where there has been no real threat of much crime but a lot of obnoxious trespassing neighbors. this system is great. I can monitor it from home ,85 miles away and intimidate the offending people completely. great item ,great price.
 The batteries do not last as advertised. Kind of a hassle to change batteries. Besides that, they’re great. Easy install.  Easy app. Never had any problems. I’d suggest the little housing deal that you can buy to put the camera in.  Gives more angles and keeps cameras safer from weather.
 Not supported by Amazon even though it says it’s made by Amazon and compatible with Alexa. It has more compatibility with my phone. Can’t be used in routines. Only sends motion/video alerts to your phone. Can’t have Alexa say “motion detected in side yard camera” or anything like that. 100% useless.
 Camera's look good and the video is clear.  The range of the sync module is disappointing and regularly drops the signal.  I also find that the sun causes false alarms with the motion sensor.
 If you want to use it to record what's going on outside your house, this is not the camera. I live in a very quite community, there are 8-10 events recorded every day and the batteries died after 6 weeks. Batteries are not rechargeable, you need to buy special batteries every time, a pain!!!!!
 One of the best purcheses I've ever made. Have whole exterior covered. Palm trees do false it sometimes but I am tweeking it still. Videos great, day and nite. Audio also. Love the new added upgrades too. I have recommennded it to friends alredy. Have had systems simce black friday 2018.
 Many times I wanted to turn on the live view and the app could not talk to the camera. I bought a single camera system and a two camera system during the frenzy sale promotion and I am glad that I keep only one after seeing so many connection issue during the first few days.
 UPDate,on 23 Nov 2018, one of the cameras stop working. I went through the troubleshooting steps, the camera work but stop working, as of now I’m trying to get a replacement but customer service won’t call back.<br/><br/> An inexpensive DIY security camera that's totally wireless, easy to setup, and with no extra fees. Works as described.
 I bought 3 Blink XT Cameras and had them up and running within about 30 minutes, including pairing all the devices, and mounting the cameras. I also spent time re-adjusting them so I was capturing the right areas outside my house.<br/><br/>On the plus side:<br/>Quite easy to set up - Pair the sync device with your wifi, then pair each camera and install wherever you want. Video quality is quite good. I like that you can take a snapshot from the vantage point of each camera so you know in advance what is "in" and "out" of the video capture area. I also like that you can name each camera whatever you want so that it matches the area it covers. It is wireless so there is no wiring to mess with. Cloud storage is free.<br/><br/>What I'm not thrilled with:<br/>It takes too long for the capture to start. My driveway is only about 15-20 feet long and someone will already be at my front door before it starts to record. You miss the person walking up the driveway which might be key to capturing a suspected thief. I'm going to see if increasing sensitivity level will help this.<br/><br/>I have a lot of missed captures. It seems to have difficulty connecting to my WiFi, even though I have WiFi extenders to push out a better signal.<br/><br/>There are times when I wish that the recording could be set to stay on as long as there is motion, or to start recording sooner if it continues to sense motion. If I were getting broken into, some of the clips aren't long enough to tell who the person is or show what they are doing.<br/><br/>I have turned on the feature "End clip early if motion stops" and it keeps recording for the full 30 seconds (or whatever I have it set for on recording time.) So that doesn't seem to work as I anticipated.
 I bought these (3 pack) over a year ago installed them quickly and easily.  Installed one at the front door and planned to replace it when the doorbell was available.  At that time they promised there would be a Doorbell in the near future.  Well, no such deal.  I've been waiting along with many others.  So if you want a system that includes cameras and a doorbell DO NOT BUY THIS.  If all you want is wireless cameras and a competetent system is OK.
 Great camera, but read the fine print folks. If you're planning on using this for continual surveillance, you're only getting and average of 40,000 seconds of recording. This adds up to just over 11 hours of actual recording. Don't be fooled by the 2 year battery life span. That is based on 5 second motion videos. For true surveillance camera get something that has a power feed and a backup battery in case of power failure.
 😎 I love the inside camera! I can take it with my anywhere and set it up even in my Hotel Room protecting myself from anyone who may come into my hotel room after I may leave out unexpectentaly.<br/>Love the ability to switch to another  blink account and check on my family while at home, observe the outside cameras and all activities. The ability to have overlapping 360 degree coverage! Priceless and a must have.<br/>I sleep good know I have the "God's Eye View" with Blink!!!
 I like how easy it is to set up but, I ended up buying a white skin an a better white camera holder so camera can blend in better with white trim of my house making it much less  obvious that it’s there. Would have liked to of had the option to buy a white camera for outdoors and the camera holder that comes with unit works but does not give you a lot of options
 I'm somewhat happy with this, I HATE that it's not Smart things compatible, however, IFTTT is able to arm when away based on my Abode status, i'm okay with that. Connects to wifi quickly and it records 60 seconds which comes a long way before amazon bought the company. I needed this to replace my one 24/7 wifi camera that was giving me heavy EMF radiation and it's really done the job well. I find it interesting that it's transmitting at 900mhz when it can't find the base station and then 2.4 ghz when wifi is connected. The Motion is above par, the motion stop could use a bit of work, I can walk by and if it's not fulfilling it's motion sensitivity it will stop recording.<br/><br/>I kinda wish that after 10 minutes of not finding a network, it would try every hour instead of running the battery dead. Also, arm based on location settings, not just based on Schedule settings. If I leave my wifi turned off and run my EMF monitor, it's transmitting nonstop, due to my third party mounts, it's a bit hard to pull the batteries out. I really don't want to have to open the app every time I want to arm, hince the thank you for IFTTT.<br/><br/>Also, Let me save live recordings, Come on all this is Camera 101. I should be able based on camera to be able to force an event, Such as.<br/><br/>Smart Things Door opens.... IFTTT: Blink, Record 60 seconds of video after disarm. For now however I just have it arm if the alarm is activated which takes 5 seconds to actually activate, .5 seconds to activate camera and record. By that time, if entry is made, the face of someone is missed.<br/><br/>What's the behavior if no internet? Wifi up?! Does it save it in it's flash and upload it when it finds internet again?  Does the camera itself save the recording?<br/><br/>Overall besides going wire, besides going expensive route with the white oval expensive wireless cameras I do like the light and the click when it's activated.
 So far I have caught 2 thieves and 1 flasher on this camera.<br/>One of the thieves was arrested and currently awaiting trial, the other is out on bail but I'm hoping that these package thieves get what they deserve!<br/>I feel safer being able to sleep at night and see what happened over night when I wake up in the morning, knowing that if someone broke in, I have them on camera and the video safely in the cloud.
 Bought six outdoor XT cameras. The picture is pretty good however there Two  year battery life is a total joke. More like six months, and these are placed at my home where there is not a lot of traffic. And as far as customer service goes, make sure you know if you expect to talk to somebody on the phone immediately you can forget about it. So overall in the cameras are not bad overpriced in my opinion for what you get
 So far not a fan at all.<br/><br/>Pros:  great video and audio quality.<br/><br/>Cons: single login, no permission based accesses. Single person viewing experience otherwise get busy alert with second login attempt.<br/><br/>For this amount and this product line I would’ve expected much more and better. Wish I hadn’t purchased for a gift and delayed opening as they are trash and I wish I could return.
 I love this camera!  I've become a Blink fan and now have 6 cameras which all just work!  The concept of short video clips which are viewable anywhere within a minute of activation is exactly what I need I have other cameras, but the Blinks are my go-to cameras for keeping tabs on what's going on around me.  I've had this mounted outside for several weeks now in a totally exposed area and it is working fine.  Furthermore, the IR night vision makes this camera a good one to catch deer coming to munch on my wife's flowers! The setup is easy and the mounting flexibility is excellent.
 I really like the blink. It was easy to set up and I like the sound  Quality . The only thing I wish it was better at, is picking up motion at further distance. It would be nice if it picked up motion about 20 feet out instead only about 10 feet out. I have my blink set up in the driveway. And my driveway is about 100 feet long. The motion sensor does pickup vehicles but they go by pretty quick.
 I’ve had the indoor/outdoor blink security system<br/>For about 5 months. I have one issue with the outdoor cameras..whenever temps go below 35 degrees the cameras will not operate. As I live in Shelter Island, NY this is a problem for me.<br/>Would not recommend
 Awesome product with great clarity. Being wireless this is absolutely great as I didn’t have to run power. Good motion detection once you get them programmed how you want them. Night vision works just fine and it is what it is. Range on the cameras is a non-issue and I have the furthest one 200 feet from the router and sync module. Setup was a breeze, and mounting simple depending on what mounts you use. I look forward to potentially expanding this system to replace my existing indoor cameras. This however is dependent on if they ever release the Blink doorbell. Off not then I will look into other options compatible with my other systems.
 It works well but I'd like to be able to share still photos.  I can share streaming video but not stills.  Stills are much more useful for my usage.  I monitor devices that are not "smart" and by being able to view displays I can tell if there is a problem that needs addressing and I'd like to be able to send a still photo to a service provider that maintenance is needed.  Additionally, the inability to view the device on a PC is a major drawback.  If that gets fixed I'd add 1 star and the same is true if the added ability to share a still shot.
 Headline says it all, its a basic well rounded outdoor camera, my only complaint is that they really should allow you to change the region of recording because sensitivity 4 is too low, wont even capture me going up to my door, sensitivity 5 captures all the cars zooming by and fills up the cloud in near two days.
 Excellent system. Using it for 6 months.<br/>NOW you select which area in image to monitor and disable some area. This is useful as my garden plants gives me false alarm.<br/>I now disable area on plants Blink system records only when it's suppose to.<br/>Bad is battery doesnot last long I m trying Energizer which is holding up and last longer.
 I also have ring floodlight camera. so compare to that when this arrives it looks cheap from box. but when i open it, its like small size but nice build quality. so it's compact. nice detection and good quality. definitely recommend this if you don't want oversize camera outside.
 I love them. The cameras are inexpensive,the installation and set up is easy, there is no fee for a monthly plan, and they are completely wireless. You get an alert on whatever devices the app is downloaded onto whenever there is motion detected. My wife and I have been on vacation and were easily able to check on our dogs back home, making sure the were being properly attended to. If there was a downside, it would be the camera mounts that come with the system, they are small and cumbersome to work with so I ordered the larger mounts, no big deal. They are going to be great Christmas gifts for the kids, I plan on ordering more for myself...
 I thought you were coming out with the doorbell type where you could talk to somone.<br/>So far I have not seen or heard anything about this new product.  Also, I would like<br/>to be able to manually make the unit to trigger,  such as photographing lightning.
 I've had this device for 3 months now, and even with technical support, I haven't been able to get it work correctly. It gives me false motion alerts over and over and over. I've adjusted the sensitivity on it and also the direction/tilt on it  with no results. I''ve been on the phone with technical support more than once asking them if I can return it. Instead of having me return it, they want me to keep pulling the battery out of it to re-set it. I've done that several times with no results. This device is frustrating, so it's back in it's box ready for the garbage. I've now purchased a "ring" device, and am very happy with it!!
 install was very easy, I was amazed at the quality of the night time photos are clear. we installed one by the front door and one in the driveway the motion censor works good and it is to change the settings. I feel the system has paid for its self it alerted us to someone attempting to break into our car.
 The picture is pretty good, however it doesn't seem to pick up motion in the evening or in the dark.  But during the day it seems to record motion about evert couple of minutes.  Most things that need recording happen after dark so if this is not going to do that then I'm going to need something else.  And yes the IR is on.
 I purchased this to monitor my aging parent. I recommend it for anyone who needs extra eyes on children or elderly etc. Works great! You can see what is going on in the dark and it easily records motion. I haven't figured out face detection yet??
 Product is ok. As advertised they say that the batteries last two years. After you set it up, you get notices that you have too much activity and your batteries will not last two years. So funny. I have my camera set at the lowest settings. Good price and on sale but $119 for and ad on. Who would want yo expand at that price? I bought one camera to set up and try. Defective. I had to send it back. Asked for a new one and received it. Imagine if I had bought 5? Not convinced this is the system I want.<br/>The idea is good but the whole program is not good from a constant management standpoint.
 I bought these to monitor our pets.  The motion detection works great.  The night viewing is clear and picks up with great sensitivity.  Have had it about 2 weeks and it is great so far
 Very happy with our blink &amp; are considering a 2nd. Runs on AA’s, that wasn’t clear when we purchased. Nice to know those can be easily replaced. Great picture, app works fine, camera sensitivity is good. Easy to set the schedule &amp; turn off if you come home during a scheduled time.
 The cameras have issues working at night.<br/><br/>From Blink:<br/>"Unfortunately there is no fix for this in near future. This issue is due to a very unique set of environmental circumstances and the way the camera manages power. If you wish to verify this, you could swap the location of this camera with another. The only steps I would be able to recommend would be trying the camera in a new location"
 Love my Blink cameras! Got them just in time for a vacation. After set-up, I've been able to check my house from 3000 miles away! 2 times it showed a neighbor cat walking on my deck, once at night! I got the XT version which can also tell the temperature which is very handy for me. So far, my only complaint is the mounts are not very sturdy. It would also be nice if the colored covers came in several wood bark patterns. Thanks.
 I waited some time before purchasing and read a lot of reviews.  This system truly lives up to its description.  I could not be happier.  Only complaint is that I didn’t buy enough cameras.  If I had know how simple it was to program and operate I would have bought several more.
 I have 3 outside my home and 3 up at a cabin. They are awesome, watch the live video see whats happening at the cabin ,it catchs video of people and critters walking around . I can watch my home when traveling, highly recommend!  Easy to install!!
 Been shopping Arlo but too expensive. These cameras are a good alternative. Work well with a few exceptions. At times will not connect immediately due to “system busy”. Motion detection fails to alert when approaching camera straight on. Best to reposition as to catch motion across field of view.
 Got these for around our house and we are quite pleased with them. More than one camera does not record at a time which would be helpful, but it's not a deal breaker. They serve their purpose and we like being able to watch the cameras while we are away.
 Got two xt cameras after Thanksgiving.  Cameras work great. Pictures / videos are clear.  However batteries that came with the camera only lasted for three weeks. Not 2 years as it claims. Very disappointed with it's battery life.
 Let me say I have been a fan of Blink since it was in the kick starter phase. I thought now was the time to try it out. Here is what I found out.<br/>Pros:<br/>Good picture during day time. Night time video comparable to most cameras in the same class.<br/>Easy to install....
 I was an original Kickstarter backer of Blink. I love it. I love that you can move the cameras around so easily. I love the new outdoor cameras and I’m going to order a 3rd one. The only thing missing is that should be an alarm that you can set, or not set, if you want to. I love getting notifications right on my Apple Watch whenever my front or rear cameras grab a video. Lawn guys, delivery guys, deer in the backyard. And the zero-light night operation is excellent
 Like the long battery life and easy installation, range needs to be better, slow latency when going to live view, don’t like not being able to see all cameras in real time, what if power goes out, yes camera is on battery but sync module and WiFi are not. Would be nice to have option of connecting external drive to sync device in case of issue with WiFi and inability to connect to blink server. Like having cloud backup but not to rely on full time, don’t like that I can’t record while in live view and what if I want to take a quick pic of what I’m seeing live? Nope
 Very pleased with the Blink camera. Works wonderfully for my needs. One disappointment, no sound notification when out of town, video was clear and crisp
 The camera is great when it comes to quality of video / picture. I have noticed over the past few weeks I won’t receive an alert until after the motion has stopped ie delivery person pulling out of driveway. A simple reset of the camera solves that issue. I wish it had two way speech.
 i purchased this for external coverage of my property, package delivery notification and overall security. Simple to set up and easy to use. Works as advertised. I like it. No problems so far. Only draw back is you can't set up a few fence with your phone. Not a deal breaker. Get some!
 The video quality is fantastic and it was super easy to set up. We have a smaller house, so we haven’t had any connectivity issues that I saw mentioned in the other reviews. Will be purchasing an indoor camera to complement the two outdoor cameras we originally purchased.
 I installed 3 XT cameras today and the entire process was simple.  So far, I am very satisfied with the system.  My only negative comment is the mounting brackets provided are not suitable for outside use in my opinion.  This caused me to delay installation until I purchased mounting brackets that are better suited to outside use.
 Really enjoy the simple set up of this cameras and the ability to have them easily linked to my phone. I have a sense of security whenever we are not home and the motion activation is on. The only downfall is the inability to record while you are watching the cameras live.
 I've only had the system a short while but so far I must say I really like it. It does exactly what I expected it to do. The video quality is very good and it can be programmed to record as much as I want/need.<br/>One of the features that sold me on the product was no contract/fees of any kind. All I had to do was pay for the camera's and go.<br/>I bought 2 of the Blink ET's for external use. One over the front and one for the back door. I was somewhat surprised however one night last week at 4:30 AM when I received a notification that there was activity from the back unit. It is over my deck on the second floor. When I viewed the video I found that a ground hog had waddled himself up the many steps to the door and set off the camera. That was about the last thing I would have expected to see.
 Only works half the time. Even with Wi-Fi extender and moving the sync box all over the house, one of the two units are always busy or the live view fails. Stick with ring or nest products. This is not worth the money.
 I love the fact that it's completely wireless. It's very easy to install. The picture is very clear in the day time and a little less at night but due to my light outside can make out who's at the door. Great cameras for the price.
 One of the device doesn’t work as great. Overall, it works good for the price paid. I didn’t want a subscription, don’t need to record all the time although I would have liked if this system had the option of automatically detecting if and when I’m not home to turn on.
 Look at the apps review in your Android PlayStore or IOS Apple Store. Terrible. Enough said.
 I absolutely LOVE these cameras. I use two inside my home and the third out front. I set an IFTTT trigger to arm the system when I leave my street and I receive notices every time any movement is detected. LOVE LOVE LOVE the blink system. Just need some more devices and possible siren. :)
 Pretty good cameras 🎥 and the system seems to be working OK. Have had issues with one camera so far but the customer service center is being really great at helping me solve these problems so A+ for customer service and B+ for the cameras in the system.! Thank you sincerely JTriplett
 Easy setup, but even with great wireless coverage, I still can have lag with video alerts.  Night time, recording is pretty bad, I actually didn't realize that my good friend was in one of my videos, because the clarity is that bad at night.
 Works as advertised.  Very good picture and sound.  There are two weak points that need to be addressed:  1.  The motion detector sensitivity is a problem.  It usually triggers LATE, but if the sensitivity it increased, it will trigger to passing road traffic.  2.  I'd love to have a DESKTOP APP so it can be monitored from my COMPUTER, rather than just my cell phone.  I'm using an iPhone and a MAC.
 Don't waste your money. Has to have perfect light, and be set ridiculously sensitive to even catch a person for half of their approach to my residence. Paused images are completely blurry. Totally useless except as a deterrent for teenagers.
 I was able to add the base unit with zero issues, I actually thought Wow this is super easy! Then time to add the camera. Several hours over a couple of days, I tried everything. Their support was friendly and responsive but unable to cross over the finish line so I had to return.
 There is a delay and it’s either too sensitive or doesn’t get it at all<br/>Pro is keeps videos free
 Great little cameras, installation is very easy and the apps are very easy and intuitive. My only problem is finding information on the range of the motion sensing, some published information on how the sensitivity setting relate to motion detection range would be helpful, or an explanation of the sensitivity settings.
 Terrible product.  I've been trying to set it up for about a week now.  The product keeps telling me that my network password is wrong and gives no other alternative problem.  I can't get a hold of support.  I would stay away.
 We purchased several Blink black outdoor cameras, we have a strong wifi signal where cameras are mounted, yet there is such a long delay in recording video that whatever motion caused the camera to activate is LONG gone by the time the recording starts.  Very disappointed that you can see cars have moved in driveway, yet it didn't record the movement or people exiting or entering vehicles.  You can see a picture of entryway with no package, then a recording showing package, yet no recording of anyone leaving the package.  I do not like the delay in the recording time.
 I really like these Blink XT outdoor cameras. My only complaint is the the battery life does NOT last 2 years, our back camera has been up for 2 months and the batteries are already dead and the camera is offline. Guess I'll be buying new batteries today...
 Bought two outside Blink cameras early December 2018, late January 2019 our camera alerted us that someone had entered our garage in the early morning hours. If not for the alert we might not have know someone was physically inside my car! These cameras are easy to setup and monitor. It takes a few adjustments to get the angle right but they are an asset without all the added extra fees.

All the cameras (3 out or 4) was great except the 4th one. We have this one on our gazebo  and at night, when we need it most, most of the time it gets condensation on the lens and it makes the image cloudy.
 I like being able to see clearly who is taking our papers or mail or who's dog is pooping in our front yard or roaming around our house.  Anyway, the notifications are pretty immediate and the tailoring to our needs is very nice.  It's basically just like having additional sets of eyes on your house when you're not there.  We really like it.
 I would have 100 of these if I could. Love love love them. Great video quality. Love being able to check on anything when I’m away from the house. Love being able to move them to different locations as needed! Must have!!!
 The Blink system is perfect for my needs. I did not want to run wires to camera's all around my house, or have camera's plugged in. With the wireless blink system I can place the camera's anywhere I need them without the worry of having a power outlet near by or running wires!!!<br/>The picture quality is great as well as he IR feature for night time pictures.
 Have had now in operation since Christmas day. Very nice system and was literally set up and running in 10 minutes. Others have stated very sensitive outdoor units and im experimenting the same issue but not a deal breaker by no means. I live out in the country off the main road and its nice to have peace of mind when away. Also work nights as well at times and i can check in at any time when needed. Minute or so lag time in notification by phone but again not that big a deal. I have 2 camera's but will buy more this spring. Outdoor units have great ir night vision.
 I've had the cameras for about 3 months and have been so impressed.  They were very easy to setup and the directions were very clear. I have been very pleased with the quality of the videos.  The only thing that could use some work are the settings.  When motion is detected the only option for retriggering the camera to record is 10 secs, which means you might miss something that you wanted recorded.
 I have 3 cameras and enjoy them as they work as advertised. I did have a battery issue with one camera where it drained and killed the batteries within 24 hours. I contacted customer support via email and received information on a possible fix. The fix didn’t work so I responded back letting the Technician know and they sent me a new camera within 2 days. Everything is up and working well and I’m a happy camper!
 My Blink XT system is for a vacation house 560 miles from my main residence. The Sync Module goes offline too many times. The problem is always with the WiFi Wireless Channel. I’ve changed the channel a number of times and reset the module. Works for several weeks and disconnects again. Nothing I can do about it until my next trip.  I also have a outdoor Nest camera which I am able to plug in to an electrical outlet. It never loses WiFi connection. I love the 100% wireless, but not the problems.
 I love my new Blink XT camera system. Video quality is pretty good, audio is super good and I love how its wireless and simple to set up. Only downfall is that you can hear people outside but you cant talk back, and also its delay in notifications. You wont know someone is being picked up by the camera until about 30 seconds after they have already left the camera view. And the night vision could use a lot of work for when objects are close, it blurs out the face.
 Cameras claim they integrate with Echo, Amazon Fire TV and other devices, but they dont. It's been months and months since Amazon acquired these cameras and there is still no way to display camera feeds on any device but your smartphone.
 This camera was very easy to put up.  I have a little trouble with light and dark pictures.  Faces are not real clear.  I will try to adjust for this.  The one problem and I hope your next version does this, you can not change the view from your phone.  It needs a rotation feature.  It is a great little camera and will probably buy more.
 System is expensive no matter what set you buy or even a single camera. Also I wouldn't really call it secure because if a criminal wants to take your system out all they have to do is cut power to the house. That's not the only way either turning WiFi off will work to. I'll admit though that it's interesting how they have the option of batter or power by micro USB to a wall charger.
 I’m very disappointed with this system. I really wanted it to work but it just wouldn’t pick up motion when it was only 40 feet away. Only 1 out of 5 of my cameras would work and it would have a mind of its own, cut off to soon or record 30 seconds longer then there was motion. Just not reliable.
 I have had this product for one month. The set-up of the camera was easy and the app is easy to use. We used the camera while we were on a short vacation and it worked great using the hotel WiFi. Great product.
 Seriously so dissatisfied with this camera! The wind blows and the motion detector goes off even on the highest sensitivity setting ! You cannot make out faces unless they seriously right on top of the camera.I had a bike stolen out of my yard last night right in front of the damn camera and it never triggered
 Does NOT work with FireTV or Fire Tablets!!!<br/><br/>Video quality is excellent. Wireless, easy setup, long battery life.
 No cords needed, I run mine on batteries. If only it didn't make a click sound when it comes on, I don't think I would even notice it recording. I have tried lots of different cameras and so far this is the best one I found. In fact I plan to get another one.
 We had these up and running in a few minutes. Install was easy. They work perfectly.<br/>My only complaint is that they need to add "groups" or "zones" to the app. It would be nice to be able to arm an outdoor or indoor only zone.
 This system is great!  Just understand the limitations of "wireless".  It's on a network - there will be delays.  Being on battery, you can't monitor continuously.  But, it is easy to set up and install, and is a 90% solution to my security needs.
 Love these cameras! Works great day and night vision!
 At first these cameras worked fine. Then we started having connection problems. We bought a WiFi extender to see if that would help, but to no avail. We contacted the company and received a new hub since apparently that was the problem. Camera worked for a week or two and now will not connect again. I also don't like how you only have 30 second viewing windows at a time. Unreliable and not useful at all at this point.
 Love the product but the battery lasted 2 months. I don't understand  why in the description it states 2 year battery life.
 Put captions with images and radio buttons.<br/>Software is very poor.<br/>The connection stand is a pain to tighten with a screw driver.  Will not work with the Echo Spot and the directions to set up are worthless.
 Spent an hour trying to get these things to tie into my WiFi. Not easy to set up, maybe they are having server issues.<br/>Update, 7-23-18 this is not the easiest system to set up. I had one camera fog up and made it useless. Tech support ran a “patch” update that did nothing. You need to play around with settings because things have triggered it and it didn’t catch it due to delay in activation settings. I ordered different mounts because the standard ones are useless. They don’t hold positions. It’s a great concept but it needs work before prime time. The covers for outdoor units are crazy expensive. I decided to keep it because I fought with this for four days and I wasn’t going to let a little plastic beat me. We did find what ate 40 pounds of bird food. The fattest possum you ever saw.<br/><br/>Got a lot better. I know say this is the way to go. Also they have zine blocking to cut back on false trips.
 They were easy to install but I was skeptical as to how well they would work. Now I wish that I had purchased additional cameras at they time I purchased the original set since the cost was a lot less than they are now.
 Camera itself is great, easy to mount. First set of batteries lasted 6 days. Bought a 12 pack thinking maybe the included batteries were old. 8 days later the brand new lithium batteries are dead. Great camera, just not worth it to replace batteries weekly. I'll replace this camera with another when I find it.
 The one feature I believe is missing (and should be provided through a firmware update) is the ability to have local storage.  Attaching a USB storage device to the USB port would enable long term storage and make the Blink system that much more compelling.  Thanks.
 Blink is so easy to use because it's wireless.  However, my batteries did not last 2 years as advertised but more like 1 week.  Yes, I always have it on but 1 week is too short for the battery life.  Hopefully, the new batteries I purchased will last longer or these cameras might end up costing more than a home security with a monthly monitor fee.
 I got this as a gift. Got the longest time I was looking for some type of video security to manage my package deliveries. The reviews with everything I looked at were always up and down. Then i got this. I had seen this before but was unsure how good it was. As of right now, i love it! Very easy to set up and install. Video and sound quality arde great. The motion sensor picks up any activity at my front door and notifies me. I can get a live view whenever I want. I love it. It's exactly what I was looking for!
 They product as a whole is great, you can set the sensitivity and even your trigger areas if you have traffic or trees that activate it after install. The only thing that brings me to give it a 4 star rating would be the claim at 2 year battery life. After install in late July my batteries have just died approximately 5 months later. They do give you warning that they are low, so you won't have a lapse in feed, but I believe the description of 2 years is not based on the multitude of variables that occur in an uncontrolled environment.
 Love how easy this is to setup. It’s almost too hard to believe that this could operate on just batteries and be so effective. If I had one request, it would be to make the locking switch in the back slightly larger to make it easier to take off.
 I bought a 2 pack from Amazon which work like a charm. I then purchase a 4 pack elsewhere due to price. Great cameras, however mounts are horrible. One fell off by itself, falling 10 feet on to a deck while we were out.
 I love the ease of installation. It works great and the video quality is prefect even at night. I like being notified.
 Well packaged.  Simple to set up and install.  Great video and audio.  Amazing range, especially compared to other products (Xfinity Home Cameras)  No wires at all!  App is well laid out and easy to use.  Needs a couple of enhancements like ability to watch live view for more than 30 secs without pressing continue, but I’m sure they have this in there so that someone doesn’t burn their batteries out by not turning it off.  Still wish it were an option though.
 Set up is easy and I haven't been prone with issues like I did with my ARLO cameras. The only thing I hate was the mounts they came with. Super flimsy and don't really work well. I ended up buying a separate kit to mount them
 NOT WATERPROOF!!!!!  when sought customer support I was told it is not under warranty because of water damage..<br/><br/>Should not be represented or sold for outdoor use...
 I don’t like that there is a very bright blue and red light on the camera and it makes an audible click when it activates.  Definitely alerts you that it’s there.  Picture is really good, but if you don’t have excellent WiFi it severely limits your placement.
 Bought since it was amazon product and was supposed to work with alexa for viewing. Does not yet work with FireTV devices yet. Also provides temperature allerts, but currently limited to alerting for low temps above 40 degreees F and high below 90.
 Seems to work great. The motion sense alerts can get annoying quickly if it’s placed where it catches cars driving by.
 Very easy to set up! Amazing high quality video. These even work at night! The photo is my porch in the evening.
 Very simple to install. Very good video quality. Good price. If you set up a camera in a high traffic area the notifications will get annoying. But you can turn them on and off as necessary.
 Overall a positive feedback.<br/>Installation is very simple, same goes for user configuration.<br/>Video quality is excellent.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Major issue from my perspective is a lack of per single camera scheduling option. I would like to monitor all traffic round the clock on the back of my house. At the same time I only need to monitor motion on the front when my kids are arriving home (and reduce non important alerts).<br/><br/>Aside from that, external cameras show one or two bars on router and control unit reception while being only 6-15 feet away (house is wooden construction).
 These cameras record in segments that range from 10 sec to 60 sec, but mine sometimes recorded videos of only 1 second. Nevertheless Blink customer service tried to blame it on internet speed to which i replied that speedtest.net gave me a reading of 115 Mbps, and then he blamed it on the distance between the cameras and the router but I live in a apartment. The cameras make a shuttering noise when they start recording, one of mine started shuttering randomly as if it was taking pictures even when the motion detection was off.
 I am a security camera system designer. I live in a historic home so I didn't want to pull cable or drill threw the walls. The only things that I would change is give it the ability to record live view and make the sensitivity stabilize quicker.
 Camera was setup outside and it worked well for a few months, then suddenly it quit. Checked the batteries, they were fine but replaced anyway. Reset the hub and the router multiple times, best I could get was a couple minutes of working connection before the camera failed again.<br/><br/>Careful with this model, seems flaky at best.
 Batteries do not last for 2 years.  More like 2 months.  Even after getting a replacement mailed and using their expensive batteries.  I recommend running usb power to them just so it's "done and forgotten about".  Other than that I do recommend these for simple setup and easy use.
 only dislike, a somewhat flimsy mount. Im using it now, but ordered what I hope are more sturdy mounts for outside in the wind. but it alerts my phone on any activity which is awesome!
 The motion recognition doesn’t work properly, really delayed. Sometimes would record branch movement but not car driving. Also, the claim that battery life would be 2 years... well not even two months... disappointment really
 Batteries that came with the camera died within a month of having it set up on the front of our house. It went through the next set of batteries in a little over a week. I’m not sure how anyone’s house is protected when my camera seems to be consistently dying. Would not recommend.<br/><br/>March 2019: Threw it in the garbage and bought a Nest camera instead.
 would give it five stars if the app was a little less clunky...but so far I'm happy with the purchase.  Fairly easy to install and just forget about.  Took a little tweaking to make it not too sensitive.
 Great little camera, easy install. I really appreciate the ability to easily relocate the camera due to the fact that it is wireless and battery powered. It would be nice to have the ability to easily use it as a webcam.
 This technology sounds great, but doesn’t work well. Video clips are delayed if they even play. The design is not discrete. It’s nice If you just want to check in on your pets while you’re out of town, but not for home security.
 Feels like a piece of cheap plastic. The mounting bracket is poorly designed junk that comes off the camera very easily. The picture quality is just ok and certainly not worth the cheaply made camera and bracket. Arlo pro is a much better made product and well worth the extra money in comparison to this crap.
 I bought these cameras for the men in my life. It does the job. They like it and the picture is crisp, setup easy and makes me feel that much safer. I will definitely add on to the set I have.
 I bought this about a year ago direct from blink. I like the video output it does, easy installation, no monthly fee for video storage but the bad out weigh the good. The sensitivity for the motion doesn't work well I have my camera facing my driveway 20 plus feet from the road and no matter what I have it set at it will pick up a car driving by. The battery life doesn't last 2 yrs unless you have it on the bare minimum I guess. You can not use rechargeable batteries either that's not recommended so keep that in mind when installing it somewhere hard to get to.
 Home security. HIGHLY recommend this product!<br/>Biggest downside is it's too easy to steal! Since its wireless, if you place outside, it has to be installed really high. Too easy to grab and go.
 Very awesome system and can place nearly where you want. The supplied brackets are ok but make placement a bit difficult. The system also freezes freaquently on the app but I know they are still dealing with growing pains.
 Got these primarily to keep an eye on the wildlife coming into the yard at night and it does a good job. Field of vision and clarity are better than expected. Will update on battery life. Record options are limited but free.
 It's great and easy. The initial set up at the start seems goofy, but once you do it once it's really easy to do. Keep in mind if you get a new router then you'll have to set it up again. Also if your internet is down then your cameras aren't storing in the cloud. That's the only bad thing I can say. These are very simple and easy. I tried mounting one inside a large glass shroud that I have outdoors.  Unfortunately the camera doesn't motion detect even something a foot in front of it. So be aware if your camera isn't detecting motion, it will need a clear view unobstructed by even glass. The app for these really is handy and needed for setting them up. On the app you can change the capture settings and alter the senativity of the motion detect. I would recomend these to most people that I know
 Easy set up, cameras work great, mobile app good, I like that once you get your settings right, motion activation sends you an alert. I will buy more cameras to add on to this system. I bought the XT outdoor set of 3 cameras and they work great. The only drawback is that you can not zoom in to see better details. Hopefully this will be another feature added in the near future. Great product, low price.
 I purchased them with great expectation, but I they are not capturing any motion by them self. I have to log in to the app to see what's going on.  Its not capturing any motion at all.
 Love my Blink cameras. Have had them since they1st came out. Had Arlo and it quit working got another Arlo and they quit too.
 Bought this on Amazon Prime day as it was one of the deals. I already have Ring. But since there was no annual fee I thought I'd try it out. By default it does shorter clips then a Ring. But you have the option to make longer clips, it will just make battery live shorter. So far so good, working as advertised.
 I would love to buy this, but with so many bad reviews, I think I will look elsewhere.
 The mount attachment is very weak and does not stay security attached to cameras. It needs to be improved if you plan to use outside. Still working with getting camera placed.
 Nice cameras- simple to configure and install. Video quality is very good for such a tiny lens. Motion detection is triggered via Infra red sensor so will not work thru glass. The mounting system is a bit flimsy, will see how it holds up over time. Have mine mounted in a tree overlooking our front porch.
 I wish batteries last longer  or rechargeable
 For the price this system cannot be beat.  I have used another one and read reviews of many others.  It is simple to set up, easy to move around, and the app works fine.
 Leaves a lot to be desired, not nearly as good as Arlo cameras.
 I got this camera and it worked for 1 day. Next day the camera module stopped working. I called tech support and they couldn't help solve the issue. I sent it back for a refund.
 We love it! No wiring required. Excelent picture. My only complaint is the adjusting for movement. 3 is too much and 4 is not enough. when it comes to this though, we’re going with 3 😁
 I’m very pleased with the picture quality and the ease of the installation as well as how easy they are to program to your phone. I purchased a 5 pack of cameras but wish I had bought a couple more. I probably will in the near future.
 Generally a good system for the very modest price. You are at the mercy of a sophisticated burgler - all one has to do is cut the cable line before entering the house. That is why I plan to buy more cameras to monitor that area outside the house too! The only other problem I had was that the audio on the alarm did not work on my Moto phone at first. They have fixed that in an update.
 Great product. Very simple to set up, total set up time for all 5 cameras less than 30 minutes.<br/>Great video quality.<br/>Would like Blink to work on voice automation and a quicker recording trigger speed.<br/>Very small cameras and easy to conceal.
 I have had these for about 6 months now.  During the day they work fine but at night they just click and are non accessible.  Sort of pointless considering that's when most mischief happens.  I will not be purchasing any more and will be replacing all 3 with a wired system.
 This is a add on to our previously installed system. Easy install a bit sensitive will catch birds flying nearby. Installed 3 months ago so far so good, we’ll see after a cold Indiana winter.
 Easy to set up and install.  Love the live features, motion detection and no monthly fees.  The con is that the camera doesn’t detect motion from far enough away so that by the time I get an alert, the driveway vehicle or person is at the house.
 Feels cheap, the included stand is flimsy and can bareley support the weight of camera, camera cannot zoom or pan. Only good thing is it is completely wireless and relatively affordable.  Not worth the money unless you get it on sale. Hopefully Blink makes improvements..
 Very easy to set up. Plugged the main module device in and downloaded the app for free and within 5 minutes I was looking at a live video and deciding where to mount the cameras. I highly recommend the 360 swivel mounts that they sell separately. Not sure how they would mount without them actually. Night vision is pretty decent and the notification response is really fast. Can’t say how well the batteries will hold up, but are easy enough to change when they die eventually
 I really like using this system.  It is easy to install and monitor.  The video feeds and sound are very clear.  I have three cameras set up in my house and all have been working perfectly.  I mainly installed them to keep an eye on my dogs so I have set my phone to not receive notifications.  Otherwise, my phone was going off 20 - 30 times a day.  Now I just check in every so often and look back on the saved clips to see who chewed something during the day.  I would like to get the XT camera and set it up outside and receive notifications when someone is on the porch.  Unfortunately, there is no way to receive notifications from select cameras.  Hopefully that will be a future possibility.  That is the only reason I did not give 5 stars.  The other option is to purchase a separate sync module to use with outdoor cameras.  This might be my best option.
 The blink is an awesome camera, I still need to learn how to activate the alerts and video portion  of the camera but they were very easy to install.
 I love the product, however 1 camera did not connect right away, then would disconnect.. I switched cameras (outside) with one camera that was working perfectly.. it worked!<br/>Now the customer service for blink was blaming my intranet and  where I had the connecting device and my house!!! It was not my intranet (fios high speed), it was not my house (open floor plan) IT WAS THE CAMERA.. I am awaiting an entire new system<br/>I am confident it will work perfectly!
 Bought as an add on to my 8 camera system. No problems for going on 2 yrs. AND YES half of them still using the original batteries. The others are in high traffic areas. You can't go wrong with a BLINK System!
 The app could use some updating. Picture quality is not that great and the motion is terrible. Mounts that come with it are worthless also you will need to buy different ones.
 I love my Blink system!  The only reason I gave it four stars and not five is that they need more products i.e. doorbell and ability to sound an alarm or talk...  can’t wait for these items to come out and add to my system .  Did a lot of research this is by far the most bang for your buck easy to use virtually no issues camera system you can buy!!!
 I bought this mainly as a deterrent since the camera's will be seen by any prospective intruder and may prompt them to<br/>find another home.
 I purchased Blink for peace of mind to care for my mother.  I am trying to keep the balance of allow her privacy and independence with safety.  This system is wonderful for this purpose.  Easy setup and low cost for peace of mind. Will be purchasing more cameras to add to the existing system.
 This system Blink XT was so easy to install and the app works perfectly. I know when anyone is around my home, allowing me to verify deliveries, services or unwanted visitors. GREAT SYSTEM!!
 Bought two indoor cameras a few months ago and decided to try an outdoor. Love these cameras. Outdoor camera is great, still trying to perfect the sensitivity but I am really really happy so far!
 I have an old dog that can have seizures .  He doesn't have them often but I never know when he might have one.  Every day when I went to work I worried about him.  Thanks to my blink camera I can now monitor him all day long.  It gives me peace of mind to know how he is doing.  I would recommend these cameras to anyone who has pets.  They are great.
 I have used it for a while now.<br/>Like: Easy set up. Not like: Short delay getting notification after camera is triggered and that is critical too.
 Amazon is blocking my review even though I purchased this on prime day. Picks us bees and the grill cover moving. Lots of false alarms.
 Waste of time and money. Did not work consistantly.
 The Blink 3 camera home security system is easy to setup and use.  It works as advertised and provides a level of security our home previously did not have.
 Easy to set up! Works with my echo show flawlessly. Only complaint if any is that the wall brackets are not the greatest and it would be great streaming video world be great
 We love our Blink camera system. It works perfectly even in the extreme weather of Rochester! It gives us piece of mind whenever we aren’t home and love he easy notifications right to our phone.
 The Blink XT Cameras are great. They do everything they say they will. Great for indoor and outdoor use. Read more about how to place them at my website The Secure Dad.
 I've only had this camera for a few months. It's great whenever it works, however, it stops working way too often. I keep hearing loads clicks (switch) but the camera isn't doing anything. I have it setup to record for 20 seconds, but I'm lucky if it hits 2 seconds nowadays. That does me no good
 The good: It works<br/>The bad: The trigger distance is 8-10ft, so someone walking towards the camera is almost past it before it records.  Changing the sensitivity makes no difference.
 Was delivered very fast from Amazon and set up was fast and easy. Installing these cameras is very convenient because they are wireless. Love how you can change the sensitivity on these cameras. The sound and quality is amazing. I would highly recommend these. About to by another kit to add more cameras.
 I can now leave my house on a quick weekend trip and feel safe and secure that all is well while I'm gone. Thanks Blink and Amazon!
 Very easy to use and set up! We didn't want to drill into the siding so we went an alternate route and used the heavy duty double stick 3m outdoor tape. So far, so good. We love the camera and system! Was able to check on our house/packages while we were away.
 Nice little camera.  I’ve been using them at my front and back doors for about a year.  Replaced that batteries once so far, not a big deal.  I do wish the software had a snooze feature to temporarily disable the cameras.  It would save the battery during periods with a lot traffic (backyard parties etc.)  You can turn them off during these times, but you have to remember to turn them back on.  Some preset snooze times would be awesome.
 No zoom, no memory, no concrete screws, delay in live feed,
 The picture quality is great, but after a couple of weeks it stopped picking up motion. I upped the detection sensors very slightly and it started picking up EVERYTHING. But the batteries died within a month.
 If anyone gets this camera, its a awsome camera but just order the wall mount. The mount these cameras come with are complete junk and one lil bump and your camera is falling to the ground.
 Nice webcam with lots of features. A little tricky to set up with our router but then once we added the MAC address of both the sync module and the camera, it worked fine.<br/>Good customer support
 I bought this from their website directly (BlinkForHome.com).<br/><br/>I really wanted to get the doorbell as well when it comes out to have one system, one app. Having one camera system and a separate Ring is annoying.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>• No 5Ghz Support<br/>• No rechargeable batteries allowed.<br/>• No auto arm / disarm based on phone location.<br/>• No motion “zones” for high traffic areas like a driveway on a Main Street. Ex: only record when someone walks / drives into the driveway motion zone, but record the entire frame to see the street activity at that same time.<br/>• No two way audio.<br/>• No local SD recording option.<br/>• Slow to connect to cameras / wake them up.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>• Set up is easy.<br/>• All wireless design.
 I have it far enough away but for some reason it takes about three minutes to let you know someone is coming.  Unfortunately, they are already in my house by the time it rings!  I have tried all the sensitivity, etc. to no avail.  Not worth the money!
 Nothing that it says in description , battery life is only 10 days instead of 2 years
 Picture quality is disappointing, I can’t even read the license plate of a vehicle stationary in the driveway, however I do like the app options and movement notifications, at least I will know if I have an intruder, even if the picture quality isn’t enough to prosecute. The night vision is pretty good as well but still not quite a clear enough picture to decifer a face or license plate.
 Everything works as advertised. However, the signal strength from the base to the outdoor camera is yellow on the wifi signal strength at best. The wifi base is mounted inside on the window sill and the camera is mounted outside less than 10 feet away.
 I love these cameras. They are easy to set up, and the pictures are really good. The instructions are easy to follow, and set up was a breeze!<br/>I gave it 5 stars because of price, ease of use, and completely wireless.
 I am going to be quick and simple. I have a wired camera system and in dead spots I have Blink. It is GREAT. It is almost 90% as good as the wired cameras. It is quick and reliable.  I highly recommend it.although I gave it 5 stars there is one improvement I would like to see. The mount needs to be made from metal the plastic mount is lacking in strength and durability.  Overall a great product by the way I have 10 cameras!
 Good camera system. I purchased the one camera system to add on to my existing system since it was a cheaper route.
 Love these cameras! This is a picture I took from my Blink system in Utah remotely while in Texas.
 I have to cameras out side my house. One is about 50' foot from the Sync Module and the other about 45'. They are great and work very well.<br/> The only issue I see with the camera is the mounting bracket. No way to lock the camera down. Someone can just pop it out of the bracket and carry it off.
 Setup and installation are super easy.  Unboxed, setup, and installed a three camera system around the exterior of my home in a little over 30mins.  Love the HD video and the fact I can zoom in on it and see my children 200ft away from the camera!  I have the app installed on multiple different  android devices and it works great!  Love that I get alerts when my children come home from school... all this with no subscription fees!
 I received this as a Christmas gift. It was very easy to install and set up. Picture is pretty great, even at night. The only thing that keeps me from leaving a 5 star review is that there is a slight lag on notifications. It's not terrible but I unlock my door, get inside and then get the notification after I've closed the door.
 Haven't had it long but I'm very happy with video quality. Also very good at night. I bought one camera, but I'll be buying another for my front door. Video quality is allot better than my doorbell.

Works as advertised. Set up of four cameras was 40 minutes. Most time was spent positioning camera.
 Bought 2 camera system. Backdoor camera works fine, the front door camera is a disappointment. It either picks up every breeze that blows or nothing at all. Sensitivity is impossible to dial in correctly.
 Very easy to install. Video quality is very good. Nice to have the option of adding more to the system without a problem. The only thing I would really like to be able to do is to monitor on my desktop computer.
 I've had my 5 camera XT system for a few weeks now and couldn't be happier. Especially because I bought it on Prime Day for $300! Helluva deal!<br/>A little backstory: I had just duty a couple weeks ago (didn't get picked after 6 hours of waiting around), but spent the entire time scrlolling through wireless security system reviews. At the end of it I was down to 2. The ario and the blink.<br/>The ario is much more expensive, has the ability to yell at someone not welcome on your property, and a little wider camera view. For the massive price difference it didn't seem worth it.<br/>I was initially hesitant on the blink because of so many reviews compaining of customer service, late or faulty camera triggering, and generally not working as promised.<br/>First off, I can see literally no reason to have to contact customer service!! This thing is so ridiculously easy to set up. I mean both hardware and software. Yes it may seem a little buggy initially, but the sensitivity adjustments work! As well as triggering, clip length, etc.<br/>The video and sound are great. I have motion sensors lights close to all cameras so when activated at night the video looks as though it's daytime.<br/>I have cameras placed as far as 80’-100’ from both WiFi modem and hub with no problem.<br/>Another complaint in the reviews I was initially concerned about was the lag time between actual motion in front of the camera and notification. Mines less than 2 seconds. Perfectly acceptable as far as I’m concerned.<br/>So far as a battery life of 2 years... the batteries on my remotes don’t even last that long. I don’t expect these to either. Solution? Strategically place your camera where they’re relatively easy to get to. Problem solved.<br/>Essentially, I’m a fan! Yes I’d recommend to anyone looking for this type of system who’s not wanting to pay a lot. Oh, the free storage is nice too.
 I own two  XT cameras and I regret the purchase. They go through batteries very quickly and the sensitivity is odd. It rarely captures the moment you need.
 Do not buy!<br/>Accessible only via phone app = fail!<br/>App not compatible with older phones = fail!<br/>Cannot access by web browser = fail!<br/>Also,  not at all compatible with Chromebook/android apps = fail.
 I really like the cameras and the ease of adding them to a tablet or phone.  The picture is really clear both day and night.  The only thing  that I did not like is that the mounting bracket on the outside cameras is not very tight, I am waiting on the first high winds to see  if they will really stay.  The inside cameras are very tight and secure.
 They are excellent cameras and work consistently well. The price is very much worth it. 10 years ago this would cost $1000
 Easy to assemble. One way voice transmission, clear easily heard. Clear picture. Instant notification of movement near cameras. Love it. NO MONTHLY FEE!!
 Blink please help online troubleshooting did not help this is my last resort! Worked great for 9 months and stopped working...
 We live in a town home where there have been lots of vehicle break-ins. We purchased this to view our cars which are in a parking lot right outside of our home.  The motion sensors go off every time someone walks on the sidewalk or even if a car drives by (behind the parked cars). If I turn the sensitivity down, then it doesn't register someone at the vehicle. Generally this wouldn't bother me as I can turn the notifications off and just let the recordings delete themselves after a few days. Unfortunately for this system, the fact that everything triggers the sensor means the battery will not last nearly as long as they stated.  I can't return this because we already got rid of all the packaging, but I would not recommend this for anyone who lives in a townhouse or other busy neighborhood.
 I am extremely happy with my Blink in home camera. A friend suggested I get one and said how easy it is to link to my electronic devices. My friend is very happy with Blink so I ordered one too. I recommend Blink to anyone that would like an extra layer of assurance when protecting the people you love or your property. It is very easy to link to your devices. From the time you open the box to the time you link it to your electronic devices is approximately 15 - 20 minutes. The peace of mind Blink gives you is priceless! Don't wait, order today!!
 Everything about this camera is cheaply made junk. Mount that came with it is made for a toddler toy camera, not a professional 100+ camera.  my 25 dollars  cameras come with better quality material and mounts.<br/>Picture quality isn't that great either.  lens cover picks everything from moister,little rain drip,etc (make it useless).<br/>Also, every few days need to be reset since it keep dropping off the module. I can go on and on how bad this camera is.
 A good image and simple to setup. I did buy an accessory bracket to mount the camera outside. I hope the batteries  really last that long in a colder climate, remains to be seen.  Also, I wish the app worked on a Windows computer or on a Chromebook, so far only on phones.
 Bought it about a year ago and just last week stoped working... Module won't connect to Wi-Fi and the worst part is there is no one to talk to like tech support agents. Will never buy it again
 Pros: compact with a fairly wide range, bracket mounts easily and appears to be waterproof, excellent customer service.<br/>Cons: had to return the the wifi part since it would not communicate with the camera but it was replaced quickly with no questions, some lag time in seeing images on the phone. Overall for the price, it seems to be fine.
 Works great!  Easy setup using instructions and app. Video and audio quality are perfect. Not paying for storage or monthly fee is huge! We have bought add ons already.
 I bought 2 cameras and set them up in just a few minutes. SO easy. I just came back from a one-week trip and used them for the first time while I was gone. I checked them every day (although they alert you if there's motion) and it gave me such peace of mind to know that no one was in my house. Highly recommend.
 Bought 3 of the XT's - overall, satisfied with the quality for the price.<br/><br/>Would be great if Amazon offered a model that would mount through the peep hole in a front door.  It would require a new form factor, but that would be easy.
 I mounted the camera outside my front door and there is a delay of up to 5 minutes in receiving an alert when the camera is triggered.  The worst is that there is no sound alert even though I set it up in settings on my iPhone and iPad!!  There is a buzz when the system is armed and disarmed.  I only know I have an alert when I look at the phone screen and see the banner.  The banner goes away and I don’t see anything on the app icon to tell me I have unwatched clip.  My sister has android phone and her blink app has a specific notification option the iPhone app does not have.  I reached out to technical support and they were no help!
 There are no monthly fees and it works very well. I was skeptical, but it’s fantastic for anyone who wants to know what is going on in and around your home when you are not there.
 Really like the cameras! I do have issues with sensitivity with the outdoor cameras and dew in the morning obstructing the camera lens. Overall, very easy to install and great app to monitor and adjust settings while away from home!
 Image quality is excellent for the price point. Setup a breeze, installing them a piece of cake, although I believe I am going to purchase some aftermarket mounts.
 Great product and very sensitive to wind and animals. This does the job for us though.  Very easy to install. Notifications are great.
 Very happy with this purchase. I can see everything happening live including amazon deliveries. Everything is saved to cloud no subscription required.
 I bought these from another seller.  Really easy to set up and use of the app.  I never got a chance to install them because as I was deciding the placement I found out they do not record motion through a window.  They were returned the next day 😔<br/><br/>I gave it a 2 star only because of not being able to record through a window.  I am unable to install them on the outside of my building.
 Easy set up. Working great. Have it set up indoor for now. Didnt come with anything to mount outside even thou its intended for outdoor
 Started out ok. After a few months the outside cameras get all blurry and no longer give me the high def images at night. I have checked them and cleaned them several times. They are useless to me at night. Image freezes up on me way too often. Then I keep getting “ camera busy” notice after it freezes up.
 Bought this system and I'm very impressed as to the ease and the function this little package does. Really nice to arm system and be able to verify the residence. Fun to watch the dogs when we're gone to. Highly recommend this system.....
 I bought two camera set . One for the front door and other one for the back door .<br/>The camera installed at the back door shows - replace battery sign after every one week.<br/>Not sure if it’s a issue with the camera or it’s a false promise by the company .<br/>I would appreciate if someone from the company can reach to me and tell the solution .<br/>I would recommend Kuna over blink .
 Love the camera and quality. Set up was not too complicated. Do NOT like the mounting bracket and this is the easiest device ever to steal so I keep worrying about it...
 I purchased the external cameras, they arrived as expected and the setup was really simple. The video and audio quality are very good. Motion sensors work well and the blink app is clear and easy to use. I am concerned about the strength of the wall bracket, but it did survive a hurricane that pulled a window pain out of the side of the house, however I think a trespasser with a stick could knock it down easily.
 Pictures great sounds great motion, Motion detector not so great.<br/> The mounting hardware could be better .<br/> The technical support is awesome
 Two year battery? Try two month battery. So we decided to buy a cord for the camera that is often triggered by motion. Now the mount does not hold the camera straight because of the plug and our picture is in black and white.
 Got 2 of these for my house- front and back porch- so far so good we have played with them and tested them for two days straight and so far we are pleased!
 I really do like this system. Gives alerts when there is any activity. I already have an alarm system so this is a plus and no monthly charges.<br/>Camera shows a wide angle and sends texts to my phone when there is activity.
 USPS lost my package, contacted Blink and they resolved the problem fast.  Most expedient and courteous customer service, very responsive and very sincere.  The sync module and the 5 cameras were installed in about 30 minutes, really simple, the instructions are really easy to follow.  Video clips are clear both day and night.
 It is a good system, good clear picture day or night easy setup and the app is easy to navigate. Time will tell the durability of the cameras, but they are well built cameras.
 It works and image quality is sufficient but if you want to monitor outdoors then you have to mount it outdoors as it does not work through glass
 easy to setup and works well anywhere i place it in my home - I just wish it had two way communication, on demand recording &amp; Ethernet hook for the module
 Overall its a decent system. Easy to install, great video and audio. However the grid selection seems to be a little trippy and also id like to be able to have a save file folder in the app for videos youd like to save. The only way to save is, to your phones memory, not in the app unless you click it off of delete like your emails. Just a hassel instead of a 1 button click to save/flag in app
 Great picture quality and timely alerts. The only problem with this product is it needs more ways or adaptations for mounting. It’s not easy to mount if you don’t have surface to easily screw into and it’s not very sturdy mounting.
 Slight delay, but overall great camera for outdoor use that sends notifications to your phone immediately. Great battery life as well!
 I can't stop buying these cameras. They are so easy to install that I have almost all angles of the exterior of my home covered.
 Yikes! This was very disappointing.  Camera did not activate immediately so person was out of view by the time blink picked up motion.  Or not at all.....
 The features are very good and typically no false alarm for motion detection; however, the quality of video doesn't seem to be HD at all. It looks ordinary during day light and white lines through image at night.
 I purchased a nest outdoor camera for my vacation home last fall, although it works well it was a bit of a pain running a wire through the soffit to an outlet I had to install in the closet to power it. A friend told me about Blink as I wanted something for home while I was away. This thing is the Bomb, simple to setup, easy to follow, alerts are almost instant (where the Nest is delayed), and best of all NO WIRES !!!!!! Great Product, Great value.
 I’m using this product for security around my house it was very easy to get up and going instructions were easy to follow quality of the camera is really good very clear works well
 Easiest device I ever setup! The instructions are foolproof. The camera resolution is amazing even in low light conditions. The phone app is simple to use. I love this system for home monitoring and security. If you are interested in security cameras for your home this is the product for you.
 Clear picture and decent audio with low cost of ownership. Recommended to two friends and one business who all purchased.
 Great camera and picture quality. The motion sensor is amazingly good. Not sure why one of my camera's batteries only lasted 3 weeks amd NOT 2 years. I was only using it periodically and expected it to last at least 6 months to a year. Maybe it was bad batteries but the other cameras are holding their charges fine? Will replace the batteries in a few weeks when i get a chance and see if that fixes the issue.  If it does i will give it 5 stars.
 These are really good cameras and a great value for the money.  I actually caught two thieves on camera days after I bought them.  So glad I purchased them.
 This system complements the outside cameras I had installed. I wish I had purchased more than the two cameras.  Since they are so easy to install, I'll probably get at least one more.  The two I have cover the front entrance and stairs leading up to the bedrooms and the second one, covers the two entry doors and windows in the entertainment room, coming off of the driveway. I can see what my little dog is doing, plus<br/>you can hear any noises. Love it!
 Fácil de instalar, fácil de configurar, buena calidad, excelente imagen. Altamente recomendado
 Best system I've ever used. The ease of install and the app. Myself and even my parents were able to set it up with no problems.
 Very easy to install.  Takes just minutes.  There is no way to screw it up.  For me the decision to purchase was the no monthly fees.  I don't want to have to pay money to see what has taken place on my property.<br/><br/>I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to see around their properrty.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R2LO5KGMC9CNO7"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1yw5LYcihS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A15lZjdLZjS.png"/> The set up is really easy and the video is not bad for the price.  One camera only gets about two months of battery life, that's a lot less then the two years Blonk claims it will get.  I think the usage on the camera is normal.  I guess the two years is if you only get one video clip a month.  I wouldn't mind the short battery life at a cheaper price and if Blink was honest about it.  Also at this price I wish it would give you the notification when it first detects motion and will let you see a live view as it records a clip.  It would be a good camera at $60 not $130.
 No dislike . I love my blink security camera i have 5 xt for outside they were real easy to pair to your cell phone i would recomend them to anyone. The quailty of the picture is very good. I have friends that ar going to buy them.
 It was pretty easy to set up. I wanted it to monitor my front and back door. The sensitivity makes this device fail for outdoor use. I have read this is a universal problem. Hopefully they will get this corrected soon. I will not buy anymore until the issue is resolved.
 I bought this system on the advice of my ADT installer. No fees like ADT cameras, easy to install, truly clear pictures and I've had no issues.<br/>However, the camera mounts truly suck. They are cheap and a strong wind could easily knock the camera off the mount. Do yourself a favor and get the after market covers and mounts also on Amazon. You won't be happy unless you do
 Frustrating mount, what’s the use of a good camera by providing a mount which is of low quality that one has to take the ladder out every day to adjust its position since it can’t hold its position. Basically now one has to spend more to get a functional mount, which can swivel for any angles (Don’t expect 360 however it should at least provide capability to provide any front facing angle) as well mount which holds its position and not get tired by its camera!<br/>Camera  is ok, though it doesn’t record continuously. No memory card feature. No ability to stream on computer.
 Easy setup, easy mounting. Was skeptical of mounts but we just had a bad wind storm and no problems at all. App easy to use. Nice picture and video quality.
 I tried a cheaper system and wasn't happy with it so I returned and got these.  This system works great.  Great App with free cloud storage.  I have lots of traffic on my 5 camera system, but I can easily store 2 weeks of videos.  I started with a 3 camera system and added two more later on.  They are easy to set up.
 Very easy to install, set up and use. And super durable. Accidentally fell about 8 ft three different times. Hardly and scratch.
 Our router is on the bottom floor, we wanted 2 cameras on the 2nd floor. If you put the Sync Module on the bottom floor, the cameras on the 2nd floor can't connect. If you put the Sync Module on the 2nd floor, it can not connect to the router on the bottom floor. It won't work with a router repeater.
 Bought the two camera system use one inside, one outside. Works great, easy set up with the phone app
 Very easy to install and set up..  We rent so ideal for us.  Works like a charm and covers a surprisingly large area for its size.  Arming and disarming is a snap.  We have a couple small dogs so camera is off unless we are out of the house, otherwise with the dogs movement there is a constant stream of short videos.  Love the ease of placement and can easily add more cameras if you need to.
 The cameras give very good quality but you will need to adjust the intensity by standing in front of the cameras at night but once that is done you are finished. I have purchased two of the five camera systems. I would highly recommend.
 Constantly shuts enable button off.....will zoom if you stretch your fingers like for a picture......enable button constantly shuts itself off....
 When it's cold outside, 28 degrees here, the camera became useless. I have this and the Arlo outside and no issues with the Arlo.<br/><br/>Updated to 3 stars..if not cold outside the camera works as expected but wish image quality was better.
 I purchased five Blink XT to monitor the exterior of our home and these cameras do exactly what they are supposed to do. they have night vision, they detect movement and send me alerts as well as recordings. I can keep an eye on our home from anywhere at anytime. I highly recommend Blink XT
 Great cameras I have 3 outside my house, also have two ring cameras,<br/>Blink works surprisingly faster.
 I've worked in manufacturing for many decades.  The "mounting" brackets are a JOKE.  get lots of gorilla tape.  someone has their head up their ass releasing this "product"
 We really like our blink and have caught 1 would be thef on our camera. I would suggest getting a motion sensor to set up outside to go along with it if that’s feasible for you. That way if someone’s lurking around at night you will be alerted along with with the alert on your blink app.
 I just ordered the XT, for some reason there is always a ticking noise in the background. No matter where I place it, inside or out. Support was useless stating that it's a known issue but more of a "feature" than a bug. Also the motion detection is awful. Turn it up and i records every time the wind blows. Turn it down you'll see the mail man getting back into his truck. There is no middle ground that works well. Glad I only bought one. Do yourself a favor and skip on Blink products. You get what you pay for and this is just cheap junk that will cost you double in aggravation, especially if you have to deal with their awful Support.
 Like the small size, link to my phone, no monthly fee.<br/>I wish the camera piece held more snuggly to the bracket. It was easy to install.
 I just do not understand why they made the attachment of the camera so weak , anybody can knock it out, a 1 year old can snap the camera out of the attachment, it just doesn't make any sense at all, and when you call customer service they don't know what to say, that is the way it is period, that is what you get....
 I have had other security camera's in the past however these are by far the best. I love that you can expand your system as the need arrive. Also being completely wireless is nothing short of amazing.
 Really like this camera.
 Very handy. You should take the time to read the instructions and digest the info before you start exploring. For years I was one of the read instructions when frustrated, but I have learned.
 These work great and I love being able to know who has arrived at my house at the blind spots.
 Seems like a good basic system. The mounting brackets could be sturdier and it would be nice if there was 2 way audio.
 I like the cameras, the picture is really good, the setup very simple and easy, my problem is batteries are only lasting a couple weeks even turned to the least sensitive setting.  Unfortunately with 3 cameras I’ll have to try something else.
 Very pleased with purchase. Easy to setup, monitor and manage.
 High quality videos.  The cameras are very easy to setup.  The app for the cameras provides excellent options for your individual operational preferences.  The long battery life is a plus!
 The video resolution is good in day light but for night time is bad, you cannot even see a license plate of my car park at 15 feet away from this camera.<br/>Camera also is kind of pixeled or grany some times.
 love my blink system.  Have 3 cameras outside.  Feel very secure especially when  away or asleep.
 If sensitivity to high it picks up wind and leaves blowing.  But when it’s down to far distance of people doesn’t work.  Not thrilled with performance.
 Great camera but batteries won't last one week. I have to replace batteries on both cameras every week. Everything else is okay for the price. I guess the cold weather in NJ is killing the batteries. They don't last a week.
 Product is not bad easy installation however the customer support or should I say extreme lack of it is a major problem
 i love my new blink xt cameras. i can monitor my home while i'm away and not worry. it is in color and has great night vision. well worth the money! i would recommend this to everyone. dixie smith
 Ive been using these for over a year.  settings are misleading, motion detection is weak at best.  hopefully now that amazon owns them they will upgrade the software.  for now, look for better options
 Great cameras so far.  No technical issues, they just work as advertised.  It's too early to tell how battery life will be, but so far, so good.
 work great.  battery life is terrible.
 It has such great pictures and I have total control of when and how to use it.
 Everything I expected and more. Sensitivity a little tricky but once you understand it is fine.
 I ordered to sets of 2 Camera and Modules, one module didn't work straight from the box, they did send me another one right away. I have one setup on a schedule and every other day the "scheduled arm unsuccessful"  but it has no problem disarming. The motion is either way to sensitive or not strong enough. I am highly unsatisfied and wish I could get my money back.
 Really good quality. The video is amazing and really clear both at night and during the day. Really recommend.
 Easy to mount for my outside camera, i live in a apt and love the convenience of having my apt right on my phone..and the quick alert status...on recorded video..
 Battery died within days. Junk product.
 If you have a two story home this system is garbage!!!  And because the idiot designers didn’t put antennas on the cameras your very limited on distance to where cameras get placed.  I wish I knew this!!  I wanted cameras placed on eves of house - cameras won’t work - best thing I did was return them
 These cameras are super simple to set up and very easy to use.  I love the fact they are mobile and you can move them around.  I also love the fact you can check the temperature in your home when your away.  These are dry cool.
 No ability to record live video from the app. Cloud storage extremely limited. Motion detection can be slow to start recording even after adjusting sensitivity. Setup was straightforward and video quality is acceptable. I do not use these cameras for home security and would not recommend them for security or other critical monitoring.
 So I went and I got arlo pro 2 because my neighbor got it. They only support 5 cams then you need a subscription. Heard about blink and they have a 2 year battery life but they didn't mention that ***( if you have a high traffic area the batteries will only last for maybe a month or so )*** so long story short I'm going back to arlo..
 So far I have had it in one week. It is everything I hoped for so far.. Contact me at. a later date so I can tell you how it is holding up.. Actually going to add a few more camera's to my system I have 5 now.. East set up,,,,good price, , wireless ,, nothing goes through my property now without me knowing,,
 Home run! Affordable, super easy to set up, great video, wireless range is as advertised. After a few weeks, the only question is the battery life.  Even the app seems good, no false alarms, no weird glitches.<br/>We bought a few mote, expect them tomorrow.
 This is a poor excuse of a security camera. It does not alert me when I am not home. And yes I have it all set up right and it is running and the battery is good.<br/>May be good if you want it for a puppy monitor when you are away.
 Like the quality in design and user interface but it sucks because it never works when there is actually something happening...  Sensitivity set to 9-10 leaves make it go off, sensitivity set to 8 my house gets burglarized and don't even get a single image of it.... Thanks @blinkhomesecurity
 Have this system since they came out. Have 2 white camera that I can not use, can not connect to system. Ordered 2 black cameras, 3 times had to ship back, not able to connect. As of today, waiting for a replacement. Be careful when they replace one camera, it came used and full of scratches. Had to send back.
 I like that these cameras work well, are very customizable as far as their operation, no ongoing monthly subscription, easy to set up, and works with IFTTT.
 Loved that I could move a camera,  caught a wild kitty eating the food I left out for it. I haven't used the camera mounts yet, I like the flexibility of being able to move it  where I need to.
 Blink is easy to install, works great, and I like the arm/disarm feature so I dont get notifications when I'm home. The only thing I would like that Blink doesn't seem to do, is in live view, I wish I could record directly to my phone with a record button instead of only to the server with the motion detection feature. Other than that, I love the system.
 Easy to set up and works well. Love the fact that the battery can last up to 2 years.
 Still new to me but seems to work great. One thing I'm not sure about is if I can arm a individual camera or if I need to arm the whole system.. Bu it was easy to set up and the pictures are clear on my phone.
 We bought two cameras in our order. Both have a pretty clear picture when you view the camera through the app.<br/><br/>For motion sensing, though, only one of the two cameras work. We bought these for home security (as advertised), so it's basically useless.
 Junk!  Purchased the two pack and one of the cameras came DEFECTIVE.<br/>Returned!
 Be careful how you set your Blink Camera settings for high traffic areas like a front door entrance. The clip length and retrigger time can have a huge impact on battery life. Our front door battery lasted 4 months not 2 years! I would recommend a clip length between 10-15 secs and a retrigger time of at least 45 seconds.
 Worked  great until the first power failure then I had to reinstall. If I have to do this every time this is Useless
 Very good product. Easy to set up and does exactly as advertised.  The app could be improved but still ok once you get familiar with it. Scheduling is very easy and email feed back if motion is detected works perfectly to include video back to your phone. Good product for a good price
 These cameras are great. They can be put anywhere and really work well. They are very easy to use and set up.
 These are not quite 1080p, but they are pretty sharp and super easy to install. No Wires? Life just keeps getting better and better!!!
 So far, so good... delivery was prompt.  All things in working order. It was easy to setup.  It's easy to use.  The pictures/videos are very clear.  Thank you.
 Nice system. Easy to install and works as good as the more expensive systems.
 Love the Blink security system.  I was having a pee problem with one or more of my pets.  Caught the culprit on the living room camera in the middle of the night.  The camera did its job for me.  Also like that I can also see live video at the house while I'm at work if needed.  Great system, easy to set up and love the app too.
 I bought this from QVC, and just love it.  It is needed to watch my disabled mom.  The range is wide and it is very clear.  The response from movement is fast.  I am very pleased also I can hear sound.  Thanks
 Love the wireless cameras the clear and  you could see them well  just wish they would rotate from side to side so you can see the whole room<br/> Also don’t like to delay by the time they click on and record you missed about four seconds of lot was there.  The required time could be longer also
 The Blink security camera are awesome.  I just recently purchased mine on QVC and I am really impressed with them.  I before, was using one WeMo / Belkin camera which had to be plugged in to work.  That made it hard to hide it.  But these small thin camers use batteries instead of needed to be plugged in.  I LOVE THAT.  You may hang them or sit them any where you choose.  I also like that using the app on your smartphone, you can change settings for what is best for you.  You can set the sensitivity for motion, and the length of recordings, and time lapse in between recordings, you can turn off motion sensor from app or disarm cameras which I like because when I am home I do not need them recording nor do I want them turned on because I have always had a fear of hackers. Before with my Belkin camera you did not have these options to turn motion sensors off and on, disarm when you are home, or too receive notifications on your phone when away whenever your camera was detecting motion.  They record everything once they detect motion and save all video clips in a folder for your review later.  I LOVE THAT ABOUT THEM.  My previous camera did not record unless you were checking it and either hit record video or take a snap shot.  What good is that?  I had to just happen to go to my app and open WeMo to view camera.  I should say I don't recall if there was a setting to recieve a notification because I no longer have that camera, but if it was there I didn't notice it.  And you did have to open the app to hit record.  And it didn't save anything in a folder.  I would reccommend these cameras for anyone.  I have already shared one video of what my dog was doing when I was gone on FB. I've already been asked what kind of camera it was and how good it was...  Good clear color video.
 Use these camera at both my home and a remote site.  Was able to reliably sync the base and cameras to a MiFi device for remote viewing and also link to my home network within the house.  I am impressed.  Would love to see the ability to store/email pictures taken - and not just video.  I agree with many - that there is limited or no customer service.  But I still like to product and flexibility of the system, and will buy and recommend to others.
 The only reason I took a star off was because the batteries last less than 3 months, instead of closer to 2 years.
 The set-up process was as simple as possible. The connection and storage is good.
 I bought these cameras in late July and now a second camera's batteries need to be replaced.
 Would not recommend. Died after 3 months of use.
 I like the alert that I receive when the camera detects sound or movement. However the approximate 2 second delay from the time there is actual movement in front of the camera and when the camera starts to record is odd. It would be nice if it was simultaneous. But not a bad investment.
 My Blink camera has worked as advertised.<br/>Easy set-up... good value.
 I noticed that the range of motion detection has dramatically shorten. I tried sensitivity at 9(max) but it does not help. It only senses movement within about 2ft from the camera. Battery status shows OK.<br/>Can you help?
 I love it! Had it for a month haven't had to recharge it yet and I have it trigger for any movement and run 30 sec. I love that it is free storage. And plenty of storage space so no need to buy more.
 Love this product! Great picture quality and battery life is fantastic. Super easy to set up.
 Decent price, easy to install, the app for 24 hour surveillance is amazing.  Buy a whole bunch :)
 I was surprised how easy it was to set up.  And it works really well.  Two nights ago two raccoons visited our front walkway at 2:30 am.  Very cool to have a little video clip.
 Easy to use and set up
 This is the greatest system EVER!  I love the fact that there is no monthly fee and you can monitor it whenever you like.  I have caught some pretty comical clips from door-to-door sales people.  I strongly suggest this system!!!  It was a little difficult to set up the first one but once I got the hang of it - no problems.  Also, they are easy to adjust once you have them actually installed.
 I like the product.  But I don't get notifications on my phone right away.
 Very easy to set up.<br/>Video quality is very good.<br/>Alerts to my phone are prompt.<br/>5 STARS
 even for a tech dummy this was easy to set up and use
 They are easy to setup but at night you cannot see anything and no one from blink will help
 Overall it's a great starter security system. The price and installation are the major pros in blink. My major concern is the mounting bracket looks like it could be broken easily enough and it needs to be able to tilt to any angle. Now that amazon owns this company I hope they listen to customer needs and really make this a great investment for people who want to feel safe but need a low cost and easy installation. Cant wait to see what they're gonna do in the coming months. Fire tv playback maybe?
 I decided to send this device back on day one, because the video quality was very poor.
 Great camera's
 Easy setup.  Nice picture. Small size.

 Easy to use and works very well, very good video quality. would be nice to have a Blink video doorbell or have the ability to integrate a Ring doorbell. Very satisfied
 I love the system. Easy to set up for a electronics novice like myself. The 3 camera set is perfect and all cameras work great. I noticed the battery that came with the outdoor camera was different from the batteries that came with the indoor cameras. Based on the reviews i read before purchasing they won't last a year (we will see). I love how the system works, I love that it records with sound and the pictures are clear. This is awesome system.
 Seems to be a great product. To early to tell how they hold up as I just set them up last night
 Quality of night time pics are poor . Good concept poor outdoor performance. Returned
 I purchased the bundle that included 1-outdoor and 2-indoor cameras.  Wish I had done the reverse as I now would like to set one up by the back door (outdoor) instead of the bedroom (indoor). But so far very pleased with my purchase.
 Works well and I live on an acre.  Wish mounting with the bracket had instructions and I did notice after it rained some blurred images since wAter on lense
 Great product. This item gets five stars right off the bat for not charging a monthly fee for monitoring with your system. The cameras are pretty good quality and easy to install and maintain. A very affordable way to monitor your house both indoors and outdoors. Image quality is pretty clear and the sensors work very well. I'm happy with my purchase.
 this system worked well at first, then after a few weeks its hit or miss.  the side camera may or may not pick up motion.  the back camera is intermittent.  The front camera is the only consistent one.  I don't feel like I paid a lot for this, so, overall its okay.  I would not buy it again.
 The cameras are great, but motion detection is lacking.  will only pick you up from about 15 feet away
 these cameras have great picture and huge convenience.  the wifi connection has been flawless to this point
 This is more of a toy than an actual security surveillance camera. Cheap flimsy mounting and very flimsy.
 I love the easy set up &amp; great quality  pictures.  Only thing I don't  like is the delayed notification. Takes several seconds for notification  after movement  detection. All in all great home security  system.  We got the 4 system... Looking  to add on now.. Love it!!!
 Love the camera’s they’re easy to install and use. The only thing I wish you could do is talk to whoever is on camera when watching live.
 I feel very safe using this system to protect the outside and inside of my home.  My main thing is there is no monthly expense involved with this system.  It works great and can be adjusted very easily for sensitivity.  I would encourage anyone to buy it.
 Good picture in color easy setup and sensitive to motion
 Fantastic devices!! This is additional to my home security... easy to setup and use!!!  I highly recommend these cameras
 Easy to set up and install for the non tech savvy person.  I love being able to make sure people are doing their job while in my home and not going through my personal things.
 I was able to connect the Sync Module to my wifi, but was never able to connect a camera.  "Adding camera failed." every time.  Contacted support and they sent me another camera.  Same problem.  Returning the entire set.
 Poor night vision
 I finally set up my blink last night and I think it is great. The video and audio records perfectly even at night in the rain. I get alerts right away and the set up was very easy.
 It was a little difficult to get going at first but is working well now that we have them up, may purchase extra cameras at a later time. Would love if you were able to speak to the person when someone was at the door.
 perfect!!!!! i love this camera
 I love the Blink XY system. I have these cameras I my home and my vacation home.  Absolutely love them.  Fingers crossed on battery life.
 Love the size, ability to place in any location and battery powered. But I found out right away that it could use better mounting hardware (does not allow for left/right adjustments) and activity zones (my flag moves a lot and sets off the motion detector). But overall VERY happy!
 This was so easy to set up and the videos are pretty clear in the day time, night camera is not as good, but you can still see what's going on.  I get a notice if a camera is activated, anywhere I am, down the street or across the country- As long as there is a wifi connection, I can turn the system off and on, get alerts and view videos all from my phone.  I could see when workers came to the house when I was in NY!  This simple device has given me a lot more peace of mind.
 These are sooo good and discreet, the nuns have no idea!
 This system is very simple (good, clear instructions) to install and gives peace of mind when away...woulld highly recommend
 Worst buy of my life. What killed this product for me was the fact that it works with AA batteries. I would literally use it for 2 days and need to replace the batteries. I would rather go through the extra effort and buy a wired camera that runs off mains.<br/><br/>Especially at this price.
 This was so simple to setup great video at a great price top shelf top notch !! Would buy again !
 Works nice but bracket not designed well. You cannot move Blink left or right once the bracket is installed so hopefully you can find something to attach it to that has just the right angle. I had to be creative and put a shim behind one half of the mounting plate so it would angle properly and not pick up passing cars on my street.
 good product
 It was relatively easy to install. We liked it being wireless—no wiring required. It appears to work great so far. I was a bit worried about being wireless, not sure how good it would work with our WiFi . It is working great! Price was great also. I would recommend it.
 Love everything about the system! Hardest part of the setup was screwing the mounts in (and I used a cordless screwdriver)
 Has given me the sense of extra security and ability to check on the house directly from my phone throughout the day. Super easy installation and hides from plain sight easily!
 Blink XT has given us information to know who is driving/walking up our driveway, as well as who is at the front door.  With the App we know when and who is on our property.  Thank you for the excellent compatibility with our iPhones.  We are very pleased.
 Small  easy to set up and use, inexpensive. The only thing I wish it had was the ability to talk to the person.
 Another great product. Quality, great 1080 p video. My home looks better on the camera than live. Just purchased another camera on Prime Day!
 I love these cameras!  They work beautifully and are very practical and user friendly.  My only wish is that the cameras would display on the Echo Show.  If you could work out that technology with amazon then they would be absolutely perfect.
 I would reccomend this to anyone I love this device easy to install and easy access to my phone I’m gonna purchase more cameras to add .. thx blink great device !!
 Motion detection is poor.
 Great devices and I like that no monthly charge is required. This was my second set of cameras. Support was terrific
 Awesome
 Very easy to install. Very happy about not having to pay for a subscription. Can check any of the cameras on "live view" anywhere and anytime!
 A zoom feature NEEDS to be added.  I wrongly assumed it was there.,  otherwise its been ok so far.
 I absolutely LOVE my Blink system. You can customize how sensitive each camera is to movement and set them to where they automatically come on and go off at certain times so you don't have to remember to set the alarm at night or when you leave for work. I will be adding more.
 Does everything I wanted and needed in a security cam for home.  I'd like to get an outdoor model now!
 Works perfectly!  Just need to adjust sensitivity setting on windy days or trim my trees!
 Easy to install and works well
 Easy to install and setup
 Excellent home security system. Love the night vision feature. Great battery life and very clear.
 great quality
 The Blink systems was very easy to set up and has great picture quality.<br/>The only thing that could be improved is the mounting bracket.<br/>I am planning on purchasing a litter heavy duty type.<br/>I would highly recommend this camera system.
 Purchased the individual camera. I’ve had it about 2 weeks. So far I am liking it. I get alerts when motion is detected and can view the video of the movement. I will be buying a set in the near future to have one at every angle of our property.
 We bought a set of the 2 indoors for our adult children as a small token for the help they all got on board when Dad was very ill and we needed help  for about 5 months  THEY loved them , for you know kids will not let you pay them for help , but this give has been a great  one as they all have pets and they  do take trips and now they can keep an eye on their homes and even the basements if a water issue was to  happen.  Seeing with kids come in and go  and how the family pets are doing
 I'm very happy with this product. It works as promised. I did have some trouble getting it to connect on my network, but Blink Customer Service was very prompt and helpful with their advice and it's up and running great, I'm thinking about picking up another one for another part of my house.
 Disappointed. Needed a replacement camera before leaving town for a few weeks.  This one arrived DOA.  Tech Support wasted my time for 20 minutes with power cycles, turn it on, turn it off etc..etc..  Won't be buying another one.
 Better hope your system is flawless, because if it isn't, you are on your own.  This company reminds me of DELL.  Great at making sales, but nonexistent afterward.  This may be the best product when working, but do you want to take that chance?  I see an Arlo in my future.
 I love these cameras. No wires easy to set up. It records and does live views it’s  awesome. I have 3 outside cameras and 1 siren.  For the price u can’t go wrong.
 Great product. No fees just good technology.
 it  is ok
 really like it easy to operate, only set back it has a few second delay when viewing...
 Small, great picture and viewing area. I love that the camera's are truly wireless.
 Batteries advertised to last up to 2 years, mine last less than a month. Was told basically it was being used too much. Also, since the first camera went down, my 2nd one stopped recording as well.
 Very disappointed. This is the only device in my house that drops from the network. Haven’t used in quite some time. Also, poor picture quality
 They work perfect, easy to configure (no more than 5 minutes 3 cameras) and scheduling works perfect, only once they disconnect from the Wifi, then I never have that issue after, great work, nice resolution, even in complete dark
 We put this up at the beach house. They are great. Easy to install and get up and going, Only con is the mounts. I have ordered better mounts.
 Easy set up and nice product.  Do not like that there is no special notification sound on my iPhone.  No motion siren.
 We love it. The only thing missing is being able to talk back. (Only to mess with my dogs) lol. It was super easy to set up, I didn’t need my husbands help at all.
 I like the picture quality...very nice!  But, why can't I view my cameras on Amazon TV?  This is an Amazon product?  Also, how about an alarm on Amazon Echo when the camera trips?
 The two camera bundle that I received was missing a pair of batteries and a mounting bracket.  The camera I did get to setup was super simple.
 I ordered 2 cameras for outdoors, I got them last night. it is very easy to set them up. The motion detectors catch and send a video clips to my cell instantly.<br/>The video quality is good. I am very happy with my purchase at this point.
 Awesome product
 I ordered 3  Blink XT cameras, they are extremely easy to set up, just download the app on your phone and then input the serial numbers for each Camera, then put them up in the various locations outside, so simple ..exactly what I wanted.
 I have one complaint, the signal on your phone when a Camera is activated is not loud enough and you can miss it. There needs to be away so you can alter and increase the volume of the alert on your phone. Otherwise I love everything about the system.
 Overall - the system seems to be bulletproof (as in very reliable).  My only complaint is that I wish the system alerted you at the beginning of motion detection, and not after it completes recording a video to the cloud.
 Excellent so easy to set up
 I  don't like the alarm. I just get a general iphone notification sound. I would like a unique alarm that is applicable to just to the blink system. Seems to me this should have been a higher priority for the software on the Blink app.
 Sensitivity is either far too sensitive or doesn't pick up anything.  Wind and bugs trigger it every minute.
 Very easy to install. Excellent app.Good resolution. Good picture quality.
 The second night that I had the cameras up, the system caught an individual breaking into one of my vehicles, the system notified my phone, the person got away, but not with my vehicle. System paid for itself on its second night.
 Great works well, easy to set up perfect for the price!
 Like the product and would like it more if it could alert multiple phones
 I’ve had this a couple of months &amp; have enjoyed it so far! Great connection to our wifi &amp; motion detection works well.
 These cameras are great! I an thinking of getting two more. Now I can cancel my monthly home security service!
 Can not sign in online. Website does not recognize email or password. Have to remove camera and and start all over for complete access.So for now limited to just phone access.
 Great set of cameras. Super easy to set up a get working. We use ours indoors and did not permanently mount them so we can move them around the house.
 The product is easy to set up great picture and live view but will only hook up to 1 device on ur phone  or laptop not both
 I like the easy set up, the small size, two year battery life, wireless, smart phone connection, live viewing.
 They were very easy to install and start using! Best deal for the money! Got the 5 camera system and had one camera that I couldn’t get to sync, but called customer service and they sent me a new one right away!
 I am using this for my office to monitor the coming and going.
 Love it! Easy to install, easy to set up, easy to use! I can go live or take picture on any camera, any time, from anywhere! Great picture quality! Absolutely satisfied and would recommend!
 Easy installation and setup.  Picture quality great for day or night.  Motion detection alert works great.  Great value!  Going to order another set for daughters house.
 I can't believe how easy these cameras are to setup. They work perfectly too. Great image quality and motion alerts are so convenient.  I'm thinking of expanding my five cameras with a few more.
 No night vision. No notification of movement.Takes too long to come up on the phone
 While the blink indoor cameras are geat, the xt is a huge pain. The sensitivity cannot be tuned to a sweet spot. Either it constantly alerts with waving grass, tiny insects or shadows or large objects are missed and must be coming super close. I regret the purchase.
 I noticed how easy it is to remove from the mounting bracket. A mounting bracket that could  be locked would be desirable. Also, a way to have it monitored by a third party  would be nice.
 Wish it had a mic like my other camaras
 Purchased this for my daughter's home. She loves it!!
 Easy install and set up with the rest of my amazon devices.
 My dislike is that it doesn't record a visible video at night. I can hear sound but can't see nothing but darkness.
 I got this as an xmas gift had it up since xmas and today got a notification that the batteries need to be changed.<br/>2 years of life from the batteries my foot!
 Very buggy system.
 Easy to Install.  Good quality picture.  Motion detection works well
 The cameras (purchased 3) work as expected.  Easy to set-up  on app downloaded to mobile phone.  If using outdoors, recommend you purchase mounts as the out of the box mounts are not easy to aim/adjust.  In addition to match the outside paint color I did purchase white covers to make the cameras less conspicuous.
 Happy with the product.  As advertised.  Pictures are clear.
 Have had for over half a year now and no complaints.  Easy to use, easy to set up, and add a lot of peace of mind. We will probably be adding more cameras soon.
 Have had one camera since Thanksgiving, and so far it has worked as described.  I get notifications a little slow from time to time but that could be connection.
 Many problems getting cameras to detect motion- for reasons unknown- was working on it with “blink” to no satisfaction- the extra sync module they suggested I need for a 1700sqft home is NOWHERE to be found let alone offered at a discount for an unhappy customer... tried to go through amazon (who owns blink) and they said “your 30 days is up you have to speak with manufacturer.” So basically have 3 cameras and a sync module I bought and now will have laying around collecting dust.<br/>Amazon: when you so boldly put your name on something- make sure you’re gonna stand behind it. About the only thing I can do is quit Prime- maybe you’ll reach out if I do that?
 I had to purchase a better router to get it to work. Ours was t strong enough.  We have a 3 camera blink in a bilevel. Once we did that &amp; got it all set up I love it.
 I think the system works well, the picture clarity is very good.  Overall I am pleased with the Blink system.
 Easy to set up and works well
 No audio! Cannot get camera to activate properly &amp; there is a very long delay before I get a notification. Someone could be in the house before I was notified. Returning product!
 Great item !!  Love it. Easy to install and works in any kind of weather day and night !!
 The price is the best part of the Blink. For what you pay the results are good. The notifications you receive are fast. A matter of seconds. Two downfalls are distance and night time resolution.
 After a series of trespassing and car break ins in our neighborhood we got the 2 camera system.  Super easy to set up and install.  One camera is monitoring the front door and the other watches the garage area.  Being able to monitor these two areas at all times from anywhere is comforting.<br/>May have to purchase a couple more cameras.
 Couldn't believe that this took more than two days to be received. The system works very well, would give it a four stars maybe even five. Wish it had a solar charger and that it could be used on a computer/laptop and that it had two way communication and that it would contact police direct if necessary.
 Great price,  great camera,  great battery life
 Daytime is OK not as good as indoor cameras. Night pictures sucks.
 This was extremely simple to install, the picture and sound quality are surprisingly good, and it has been reliable. Very happy with this system and would recommend it.
 These cameras are a gem.  I really like this product as a layer of security.
 Had it for about one month. Easy to setup. Clear video clip. The only thing I don't like is the recording delay after motion is detected. About 2 to 3 seconds. Too long to capture anything if some one passes the door fast.
 You cannot pan or zoom with these cameras. They can easily be knocked down. On the app, you can only view one camera at a time. This product needs major improvements.
 So much fun watching the animals come into our yard, and UPS driver, and my husband.
 It did not work in my house!
 Overall good product. High quality picture, battery life good so far. Sensor a little touchy but sure varies with environment.
 Would like to be able to speak (both ways) - It might be better through a separate wireless speaker. Waiting for a doorbell system.
 If I could get the sink unit to install, it would sure help.
 Easy setup. Works well. Only thing that I don't like is that you have to manually arm and disarm, and don't have the ability to set it up for an automatic schedule.
 Good for the money. Down side is to get the needed pics you have to boost up sensitivity to the point where it will trip with movement in a shadow.
 With a recommendation from a neighbor, I purchased and installed a system a week ago.  So far, I am very pleased.
 This was the perfect security system for me.  The cost of the initial cameras was very reasonable, I only need two cameras.  Set up was easy even for me plus  no expensive yearly costs and I can turn it off and on as needed.  Very happy I purchased it.
 Good system, simple and reliable and great video quality. Needs an offer add on smoke detector module and also a siren module.
 Ordered this extra camera as well as the 1 camera unit on Prime Day. Now I know why they were discounted!!! JUNK!  After about 1 week completely went off line and now I cant get the camera system to respond at all.  Save your money and buy a Ring device or something else. I have had Ring for 3 years and have never had a problem.....I guess thats what you get for what you pay
 Love it
 I have one camera has difficulty connecting to syncing modules
 Works very well and so easy to install and set up.
 Blink app was installed on my ipad (2018 ver 6) and it worked as stated. Easy to set up. Works very well with my echo show and echo spot.
 So easy to deploy which opens possibilities to setup in very hard to reach places.
 like the app wish you could also get monitoring on your mac/comp.also  liked not paying monthly like ring
 Love the product JUST once in a while won't Catch everything And a little delay.  Would Love for Blink to make two way
 I freaking love these things!!!! I got em stuck everywhere. Great wireless distance. The light helps a lot. I even put em in toolshed &amp; buy the pool. They are great!!
 This system works even better than advertised. Easy installation and adding more cameras.
 Good camera
 Great product! Easy to set up and easy to use.
 So far so good. Easy setup, really  like  not having a monthly fee. Picture quality  is  great. Going to get indoor setup later.
