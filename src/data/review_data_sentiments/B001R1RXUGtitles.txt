Works for my sleeping noise
Not what they used to be
Unstable, but cool air
Excellent fan with a single glaring con,for those young at heart
Disappointed It Broke In Less Than 90 Days!!!
Dying after 5 months.
After two years, it has stopped working.
Big Performer, Small Package
Hot, sweaty with a brand new fan that doesn’t work
2nd one to break in 4 months, Honeywell never responded to my emails
Worked for almost exactly 1 year.
Weaker Motor Than Older Model
I love this fan for the price and purpose
Not feelin' it.
Excellent white noise for sleep
Trinidadians and Tobago'nites love this here fan my friends!
I haven't really had much reason to think about it, it just works.
Pointless Purchase
Affordable little powerhouse of a fan.
Fan is off balance, makes annoying noise.
25% quieter my butt, but better than the heat
Excellent at its job, quiet and powerful - great buy
I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!
Great fan for air circulation and price
Amazing fans, I have like 7 of them now
Piece of Junk- Stopped working after 5 months

Good fan for the price
This fan is FANtastic
Nice sleep Aid!
Surprisingly solid fan for the money
Highly Recommend
Great product didn't last long
Powerful, compact, durable, quiet, discreet, blends in visually
It's a good fan for the price, but you get what you pay for
Really nice little fan, I had no issues with the base being unstable as other reviewers stated.
Product Has Changed ! No Longer Decent, Obvious Cost Cutting Manufacturing
Change For The Worse - Agreed
At speed 2 it is just starting to get annoying at this distance and 3 gave me flash backs ...
Nice for subtle white noise
Blow your worries away
Just Doesn't Last

Honeywell Fans Are Not What They Once Were
Surprisingly Quiet
Great fan for the office
Very quiet, although new ones are not as powerful
Strong off-gassing plastic smell made it unusable for me.
Small, affordable, and surprisingly very effective!
Great little noisy jet engine!
Longevity Issues
It is perfect on my side table next to my bed
OK Fan
Honeywell oh how you let me down...
It worked great and the adjustments on the speed were really useful ...
Very Quiet. Not Very Strong. Doesn't Make For A Good "White Noise" Machine.
Small but powerful fan
Disappointing ending to this story
Number 2 on the list of "small but mighty" things of mine
Compact and cute but defective
Works for me but beware of fan noise
) This fan is just as good as any within its very fair price range
Ok air circulation, not enough white noise.
Great fan, perfect for dorm room or white noise!
Broke after 4 months
3 speeds, good size for desk, hard to reach power switch
Excellent small powerful fan.
Underwhelming, packed with Disappointment!
Still great, three years later.
Black or White? Old Model or New Model?
Decent - gets the job done
Great value at the ~$10 price point
Not Turboforce AirFlow, Look At The HT-908 Instead...
I'm positive I made the right choice with this great little fan!
Durable and Effective Fan
Hard to beat this powerful & inexpensive fan!
Economical, quiet way to stay cool for those of us who run hot.
I needed this.
Great fan but handle with care
Begins to Crap Out After a Year and light usage
Great fan!
Use these all the time
Great for the Money, does the job, but not too powerful or durable.
VERY VERY WEAK FAN~ do not buy if you want to actually move air!
Great Deal!

Perhaps I received a defective fan?
Too powerful for a desk fan, but great to cool a living room

Great little fan for personal space
Worthless airflow
Cheap and does the job.
Extremely tedious and overly difficult to open for cleaning.
Great fan for the price
Get this if you are on a budget and are expecting average fan speeds. :)
It has been running for 2 straight years!
This fan really blows!
Does the job and well!
These units move a surprising amount of air for how ...
A wonderful Fan
Great if you only want a fan, not noise mitigation
Yet another iteration on the same design

Blows air good.
Good small fan, perfect for use at a desk or office workspace
The right size, but annoying engineering defect
Nice look... but very little out put of air.
GREAT FAN...!!
Quiet air circulation
2nd one to die in less than 6 months.
Not what I was expecting.
If it lasts a few years then it would be a good buy indeed
Well worth the $16
For the price, great desk fan.
Pretty good for really low price
Broken within five months.
Too loud
Good if used in right application
Great fan!
This is an excellent little fan
Very weak, poor air circulator
Quiet Fan That Can Move Some Air!

A nice little fan.
I really like this little powerhouse

This little fan is perfect for a cruise
Good Brand !
seattle doesn't believe in air conditioning

I am extremely disappointed with this fan
Static Noise After Couple Weeks...
Great fan!
A Fan of White Noise
Perfect fan---just what I needed
Small but powerful!
This thing moved so much more air than a box fan!
Get what you pay for
Short life span
On the slow setting it's pretty quiet.
Only good for small spaces close up!
This is a "circulator", not a regular fan
This is a nice little fan
Love these fans
This fan blows less air than a hairdryer!
Warning!
It's not a perfect replacement for my previous fan
Airflow will feel low despite high settings don't let that fool you
Don't waste your money!
Perfect
Great
USED to be good
Very quiet and throws off a nice breeze.
Let the Buyer Beware
for the price it is great. The fan is pretty strong for its size ...

Won’t adjust or position effectively
It's a good size, sturdy
Little engine that could! Absolutely amazed!
I have a previous Honeywell small fan which looks like the same model but it is not
Not Satisfied
