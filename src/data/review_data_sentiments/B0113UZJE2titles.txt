Garbage. Donâ€™t waste your money.
Would not weigh 4 grams
The scale is almost useless for measuring out spices and yeast and other items ...
I would recommend another product to weigh food
Drained battery even when turned off!
Scale for puppies
Works Great... Til It Dies
Looks great but isn't practical for a lot of uses, But there's a larger one!
All in all I am totally pleased with this scale and especially pleased with their customer ...
There are plenty of other GREAT kitchen scales available that ARE waterproof for the same ...
