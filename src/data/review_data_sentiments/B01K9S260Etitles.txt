Have had and like the fitbit
(Long, In Depth Review) Great Device, Build Quality Way Better Than Original Charge (HR)
Breaks just after warranty and no way to fix it
Dangerous Device
My advise, do not ever buy anything from this company.  I know I won't make that mistake again.  Worst customer service ever.
Addicted to Fitbit
2 defective Charge HR's
Customer Service is Horrible
I originally loved my FitBit
Charge 2 does not work in the Cycling mode. (Connected GPS is not reliable)
BEWARE: The FITBIT Charge-2 won't last 1-year!
This device does NOTHING well
Was skeptical but I have been converted!
Answers the question: How well do you sleep?
BEST REVIEW for the Fitbit Charge 2
I noticed the Fitbit was either not tracking my steps ...
My wife loves it.
I love this fitbit
Great tracker - Just remember it's disposable.
Great product with extremely poor security.
buy something cheaper (and more accurate)
Happy at first but experiencing some issues.
Great device, huge improvement over the original with one inherited problem...
HR is not close to accurate!
Limited usability and benefit
3rd upgrade from Fitbit and blown away by all the information it provides!
Inconsistent results and other PITA factors make this a FAIL!
Get something else
This is not just another bad performing product
Not useful as a heart rate monitor. Extremely inaccurate and difficult to wear properly.
I am so glad I bought this!
Sleep tracker is no good
Pleasantly surprised.
They do not hold up well for the cost!
Defective Product and FitBit won’t replace it. Stay away!!
One of the best fitness bands on the market.
Decent for the most part--not spot on for distance
BIGGEST LET DOWN
though the band is a bit bulky i've liked many of the features
Had several FitBits. This is a disappointment.
Bad Deal!!
Love my Fitbit!
Steps are very innacurate....
Super disappointed:(
Crappy company
No accuracy at all
Frequently will not sync
Good tracker with a fatal flaw
Performs as expected
The band broke after 7 months of use
Makes me actually want to exercise and hit my goals.
Life Changing- Former Lifetime Weight Watchers Member
SO much better than Charge HR v1
Cracked screen
Disappointed in this "Upgrade"
Love it!
I like it, but the green lights on the back and brilliant white light from the face waking mess with my sleep.
Unreliable data.
Way off on step counts and calories. Does not seem to be accurate at all. Battery lasts 2.5 days now.
More of pedometer with heart rate available using two hands and two inputs. NO one-handed heart rate read-out.
I need more sleep!
It inspires me to exercise, which is good. But the software is not very good. It's OK for the price ($119 on sale).
Can not show information during the workout
Hardcore Tracker That Goes 3 to 4 Days On Line Charge
Don't buy it if you are an Android user
Difficult from the start
Heart Rate on Wrist Feature is HORRIBLE
Life-changer
For Average People
Quality Issues & Poor Customer Service
Pretty good.
Better than ever
Simple design, works great, although dated looks
Heartbeat is off
great for hourly movement reminders
Perfect size for my wrist, Non allergenic, energy in and out, heart rate, time, sleep....it's awesome
the Charge 2 is a nice sized tracker
Absolutely love it
Don't buy it! ---- Please see the video
I love my FitBit Charge 2
I finally found something to motivate me!
A good way to track and push you. But it has its flaws
Choosing a Size SMALL or LARGE.
Do not consider this an upgrade from Charge HR
The Fitness Device to Buy!
Doesn't read heart rate during workouts.
Love this Fitbit! Pros & Cons
Lackluster and now dead HR
Price vs. Value is a little low.
Great Fitness Watch
This Fitbit model gave me vertigo
Great until it stops working!!
Improvement over Fitbit Charge HR - and actual behavior change
Do not buy anything fitbit sells.
... meet my new fitness goals and also to gain better insight in to my sleep patterns
Not that Useful
The 2 main things I bought this for dont work that well
Great value for money! So much in such a little device!
Meh
It FITs every BIT of my life!
Love it, can't recommend highly enough!
Inaccurate data so there's just no point.
Questionable Data and Lack of Syncing
Juicero of pedometers?
Keep Step'n!
Marginally better than One insyncing....more features
I LOVE MY FITBIT CHARGE 2
It’s good, but it’s uncomfortable
Okay-ish.
NOT FOR TENNIS PLAYERS
Cheaply made product and HORRIBLE customer service!!!
Excellent introduction to Fitbit.  Nice and rugged.
The Wristband Sucks
Fitbits just aren’t for me.
Screen isn't worth the price tag.
Disappointed because I was unable to set it up
horrible fitbit servise
Love This.
Wildly inaccurate!
Just Okay...Step Count Off
I love my fitbit HR
Time to move!
I've named mine Albert
Oh i love this fitbit
Over counts steps
FitBit Just Okay. Could Use Some Tweaks.
A nice toy, but not perfect.
Many nice features to "connect" you to your exercise, diet and your mobile device!
Lasted Less than 2 Years
Fitbit is cool, but I still prefer my cheaper tracker
Not Tracking HR, Active Minutes or Distance Correctly
Hot Garbage
Works but has some drawbacks.
I will never buy a Fitbit again. Buyer Beware of Replacements.
Lasted 10 minutes - then died with no explanation - spend your money elsewhere
Frustratingly Inaccurate heart rate monitor
Not so great for Android
Good heart rate monitor, step monitor so so, sleep monitor poor
Love it!!!!!
Worth the investment! Silent alarms! Accurate. Motivational. App keeps track for weeks and shows trends! .
CAUSES SEVERE WRIST PAIN
Great Activity/Sleep Tracker, BUT possible HEALTH risk!
Works well
Not quite ready for prime time.
Happy with tracker after solving a couple problems
THE GOOD: Nice display
Screen scratched to unusable in two weeks
Finally found the FitBit for me
Favorite Fitbit Design So Far!
Excellent watch; no issues after 3 months.
Great usability, unreliable product (and horrible customer service model)
Very disappointed.
Poor packaging and incomplete kit for the Fitbit Charge 2
It's Different
Great fitness tracker, mediocre bands.
Love~Hate relationship.
In love... minus the default band...
Very inaccurate heart beat monitor when exercising
A+ Holiday Treat
Worst smatwatch ever.
Did not last 2 years
Heart rate is totally wrong on the low side.
I like the features
Misleading Band Sizing
Regular Firmware Updates + Great Software (Online and through the App)
It's great!
A decent but flawed device, good for tracking HR and sleep but not for accurately measuring daily physical activity.
Second Fitbit to just die after 12 months
Best smartwatch (for me) and fitness device!
A Wonderful Tracker
Poor customer service
but I waited three weeks to make sure I was satisfied. I've been wearing another brand of fitness band ...
FitBit Band Falls Apart -- On Charge 2
Almost Perfect Fitness Tracker!  Switched over from an Apple Watch Series 2
inaccurate, doesn't last long, terrible customer service, no warranty
3 fitbits broke down in under 2 years.  It is NOT made to last. This is sad considering cost.
For not-fit folks, too!
Terrific statistics
I wore it like a normal watch
Awesome product
Stopped working 6 months later- BUY FROM FITBIT DIRECTLY
Just In the Nick of Time
I certainly like this product
Overall good health awareness to help modify behavior
Dont Buy This!
DO NOT BUY!!! INACCURATE STEP COUNTER - ANY ARM MOVEMENT COUNTS AS STEPS
Good Tracker
Good for understanding and applying health data
First Fitbit Purchase!
they sent me a new one and it works fine now. So A+ for customer service

Love being able to see my sleep patterns and heart ...
Some nice features but HR sensor made it uncomfortable
Love this
Nice upgrade from Charge HR
It worked well while it worked and died before it was even two years old.
Charge 2, Fitbit App, and FitStar (Fitbit Coach) is a winning combination.
Wouldn't recommend.
Love it, but it came without a dongle that was needed for the Mac connection
Very helpful for tracking sleep patterns!
Not sure if mine is a defective product or if all Charge 2 products are like this.
I like it
Research product before buying
I love this fitbit
Mostly awesome!
A big step up from the previous model
Not a great product for moms
I love the color and the capabilities
I love this thing!
Part of my fitness program that has helped me lose 85 pounds in under a year
Love-Hate relationship
The charging port sucks
They don't have a repair center to fix issues after the warranty expires.
Great product
Merry Christmas, Honey
Tried 2 of these ,both were not accurate
Glass Cracks
Underwhelming - not recommended for cycling
Keeps me motivated to move!
Great exercise band for anyone to use.
and I absolutely LOVE IT! I've been waiting for something similar to ...
Doesn't work after only one month!
It does the job. Love it
OK, but don't think I would buy it again.
UPDATED REVIEW - Not Good
Worth the Upgrade
Great for tracking activity, Terrible to charge!
Newer Mac users *beware*
Good electronics, awkward band
the increase will not show up for a good 5-10 seconds
Also while laying bed it is sometimes hard to get the screen to light up as well Overall I'm really enjoying this product and wo
Works for a while but it will break on you.
We should have returned this poor quality product earlier
Like it. There's a reason there are upgradable options
Great piece of tech-gear
Fitbit just keeps on going with the awesomeness!
Save you money and buy something better.
Great Product!  Much more sturdy than the previous Charge HR model!
False Steps Recorded While Sleeping.
best fitbit I have used
Not effective for cardio and HIIT training - stick with a chest strap
Great design, terrible quality and support
I love it! It is loaded with features
I love it so much
Piece of crap. Fitbit brand is a joke!
but the device is so thick (tall) that on my tiny wrist it was pretty uncomfortable. I returned it
Aweomse

Horrible all around
Functional but not very durable
Great Monitor, just like better directions

Great product with social aspect.

I initially really liked it. I work out often so it's nice ...
You need this!
Fitbit Charge 2 wrist strap failure after 6+ months use.
Ok for starters like myself
For the fitness beginner but not for everyone...
What needs improvement
It doesn't count steps - it counts arm movements
My advice before you buy this nice item!!
fit bit
Best FitBit Ever!  And best deal I could find!
Buyer beware of limited warranty and quality of product
DO NOT BUY SQUARE TRADE WARRANTY
So far so good
Works well
... 5 years or more have a healthy case of love and hate with them
Small, unobtrusive, fashionable, works great!
BUY THE WARRANTY
Good try... MANY flaws!
LOVE THIS WATCH!!!!!

The new model is 100% better than the original Charge HR!
VERY GOOD MOTIVATOR
Versatile, useful, and comfortable

Overall, really nicely designed
Great product with many uses
Great App and feachers, good customer service, but doesn't last
was I did not have drag my bulky cellphone to get good running and bicycling information on training
Screen cracks and chips
Terrible HR tracker, but it can tell time pretty well.

Good functions -- Mediocre accuracy
This device does a great job on encouraging the user to do more
I LOVE this Fitbit Charge 2 !!
Love my Fit Bit.
You'll like it.
Fits my need and is working out well
NOT scratch resistant!!
I liked the look of the Charge 2
the face scratches really easily. Save your money -- do not purchase
but it is a little bulkier than I would have liked. It is accurate
I didn't want my phone with me at night as I always end up surfing the web (review junkie) too late and Im also a slow riser and Love to hit snooze like 4 -5 times
FITBIT, Tech and Stats are Fantastic... but when your straps break the tech is useless....

After less than 2 months, will no longer take a charge
Ugly but addictive

I would not recommend this tracker
Display times out = useless.
Exercise tracking feature is horrible.
Works for a while, then starts to fail.
Weak Silent Alarm

Heart rate monitor work? Yes or no or maybe. You never know.
