Spot on, but shorter than a normal mouse
At first works well - but doesn't last long
Inexpensive,Reliable, stable and easy to install
Manufacturing Defect?
Quality mouse
Nice Cordless Mouse Has A Few Issues.
Dud! Right click button dead after a few weeks of use.
Eats batteries-wouldn't buy another one
I really have nothing against a basic utility mouse. ...
Read the 1/2 star reviews - they are correct - this product has problems.
Great quality and comfort
It works, but only for about 2 years of less than average use and it eats batteries
Good mouse. A bit small and no usb C, but otherwise a solid option.
Would not buy AGAIN and AGAIN!
A Simple, Effective, and Inexpensive Device
Worse yet, after inserting into USB and pulling out
Comfortable and works well enough for the price
Updated: durability issues.
Simple plug-n-play meeces for your computer
Seems good but not my favorite; dongle stores inside battery compartment
Mouse is great, but beware of return
Died After only Months
Works Perfect, No Installation Needed, Perfect Size, and Wonderful Price!
I don't think I can use this.
Not a quality item.
Bugged Out After 6 mos
Great Mouse Except for Battery Replacement
Here I am a year later with the mouse still going strong and looking great and I am really impressed

Something Small, Don't Pass This One Up!
Solid mouse (Updated)
Updated Review - Broke after two years of light and infrequent use
If QC holds up I won't need another one brand of mouse for a long time
Better for some of us than pricey alternatives
Works instantly after connecting, as good as a pricier Logitech mouse I have for another computer.
Base is warped - quality has declined over the years.
Great mouse for the money
If you want a little mouse, this is not the mouse for you
too bad because this model is very comfortable to use
Agile and Just-Right Size

The nano receiver/dongle can bug out after about 20 months
Holding up great after a year
I wanted to like it, but I just can't
Basic mouse that gets the job done.
Perfect as a travel mouse - the nano receiver is stored between the two batteries!
Disappointed
The mouse works fine, but I find it likes to eats batteries.
Mouse shape and comfort are poor
Good price, below average performance.
If I were you I would purchase a different mouse.
