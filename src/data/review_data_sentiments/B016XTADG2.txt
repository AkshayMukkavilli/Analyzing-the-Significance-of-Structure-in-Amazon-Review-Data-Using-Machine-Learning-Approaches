 Great little speaker—especially for the price. Sound is crisp and full, it looks great, and has a nice, solid heft to it. It's also extremely easy to pair to an iPhone. Once paired, it quickly and reliably connects to my phone when turned on.<br/><br/>I get that Anker wants people to see their brand name and the white paint they used isn't so bright that the logo is obnoxious, but I still didn't want to look at it. So, using a metal pick in holes around the perimeter, I slowly and carefully pried off the grill. It's held in by tension and a very thin strip of black adhesive tape. Once the grill was off, I wrapped masking tape around the small ledge all the way around the grill. This was to keep from painting and ruining the black adhesive so I could reattach it later. If you use the slick, non-sticker paper from a sticker sheet you might get better results than I did. The masking tape took off a small amount of the adhesive, but it still worked. Then, with a $4 can of generic-brand metallic copper spray paint from the hardware store, I gave it a couple coats from all directions. Don't spray too heavily or you'll clog some of the small holes in the grill. IMO, it turned out perfect. Really classes up the little speaker.
 We were looking for a relatively inexpensive portable wireless Bluetooth speaker to replace a fun –looking Big Lots “boom box” style speaker that lasted for about a year.  Our primary use is for streaming music or internet radio services such as Pandora and Spotify, and listening by the pool and while having dinner.<br/>My wife and I decided to take a listen to 3 highly reviewed speakers that received mostly positive reviews on Amazon.  Here are the 3 speakers tested:<br/>1.  Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 (Cost: $27.99)<br/>2.  Anker SoundCore (Cost: $35.99)<br/>3.  JBL Flip 3 Splashproof ($81.30)<br/><br/>We were really hoping that the less expensive speakers would have been close in sound quality to the JBL Flip 3 Splashproof.  Sadly,that just wasn’t the case.  Upon the very first look, when opening up the box, you get a sense that Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 is a very no-frills, inexpensive speaker.  The packaging, the speaker, the extremely short, tiny USB charging cable.  Visually speaking, this speaker screamed no-frills.<br/><br/>Conversely, the Anker SoundCore gave the impression that you were opening up a well-constructed, tiny speaker.  It was packaged nicely, easy instructions, it felt a lot more substantial than the Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3.  Aditionally, the USB charging cable looked like your average size charging cable for your portable devices.<br/><br/>Last, was the JBL Flip 3 Splashproof.  At $81.30, it was a lot more money than we were hoping to spend on a portable pool speaker.  It was plain to see that this speaker just looked “ more expensive” than the other two models.  Great packaging, a super long and thick  USB charging cable that came in an eye-catching orange colored jacket.  The speaker itself looked awesome too with its compact cylinder shape.<br/><br/>Enough about the appearance… a speaker is all about ease of use and more importantly -- how it sounds.  How did all 3 sound and how easy were they to use?<br/><br/>On all 3 speakers in our test, we used 3 separate Samsung Galaxy 7s phones.  We played the same identical songs on each speaker and set the volume identical on all 3 phones.  Here were our results-<br/><br/>1.  Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3.  Unfortunately, this speaker was the least inspiring of the three speakers.  The sound was clear. However, it sounded tiny, none to very little bass. It projected a rather flat sound with the various music we played through it.  It was  though extremely easy to use, and the Bluetooth worked flawlessly.  I would generously give it 3 Stars.  On sound alone, I’d say it’s more 2 Stars.<br/>2.  Anker SoundCore – This speaker was hands-down better than the Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 for just a few dollars more.  Lots of great features – all of which worked perfectly.  The only downside of the Anker SoundCore was that it lacked bass.  The sound coming out of the Anker SoundCore is very balanced and fairly loud for such a small speaker.  I would lean more towards the 4 Star mark on the Anker SoundCore simply  for delivering a very nice, balanced sound quality, and is capable of filling a small room.<br/>3.  JBL Flip 3 Splashproof – At $81.30, we were really hoping that this wouldn’t be a situation where “you get what you pay for”.  Unfortunately, it was in the end.  Regardless of the song, or the type of music we played through it, it was far superior to the other two speakers.  It worked flawlessly and the sound/projection of sound coming out blew away the other speakers.  The Flip 3 Splashproof produced a rich, full sound that was extremely clear and thumped just the right amount of bass. It easily fills space with great clarity.<br/><br/>All-in-all, the JBL Flip 3 Splashproof blew away this competition.  5 Stars.  If you’re on a tight budget, you can’t go wrong with the Anker SoundCore.  If you can swing the extra bucks for the JBL Flip 3 Splashproof – go for it!  It sounds amazing!<br/><br/>Update:  Even though the JBL Flip 3 Splashproof sounds very good, the Bluetooth range is awful.  As long as your phone is within a very short distance of this speaker you will be happy.  The Bluetooth range on the Anker is WAY better than the JBL.
 I was really excited about this speaker after reading the reviews, but it stopped working after three weeks. There are other reviews that mention this. Unfortunately I missed the return period so now I am stuck with a speaker that won't turn on. And yes I know how to charge it. I hope the manufacturer reads this and wil exchange my speaker. I bought their backup battery at the same time, so I know they have good products. Unfortunately this must be a defective speaker with the power button. UPDATED 11/4/17 - I was immediately contacted by customer service at Anker after my review and they asked for my serial number of the defective speaker.  They sent another one out free of charge.  I was very impressed with their high level of customer service.  So far the new speaker is turning on and I hope it keeps working.
 Wow!<br/>I purchased this speaker because my tv is 12 feet across the room and I am a senior with hearing loss.<br/>My tv is louder than normal and always told by family it's too loud.<br/>I decided to try this item out since so many great reviews.<br/>Took 2 or 3 times to Bluetooth to my tv but that's because I didn't set it right.<br/>Now, I put the speaker on and I was disappointed the speaker wasn't that loud.<br/>I was ready to send it back.<br/>Then something told me to check the audio on tv.  I thought I had the type of audio wrong checked which may have lowered the volume due to the type of audio.  But, before I could do that, I noticed that the volume on the tv was low.  Naaah, that couldn't be the problem could it?  Well, I raised the volume on the tv  ( the tv doesn't get louder) and guess what!<br/>THE VOLUME ON THIS SPEAKER WAS BLASTING!!!!<br/>I then had to lower this speaker because it was too loud!<br/>This speaker is great, great and GREAT!!!<br/>Great sound!  U will not be disappointed!!!!<br/>Take it from a half deaf senior!!!
 I love everything about this speaker except for one thing.  Unfortunately, the one thing is that it is a complete pain to charge this thing.  There seems exactly one sweet spot where the cord and the speaker connect and will actually charge.  It can take a very long time to find the sweet spot.  Then, it will only hold the sweet spot for a few seconds unless, by some miracle, the forces of the universe align and it will actually charge as it is supposed it. Additionally, this problem seems to be getting worse.  Thankfully it lasts a long time on a single charge so I don't have to deal with this too frequently.
 I’ve had this speaker for not quite two years now and I have to say I really love the battery life. It goes and goes! The problem is that the usb-c plugin (where you plug in to recharge) is messed up and became that way shortly after using it. I have been “making it work” for more than a year by wriggling it in a funny position to get the charging light to come on but now it seems to have gotten worse each time and now it has become harder and harder to get it charged which is a shame because I find this to be a great little speaker in general... one that you can just take anywhere and not have to worry too much about it because the rubbery surfaces are great and it sounds pretty decent too especially for the price. I’m not sure how long  the warranty is for something like this but I’ve had great luck with many Anker products in the past but this one hasn’t really held up as well as I think it should have.<br/><br/>UPDATED REVIEW:<br/>After reading my review above Anker customer service reached out to me and promptly sent me a new speaker! They did this on their own accord. I was not seeking a new speaker, my review above is based on my honest experience with this speaker. Anker customer service is top notch and in fact, I always buy a lot of Anker products knowing they are a great value and if you do have an issue they will practically bend over backwards to make it right! The new speaker is working great, you should get one of these if you’re interested because it’s a great value for what it does and Anker always stands behind every product I’ve purchased from them!
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-RLPA6RAYVFXCK"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A174MV6NLGS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ZobN84uwS.png"/> It was great for about 6 months.  I don't use this speaker very often so I was surprised when one day I heard it constantly beeping.  I realized it was because the usb port had come loose--and was losing charge.  I have to keep the speaker positioned a certain way now to keep the wire connected.  Kinda sucky as I liked the product in general.  Unfortunately, I won't be buying this one again.
 I was looking for a small speaker to connect with my Amazon Echo Dot. I didn't need a BOSE quality speaker, just something that I could use to amplify the sound when I wanted to listen to music. When I first received it, sound quality was good. But now, the sound fades in and out. It is static-y at times, even when it is close to the Echo Dot. And I don't know if this is possible, but it when it plays music, it almost sounds like it is lagging...like the music is playing in slow motion.<br/>The battery life is terrible. I have to charge it every day for 3 hours worth of listening time.<br/>I would definitely NOT recommend this product.
 I had purchased this speaker and it had stopped working just after the return period.  I posted my disappointment, and the customer support team was unbelievable in following up with me and getting me a new speaker!  They really wanted to be sure that I had a working speaker.  They were very nice and sincere.  I am sure to purchase their products again, knowing that they stand so strongly behind their products.  It was a pleasure to deal with them.
 Now LED light goes on and claims to be Bluetooth connected but no sound at all.<br/>I bought it only 3 months ago. It's not the most expensive speaker but I thought it should have lasted a little longer that that!<br/>Too bad because the sound wasn't bad when it worked.
 Originally gave it a one-star review, as it had stopped pairing with any of my devices after 6 months, and had a hard time changing tha pairing between different devices before that. Have to use the 3.5mm cable, which is not what you expect from a BT speaker.<br/><br/>Update: Anker support got back to me and said that holding the + and - buttons will reset the device, and that seems to have helped. They also sent a replacement, which was greatly appreciated.
 I can't sing the praises of Anker and their products enough. I own several other products of theirs (it all starting with their PowerCore Chargers) and they've hit it out of the park on another one. Solid, quality products that are highly functional, versatile and affordable. Live in SoCal and got this for beach / backyard patio / general Bluetooth speaker. Researched a few others including Bose SoundLink / Beats and I found the reviews (and notably the price) to guide me toward buying. I'm SO glad I did. Truly y'all (from the south so no apologies) buy this. Stop your endless pursuit I hear some of you here "but that bass though" "the distance for connectivity." Please. If the bass isn't enough for you, you're A) Out of your mind and setting unrealistic expectations and B) Probably should be looking at more expensive products and not wining about this one. This is solid no matter how you compare it to the competition. Pairing is super simple. Have a 2100 sq ft home and in an upstairs bedroom I can still hear it and it fills a room completely (when placed at top volume limit). Materials are quality and I even got the case ($14.99 or what have you) that they make to go with. Don't waste time or money looking, this is your guy/gal. Trust.
 Hey all. Today I received the newly released Anker SoundCore Bluetooth speaker. I couldn't have been more pumped! I love Anker products and their customer service! Anyway, you're here to read my review and I'll try to keep it short and sweet.<br/><br/>Anker packaged this SoundCore very well. The black cardboard box is actually quite attractive, if a little misleading on the actual size of the SoundCore as its quite a bit bigger. On the inside you'll see the speaker is tucked away behind some more cardboard for protection and to the right, a small cardboard sleeve with your micro USB charger. Immediately I was kind of bummed this speaker wasn't yet using USB-C as it will become the new standard. The speaker is very light, as my similar in size jam box mini seems heavier. It's nicely built and has a good feel in your hand.<br/><br/>Powering on the speaker was a breeze by simply holding the power button. It was ready for immediate pairing so I paired it to my iPhone 6S Plus. I started to play PSY's new song "Daddy" (don't hate on me just yet, OK?)<br/>The speaker was quite loud and completely clear at max volume. "Bass" isn't quite there, but it is clear and not hollow sounding.  However, it gave me a beep and disconnected. My iPhone said it was still connected but the music had paused. I didn't think much of it at first but I wanted to compare sound to my other MUCH used Anker Bluetooth speaker. I've supplied some pictures quickly comparing the two. My square Anker speaker sounded just as clear at full volume, albeit not quite as loud. We're talking maybe a few clicks higher on the volume scale. But, that's OK. The SoundCore is an attractive speaker and it sounds very nice compared to its price point.<br/>I hooked back up to the SoundCore, and I had connectivity issues again, and again. Finally I was able to get half way through the song while keeping my phone, which was a foot away, paired with the SoundCore.<br/><br/>Overall, it's another Anker product which means it is attractive, and built well. Competition in its price range may exist, but Anker carries the brand name I trust. My three star rating is due to my issues that seem to be pausing my music. If I hit play, the music typically resumes.<br/><br/>UPDATE: 12/6<br/>Anker has reached out to me to let me know that the speaker stops playing at loud volumes to protect from hearing / device damage. I exclaimed my dissatisfaction with this as the SoundCore speakers higher volume was one of my biggest reasons for liking this speaker. They told me that a new version would be coming out within a week or two to remedy this fault. I will update my review when i'm able to get my hands on it.<br/><br/>Final update 12/28/2015<br/><br/>I received my new SoundCore speaker and I am happy to announce that this new speaker does not have the audio issues my first speaker did. The speaker is able to go to full volume while continuing consistent playback with great sound for a speaker at this price. There are no notable differences between the two speakers other than my original issue being resolved. If all of this really was just a "bug" or planned execution to save the speakers and/or prevent hearing damage to just be updated and fixed at a later date, I'm a bit disappointed but I do like the speaker. Ankers customer service has been exceptional and they've been keeping in contact with me all along the way. I've updated my original rating.
 The Anker SoundCore speaker worked well until I let the battery discharge completely while I was traveling for 2 weeks, On returning home, the battery would no longer take a charge turning the speaker into another silent paperweight on my desk.
 My speaker came and it was absolutely gorgeous. It has a rubberized coating for the body and metallic grill. I purchased the blue model and the color is a very bright blue.  The craftsmanship is very solid.  It is what you would expect for Anker quality.  But that is where it ends. The most important part of the speaker is the sound. I find it The bass very tin like and Max volume is horrible. Refurbished UE speakers are a much better value. I bought this a a discounted price just above $20. First time I am writing “you get what you pay for” in a review. Anker is usually the best value.  Not worth returning and I might just use this at home with my Echo<br/><br/>Update:  Anker customer service is outstanding.  If you want an inexpensive speaker for personal space.  And i mean Personal space... this Soundcore is really nice. Bass is still not really there but what do you expect from this price point.  Outdoor use is still meh for this item. If you need a little more punch check out the soundcore 2 which i believe is a better value with increased volume.  I will be using this inside a conference room and am very happy it includes a mic!
 Worked for three days and all of a sudden I cannot connect any of my devices via Bluetooth which kind of defeats the purpose of having a Bluetooth speaker. Will be returning this one. Hopefully I can get a new one and it will work for me because I really liked this speaker.
 So, this is my first experience with any Anker products. This thing got delivered yesterday and I've been furious ever since. I bought it for background music for my office, so I didn't need anything great or loud, so I thought this $29 speaker would do the trick. The problem is that I spent about $250 on a Braven speaker last year for camping and such, and although I was more than pleased with the performance of that speaker, it is only marginally better sounding, and maybe just a little louder than this Anker speaker. It's also about 3 times as big and has a 12 hour battery life, as opposed to the Anker's 24.<br/><br/>This is probably the best value I have even seen in a Bluetooth speaker. I just wish I would have found this before spending tons of money on others. I would gladly have paid more money for a speaker of this quality.<br/><br/>Is it the utmost in premium quality sound? Of course not, don't be an idiot, it's a tiny speaker that costs under $30... but I think you would be hard pressed to find anything at this price point that comes anywhere even remotely close to the awesomeness you get with this speaker.<br/><br/>I will be buying more anker stuff.
 Why did I wait, this thing rocks! Have only had it for a week, but took it with me on a trip and was fun to have something better than a phone to play tunes while getting ready in the morning. It was small and fairly light so tucked right in my carryon. I sing in a blues band and picky about sound so did a good bit of research prior.  Great for a home office as well and much better than laptop speakers.  This has great sound, you can probably turn it up to about 60% before any distortion begins, so will fill a medium sized room with great sound, but not a ballroom.  It does have an aux input.  I have not tried it outdoors yet.  I do suggest you buy the protective case by Dsall.  and my only suggestion to the manufacturer for the next version, the controls are molded into the rubbery top of the unit and are very hard to see in a dark hotel room!<br/><br/>One thing I did not notice in other reviews, (might have missed it) if configured in your settings, when connected to your device (iPhone 6 for me) your lock screen will give you a notice of the battery life of the Anker as well as your iPhone, so no guessing about how much battery life is left. I have only charged it once and have likely played it for a total of 4 hours over the last week (Bluetooth) and the battery still says 100%.
 I was excited to see a bluetooth speaker from Anker and jumped at the deal. I should have read the product dimensions as this thing is just smaller than a 20-oz bottle of soda. For it's size it does decent with sound, just don't expect a lot of bass. The sound is similar to a small LCD TV speaker. Also, when you buy this make sure you have a USB wall charger as this only comes with a USB cable.<br/><br/>That being said, bluetooth does connect easily and there's no lag when music starts playing or mangling of music in between songs like with some cheaper bluetooth speakers.<br/><br/>In comparison I bought the TDK Trek Max A34 when it was on sale which is considerably larger and has more clear and boomier sounds, but it does cost about 4x as much. I'll use this to replace my JVC OnBeat in the garage.<br/><br/>Update: Customer service is outstanding! I had a couple of conversations with them and they offered to make things right. This is one of the reasons I will always seek out Anker products before any other.
 So I really do enjoy this product when it's functioning (good sound, GREAT battery) but it has a fatal issue! The charging port. Two different speakers are now unusable - not because the sound doesnt work - but because I can no longer charge them. The light doesn't come on or anything. If you take a look at your model, the port you plug your charger into.... looks somewhat cheap probably.<br/><br/>I didn't leave a negative review after the first Soundcore this happened to (Purchased April '16 - Let out its last notes Dec '16) stopped working. I thought maybe it was my fault. I'd had the speaker for 7 months and hey, it dropped a few times or whatever. Maybe that knocked some screws lose? I'll just order another and pay extraaaa close attention... but now with this one, which I've had for about 2 months... the port still LOOKS fine but the light won't come on or anything when I try to charge (battery is so good I've been trying for a full day and it still hasn't died yet but it's about to so the good news ends there).<br/><br/>I've tried with multiple universal chargers/outlets ... no luck. I still trusted ANKER enough to buy another Soundcore PLUS an iPhone charger from them after the first issue... I charged the first mishap to the game and hoped for the best... but that iPhone charger, which is an extremely popular alternative to Apple's, broke after about a month... So, even though I do like this SoundCore speaker when it's FUNCTIONING, I'd be a fool to purchase a third.<br/><br/>Pics are of the first Soundcore with the warbled port (now I just think the port's cheaply/faultily built and it definitely WASN'T my fault), the second Soundcore with the port still intact yet incapable of receiving charge......smh ...... and then both together, with my hand. Best wishes to everyone who's purchased...
 I received this Anker SoundCore today and follow in introduction to charge it before use. The pairing process was clear. I got this paired up to my iPhone 6S and I can see the battery bar in the notification. All the buttons work well ( Skip song, change volume on my phone).<br/>BUT THE SPEAKER DOESNT PLAY ANY SOUND! I tried iPad Pro 10.5, old iPhone 5, roommate Galaxy S7 and all the buttons work except there is no sound at all.<br/><br/>I have several Anker Chargers and lightning cables, they are all good products. Just unlucky got a defected unit.
 worked very well as a speaker, good sound.  but within two months, had significant problems with the charging cord - it would fall out or disconnect if the speaker was touched, if the shelf the speaker was on was touched, or if the floor on which the shelf sat was touched.  now, after five months, will not charge at all - the cord just falls right out.  have tried with at least a dozen cords over the past several months, all with no luck.  now i have a paperweight.  maybe i just got a dud, given all the good reviews, and like i said, it performed admirably when left alone with no one near it and a charging cord actually recognized.  sad that it's now defunct.
 Speaker works great if charged.  Over time the charging port does not connect, therefor not charge the speaker.  The cord will not stay intact.  It is too late to get a replacement.  I will not purchase another since this is a common problem.<br/><br/>Anker, please fix this problem.
 I really like this speaker. My wired Bose Companion 2 OC computer speakers are great sounding, but when I plug them to my iPhone 7, the volume is so low, even when I put both volume devices on max. Not this one, plus this one is Bluetooth, so I can connect it wirelessly to my Apple TV (the only workaround possible if I want to play something through my projector connected via hdmi and have sound coming out that is not limited by the projector's usually low output<br/><br/>My only thing is that after both my iphone and the Apple TV has paired and worked with the Anker, I can't just re-select the Anker to whichever device immediately, I have to first "forget" the device, re-pair, and turn off/on the power to the Anker every single time I switch. When I tried to just connect the little thing would just keep on spinning. Both my phone and Apple TV have updated software. I might just have to get another one to have 1 dedicated speaker for my phone, and the other one for the Apple TV
 You get what you pay for. It’s an ok speaker fir the price. It’s loud without distortion, and you can hear the mids and highs fine but you’ll only get a faint whisper of lows and bass. Based on the reviews I read before purchasing, I was hoping for average bass but there is none.  I’m returning for something more my speed<br/><br/>If you’re looking for a entertaining, party speaker,  you’ll be able to pop to the beat but you won’t be able to drop to the baseline because you won’t hear it.
 Another excellent product from Anker. The product itself feels At first like it might just be hard plastic casing coated in that soft touch coating a lot of products use to make you think they are premium - it's actually a soft silicone rubber that probably won't scratch or rip! The sound is about what I expected. It's not going to make you feel bad about buying a Bose or other much better Bluetooth speaker, but for most listening it's perfect. There's not a lot of low end, but the sound is clear and you can hear everything in the songs you play as intended. One annoying thing is that if you press the Bluetooth button by accident it will temporarily unpair from your phone. It would be better if they’d made it require holding down the Bluetooth button like most other stereos - or if the button was harder to press or on the side. For the money it's perfect as an additional speaker for on the go or in another room. I'm mostly listening to podcasts on it in the room I'll use it in, so it's perfect. I'm considering the v2 for taking to the beach etc because it's more rugged- maybe the sound will be improved!
 It's a fantastic little speaker with *incredible* battery life. The battery life is so long, in fact, that it's actually an issue that it doesn't have a battery indicator! You really don't ever know if it's gonna go out or not - and it never does! This isn't always a huge issue for me, though, as I mainly use it as a simple solution for an external speaker at my desk. You can plug it in for charging and still keep the music going. Also, with it being a modern lithium battery, you can simply charge it whenever you feel like, and the battery life won't be negatively affected. (What, you're gonna miss that extra half of a minute off of a 24 hour battery life?) The sound quality is also fantastic for the size of the speaker and price point. You won't be rattling the rafters or anything, but you also won't really ever feel like you're missing something. The only time I've ever wished it was louder is when I wanted to use it on the counter while I was in the shower.
 My T12 speaker refused to properly pair with my new Kindle. I suppose I could have tried to figure out what was wrong, but I've had the T12 for a few years and it doesn't owe me anything. I'd have bought another one -- it had really excellent sound with quite good bass, but they aren't making that version anymore and I didn't like the others.<br/><br/>I have other Anker product and ALL of them work well, from the smallest inexpensive SD reader to some fairly complicated interface devices. When I saw this at a very reasonable price, I bought it.<br/><br/>It paired with the Kindle instantly and it sound very good. Less bassy than the T12, but it was also less expensive and this one has the advantage of being rather louder than the T12. Since I use it for audiobooks and not music, I'm not all that concerned with bass. This is a good, loud speaker. It charges quickly, pairs easily, adjusts without complaint. I'm very pleased with it and the price is more than reasonable.
 After your ears become accustomed to it, the sound will seem clear and crisp with depth. It doesn't have booming bass but it reproduces the thumping sound of the bass really well so if it's in a corner it will sound boomy but without any of the actual movement. The battery life is RIDICULOUS. I gave it a full charge and got over a week play time while playing via bluetooth at around 5 presses below max volume for about 10 hours a day. The volume on my phone is usually right at the orange bit where it warns you about playing for too loud etc,
 I noticed that the "in" gift this holiday season are premium quality Bluetooth speakers. Working from home, with a PC, smartphone, and tablet on my desk, having a good wireless speaker seemed a worthwhile investment. The better known brands seemed to be hovering around the $125 - $150 price point which seemed reasonable ... then I started seeing ANKER publicizing theirs.<br/><br/>Already a fan of their chargers and cables, I was more than eager to give their speaker a try - especially at &gt;50% of the cost of the others.<br/><br/>I've already accepted it as an early gift and the 24 hour battery is now starting it's third day after 10+ hours of playtime each day since first charge. The sound quality is impressive and has capacity for a fairly loud maximum. I'm not an extreme audiophile so I can't vouch for high level performance but I do enjoy a variety of musical genres and all come through with a warm, rich depth.<br/><br/>Was pleasantly surprised by its ability to also act as a speakerphone.<br/><br/>A couple of (very minor, wish list) suggested improvements:<br/>&gt; the controls are basic (on/off, vol up and down, and skip track) and molded into the top of the speaker; being the same color they were a bit difficult to find at first;<br/>&gt; it comes with a charging cord but no AC adapter;<br/>&gt; there is no battery level monitor (a red flashing status light indicates low charge); perhaps an app with power status and a basic equalizer to adjust sound?<br/><br/>Beyond these minor items, am glad I thought to gift myself with this.
 No question, was the best speaker for the price!  In short: solid design, long battery life (sometimes I even forget that it runs on batteries), nice button placement, good response (can double press play to skip forward), nice sound (some bass and doesn’t sound like its coming from a can), I do not use it much that way but good enough as a speaker phone (make sure that microphone is placed upright and facing you), water resistant and feels / looks like one (one continuous piece of rubber on all three sides with mesh on front), long range, easy connectivity and good reliability.  Had it for almost a year now and no problems!  We liked it so much that we decided to buy a second one so we did not have to share...:)  Small sidenote: would be nice for the Bluetooth speakers in general to connect to each other to play off of the same music device (just a thought)!
 I bought this base on the great reviews! . It worked amazing the first three months! I thought this is an awesome product for such a low price, but .... After three months exactly this anker speaker stopped working. I doesn't charge at all, i though the problem is the charger cable so I got a new one, but nothing. It just doesn't charge. I can't even return it because it passed 3 months. Waste of money. I would suggest to spend a little more in a durable speaker.
 Update to 5 Stars: Anker Direct Customer Service sent me an upgraded replacement Anker Soundcore 2 Bluetooth speaker in the mail within a week of learning about my faulty speaker. The new Soundcore 2 is more sturdy than the previous generation, with rubberized edges and tiny bead legs to give it stability on most surfaces I've tried. It just feels well made.<br/><br/>The sound quality, (which was the reason I gave the original speaker 3 stars) is now one of the deepest and clearest audio output devices I own. Everything comes out clear and without static or scratching. I can use it in the office or outside when I do yard work. The volume buttons are clearly labeled, along with the power and Bluetooth button.<br/><br/>Overall this is an exceptional device and an amazing customer service experience with Anker. I would recommend any of their speakers or battery charging bricks.<br/><br/>The product I received was very well designed and sturdy. My intention was to use it as an office desktop speaker for ambient background music throughout the work day. It connected easily and I was excited to play some tunes, but the sound out put was clicky and static filled. After tinkering with the volume buttons on the device, (which are very user friendly) I realized that the speakers weren't able to play music much louder than a whisper. I don't believe this was it's intended design, but ultimately if the speaker isn't able to output a reasonable volume for music it is basically useless.<br/><br/>Aside from that I thought it was a well priced product. Anker portable battery chargers are awesome too!
 I have always been impressed by Anker's charging devices and have never had any bad experiences with their products. I recently got this speaker because i work in IT for a school district so it is nice to have music during the summer when i'm alone in the school working on things.<br/><br/>Sound Quality and Bluetooth:<br/>  The bass is very clear even in heavier songs. It can get muddy if you turn the volume all the way up but that is to be expected with most devices. The mids and treble sound is excellent and is only muffled because i keep the speaker inside a backpack pocket with the zipper undone. The bluetooth range is hard to beat. The majority of use is in brick buildings so I expected to have some trouble. I can freely move from one room to the next without having to deal with the speaker cutting out. I tested to see what the range was and I got down a full hallway (at least 100FT) and the speaker cut out when I turned the corner.<br/><br/>Size:<br/>  The design feels good in your hand and is very minimalist so it seems to fit in wherever it is placed. The plastic does like to attract finger prints so if you are eating a greasy burger make sure to wipe your hands on your jeans first or you are going to have very visible prints on your speaker.<br/><br/>Battery:<br/>  Battery life is exactly what you would expect from Anker. It has survived for a full week with a daily use of about 5-6 hours a day and is showing no signs of dying. And the battery comes with charging cables that are plain black but are Anker so they are the best ones you can get your hands on. I use these cables for almost everything I can.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>  For the price (I paid $25) I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again. Even for the MSRP or a higher price I would recommend purchasing it. For most use cases this is going to be what you need and is going to impress you every time you turn it on.<br/><br/>Notes:<br/>  If anything changes I will edit. Otherwise the above is 100% true.
 I was torn between getting the Anker SoundCore vs the Cambridge OontZ Angle 3 as both products were top sellers on Amazon and received great reviews. So I bought both to try them out. Both of these speakers are very compact, easily pair with my devices, and produce reasonably good sound in its price range.<br/><br/>I tested these speakers by streaming the same music from my Amazon Fire HD 8. After trying out a few music and audio, I concluded that the Anker SoundCore actually produces clearer and fuller sound in comparision. Neither one produces impressive base which is sort of expected given the small size of the speakers. Since the speaker is very compact, I can carry it with my Fire HD to places and enjoy better audio with it. The only slight drawback is that it does not seem to have an auto shut-off function.
 These sound very good, and the battery outlasts any other I have found. I charge mine less than once a month, and it travels everywhere on the dash of my car.<br/><br/>So far, I have left it out overnight in the rain (twice), and cooked it on the dash of my car many times.  It's still working fine.<br/><br/>Given that Anker makes so many battery-booster products, I don't know why they don't put a port on this to allow you to recharge your Bluetooth device...but it won't. You can hook them together, but that ain't gonna charge your phone.
 Just received it today. First impressions are "I'm impressed". It's beefy enough to feel quality and well made. Bass is more than adequate unless your a music connoisseur. Using my call phone via Bluetooth was excellent. Connecting to Bluetooth was effortless. Volume was all I'll ever need. Unless time and use causes a reduction it presently gets 5 stars from me.  UPDATE: my job entails a lot of waiting. So, I occupy my time by using my call phone making calls it watching YouTube. The speaker has worked flawlessly. I can hear the other party very well and they hear me well. As you know some videos on YouTube aren't loud enough, this speaker amplifies enough to overcome those issues. Buy this! For the money it's excellent.
 I bought this Anker sound core Bluetooth speaker in June 2017. I bought it to match up with my Apple iPad Air, and it worked perfectly. I then bought  an Apple iPad Pro and thought I was having trouble with the Anker. It  wouldn’t match up with my iPad Pro.  I emailed Anker and they responded within 4 to 5 hours.  Their response was so positive that I couldn’t help but appreciate Anker’s interest in the product as concerns the customer satisfaction. Then I tried a new route and found that it just took a switch to switch on the Anker in the iPad Pro, and lo and behold it worked perfectly for my iPad Pro. I can’t thank Anker staff enough for the willingness to help me. This product is very good and I really use  it all the time.<br/>A little small, the speakers work well, And I’m very satisfied with the product. And I know you will also like its performance.
 Update: After 7 months of pretty much non-stop play, every day, it no longer connects to my phone. Which, is nearly 5000 hours of playtime. Which I was very happy with. So if you listen to things constantly you may wear it out.<br/><br/>Sound Clarity for voices is about an 85%. Certain pitches and treble heavy sounds are where this speaker fails.<br/><br/>Also, depends on who you're talking to. The Mic for calls is not consistent in how it'll perform.<br/><br/>However if you're using it for subliminal and vibrational recordings or just nature sounds it rocks. This is my use for it.<br/><br/>The speaker has played over 18 hours straight without dying. It has not died in the month I've had it and it plays all night and most of the day. The 2 hour charge time is a maximum. Usually finished before then.<br/><br/>The form factor is a brick. Always sits level and easily tucks into a pocket as a companion on a walk. You can walk and talk from a front pants pocket as an optimum scenario.<br/><br/>Speaker has call answer and end functions with the play button. Play will answer a call and end it when you're done if you so choose. I'm not sure if that's listed in the instructions. Really this feature is good if you want your phone charging away from you but to answer calls while washing dishes.<br/><br/>Main issue with the speaker is imperfect sound. But at under $30 unless you opt for colors, with 24 hour play time...you get tons for the dollar. But no, probably not a speaker for Classical Music.
 This speaker sounds great. It as some chamber in the middle which adds a decent amount of bass for the size. It's also pretty cool because it makes a puff of air every time the bass hits. The best part about it is that it lasts all night long, great for dorm parties. It's not the best sounding, or the loudest speaker I've ever heard, but no other speaker lasts as long. If you put it on full blast before you go to bed, it's still gonna be blasting when you wake up. If you only use it occasionally, your gonna forget it ever needs to be charged. This is probably the only speaker that actually lasts LONGER than the manufacturer claims it will. As of writing this review, I've had it for over a year ands it's still going strong. If you need music for a dorm room, or an apartment, this is perfect.
 Showed up and didn't work so I never found out how it sounded. I assume it probably sounds good. it had a nice weight to it.<br/><br/>Revised:<br/>So, anger apparently monitors their reviews because shortly after writing this a 2 Star review they contacted me directly. They sent me a FREE upgraded version of this speaker, the Soundcore 2. Holy crap does this sound great! I was keeping my eye on an Altec Lansing of the same size. They run 50-70. The soundcore can cost 30-40 and honestly this thing is nice and loud. Pretty deep bass and high frequency for the size. Yes I listen to EVERYTHING. (U2, Kendrick Lamar, Led Zeppelin, Beyoncé, French jazz, NIN, Drake, Daft Punk, all of it) after just a few songs I think this is an incredible deal! I’ll see about the water resistance and the battery life soon. I had to turn it up to the point where it was TOO LOUD to get any inclinations of distortion. I haven’t heard anything this good for so inexpensive. I turned it on in my open downstairs house and it filled the living room and kitchen with plenty of sound. More than enough for an office, bedroom, shower, trips where you want to take a small stereo, or medium sized space. Not just ok but really good. I swear it is identical sound power of my Echo. I know there are nicer devices out there for more but I don’t want to spend $200 on one of these new devices that has too many applications that might not be supported in a few years.
 This is my second purchase of Anker's Soundcore Bluetooth speakers...My wife kept "swindling" mine, so I bought her one of her own!  These little speakers are phenomenal and really "pack a punch" for their size!  Originally, I purchased my first one to mount on my ATV, but never actually installed it, because I found more uses for it around the home (in my garage etc)...I am going to try and link it with my Amazon Firestick, to see if I can run Bluetooth through my TV and enhance our TV's audio.  I'm not too "Techy" but am going to try and see if it will work through there.  We are very pleased with our purchases of the Anker Soundcores!!
 I have been using my Anker Soundcore for over half a year and I love how versatile it is. My (old) car doesn't have Bluetooth available, just the radio and CDs, so this speaker fills my car with sound when I can't take any more of the local radio stations or I can't find my CDs. The best part is that the music doesn't stop when I turn off my car lol. I also used to ignore incoming calls while driving, but now this also makes it possible to take those calls, even on the highway. It's the perfect size and shape for toting around in a large bag and the battery is plenty for me: normally my phone dies well before it. It improves chores because I can bring it along in a bag while I'm moving around and the sound just keeps flowing. I love Anker products, and this is definitely one of my favorites and best purchases! I'm no sound quality guru by the way, but I think the bass is just fine, maybe a tad light, but then again, for me, it's purpose is to serve as a portable speaker so I am not seeking high quality sound. I find it better than cellphone and laptop speakers, and comparable to my old iPod radio docking station speakers if that helps.
 Maybe five stars is a little high, but this speaker is a great mate for my Echo Dot.  The voice even sounds the same through this speaker, just louder.  I tried the Mokcao Power+ and the concept of inserting the Dot and the appearance are very cool, but the speaker is very harsh and shrill and my ears did not like the instant ear fatigue that comes from overly bright speakers.  The one thing you can say for the 20 watt Power+ is that it gets very loud, but as I said it's hard on the ears.<br/><br/>The Soundcore sounds great and may not have a ton of bass, but it's a far better choice for me than the Mokcao.<br/><br/>Quick update:  while the speaker may not be the best for music it handles voice very well and is great with my Dot, which I use primarily for live talk radio and podcasts.
 I bought this speaker in mid July to upgrade from a little (but ultimately too little bluetooth speaker) for my kitchen. Space is at a premium in my kitchen, but if I can't hear my podcast over the sound of me washing my dishes, then it is not loud enough. So, for the basic check, yes, it is certainly loud enough to be heard over the sound of me doing the dishes. It is a solid little speaker with pretty good range and a nice velvety finish that makes sure you have a nice grip.  I chose to write my review now, in December, after all of these months because today is a momentous occasion. After charging the speaker to full capacity directly after purchasing, today--5 months later--the speaker has indicated for the first time that it needs to be charged (by a softening of the music and gentle tone every few minutes). After using the speaker multiple times a week for multiple hours each week I vowed to not write this review until the battery actually needed to be charged. Today is the day. I wholeheartedly recommend this speaker. If you are in the market, look no further.<br/>ETA: August 2018-over a year after purchase--is when it needed to be charged for the second time. What a great speaker
 I really wanted to like this speaker, but it does not work with Echo Dot 2. There are several seconds of silence at the beginning of every sentence when Alexa starts talking, which means I cannot hear what Alexa is saying for several seconds. It works and sounds great (except for the beginning) for a continuous stream such as playing music, but I bought it to use with Alexa mainly. The customer service is great, they sent me a replacement speaker to try right away, but the replacement does the same exact thing. It also does the "silence" issue with both Bluetooth and Aux mode. I tried other much older speakers that I already owned on the same Echo Dot 2 and they work fine, so the issue isn't with my Echo Dot 2.<br/>I'm sorry for the bad review, but I had such high expectations for this speaker and instead spent many days troubleshooting my Echo Dot 2 and the speaker.
 If it didn’t have that loud annoying beep at it’s highest volume and also when the song changes it beeps so loud that it’s ear piercing and causes me to have light migraines. Ruins the moment of listening to your favorite songs especially the relaxing ones. The speaker is very well built. The sound quality is superb and ideal for me. Bass is sufficient for my taste but I just couldn’t stand that loud beeping letting you know it’s at the highest volume. I honestly have never owned a BT speaker  that did that so idk what the purpose of it is. Please remove it. I don’t know if anyone else experienced this with theirs? I have their earbuds as well and it does the same thing. It’s more tolerable because it isn’t as loud but still unnecessary in my opinion.<br/><br/>UPDATE 3/31/18:<br/>Anker has amazing customer service in my opinion. They’ve reached out to me after reading my original 3-star review and offered me to try their Anker Soundcore 2 at no charge. I agreed and have since received it. I’ve been using it for the past few weeks. it’s a decent speaker and again, well-built. Oddly, I prefer the quality of sound on the one that made the loud beeping noise than the 2 and the original one is smaller. Still a great speaker but lacking bass. The Oontz Ultra Plus is my ideal BT based on sound but the connection was not in sync. The speaker was .05 seconds behind the YT videos  played on my phone so I had to return that as well. They haven’t reached out to me or anything at all so Customer Service points definitely is WON and deserved by Anker. This is what you call Good Business Practice.  I commend them on their commitment to their products and most importantly their customer. (Which makes perfect sense if you want to be a successful and trusted company.)
 This speaker is very nice but only in limited capacity ie cell phone or computer use. For regular listening it's just too small and not loud enuf. I use it on my echo dot and it's just OK. As soon as I want to listen to something that needs volume it bottoms out and starts beeping. Still for the money it's a good PORTABLE speaker.<br/>UPDATE: Anker Direct customer service contacted me about my mediocre experience. They offered me a new upgraded SoundCore 2 speaker at no charge. The new speaker arrived quickly and was amazing. Almost triple the speaker wattage, huge bass more mid range and plenty of volume. I was truly impressed<br/>The bottom line is Anker is a consumer centric company, and what started as an OK experience turned into a great experience.
 Bought this speaker for my girlfriend in July 2017. She loved it...used it daily and it sounded great. It held a charge quite well considering the amount of usage.<br/><br/>Apparently, the warranty and the functionality go hand in hand. The speaker died last week. Just a few weeks after the warranty expired. I have completed all of their troubleshooting steps but nothing works. The speaker just cycles between connected and disconnected regardless of the paired device.<br/><br/>Moral of the story? If you plan on buying this speaker (or perhaps any Anker product), take advantage of the Amazon extended warranties because the products life may be tied to the manufacturers warranty.<br/>== EDIT ==<br/>Adding back a couple stars.... to their credit, Anker made this right and we now have a functioning speaker.<br/>Thanks!
 I truthfully have to give this speaker a 1 star. I read the reviews sharing that it can play up to 60 feet away, battery life is long and minimal disruptions. All of that is inaccurate. Patchy sound with the speaker. If you walk near it or around it, it cuts off the sound. I continuously have to recharge the battery daily to make sure the speaker can play. In addition, it doesn't connect to my computer easily. I wish I got another speaker. Unfortunately, I bought 2 of these. I regret this purchase and highly recommend thinking twice if you are considering this. I believe the other reviews are paid for or incentive reviews. Simply put, this speaker sucks bad.
 Bought this speaker end of August, 2018. As of yesterday, January 12, 2019, it no longer turns on.<br/><br/>I never used it while it charged. It was only ever used maybe 3 times a week for no more than 2 hours each time. I literally charged this thing like 3 times the whole time I had it. Now, when I place it on the charger and the red light never goes off. I even tried to turn it on while it was on the charger after a few hours. Still nothing. Kind of pissed.<br/><br/>I never got it wet, never dropped it, and there were maybe 3 different phones that were connected to it, ever. I'm not sure why it's done for.<br/><br/>Buttons were also too hard to press...<br/><br/>If it was still working, I probably would've given 3 stars. The sound is ok for what you pay. But the fact that it only comes out of one end sucks...<br/><br/>Also, the buttons being too hard to press gets really annoying when you have to hit the play button twice to skip a song.. No other navigation buttons besides volume up and down, power, play/pause, and connectivity..
 Update:<br/><br/>The company sent a new one and I am willing to try it. I will keep updating this review if anything comes up. Looks everything good thus far!<br/><br/>I really liked the product thus far, until it dropped the sound level almost half the original after only using for 25 days. I thought it's running low on the battery and charged it to full but did not work. And also when I sync with my Chromebook it does not auto shots off. It was advertised as it would.
 I followed the instructions for pairing with my iPhone XS.  However, the instant I hit play on music, the Anker overrides my iPhone volume setting and turns it to a terrifyingly loud maximum volume, which cannot be adjusted on my iPhone or on the Anker speaker itself with its own volume buttons.  I tried unpairing and re-pairing it, same problem.  The Anker Soundcore will only play music at its maximum volume and there's no way to control that.  I'm not sure if this is what it's meant to do, or if this is a broken unit.  I thought that maybe updating the firmware would fix it, but my Soundcore is not recognized by the Anker updater software I downloaded.  Junk, returned.
 This little guy is awesome.  I'm quickly becoming an Anker superfan. Their products are all high quality and very reasonably priced.<br/>I bought this speaker for an upcoming beach trip, but it's quickly come into heavy rotation everywhere I go.  It's super portable and feels very rugged.  The rubberized metal enclosure feels solid and has a nice, grippy texture.  Anecdotally, I haven't been able to get the Bluetooth range that some reviewers are reporting, but it's been good enough for my purposes.  I haven't done a serious test, but today it seemed like I could only get about 15 feet of range when connected to my phone.  Granted, my phone was outside on the deck and I walked inside the house with the speaker, so I didn't have a clear line of sight.  The sound quality is about average.  It's clear at high volume, but throws zero bass.  For its size and power output, I wasn't expecting much in that regard, and it's lived up to my expectation.<br/>One little additional thing I'll note is that Anker seems to do a great job with its packaging.  It not only looked good and had a premium feel to it, but it was securely cradled with a thick inner box inside the outer package, without any unnecessary foam or extraneous, non-recyclable padding.<br/>Overall, I'm very satisfied with the purchase and would buy it again.
 I bought this primarily to use as a speakerphone. I work from home mostly and have an old Jawbone Jambox I plug into the aux of my macbook and use with my work's conference call software. My phone on my speaker isn't loud enough and the battery dies if I'm on the phone all day. The Jambox started having issues so I bought this Anker as a replacement. The sound for listening to music is decent, albeit thin and tinny. But when connected to my computer for phone calls it doesn't pickup the first 2-3 seconds of another person talking, so I miss most of what they say. Not sure how or why this could be. If I play music it starts right away. But everytime I'm on a call and someone else starts talking I can see they're talking on my conference call software because the mic levels start spiking next to their name, but I can't hear anything, and then all of the sudden it kicks in but I've already missed what they said. Making this totally useless for what I wanted it for. I'd normally give it 3 stars as I realize this is more of an edge use case, but the sound when playing music isn't all that great either compared to the Jambox so putting 1 star as I really can't recommend this for anything.
 Dammit Anker - Is there anything you can't do better than everyone else.<br/><br/>Picked this up because I was not satisfied with my other brick from another manufacturer.  It's audio pickup meant that it was relegated to only using it for a speaker and not a speaker phone.<br/><br/>The speaker phone on this is very clear and usable. I've had no complaints during calls from anyone.<br/><br/>The old brick also had an annoying quirk that it wouldn't allow me to charge it *and* use it with BT at the same time.  I'd have to hardwire it.<br/><br/>I was amazed one day when I had hardwired it to my laptop while charging it from a USB charger when a call came in and my phone (unbeknownst to me) had already paired with the speaker, muted *and* paused the playback from my computer, and let me answer the call through this speaker.<br/><br/>Really cool, Anker.  Really cool.
 Really liking this Bluetooth speaker! The speaker turns on easily and you don't have to press super hard on the buttons. It reacts easily to the phone and isn't a pain in the butt. Very pleased with this speaker and if I end up needing another one this will be brand that I will be getting.
 A friend recommended this Anker Speaker and I'm glad I bought one myself.  Great quality sound for a very affordable price.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>+ Price point - beats spending high dollar on "name brand" speakers.<br/>+ Sound quality - I use this around the house while cooking or hanging out with friends and also set it on the deck porch during the evenings to enjoy a relaxing night.  No matter where the speaker is sitting, it still pushes quality sound.<br/>+ Portability - it's light, small and very portable<br/>+ Charge Life - I've owned this speaker for a few months now and use it weekly and I've only charged it once.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- No comment.  It's been that great of a speaker.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this to anyone.  It may not be a Bose, but for a recreational user that enjoys music on the porch or around the house, go for it.
 Works well as a bedroom speaker to make the Echo Dot usable for music. I have a regular Echo in the kitchen and a Dot in the bedroom. I don't do a lot of music listening in the bedroom, but I like to wake to music, listen while doing housework, etc.  I wanted something that would sound better than the Dot's built-in speaker, but didn't need or want such heavy bass that it would disturb people in neighboring apartments. I first tried the Amazon Basics speaker, but found that too tinny for music listening.  Returned that one and got this one for just a few bucks more. It's noticeably better overall than the Basics speaker, and much better than the Dot speaker. It has some bass but not the level of bass of the regular Echo speaker or good desktop speakers.  I wouldn't use this for any serious music listening, but I think it hits the sweet spot for an inexpensive yet listenable personal speaker in a bedroom, workspace, etc.<br/><br/>My one quibble: the buttons (volume, power, etc.) are are embossed on black rubber and so are practically invisible unless you have a a light shining right on it. (Not apparent on the website photo.)  I had to put pieces of tape on it to indicate where the up and down volume buttons are.  Maybe not a big deal if it's convenient for you to adjust the volume on your device. Just isn't in my case, and I wonder why they didn't at least make the embossing thicker so it would look like it does in the picture. Speaking of pieces of tape: like a lot of bluetooth speakers, this one has an annoying blue light -- but a small piece of black tape solved that problem more or less invisibly and inaudibly. I'm actually a lot more annoyed by the invisible controls than the blue light.<br/><br/>Overall -- good speaker for the price.
 I really like this purchase. Just grab it and take it with you around the house -- even on the ledge above the shower head while keeping the smartphone safe and dry and charging on your desk or nightstand. It also works well for just playing non-Bluetooth sound from my computer on my desktop (via stereo jack) when I don't want to fire up the sub-woofer desktop system. Flip it over on the desk during commercials to almost mute the sound perfectly. For road trips, I sit it below my car's dash behind the steering wheel to play my smartphone with Bluetooth directly toward my face. Or then easily switch to my earbud Bluetooth. The Anker Bluetooth circuitry switches easily back and forth. It's surfaces are rubberized to not slip; perfect size; good sound. Versatile: new uses and ideas daily. I truly recommend it highly.
 I’ve only had this speaker about a week, but so far I like it. Just like the rest of the Anker products I’ve purchased.  It sounds great, paired up to my iPhone 7 instantly and it’s not a chincy, lightweight speaker. It has some weight to it and feels pretty sturdy. I live in a two story condo and if the speaker is downstairs and I go upstairs with my iPhone I haven’t lost the connection. I’ll update this in a month or two with my experience with this speaker.<br/><br/>**** I have to say one thing about ANKER. THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING ****  I’ve purchased about 15 products in the past five years. I’ve only had a problem with one item, a small speaker stopped working after a couple months. I called customer service and explained my situation. Before I got off the phone the customer service rep. requested a replacement. Can’t say I’ve ever had a better customer service experience.<br/><br/>Here’s my disclaimer: I am just a regular customer, never received any free products or any kind of compensation from Anker. I’m just a satisfied customer and want to share my positive experience with others.
 I like to listen to classical music, and small speakers are usually incapable of meeting the requirements for good sound. I am retired and spend at least an hour in the morning in the bathroom preparing for the day. That is the perfect time to listen to classic radio from stations such as WQXR-New York or WCRB- Boston. I have tried many small speakers with little satisfaction. I decided to throw some money at it an buy a more expensive unit. I read the reviews on Amazon and found little to recommend any of the smaller speakers, even expensive Bose units. Everything is designed for heavy bass for current pop music, but bad for classical. The comments on this inexpensive Anker speaker were surprisingly posiitive, so I gave it a try. I’m delighted with the sound quality, compared to all my earlier speakers. The tones are crisp and equally balanced from treble to bass. For the first time I can really enjoy the music. The bluetooth connection to my iPod was easy and the battery lasts several days at least. Highly recommended! And no, the unit is not meant to be waterproof, but I don’t want it in the shower anyway.
 Ordered this as Anker has yet to disappoint- Battery pack portable charger, ear buds, and now this speaker.<br/><br/>Out of the gate, the expectations were high-  Solid look and feel,  Presentation and unboxing is VERY nice-  has a premium appearance to the packaging as well,  As mentioned,  I've previously used other Anker products, and they get great review; plus a solid price!  Arrived Prime one-day and out of the box it paired right up and delivered good sound, without being bass heavy (which was the preference), yet just a little oomph.<br/><br/>IF you listen to bass-heavy music, at higher volumes, you will probably find it lacking the DEEP bass.  For everything else from rock to jazz, you will find the sound far reaching and balanced.  Although, I wish a *bit* more bass was present.  The size is perfect for sitting on kitchen counter or for a backyard patio table gathering.  Good range-  A solid value for the money as with all Anker products.
 So far I'm pretty impressed with this speaker. I've owned it for about 5 days and it's performing great. Music is loud and non-distorted, speakers carry great soundstage, bass isn't great, but everything else is. The battery says it lasts for 24 hours, I've currently played this speaker for over 26 hours (between medium volume and high volume (iPhone)) and the battery indicator states that it still has about 80 percent life. Personally I would say you can get over 100 hours of listening between charge with this speaker. Overall, I would recommend getting a carrying case for this speaker and being careful with it. It is sturdy and built well, but it feels as though if you drop it from a height of 5 feet or more it will shatter. Also, if you plan on taking this speaker to work be careful as to not touch it with dirty hands. It will leave marks on the speaker because of the material, at least this is my experience with the black colored speaker. In close, this speaker is great, audio sounds great and carries a large soundstage, notes are crisp and clean, and the battery can last well over it's rated 24 hour life.
 I purchased this speaker, without reading the reviews and just took the overall rating, at face value at over 4 stars. I have purchased many products from Anker and have always been happy with the product and if there was something wrong, Anker would make it right.<br/><br/>So when I purchased this speaker with a built-in mic I thought it would be great for speakerphone when a conference room didn't have the right phone. I tested this speaker with many phones and the overwhelming feedback I got from the other end of the line was that they could barely hear me. I literally had to hold this speaker like a microphone and directly talk in to it for people to hear. The microphone is located on the right side of the speaker when you are facing it.<br/><br/>I assumed that this couldn't be the way that the product was meant to work and that the microphone was broken. So I contacted Anker, and they got back to me and told me that the microphone was a "side benefit" of the product and not really meant to be used frequently, so I should speak directly in to the microphone!<br/><br/>So now I have to hold this thing like an actual microphone any time I want to use it as a speakerphone. I wish they would make it clear that the mic is there just as an ornament and not really there to be used. They advertise this as a speaker with built in mic.<br/><br/>I am very disappointed with the device and the customer service I have received. I escalated the issue days ago and still have not heard from Anker. This will definitely make me think twice about buying Anker products again in the future. The sound quality otherwise from the speaker seems to be fine for what it is. I just wish I could use this as advertised. I will be returning this item via Amazon.
 So far so good! I bought this to use by our pool because I was looking for a reasonable price and one with long battery life. I have only used this one day but happy with it so far. It touts 24 hour battery life which sounds insane. I have not used it enough to test that limit but in the one day I used it for several hours and no problems...we'll keep using to see.<br/><br/>It looks nice, very functional and does NOT feel cheap. Has nice quality feel to it.<br/><br/>There were some negative reviews on the sound which had me a little concerned. However let's be realistic. Unless you are a hard core audiophile the sound is just fine and look at the price. If you are that particular go spend a bunch more money for a high end unit. The sound power was plenty loud enough to me and I didn't find weak bass as many negative reviews had. Again if you are into high end sound you may not like this but for the money spent you should be expecting something that will cause the windows to vibrate.<br/><br/>Update: The battery continues to run like a champ on this thing, still on its first charge!!!
 I have got to tell you that this Anker speaker is unbelievable.  It is truly amazing how much quality sound comes out of this compact size unit.  I was very involved in audio retail sales back when terms like RMS and THD were every day language in the evaluation of sound systems.  So I do know when something sounds good, and this speaker is a little dynamo!  I have herd less from speakers at OVER three times the price. The highs are crisp and not tinny in the least,  and the bass is not muddy at all.  If you really want the biggest bang for you hard earned dollars then I would not wait,  you will not be disappointed in the rich and accurate sound here.  I don't care it it is pop, rock, jazz or classical music you prefer, it will all sound, not just good, but GREAT!
 This little speaker sounds and looks great, though the first one was D.O.A.--wouldn't turn on at all after full charging. Excellent customer service shipped a replacement immediately, and the new one charged right up and produces clear, strong sound. I am not a serious audiophile, but for my purposes this little unit does a great job.<br/><br/>At first I had trouble with the range being quite short, and said so in my initial review. Anker replied immediately with several helpful suggestions, and it turned out it was my (older) device that was the culprit, not the speaker. The SoundCore transmits perfectly through my whole house when I pair it with my newer device.<br/><br/>The speaker has clear, bright sound, is compact and good-looking, and plays music in every corner of my little house. Customer service for this company is truly amazing and responsive. Five stars from me.
 This speaker worked great, until it stopped charging.  Disappointing, because Anker is a brand I have come to trust.
 The speaker itself is a solid little unit. Sound quality is good, physical size is fairly small, no real complaints here.<br/><br/>The issue I have with this speaker is that when connected (via Bluetooth) to my Mac, the speakers emit a "popping" sound every few minutes (while no sound is being output through the speaker). This does not happen with any other Bluetooth speakers I've used, nor with the laptops internal speakers.<br/><br/>Further, the popping sound persists even when the Mac's audio is muted, so it is originating from the speaker itself.<br/><br/>This sound is very annoying, and is the sole reason for the 2-star review.
 Overall, I like this speaker. It has great sound quality for the size.  For some reason, my speaker was losing power after about 3 hours.  I just ended up keeping it plugged in more often.  One thing I don't like are the buttons on the top of the speaker.  They are not a different color, just raised markings.  They are very hard to see. It's like reading Braille.  I wish they were an offset color so I could see them better.  Otherwise, I'm very happy with this speaker.
 I teach therapeutic yoga and needed a small, lightweight, portable bluetooth speaker to take to client's homes. It also needed to pair easily with my older iPhone 6 so I could use my different playlists. This speaker is perfect. It is small and light enough to pick up with one hand. It easily paired with the somewhat touchy bluetooth function in my phone. The instructions were in every language except English so it took me a few days to take it out of the box and try to get it to work. Be sure to charge it for 24 hours prior to first use. Even without the instructions in English, I figured out how to use it (with a little help from my partner). The symbols on top of the speaker clearly show their function. Press and hold the one on the left and once you hear the sound, you have power (and a light comes on). Press the minus symbol and the volume goes down. Press the plus symbol and the volume goes up. Press the minus symbol and volume goes down. Not sure why you'd need any of the functions other than power since you can control from your device but they are there just in case.  Have only listened to this in my home but it fills a decent-sized room with crisp, clear sound. Turning up the volume does not create distortion although if the speaker is too close to your phone (within 2-3 feet) the sound quality is not as good so be sure to have speaker at least 6 feet from your phone. The icing on this already delicious cake is that this little speaker comes in colors. I chose blue which is a true blue and goes with my home decor. This little blue bluetooth packs a big punch.
 I am very, very pleased with these speakers. The sound is nice and rich. Maybe a touch on the bassy side, but still quite good. If this was a $100+ speaker, the slight bassiness might warrant marking it off a point or two, but at this price it is absolutely within reason. There is almost no noticeable  distortion at all until both your phone and the speaker are at max volume. Even then the distortion is only minor and only at the peaks, and at that point it is putting out a huge amount of sound considering the size of the package.<br/><br/>The battery life is great. I haven't had it long enough yet to confirm the advertised 24 hours but I have used it for over 12 hours of playback spread over multiple days without charging, and it is still going strong.<br/><br/>The 66 foot advertised range is probably pretty close to accurate in open air. Inside it is a bit shorter, but not much. I only start to see the signal break up with the speaker at the complete opposite end of my house from my phone. That is only about 50 feet, but at that point the signal is going through multiple walls, so still pretty respectable.<br/><br/>The physical construction is also outstanding. It is solidly built, with a nice rubberized surface that seems like it will stand up to a decent amount of abuse.<br/><br/>For the price and the size, I really have nothing but good things to say. I just could not be happier with this purchase.
 UPDATE::: I immediately got a response from Anker when they saw my review. I must say that their customer service is one of the best I have ever dealt with. Not only did they work to solve the issue I was having, they offered an upgrade to Soundcore 2. I will definitely be recommending this to my friends and anyone else.<br/><br/>This product arrived at my house on 6/4 when I was out of town. Finally listened to it 2 nights ago. Though I hoped it had a little better bass I thought oh well it was a good price and still sounded pretty good. Today I went to play it through the bluetooth and my songs kept cutting in and out frustrating me to no end. I rebooted my device AND the Anker hoping that maybe it was just a glitch but sadly no, it still did it. I plugged my device directly into the Anker (I purchased it for the bluetooth for a reason) but STILL, it cuts in and out, totally leaving me frustrated. I believe I will be returning this tomorrow. Shame because it seemed like a great buy.
 Started out buying cell phone batteries by Anker... and have ventured into hub, cable and charging equipment.  This was out first venture into a sound product and we are NOT disappointed.  It's great to take on the boat, our ORV, at the campfire and just have in various places around the house while we're working on something.  Once paired with your phone or computer, it works instantly the moment it's turned on.  The sound quality was adequate to use for a meeting room presentation with video...  and is more than enough around the house for general listening.  The volume can be quite significant with not distortion and the base and "EQ" balance is good for multiple music types.
 This is the second one I bought.(The usual problem with Asian products, quality varies a lot. The good units are fine, the poor ones stink.) The first went back because the bluetooth range was ridiculously short, less than 10 feet with no obstructions. This one is much better but not 60 feet. 25-30 is about it but it held that distance through a French door with hurricane glass. That's about average for these type of speakers and is all the distance I need. Battery life is extraordinary, in excess of 20 hours. Pairing with an iPhone and an Echo Dot was easy and re-acquisition was immediate when it was turned back on. Sound quality is very good for a small speaker but with minimal base; you just can't move much air with tiny drivers. Volume is good without distortion until you turn it up towards max. Overall construction is very solid and the rubberized coating has a nice feel to it. BEWARE, the rubber coating does not make it water resistant. The control buttons are large and well marked even though they are the same color as the case. The bluetooth light is slightly off center because of speaker placement but who cares. The charging cable is about a foot long but the mini USB connector is so common now you probably have a longer one somewhere around your house; I did. So bottom line is a fine speaker with the limitations a small speaker has: don't expect Martin-Logan sound quality or big, round base notes but it sure makes an Echo Dot sound really good.
 Are you looking for a portable speaker that doesn’t cost a fortune, yet offers exceptional sound quality and unbelievable battery life? If so, Anker’s SoundCore Bluetooth speaker should be at the top of your list! Whether you’re somebody who travels, loves being outdoors, or simply wants to enhance their audio experience at home, this product provides great value. I originally purchased this speaker solely to enhance the sound quality on my iPad, but ended up using it for so many other things! Due to its design, features, and versatility, Anker’s Bluetooth speaker is one that is sure to meet your unique needs.<br/><br/>Design<br/>The minimalistic design and small form factor of this speaker allow it to fit well into multiple environments, whether that be on your desk, in the living room, or on the patio. Although some may prefer to have multiple color options to choose from, the matte black finish on the speaker does great at hiding any blemishes, while still maintaining the look of a premium product. The rubberized texture, which covers all but the face of the speaker, prevents it from sliding around, which provides a sense of security when placing it on slick or uneven surface. Its rugged and durable build quality has protected my speaker from breaking such as when I dropped it on a bed of rocks while fishing!<br/><br/>Features<br/>For only $35.99, I was expecting the Soundcore to exclude features that some “higher-end” brands had, but this speaker has it all! To begin with, its battery life is simply incredible. After weeks of listening to Spotify, YouTube, and Podcasts, this speaker was still going strong. With a stated 24 hours of play time off of a single charge, it really captures the essence of a “portable” speaker. Next, the ability to connect wirelessly through Bluetooth is extremely convenient. With a short hold of the Bluetooth button on the top of the speaker, your device will automatically pair up. Unfortunately, older devices that do not have Bluetooth cannot use this feature, but it does include a 3.5mm headphone jack for an alternative connection. You can also remotely control applications directly from the speaker by using the volume up/down, power on/off, and play buttons!<br/><br/>Versatility<br/>The Soundcore is truly a multipurpose device. It is small enough to throw in a bag or purse and bring with you everywhere, yet still powerful break through noisy environments. I’ve used it at home, outdoors while fishing and hanging out at the park, and even in the car to connect to my phone! It works with ANY Bluetooth connected device and with ANY music application, and can stand horizontally and vertically, or fit into tight spaces when there is nowhere else to set it. From songs with heavy bass to those with rich vocals, this speaker will deliver.<br/><br/>I’d recommend Anker’s Soundcore for anybody looking for a Bluetooth speaker with the perfect balance of form, function, and price. Through its sleek design, full suite of features, and great sound quality, this versatile speaker packs a punch!
 OK, first, I'm not an audiophile. And a true audiophile probably won't be happy with any bluetooth product. The dynamic range of any downloaded music is just not the full monty. But for what it is, this is an amazing piece of equipment. First, it is so solid, I could probably throw it through a dual pane window and not damage it. It is heavy and robust. It pairs effortlessly and holds the pairing beautifully. The sound is amazingly full and clear. Good bass, great highs. I bought this for travel and it is exactly  what I was hoping for. The long battery life is a great plus. Not having to charge all the time or be near a power source is a great plus. I recommend it!
 I gave 5 stars for sound quality - because it has outstanding sound. But note that this will not fill a room with heavy bass. This speaker works best in small applications, even though it does get quite loud with almost no distortion. Just remember that the bass response is reduced as you create distance between your ears and the speaker.<br/><br/>For my ears, eq settings, and volume, the best distance is under three feet. The sound at that distance is amazing. And yes, the bass is great. It is clear, loud, and full. Yet this speaker also gives high quality throughout the full, hearable frequency spectrum.<br/><br/>Anker produces some great items - and this is one of them. Mine is the model A3102 - black. It looks great and "feels" solid. The body has just enough grip to keep it from slipping and is comfortable to carry in one hand. The bluetooth pairs quickly and stays paired. This speaker runs a long, long time on a single battery charge. I have watched video, listened to music, and listened to pod casts - all with great sound quality.<br/><br/>I recommend this speaker to anyone seaking high quality, portable sound.
 This is the first Bluetooth speaker I’ve owned. This Anker Soundcore is excellent. At first I wasn’t entirely impressed with the quality of sound but it grew on me. What’s most impressive is the volume and fullness of the sound. I use it to substitute the volume on my tablet. I can’t believe how loud I can turn videos or music up without having a weak sound. I use it in one room so for the price it gets the job done and then some. The grill is real on it and the rest of the speaker is made of a soft plastic that almost feels like a synthetic leather. When you pick up this highly portable device it feels like quality. When you can get this for under 30 bucks there should be no complaints. As for the blue light in the center of the grill that indicates it’s on and powered, no complaints. One reviewer complained about the position of it, I can see how this may bother someone who may struggle with ocd. The only complaint I have is yes it is difficult to see the button symbols in the dark. I either turn a flashlight on or desk lamp when adjusting. For a teenager this may be a solid starter speaker but for someone who is middle age , this is awesome!
 I purchased this speaker for my classroom. I teach Sunday school and my earlier speakers (12 years old) were making a funny sound and so I decided to discard them. These speakers had served me well for a long time. I bought this speaker with the hope of replacing them.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the sound volume was very poor and none of the 12 kids in the class could hear very well. When i tested this at home with my windows laptop, the sound seemed adequate. In the classroom I have a google chromebook.<br/><br/>I tried to press the + switch to increase the sound, but there was very little effect. I increased the volume on the chromebook, but the sound was still not loud enough.<br/><br/>The main pros of this speaker are:<br/>1) Bright blue color.<br/>2) Portability.<br/><br/>The cons I faced are:<br/>1) Speaker doesn't seem to respond to the + buttons on the top.<br/>2) Takes long time to establish connection with the Chromebook. (Around 3 - 5 minutes).<br/>3) Sound quality is not good with all sources. (worked with windows laptop and iPhone, but did not work with chrome book).
 I am so impressed with this speaker.  I purchased this to replace an old Logitech speaker, in my bathroom.  I was amazed that the Anker speaker was about 1/4 the size of the old Logitech, but the sound is so much better.  I used to turn my Logitech speaker all the way up to be able to hear it, but this would cause very distorted sound.  This Anker speaker sounds very clear, no matter what volume I set it to.  I think this speaker will be what I give everyone, for Christmas this year.  Another hit product from Anker.  I own a lot of Anker products and have never been disappointed.  I'd like to invest in this company.
 The main reason I purchased this bluetooth speaker was to hook it up to my Echo Dot in my kitchen. I figured the Echo Dot's speaker wasn't powerful enough so wanted something a little louder. When it arrived and I opened the box, I was surprised how small it was. The pictures didn't really show how compact it really is. The whole thing is 6" x 2" x 2" which, if you compare it, is like a Hershey Chocolate Bar nut 2 inches deep. It scared me a bit at first because I thought it would have bad sound at that size, but it is surprisingly powerful and has great quality sound. It sounds like a much bigger speaker than it is.<br/><br/>I haven't tested the battery life of it yet, but I've used it unplugged for a few hours with no problems.<br/><br/>The one thing I didn't think about it is that it didn't come with a charger. It came with a micro-USB cable but not a wall outlet. I guess it's meant as more of a charge and take with you speaker than a leave plugged in speaker, but for the price, I think they should have included a wall charger.
 Got this speaker and was really pumped about it. Barely a month later however, it won't charge, turn on, nothing. I had used it at work the day the before and it worked just great. Not sure what changed within 12 hrs...was a great speaker while it lasted though<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/>I was contacted by their customer service and they sent a replacement that works great! Lena was also very helpful and patient. Everyone at work keeps asking me where I got my speaker and I haven't hesitated to recommend these guys. Found a new company for any future purchases. Thanks!!
 Wow, wow, wow.  I said hey for 40 buck, why not.  Well let me tell you, I am not disappointed.  First, let me start by saying, I know technology and speakers.  So this review won't be fluff.<br/><br/>This speaker is ideal for small to medium size rooms.  The clarity is surreal.  It won't fill up a room with full range sound like the JBL Charge 2+ (which i have) but if you are into classical music, soft listening or music with orchestra type sound, this is the speaker for you. You can even use this in the back yard when doing gardening or cleaning.<br/><br/>I recommend this for anyone who just wants to have great sound around them.  Of course not for throwing huge parties, but if its a small get together, this will work great.<br/><br/>Range is decent when using bluetooth from my Mac book pro (about 10 feet) but when using my cell phone (iPhone and LG G2) the bluetooth range increased to about 20 feet with out drop out.<br/><br/>The only draw back is that it does give me a hard time to turn on.  I press the power button a few times to get it on, not sure why but its a small problem, nothing to worry about.
 Solid construction , great quality , but a little too much bass at times and no way to adjust it and many times it wasn't loud enough and it was on full volume. Many times I wish I could turn it up louder , I do not understand why they do not allow you to turn up treble and voice on this speakers. I know the speaker could handle much more treble and highs but its a great speaker just I really thought it would be to loud in almost any situation but its only loud when your source is very good quality and loud as well.
 Very poor Bluetooth range.<br/>No mute button,  really?  A remote speaker with no mute?<br/>The buttons it has, are nearly completely blended in the color of the speaker and almost invisible, they seem to be just raised, like for the blind.<br/>The low volume only goes so low (not low enough) before going off (except when it doesn't, sometimes holding the minus volume just stops going any lower at all).  Weird.  And no, that doesn't get by as a mute.<br/><br/>It does sound good.  It would seem the big differences between this and a much more expensive speaker like the Bose, are the BT range and the controls.
 I hate this thing. Just to be clear, the sound quality is excellent. But the owner's manual is awful, typifying the usual method of not including a clear narrative, but rather poorly explained illustrations. And the unit itself apparently does not recharge when it's plugged into my laptop. So you have to recharge this thing overnight and if you're lucky, you get a few hours of power before it dies. And then you're screwed until you plug it into a wall socket overnight again. And despite the universal custom of a blinking light meaning "charging" and a solid light meaning "charged," the Anker ignores all that. Finally, there is the issue of the "on" button, the blue light, and pairing the unit to my laptop's bluetooth. Let's just say that it's unpredictable. Read between the lines. As I write this, for instance, the speaker will NOT turn on, despite my having tried to pair several times and pressing the on button. My crime was turning it off five minutes ago, and now it won't turn back on. I am seriously considering sending this thing back for a refund.
 I drive to South Carolina 3 times a year. I like to listen to my tunes during the 16-hour drive but the GPS can be a little hard to hear, even though the music fades. When a call comes in, it pauses the music but then I hafta fiddle with plugging in my headset cuz the microphone on an LG G2 sucks! (That's my one and only complaint about my phone) and if I use a bluetooth headset, the call will take precedence over the GPS and that's potentially problematic 😄 I never even knew about Bluetooth speakers (I'm old) until I looked at accessories for my phone on my wireless carrier's site (they actually told me to find what I want on their site then buy it on amazon). HOLY CRAP the sound quality is ridonkulous and the GPS is very easily heard over the faded music, and we're talking about Megadeth. I just ordered the carrying case. I'm very excited for my next trip.<br/><br/>Update 2/21/18: Um, I haven't had to charge this beauty yet. I use it ALL the time with my phone or kindle fire. I absolutely love this thing! Not one complaint 😀👍
 Good solid sound for such a small speaker. This is getting close to Bose sound quality compared to similarly sized Bose. It's very heavy for its size and I feel that really helps with bass output.  Excellent value at this price.
 Worked great then charging port failed!  Was very pleased with the sound, size, run time etc.  Then the cable started falling out of the charging port.  Using the cable that came with it and tried other cables when the original kept falling out!  DON'T BUY THESE,
 So I had a similar $40 speaker that was WAY too heavy to use for travel (stated it's great for travel online) that finally died.  I decided to spend less this time around and it paid off big time.  Not only is this speaker nicer looking and smaller, it's definitely light weight enough to travel (at least by car).  The sound quality is great considering the price.  Knocked off a star only due to heavy base when playing fairly loud, and obviously you can't control those functions.  The bluetooth works perfectly and I could not be more thrilled with this purchase!
 It has a nice look, it connects reliably, the sound is mediocre. You think you're getting something like a Bose which I have one of, but the sound is only about one-third the quality of the Bose. There is no bass at all.<br/><br/>ANKER contacted me about this review, they sent me a replacement speaker that was the newer model, the Soundcore 2.  It DID have much improved sound.  There was a moderate amount of bass and the overall I am impressed at how Anker wants to ensure that I am pleased with my purchases from them.  Thanks ANKER!
 Anker products, in my opinion, have always been good and this Bluetooth speaker is no different. I bought this one for my dad to use with his laptop since his laptop have crappy speakers and wow this really brings out the quality of videos that he's watched. He also paired it up with his phone and have had no issues, the quality is really nice and so is the battery life! Although, it has been pointed out that there's this humming or buzzing sound when connected with the Aux cable and being charged at the same time and I can attest that it is indeed true. I don't really see it as a big problem since my dad isn't going to use the speaker that way but you might I don't know.<br/>For the price, you can't go wrong with this speaker. It offers good, quality sound, good battery life, it's portable, has a nice matte finish, it's sleek in design and is super simple to set up. If you're looking for an affordable Bluetooth speaker I would say go for this.
 I always trust products from Anker! Honestly they are such a surprise of a company for me.. Everything I buy from them is high quality, works exceptionally well and lasts! This is a great little speaker for the price. It's a great size that fits in your hand, has a nice almost rubber texture so has some grip and just looks really cool! It's quite powerful for the size. Only thing I don't like about it is the straightforward construction of the speakers. It is very directional and doesn't have much of a radius of sound around it. If you're right in front of it and move just to the left the quality of sound significantly drops. Also I feel like the sound is slightly muddy being more bass heavy (although with incredible bass!) but not enough treble. I am a bit of an audiophile so these small things matter to me but it really is a great little speaker overall especially for that price! Love Anker! Worth buying
 Acceptable sound for those places or times when you want to either listen to a digital phone or tablet, or, as in my case, when it is not convenient to use my stereo speakers for the TV.  Sound quality is much better than the tiny speakers in most digital tablets, but is very limited when compared to larger speakers.  Since I live in a condominium with common walls, there are times when this speaker provides adequate sound for news broadcasts or any programs where quality high-fidelity sound is not needed.  One of the very best features of the Anker is that its battery provides nearly 24 hours of playing time.  Many other brands provide only 6 to 12 hours.<br/><br/>If you are going to use the device only as an adjunct to the speakers in your phone, iPad or similar device to listen to music, I would suggest upgrading.  How much upgrade is nearly unlimited in price.
 This little baby has sound that rocks - or, if you're in the mood, soothes. The integrity of the ratio between treble and bass sounds good all through my one-bedroom apartment (about 800 sq.ft.), though if I push the volume too far, it beeps at me. I only tried that once, since I don't want to blow out the neighbors, anyway. I can go anywhere in my apartment and the speaker never fails to pick up the signal.<br/><br/>The aesthetic of the speaker is pleasing in looks and feel, in my preferred color option, RED. The short, black cable it comes with is fine, but I prefer more choice on distance, so opted for two 6-foot, braided red USB cables (yes, with lightning connectors) that look quite snazzy. They also look and feel like they are going to be durable for the long-haul.<br/><br/>I've only had this speaker for a few days, but it's been playing for 6-7 hours each day on the original charge. I am absolutely pleased with these Ankor products and would recommend them in a heartbeat to anyone interested in purchasing a powerful, attractive, terrific-sounding small speaker.<br/><br/>Since I want to be able to use the speaker at home, at the office, and on my travels, I also purchased a co2CREA Storage Travel Organizer Carrying Case Bag for Anker SoundCore Dual-Driver Bluetooth Speaker A3102. Believe it or not, the case easily stows the speaker and one of the 6-foot cables, zipping up without a complaint. And yep, it's also in red, a perfect match.
 How can this tiny little guy pack so much great sound? It's way better than the Inateck Bluetooth 4.0 Portable Speaker IMO excluding the fact it had a stand for your phone. The battery life is amazing. Prob lasts a little over a week for me since I only play it during my workout hours. There's a play back, rewind/forward (press 3x quick for rewind and 2x for forward), volume up and down function and bluetooth button. The only suggestion I would offer to change are the buttons. The entire speaker is black, including the buttons. If they were another color, that would be helpful to see where or what I'm pushing. I'm basically feeling the shapes on the buttons like braille to determine what is what. But overall, I totally recommend this. The shape is cute and perfect for portability. Not heavy at all, but you can feel the sturdiness of it too. Hopefully this will last longer than my old one. The Inateck lasted only a year for me.
 ...several months ago I had initially purchased the OontZ Bluetooth speaker for my 'small' sound needs as the reviews and price seemed fairly good. My advice, skip the 'tinny' sounding, mono OontZ and go for this Anker speaker box! The difference is 'nite-n-day'! I've paired it with my Fire HD on my night stand for evening jazz, classical, and night time relaxing music and it offers superb sound for a device this small - actually much smaller than I expected. No, you'll not get stunning symphonic bass and balance, but you will get enough bass and mid-tones to work in the music's favor... especially at a lower volume. The volume does go way higher than I would ever want bedside, but, again, a lower volume sounds much better so close to one's head. I can see why this might be effective for a porch, deck or outdoor sound device, too. BTW, it comes with a USB power cord only, but I switch off with the same 'plug' adapter cord for the Fire to recharge the battery. Considering the reasonable price, size and sound quality, I highly recommend.
 I love the Anker brand.  I have several of the portable power packs and have been impressed with the reliability and quality of the products.  The SoundCore may be another great product or I may blame a deficiency on the device the Bluetooth receiver is getting its sound from, My Dish Hopper.<br/>The Dish Hopper has a great feature where you can send the audio output from whatever is in the TV to a Bluetooth speaker.  The balcony on my vacation condo is near the 33 foot limit of most Bluetooth speakers.  I bought this SoundCore as it has an advertised 66 foot range and is a product of a brand that I trust.  The problem is that the speaker cuts out periodically; but it does recover after a few seconds.  Is it the SoundCore or is it the Hopper?  I will have to test with my Android over the 4th of July holiday.<br/>The Hopper only transmits the full audio and is not controlled by the volume control in the Hopper remote control.  The Anker SoundCore has the controls needed on the unit.  The unit provides plenty of volume so Jimmy Buffett can play for hours and hours because of the great battery technology the Anker is famous for.
 I just received this little thing today and have used it for less than an hour. I've played some David Bowie (standard rock, 70's style) and am now listening to the Chemical Brothers. This is by no means a full test, but I'm very very pleased with what I'm hearing. I've got it connected to my Nexus 6 phone and am using PowerAmp to play the music if that makes a difference to anyone. But honestly, at this price, I wasn't expecting great sound, just something better than my laptop speakers and something mobile. As usual with Anker products, I'm delighted.
 I originally bought the sound ore one. After posting an honest, but not super favorable review of my thoughts on the product I was notified by a costumer service rep from anker. They said they read my review and were committed to absolute costumer satisfaction. The rep asked if it would be ok to send me the Anker soundcore 2 at no cost in hopes I would be more satisfied with that product. I thought yeah right, but a few days later low and behold there it was another speaker. So I tried it out and was actually very impressed!!! The quality was a lot better it felt more durable had better sound quality and was water resistant to boot. So not only was I happy with the product I was amazed by the effort made by Anker to ensure I was a happy costume. For that I will be a loyal costumer from here on out! Cheers
 At less than thirty five dollars, I knew I wasn't buying a high end product with amazing sound, but I had hopes. The sound is decent - it's not going to wow anyone, but it fills a moderately sized room... moderately I suppose. The controls are simple and connecting it up is pain-free. The rubber surround is nice and protects it from scrapes and whatnot from moving it around.<br/><br/>The big knock is that it randomly loses the Bluetooth signal and abruptly stops playing. This happens roughly once every half-hour or so, just enough to be a pain. Luckily, I'm not DJing my kid's wedding or delivering a state college commencement speech with it or anything else mission critical when it loses the connection and stops playing. It did stop once smack in the middle of the Abbey Road medley, which was jarring enough. While I haven't read many other reviews with this problem so I'll double check on my end, but my phone is placed right next to the speaker with the speaker plugged in via USB.
 Update: 6/1/2017<br/>Today around 18.45, I received my replacement and to my surprise, Anker actually gave me a brand new speaker.  Also their got the color right too. WOW!  I thought I will be getting a refurbished unit but Anker really are backing on their products and taking real good care of their customers.  I am very impressed and I encourage buyers support such a company because these days big and established company just couldn't be bothered with their customers support department which is a shame. 3 CHEERS and Hooray for Anker! Thank you Anker!!!  x3<br/><br/>After 11 months of use, it started to have charging issue and therefore I had to contact AnkerDirect. To my surprise, Anker responded quickly and the solution they offered was very good and at the same time very polite. I was very impressed because the last time I contacted a well known company but their support department was so rude. I felt so loved by Anker and they take care of their customers with respect and trust. Company like such are very hard to come by these days. Thank you Anker for trusting and listen to customers. Thank you x 3
 UPDATE 2/17: This speaker is still a very solid speaker, and the battery life is still phenomenal. The reason I took off one star, is the lack of function buttons on it. There needs to be forward, backward, etc buttons on it. There is plenty of space on it for them. The Play button is very hard to push twice to skip a song, impossible to hit three times to go back. Overall the buttons are not very easily pushed, the double push really makes it noticable. I still like it for the great battery life and the decent sound, but it isn't quite a 5 star product.<br/><br/>Awesome speaker for the price. Was looking to upgrade the speaker I keep in my bathroom (one of those cheap round speakers) since the battery was terrible. I searched for a long time and found this one. I have other Anker products that are awesome and this one doesn't disappoint. Sounds great and have yet to have to charge it after a month of use. Even took it down to the dock at the Lake and it still sounded great when we were far out in the water.
 Original: Anker’s Product has always been great and the quality of the sound is amazing. But the connectivity of my speaker has become so horrible after months of using. I contacted them for over a week for my warranty claim, I assumed for Chinese New Year reason, there is no response, or that the warranty claim is a fraud. It is frustrating time and time again dealing with Anker products that broke over time.<br/>------------------------------------------------------<br/>Update: Anker staff was very friendly and explained that a week of delaying response was not intentional but a system glitch. They handled it very professionally, and this item continues to perform so well. I highly recommend it. The quality and duarability are both awesome, be aware that its waterproof ability is not one hundred percent. I now keep it in my home mostly and believe it will last long!
 A couple of things:<br/><br/>1) Yes, this product is amazing - great sound quality and value for money.<br/><br/>2) More importantly, Amazon has an issue with fake reviews designed to manipulate products' ratings. This seems to be particularly prevalent for this kind of speaker. So, I wish to pass on a piece of advice that I got from another Amazon customer: When thinking about getting a highly-rated product, click on some of the customers that gave it 5 stars and have a look at their other reviews. If a number of these customers gave 5 stars to every product they reviewed, this should be a warning. There are speakers with a better rating, but those ratings seem to have been manipulated.<br/><br/>These are my thoughts. I think Amazon could do more to prevent this kind of thing.
 I have been using this for a few months now on a daily basis and lets just say it works good and they definitely didn't understate the battery life. I haven't killed it yet despite running it for probably close to 20h without a charge at 50-75% volume. Just keep an external cell phone battery handy as your speaker may last 24h but your cellphone probably won't streaming.<br/><br/>As for sound quality I would give it 5/5 for the sound from something so small and the price. The audio comes in very clear with no distortion, but it lacks bass. If you turn it up to max and play a base heavy song though it will puff out air as if it had a tiny sub-woofer which is quite amusing. The dual speaker for the stereo sound takes a bit to get used too as they are so close together it sounds a bit weird but that is a design limitation for such a small device so I will not knock it a star for that or the bass as I knew about both before getting it.<br/><br/>In terms of build quality it's solid and build like a tank, nothing about it feels cheap.
 I have been nothing but thrilled with this product from day one. For the price you could never beat it and frankly, I am surprised by some of the poor reviews a few people have left about the sound quality. For 99% of the world population, the sound quality coming from such a tiny inexpensive speaker could not be better!<br/><br/>Battery Life - I have never timed it, but I am always surprised that it is still on after hours of use without plugging it in.<br/><br/>Blue-tooth - Works well, I use it primarily paired with an Android phone and never have issues.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that you can't plug it into a computer via USB to use as a sound device. There are no supporting drivers that I have been able to find. And to make it a little annoying, if you do use it with a computer via audio cable and try to charge it from USB on the computer, it causes a hissing noise.
 Edit: Their Customer Support quickly contacted me, and offered to replace the device, no questions asked.<br/><br/>I bought this speaker almost 5 months ago, and overall, it’s a nice speaker. The sounds is great, the battery life is amazing, and it’s compact. I charged it when I first bought it, and used it regularly for 3 months without needing a charge. At the end of this period, it stopped playing music, so I assumed it needed to charge, even though the icon on my phone showed it with about 40% charge. I plugged it in and left it for the night, and the next day I turned it back on and tried connecting my phone. I realized I couldn’t connect my phone to the speaker, no matter what I did, even though my phone would connect to every other Bluetooth device I had. At this point, I came to the conclusion that the Bluetooth of the speaker had somehow broken (after 3 months of never dropping it or taking it anywhere). I’ve owned several Bluetooth speakers, all of which I would consider to be much lower quality than this speaker, and I never had an issue with them. I haven’t looked into the issue very much, so I’m not sure if this is a common problem, but it is really disappointing to have such a nice speaker fail on me.
 I have been looking at options for listening to my music and this option was a new one for me.  Definitely uncharted territory for me but I decided I would try it.  It arrive fairly quick even with delays due to weather.  I read the enclosed pamphlet and the instructions where pretty simple.  Charged it up for recommended time and then synced it with my phone no problem.  For someone who is entering the digital world with resistance the process was fairly painless.  The sound is good and I like the fact that is small and portable.  I have ordered the travel case for the speaker and an aux cable just in case I want to connect to the speaker via a cable.  Still waiting on these two items.  All in all price vs. function and what I end up with it is perfect.  Not as hard to do as I had thought it would be.  I would recommend this to others as a great option.
 At first, I was skeptical of the speaker. I also read through almost all of the reviews just to be sure (I like to be extra sure of my purchases).<br/>When I got it, I was pleasantly surprised. I've gone through my fair share of Bluetooth speakers and I really like this one. Although it doesn't have the bass feedback I would like, I'm still happy with what I got. I bought another one for my sister because I liked it so much. It is no beats speaker, but the quality is better than the others ones being sold at this price.<br/>The loudness of this speaker is good. Also the range of the Bluetooth and the sound it carries is exactly with the description.<br/>The battery life is no joke, I've been using it for a few hours every day for the past two weeks and it still hasn't needed to be charged.<br/>In other words, I will definitely be buying anker products and would recommend to my friends.
 This was a superb Bluetooth speaker during the first 2 months.  I was thrilled with the quality of sound for both speech and music and videos.<br/><br/>  After that, the sound clarity began to dim gradually.<br/><br/>Now, after many months of use, I'm not impressed.<br/><br/>Recently, it got to wear it lost its pairing with my computer and can NO longer be paired with the computer.<br/><br/>I'm very disappointed.  Initially, I had given it a 5 star review.  But I cannot do that any more.<br/><br/>It has never been dropped or damaged in any way.  It's just fizzling out for some reason.  I don't know why.<br/><br/>I'm stuck with it though.<br/><br/>The only up side is that it does okay, but not perfect, for telephone conversations.  I have to have it within 20 inches of my face to have a clear conversation now.
 First, let me start of by saying, the sole reason I decided to leave a review and one of the several reasons I have been so impressed with this particular speaker is the absolutely incredible battery life. Anker advertises 24-Hr worry free battery life and I can safely say they aren't wrong. In fact, they undershot themselves by a pretty substantial amount. I have been using this since January 25th, it is now April 4th and I have STILL not gad the charge it. I don't even know how that is possible. I use this at work and it usually runs for at least 2 hours a day. I use it at least 5 days a week. You do the math. My co-workers have enjoyed it so much that they asked me where they could get one and at least one of them has bought one.<br/><br/>The sound is superior to any speaker under $50. I have friends with much more expensive speakers and they now have buyers remorse because they can't hear a difference. If all you're concerned about is how it sounds, stop reading and just buy this speaker! Now, one reason I am sure this speaker is cheaper is because it lacks any extra features that some other more expensive speakers have. For instance, I've seen some with FM Tuners or 3.5mm jacks. You're not going to get any party modes or EQs with this speaker. I  am personally OK with that, those aren't really seatures I even see people use regularly and most phones can handle those functions anyway.<br/><br/>The build on this speaker is unique in that it's constructed with metal, but has a rubberized casing. This is beneficial though, as it makes it easy to clean and gives in grip on smooth surfaces. The build certainly helps improve the sound and protects the speaker from fall damage. The newer model has even added waterproofing if that's something that interests you.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this speaker enough. If you're looking for a speaker with impressive battery life and even more impressive sound, you've found it.
 I wanted decent sound, easy portability, long battery life, farther connection distance, and Bluetooth connectivity for primarily office and in-home use. This speaker gave me all I needed in large square footage. I've never lost connection due to distance.<br/><br/>I am not an audiophile, but after having an <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Altec-Lansing-iM-237-Orbit-Ultraportable-Speaker-for-MP3-Players-Silver/dp/B001ELK2NY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players (Silver)</a> that has incredible sound depth for the size, I find most portable speakers falling short. (If I could replace my orbit, I would, but its predecessors didn't measure up.) This one doesn't reach that depth I miss, especially in the low end, but it sounds better than most others I tested before buying. And ultimately, it is a portable Bluetooth speaker. I don't expect high-end sound out of this kind of product. I got lucky with the orbit.<br/><br/>The speaker gets fairly loud. I don't play it at full volume in my office, however, it would not be loud enough if I were entertaining friends outdoors where sound gets swallowed by the trees. Overall, I'd rate this a 4.5, but since I can't do a half star, I bumped it up to 5 for the overall pros at a good price.
 Absolutely amazing. Delivery was on time, and I've been using the speaker ever since. Incredible sound quality, works with a multitude of devices, and with a no-nonsense interface of only 5 buttons that's incredibly easy to use. Volume goes up really high, which is actually pretty surprising given the size of the speaker. I was able to feel the air itself distorting around the face of the speaker when it was near or at max volume. I only have a few issues with the device however. First, the range. 30 feet sounds like a lot, and it is, but the signal starts to drop intermittently  (for me at least) around 20-25 feet away.  Next, the battery- 24 hours is a great vattery life for something so small, but the cable that comes with it is kinda.... short. It charges with any micro usb cable, so if you have an android phone or something that problem solves itself. However, even at 24 hours of life, it CAN take a little bit longer than expected to fully charge. Also, if you want s protective case for it, that'll run you another $10 or so, which... can be an issue for some people.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm incredibly happy with the product, and would recommend it for anyone looking for a good Bluetooth speaker at a good price. Mind you, I got mine during black friday/ cyber monday, so it was about $14 off if I remember right. Still, a damn good speaker.
 UPDATE 2: Changed my review from 2 to 4 stars for the quick and satisfactory response from the customer support team from Anker. Since I bought the speaker outside the USA, shipping the defective one wasn't possible. So they offered me a refund. I was so pleased with their customer support that I got a powercore from them. And of course, I wasn't disappointed. Excellent company. Looking forward to getting more of their products.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>After using the speaker for a while I noticed something quite annoying: the speaker would disconnect from my Motorola phone and it would go on a connecting/disconnecting loop for a while. I haven't learned how to keep the speaker from doing that, but it's quite annoying. I have to disable/enable bluetooth and/or turn off/on the speaker. This happens with the phone being less than a meter of distance (less than two feet) of the speaker.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>  - Good quality for the price, especially the bass, which was a nice surprise.<br/>  - Awesome battery (24 hours at 80% of volume)<br/>  - You can even answer the phone with it (it has a microphone)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>  - If you place yourself between the phone and the speaker, the audio stutters. I also have a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones  ( the Motorola Buds ) and they have way better range. I can move around my apartment with no issues and audio experiences stuttering only if I have at least 3 walls between me and the phone. So the range theme was a bummer.<br/><br/>Wishlist:<br/>  - It would be better if it was water proof.<br/><br/>Other than that, the speaker works great, pairs quickly, it feels nice to the touch
 I have chronic neuro Lyme related sound distortion disorder. Speech from an electronic source (computer, phone, etc.)is nearly unintelligible unless I use earphones which are not good for this disorder. This little speaker has the most speech clarity of any device I have used. It's wonderful! The tone sounds very "pure," like there's almost no distortion. I am no audiophile, since I don't hear well enough to speak about "clear bass," etc.but the volume is more than adequate, and it's so small and easy to carry, I just carry it wherever I want.<br/><br/>It's beautifully designed. The "skin" of the speaker has this silky, sensual feel. My personal preference would be to have the control buttons more visible, say in red, so that my 61 year old eyes could see them better, but I suspect that aesthetic design is important to this company.<br/><br/>One minor criticism: the user guide could be more user friendly for us spoiled English only readers. I found the instructions a little confusing and minimalist. But ultimately, I was able to use the speaker fairly easily.<br/><br/>The company: fantastic! You can tell they are dedicated to excellent customer service- they email you to make sure you are satisfied, and provide support contact info.
 I'm updating my rating based on Anker's outstanding customer service. I'm very impressed that they've taking the time to exchange emails and they even sent me an updated speaker. It's so nice to know that there are companies out there that have the money not to care, but actually do care.<br/>Also, to be fair, regarding this speaker, I was comparing it to one that cost $200 more. And as Anker said - everyone has different taste in listening. I gave this speaker to my mom and she loves it. It's easy to pair, really easy, and super easy to disconnect and re-connect (just press the button on the top). And if I left it on, as soon as I turned on my Echo, it paired up. Which I might have taken for granted, but not after having so many issues with past speakers, either they wouldn't pair, wouldn't connect after they were paired, or that I'd have to press the on/pair button each time. Not to mention the mixed up wifi Sonos that took over my phone, wouldn't stop playing pandora even after I shut off my phone and then even Alexa couldn't control it, this speaker is a dream! All in all, this is a darn good speaker. I still want more bass, so it's not the speaker for me. But it is a good all around speaker for the price. Lastly, if thinking about buying this, I would recommend to spending the extra $10 and get the Soundcore 2, it's a big step up and definitely worth it.<br/><br/>______<br/>Original review:<br/>I can’t understand what all the rave reviews are about. I got the Anker in hopes to replace my Bose mini, that I’ve had for years and now is distorted at high volumes. However, after listening to them side by side, I’d rather listen to my old speaker even if that means on a lower volume than this one.<br/>To be fair, this Anker is a good speaker, just not for me. It has excellent clear sound, no distortion, and very “crisp”. But it lacks the quality of a deep rich sound and physical air from the bass.<br/>And maybe if I listened to just pop high pitched music or something, it would be perfect. Or if I listened to it at the beach while flirting and laughing (like in the ad pictures), it would be all good.<br/> But that’s not usually the case, I mostly listen to my speakers inside and want the feeling of being immersed in the music.
 At first I loved my Anker, it sounded great and for the price it was fantastic. I had noticed it wasn't connecting to my iPhone 6 plus after a few weeks of use. I thought it was just because my phone was old. I recently upgraded to an Iphone X and again it simply doesnt connect even after charging it completely. I restarted my phone removed bluetooth and turned it back on and once again it is not connecting. I loved the device but this has left me high and dry. disappointed.  :-( .
 EDIT//// After writing a review, Anker was kind enough to email me personally email to resolve this issue. They sent me a replacement and this one works much better than the one I received before. So I guess it was a defect.  I Recommend this to everyone who are interested in a low budget Speaker. And also for their superb customer service.<br/><br/>When I first received this product I was astounded by the sound quality. However, after couple hours of use I found a really annoying issue with this speaker. Every time I switch my apps or anything it sounds a POP. Its not that loud but hearing it every time I do anything really annoys me. I tried connecting to another phone and it does the same thing. FYI I use Galaxy S8+ and Moto G4 (amazon).  Because its a hassle for me to go to ups (where I live requires a lot of parking fee and complicated parking) to return this item I'm just gonna find a way to use this speaker.
 I do makeup for a living and I need music to get in my zone. I had a small cheap Bluetooth Speaker with a short battery life. I researched 24 Hr battery life Bluetooth Speakers and came across Anker SoundCore. The price point is very affordable. Ordered it. I also ordered the case separately. Got it in the mail within a couple days. Used it while charging then I packed it in my makeup luggage bag. I specifically ordered this to take to Comic-Con in San Diego. I wanted to play it while doing makeup on talents. Well it wasn’t turning on. I was frustrated. So I went back home to LA, emailed Anker. They sent me a new one right away. No hassles whatsoever. Belinda, the customer service representative was so helpful and kind. She wanted to make sure I’m a happy consumer. Well I definitely am! Thank you Belinda and Anker! I will be ordering other products from this company because it’s good quality, price point and I’m very happy with their customer service!
 ***UPDATE***<br/>I feel compelled to update my 4 star review since leaving a month after owning this speaker.  Yes the sound is not that of a large stereo BUT with some tinkering with your device you can still get good sound quality out of this.  I've been using this speaker a lot in the past month camping or being out back, at the beach, etc.  I have a larger better sounding speaker but I'm lucky to get 3-4 hours out of the battery. I have run this all day and battery is still going, charge overnight and get same great results the next day.  Very easy to pair, nice size to carry...not a lot of complaints but wanted to update to 5 stars as I love this speaker and would easily buy again!!!!<br/><br/>Nice speaker depending on what your looking for.  The battery life is great, easy to connect.  Bought as a gift for someone who listens to a lot of talk. I have other BT speakers and this one is not as good playing music, really distorted when playing higher volume.  Again, good choice for someone who doesn't want to charge their speaker constantly, for average use this is a good choice.
 SoundCore is smaller and heavier than I expected. Sound quality is excellent, but the battery..., is to die for. I'm still on the first charge, probably a month of listening to it, and wondering if perhaps I got the "atomic battery", or the one run by local power pull (joke - ley lines). It just won't quit.<br/><br/>And in case it's not obvious, the 3.5_mm hole on the end just above the micro-USB recharger..., is for input, not output. I'd thought that perhaps you could plug headphones in there, and listen to WiFi-sent music (a portable WiFi receiver that runs your headphones), but it's the other way around. Your device would supply an analog signal, and no WiFi would be involved (self-powered speaker for analog sources)<br/><br/>Would I buy this again? You bet! Indeed, Anker has immediately become my go-to brand, the one that I compare subsequent choices to, and probably the one that I'll remain with.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The initial charge lasted about three and a half months. Amazing. I don't listen every day, but am immensely satisfied with this product.<br/><br/>UPDATE @ three years:  I've loved this thing.  It's been amazingly faithful, with unbelievable battery life.  So why have I knocked it down from five stars to three?  Because it's had a really annoying habit _in my situation_:<br/>*  It's connected to my ASUS Chromebox (no speaker there).<br/>*  I play a Youtube video, any video.<br/>*  I pause the video for more than, ohh, thirty seconds.<br/>*  I resume the video, except, the video portion is mostly frozen, stopped by this wonderful device stuttering, which forces first the Youtube audio then its video to stutter.<br/>*  ~Powercycling the Chromebook's bluetooth doesn't generally fix it, ditto powercycling the ANKER.  I usually have to powercycle _both_, and fiddle with things for a minute or so in order to reestablish contact.<br/>*  The video resumes normally, GREAT.<br/><br/>The problem comes when this never gets fixed, when any interruption requiring a pause then requires a mini-tortures-of-the-damned reset of the connection.  Ten times, a hundred times, probably much more than that, and this afternoon I'd had it.  I WHANGED the ANKER on my desktop (the Chromebox cost more, and incidentally had many cables attached...), and then it wouldn't turn on for multiple attempts.  But now it does (and I'd have preferred that it hadn't).<br/><br/>All of my other ANKER products have performed flawlessly; the brand continues to be my go-to-choice, the standard against which other options are compared.  But this design is clearly not a universal solution.
 I was interested in getting a small speaker to listen to podcasts while I was out in my workshop.  This one came highly recommended and so I figured it was worth a try.  I charged it when it arrived, and after a brief struggle trying to figure out how to pair it (turns out you need to hold down the power button for over a second for it to turn on - didn't figure that out initially) the speaker showed up on my iPhone's bluetooth options, and it paired when I used the pairing button on the speaker itself.  It plays well, and is a huge improvement over my phone's speaker (which was really what I was looking for).  The range is pretty decent, and for my purposes (podcasts) it seems perfect.  It's still new, so I will update this if something drastic happens.
 This replaced the Amazon Basics speaker I got on Prime Day for $26 but was dead in the box (never turned on). I really needed a bluetooth speaker to work the Echo Dot with any success (also bought that on Prime Day). Returned the crappy Amazon speaker and after a little research, narrowed my new selection to this Anker. It set up like up a breeze to the computer. Alexa took a bit more patience to set up but once she finds it, she'll remember. Now my only issue it with the Echo Dot set up to connect to computer when it wakes, it automatically DISconnects to the speaker, which is a pain. So every time I wake the computer from sleep, Alex connects to it and I have to tell her to connect to speaker again. But that's not Anker's fault. The sound is awesome for such a tiny little thing; very rich.
 After reading and watching so many reviews I was even more confused and concerned about purchasing a mini blutooth speaker to replace my 10 year old jbl clunky one.<br/><br/>I finally came across this Anker one and what impressed me the most with the reviews were the comments about customer service. The second was the sound.<br/><br/>So, the box came today!  I opened immediately. and set-up, 1 minute. Connect with my dot another 30 seconds. Playing music already done.<br/><br/>Reviews were correct about the Bass. Wish it could be deeper.<br/><br/>Sound is excellent. Lound as can be. I have a very open floor plan and it fills the entire space well. So small and light weight. I'll be able to bring this into other rooms with ease. Out in the back yard while doing yard word to annoy the hood with rock blasting.
 I have now purchased two of these. They are so cheap and put out a lot of sound! I use them all the time and my only complaint is that they aren't water resistant. The battery on these lasts for a very long time and I almost forget that they ever need charging. I watch movies and listen to music for a long time before I hear the speaker tell me it is finally needing a charge!
 Love the rich sound. Love that it has volume and pause/restart controls. Love that there is such a wide range of volume. Very easy to pair with my phone. I would wholeheartedly give five stars except that the top buttons are hard to see and are very difficult to press, especially the "on/off" button. I got the speaker for my office, and with the phone ringing and people coming in, I have to use the pause and volume controls a lot (which is why I got this speaker - to replace one that had no built-in controls, and was sometimes just too loud for the office setting). I have the speaker tucked away at the back edge of the credenza, which requires a bit of a reach, and, at that angle, all of the controls require a lot more pressure than is comfortable.
 Update: The battery lasts so long. How do they do it? I have not charged it in two months and it’s working fine.<br/><br/>It’s really small and produces great sound. Feels cool to hold something that sounds so nice.Alien technology?<br/><br/>It’s easy to pair, but it broadcasts all sound, which can be annoying or catch you off guard.
 Pros:<br/>Surprisingly long battery life. sometimes it amazed me (similarly priced Oontz angle speaker needed to be charged many times)<br/>Good usb port (the usb port in the oontz angle broke easily)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Sound quality is not good. (The cheaper Oontz angle speaker has better quality)<br/>It started having problems like the sound getting cut off (Oontz angle didn't have that)<br/>It gives a BEEP sound when you maximize volume which is SO ANNOYING. (Oontz angle didn't have that)<br/>it doesn't turn off when you're not using it for a while (Oontz angle turns off if you're not using it for a while which is great for when you forget to turn your device off)<br/><br/>Overall I would go with Oontz angle. It's better in every way except battery life and USB port
 Over the past few years I have purchased a number of Anker products through Amazon and found them all to be of very high quality and reliable.  The Soundcore Portable Speaker is no different.  An excellent product!<br/><br/>The speaker paired easily with my laptop and later with my Echo Dot.  As noted by most reviewers, the sound quality is outstanding, particularly considering the low price.  The construction is rugged, so it should be able to take a fair amount of abuse.<br/><br/>While extremely portable, it is heavy for its size.  I am not saying that is a bad thing since that attests to its robust construction.  But it is not necessarily optimum for travel if you are looking to minimize weight.  I decided to leave the Soundcore paired to my Echo Dot and I plan to use my Amazon Basics BKS-30 speaker to for travel since it it slightly smaller and significantly lighter (also a very good speaker).<br/><br/>Other than that, if you are looking for small speakers with great sound quality at a low price, you have come to the right place.
 I have been on the lookout for a decent portable bluetooth speaker to use around the house with my laptop and iPhone AND to use in the car with my iPhone since I don't have bluetooth in the car (yes my car is that old). I absolutely LOVE the sound that comes out of this little speaker. It is by far the best bluetooth speaker I have found. It has a very nicely balanced (for me) rich sound. I don't like too much bass and this is perfect! It connects easily to my macbook and iPhone. I have no idea how long the battery is supposed to last but I use it 8-10 hours a day and recharge it overnight every other day. Comes with a good sturdy case for when you are traveling. LOVE this product!!
 Sound is decent, went on the fritz for a day or two but is working again (just stopped for whatever reason - I did nothing to the computer or the speaker - when it stopped working, I detached from the aux cable &amp; used a different speaker.  Two days later, when Anker contacted me, I figured I'd try it again - hadn't even powered it off - and viola, it worked again).  Can't explain what happened to the speaker, but after I wrote my problematic review, Anker contacted me - they were WONDERFUL - fast response, totally willing to work with me to resolve the problem.  Anker, I'm a believer - with that fast, concerned service, I would never hesitate to deal with you again.  Great job!!  Oh, and I fully charged it when I first got it (about a week ago), and I haven't charged it since, and it's still working.  So the battery life on this is incredible!!
 Let me start out by saying that my previous Bluetooth speaker was a small round one that spoke to me in English or Chinese depending on its mood. So we weren't on good terms when its battery stopped charging and it was time to move on.<br/><br/>In comes the Anker Soundcore. I read a lot of reviews before I decided on this one. And I was not one bit disappointed. The packaging is just as attractive as the unit itself. The other reviewers are right when they say it feels like a premium device, and I would say it *is* a premium device! Sound quality is excellent. The highs and lows are in perfect balance and I don't think there is much justification to spend $50-$100 more on very small improvements in sound quality. This speaker can get VERY loud, louder than most speakers I've seen with this size.<br/><br/>The bluetooth connection happens quickly and I've tested the range at 20-25 feet with no problem. One thing I wish it didn't have was the "Anker" logo on the front of the speaker, but that's only minor to me.<br/><br/>If you're in the market for an affordable, great-quality speaker, then the Anker Soundcore is the one for you.
 Anker is a fantastic company. They always stick by their products and they create great products for an affordable cost. This speaker is no exception to this. That fantastic Anker quality that everyone loves is present here. This speaker is perfect for situations like being in a room while you listen to music while cleaning or things like that. It has ample sound and the battery life is just plain ANNOYING, BUT IN A GOOD WAY.<br/>I WISH I could kill this thing. With light use it will last you WEEKS. And personally, I'm not a music head who can listen to music 24/7, so this battery life is perfect for me. Pairing is easy and it can remember multiple devices (three I think).<br/><br/>Overall, you should definitely get this speaker if you want a medium sized speaker that can keep your music on a personal to shared level. Basically, if you want to listen alone or with like 3 people this is perfect.
 I absolutely loved this speaker when I received it--it was easy to pair, the sound was great (I'm not watching movies or listening to music--just podcasts!), battery life was terrific, and its range carried throughout my home. After six months, I did have some problems with the speaker, which has an 18-month warranty. I contacted Anker, got immediate customer service (within 24 hours), and they stood by their product. A really good product, and an exceptional company to work with!
 I finally replaced my big boombox with this great bluetooth speaker. This little thing sounds great and has a great battery life and longer range so I can be in the other room ans still works. So happy I picked this instead of the competition.
 This is my second Anker speaker. My first speaker is the Anker cube speaker: <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Anker-Classic-Portable-Wireless-Bluetooth-Speaker-Powerful-Sound-with-Enhanced-Bass-20-Hour-Battery-Life-and-Built-in-Mic-works-with-iPhone-iPad-Nexus-Laptops-and-More-Black/dp/B00GZC35YK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Anker Classic Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker, Powerful Sound with Enhanced Bass, 20 Hour Battery Life, and Built-in Mic, works with iPhone, iPad,Nexus, Laptops and More (Black)</a>, which I bought in October 2014. It's still going strong and is paired with my bedroom Echo Dot.<br/><br/>I have a second Echo Dot in my kitchen. After discovering that switching the cube speaker from one Echo to the other is a PITA, I've purchased this second one for the kitchen. At first, I tried to go cheap and get a little red speaker from another maker that cost just $15. Wow... I won't link to that product, but it stopped working the day after I received it. You get what you pay for, right?<br/><br/>I should have just gone with Anker from the start. Anker is a class act - I received this quickly and the speaker was packaged well. I have it plugged in, charging, right now and look forward to using it this evening while cooking my dinner. I'll post more after that.
 I am very very VERY happy my Anker SoundCore came early and it is everything on the description says it would be. All these years of struggling to find a great or better Bluetooth speaker and Anker came through my head. First of all to let all you viers or shoppers know Anker has very great durable products like charging cables, wall charging, etc. Second Anker customer service is very helpful plus if you can get your Anker product replace free hassle and simple.<br/>Now on to the SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker right now I read all the directions that came inside the box by Anker. I have tested it and I have linked and compared to my laptop. Why my laptop??? well, its old and the speakers in my laptop aren't that great plus its a low budget/basic laptop. Anywho after comparing my laptop to the SoundCore which was very easy and simple, I started to play some random Youtube videos. The sound that produces from the SoundCore was . . . . I am lost of words IT WAS AMAZING SOUND QUALITY!!! Also, my laptop's volume was already at 100% max, but not the Anker SoundCore it still had extra volume and it was like the SoundCore was loud as a rock concert.<br/>I do recommend this Bluetooth Speaker to anyone especially for those who have trouble hearing and well my hearing is not that great, but if you want a great and durable speaker well get Anker. I will continue to buy more Anker products in the future.
 I ordered this speaker for my son for Christmas, I tested yesterday to make sure it was in good working condition. The speaker sounds great, just lacks in bass, but you should expect that if you're ordering a speaker this small. Personally I am going to get myself a different brand because I want something a little bigger and with better bass. If you're looking for a great sounding little speaker, it's extremely hard to beat especially for the price. I have listened to many of the Bluetooth speaker in this class like jbl, bose, lansing, Sony etc. Sure a couple sounded a little better but by a very small margin and they cost around 100$ more, no way they are worth that much more for the small difference in price. Very easy to connect, I like the sleek design of the buttons being almost hidden and the battery life is fantastic!  If you're wanting some good bass, you're looking in the wrong class of speaker, step it up. This speaker sound every bit as good if not better than any other speaker in its class. Bottom line if you want a great sounding speaker, can't beat it.
 I have to say that I am really impressed with the Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker (A3102). For its size, it really puts out some nice, clear audio. If you put your hand in front of the speaker, you can feel air being pushed out of the port. The audio is clear...I mean it sounds really good. There are crisp highs, mellow mids, and nice deep lows. The build quality of the speaker is quite good too. Metal grille, rubberized body, large integrated buttons and solid connections.<br/><br/>For the price (I paid less than $40), you get a really great personal bluetooth speaker that can easily fill a small room with crisp clear, audio.
 This speaker has so far lived up to my expectations. Upon receiving this in the mail, I quickly charged it up and got to listening. Using both Bluetooth and the auxiliary input, I have found that the sound is clear and this speaker gets quite loud. I have not strictly tested the 24-hour battery, but I can say that while camping I used it for about a week straight watching television without the speaker running out - sometimes forgetting to turn it off before I went to bed.<br/>The speaker itself has five buttons, power, plus, minus, play and a sync button. The auxiliary in, power and mic are on one side. The speaker itself has some weight to it and seems to be well made. Overall, I am pleased with this product and would recommend it for a portable, battery powered Bluetooth or auxiliary speaker.
 What's not to like? I don't even know how they can make and ship there things for only $25.<br/>At the end of the day, this is a well designed speaker, that pays close attention to detail.<br/>Pros:<br/>1. The range is excellent, even in an office building where the audio source and the speaker are separated by several walls.<br/>2. The buttons are very tactile. You can easily operate the device just by feeling the shapes of the buttons.<br/>3. The unit is smaller than a gen 1 Bose SoundLink mini, and is a fraction of the weight.<br/>4. The mids and highs are very crisp, and the unit is LOUD. I'm very impressed by the size of the sound that can come from such a small device.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. The bass is definitely lacking. If you are looking for something that produces neutral and true audio, this is not the device for you. Even if you put the speaker up against a wood wall to amplify the acoustics, the bass is still not where I would like it to be. However, I think the bass is very good for the size and price of this unit.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>This speaker is $25, and you get a heck of a lot for your money. When I was deciding whether or not I should buy this speaker, I also looked at the gen 2 model. The reviews seemed to indicate minimal improvements between the gen 1 and gen 2, but the gen 2 was proportionally quite a bit more expensive. After using the gen 1, there are very few things I realistically think the gen 2 could improve upon. When it comes to bass, this speaker is not a Bose SoundLink, and it is neither as large nor as expensive as one (about 1/8th the price). The only Bluetooth speakers I know of that have better bass are either much larger, much more expensive, or both. In my opinion, the positive features of this speaker far outweigh the single negative. This speaker is a great value, and until there is an incredible breakthrough in speaker technology, I don't think you'll find a better speaker at this price point.
 Keyword:  TUNITY<br/>If you use the app Tunity on your phone to tune into and listen to TV channels on your phone via the Bluetooth speaker in a loud bar, then be ready to be disappointed.  I bought this specifically to listen to Bellator MMA (Spike TV/Paramount) while I was at my local bar.  The bar plays loud music and has tons of TV's.  So I had them put one TV on to the Bellator MMA fights and I used Tunity to play the audio over this BT speaker.  It wasn't loud enough though.  I had to hold the speaker right up to my ear just to hear the announcer on TV calling the fight plays.  So I'm going back to my 10W DIY bluetooth speaker and its heavy batteries instead.  Otherwise, I thought his BT speaker was nice.  It's tuned to play cleanly at full volume.  It just doesn't have ENOUGH volume.  Maybe if there was a button you could press to tune it for vocals only, then it could have played that louder.  Like a quick EQ button.  One EQ setting for music and one EQ setting for vocals only, that could play louder.
 I've purchased 3 wireless speakers in the last 3 months and so far this is the best one. The OontZ Angle 3 (awful sound quality) and ZoeeTree (a lot of weird product quirks before it tweaked out and died in 3 months) were garbage. This one was straightforward to set up and has crystal clear sound and some decent bass. It will turn off after not being connected for awhile which is also nice since I always forget to shut it off before I leave work. I recommend this one as a good value purchase.
 This little bluetooth speaker is a powerhouse. Let me start by saying that I like this product for a reason that might not be acceptable to others. The price. For $39.99 it was a deal worth making by itself, and that also may be why it might not appeal to others. This is not a $200 Bose speaker, I admit that. The sound quality in the mids and highs is pretty great, whereas the bass is not quite as good as a few of the other brands out there...but $39.99! OK, that out of the way I'll talk about the product.<br/>It's got weight and feels like quality, this is not a shoddy product in any way, it feels like it's put together to last. I love the rubber surround and integrated button on top, and the speaker grille is heavyweight. It's going to last. It came superbly packaged in a stylish box that would make a great gift without ever wrapping it. Very nice.<br/>Battery life: as many have said the battery life on this is ridiculous. It came mostly charged out of the box and it lasts and lasts. Love this.<br/>Sound quality: For the price I believe that this speaker beats out all comparable contenders. The mids are great, the highs are crisp, the bass is satisfactory for both size and price. The thing I found most impressive was the immersion in the sound. This speaker fills up space in a way that you really feel its absence when you turn off the music. It's stereo quality is really great. I can't believe the volume and range that this small speaker delivers. It's really impressive. I've played a variety of music through it and my girlfriend and I use it at night to play rain sounds and relaxation tones while we sleep. The sound-filling quality helps to really make the nature sounds feel real.<br/>Ease of use: Could not be easier. Power up, push the bluetooth button and pair it. It's that easy. If you can't figure this out you probably would have issues tying your shoes.<br/>Included USB power cord. It does not come with a wall plug, just the micro USB to USB cord. It's a little shorter than I'd have liked. I DO NOT CARE. If that's the make or break deal for you then you should reassess your life.<br/>Overall: I gave this product 5 stars because you can't beat it for the price. Seriously, don't even try. Sturdy, decent immersive sound quality, easy to use, stylish. I am really enjoying this and I can't wait to use it outside this coming spring and summer. I totally recommend this speaker.
 Was not expecting much to be honest. A small Bluetooth speaker? How good could it be? I have to say that this is a really fantastic speaker with rich, clear, definitive sound. I do not 'crank it up' so am not sure it would be good for that type of use. But for mid-volume level listening it seems to be a high quality sound. I listen to Classical and Jazz primarily and this speaker has not disappointed in any respect. Bought the DSALL case to go with it and it is a perfect combination.<br/>UPDATE:  After a couple months now of here-and-there use I have yet to have to recharge the battery.. As time goes on I am increasingly impressed by the ANKER Bluetooth speaker's quality sound and obviously overall superior engineering quality. Planning to buy a few more as xmas gifts. So rare to find a product that is above and beyond in quality, but this one wins the prize.
 It's a very nice speaker, this is true, but getting this thing to power on was an unpleasant experience.<br/>Up to my current knowledge of the device and the guide book included, this device will NOT power ON or OFF without being connected to a usb power source.<br/>I've looked through the included Welcome Guide of the device in question and it doesn't point out that the usb power supply is necessary to power on and off your device manually.<br/>It's simply stated:<br/>"Using Your SoundCore"<br/>"1. Turn on / off"<br/>and right below it is a picture showing a hand pressing the power button for no less than 2 seconds.<br/><br/>While the time to power on and turn off the device in question is indeed true, the need of the usb power source to actually turn on the device is not instructed, so I assumed that simply charging the speaker was enough to use the thing.<br/>With the speaker charged, I proceeded to hit the powerbutton to no avail and I worried the device defective.<br/>Then I let it charge again to see the light simply darken and tried again with the same result.<br/>It was later that I left the USB in the thing to make sure it was even able to boot up, and it was! At this point I wasn't even happy the thing worked, I was annoyed over the process at which this thing needed to be powered on.<br/> tentative]It says that it's a portable bluetooth speaker with up to 24-hour play time (volume and music may vary) but to power it ON (and manually turn it off) I NEED to plug the micro USB into the speaker! tentative]  tentative]While on the subject of "Portability", if the device powers down with no device connected to it, you have to be really sure you want this particular device connected. tentative]<br/><br/>-omitted-<br/><br/>If this was clearly stated in the manual included in the device, this review (or rather, my impression) would be a lot more positive and hell, I'd heartily recommend this thing based on its performance and its current price point.<br/>If it is my device that is faulty (which I'm skeptical on as I have successfully powered on and off the speaker multiple times with the USB plugged in and ONLY when it's in) I would love to hear that my little tirade isn't correct and I'd be more than happy to change my opinion, and if the speaker isn't faulty and the methods of powering the speaker are as I have described, then simply updating the manual to explain how to power this device would help others who will run into this ordeal.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>After leaving the speaker on for bit since my last power down (40 minutes), I decided to try and power cycle my speakers again without the USB and to my surprise, it worked!<br/>It seemed that the speaker has a bit of trouble trying to figure out that it is able to be used after being unplugged, as trying to power on after unplugging the usb had a longer delay (in my previous case, not powering on at all), and now after a few power cycles, the device is now functioning somewhat as expected.<br/>If others are still trying to power on the device, try re-connecting your charged speaker to the usb and try powering it on, wait for some time and power cycle.<br/>If some can't get the speaker to boot after the first use, try plugging it up with a usb and try to power it on.<br/><br/>My first use of the device did result in some annoyance in booting the thing, but for now it seems to be functioning correctly, and my impression has improved, and it was likely that my device had a bit of a delay in it when trying to power it on after charging it and corrected itself after turning it on/off while plugged in.<br/><br/> Another Update]<br/>Yet again, the device only powered on/off only when plugged in.<br/>It's not clear as to why this is happening, but I will be patient with this speaker and hope that it doesn't just quit working all together.
 This is a really wonderful little speaker, especially for the price. The battery lasts a pretty long time; I think I only charge it every couple of weeks (with light use). And the audio quality is pretty good, definitely a lot better than many other little portable speakers. Obviously not hardcore audiophile equipment but for a $30 battery-powered portable speaker. It's nice that you can plug in or connect via Bluetooth.<br/><br/>I used it for about 7-8 months, after which the audio quality got funky and Bluetooth wouldn't work anymore one day. I contacted customer service, who were extremely helpful, friendly, and quick. I think within 2 business days they had sent me a replacement, which I then received 2 days later, for a super fast turnaround time. And it was as easy as can be. This kind of customer service is yet another great reason I'll keep buying Anker products (on top of them being well made and inexpensive). Thanks Anker!
 The quality from this is very impressive. I have no hesitation in using this to play selections for the kids and for personal use and enjoying it. I’ve also used this as a speaker phone for calls. The battery life is awesome. I forget often to charge it, but even when left for weeks, I’ve yet to find it has been depleted, and just place it to charge when I remember.<br/><br/>The only problem is that on my wife’s phone, the signal crackles and drops every so often, which is very annoying. I haven’t found this happening on my phone, and I haven’t seen this happening in either of our phones with other devices so I’m not sure what to make of it. Might decide to send it in on warranty.
 After charging it I paired it with my bluetooth transmitter and it worked fine for just a short time then quit and would not pair with either of my transmitters. It would play when plugged into the PC but that is not what I bought it for. Had to return it.<br/>  UPDATE. After my review for this product I was contacted by Anker and offered a free speaker because the one I purchased failed. I told them I had no complaints because I know things like this can happen and I did not blame them for anything. Later I received another e-mail from them with an offer of a new speaker. This time I accepted because anyone this eager to please really cares about customer relations. I have been using the speaker since receiving it about 3 months ago and I am really happy with it. I have played it every other day for an hour to hour and a half and it still does`nt need charging. I wish I was better with words so I could give this product the review it really deserves.It has a really good sound and the battery is lasting a very long time. Also I am happy to say it reaches from my man cave to my bed room upstairs and sounds great. I can`t really say enough about the customer ralations department they really want to please. And really they do.
 I LOVE THIS speaker. I had always listened to music on my phone when getting ready in the morning or working around the house. My son had gotten a much more expensive one from the cell phone store and he liked his, but I just did not feel the need to spend a bunch of money on a speaker. Then I saw this one and read the reviews and thought "why not."  I did not have huge expectations - anything would be better than coming out of my cell phone - but I was really really impressed. I was able to walk into different rooms of the house and still hear the music clearly for the most part. I tried to use it for a phone call and the caller said they could not hear me very well. However, this may have been because of location and volume setting. I was still unsure how to answer the call and didn't want to mess around with it mid-call to see if it helped. I also ordered the carrying pouch which is a nice addition when going to a friend's or park. I would definitely buy this item again - no question. I would also recommend it to friends.
 I got this as a gift for my father about a week ago. He has some hearing loss (probably due to his 80's hair metal addiction), so we needed something that was powerful enough for him to hear as he does things around the house.<br/><br/>This speaker gets plenty loud, thankfully, and he loves it. Easy for him to carry around if needed, and he says it's very easy to use. The buttons on the top are difficult to see and offer little tactile assistance, but he says that he has no trouble using it. We went ahead and used a bright marker to trace over the buttons anyway.<br/><br/>He is pretty technically illiterate, but it just took me a minute to connect it to his phone for the first time and he doesn't need to do anything else.<br/><br/>Sound quality is surprising for the price, especially considering that it's a single speaker. Not a lot of bass, no sibilance, nothing sounds muddy, it's pretty alright. Build quality is similar. Feels solid, well-made.<br/><br/>Battery life is pretty good, so it wouldn't be a bad choice for taking it outdoors either.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it for anyone that just wants something that works and isn't a piece of crap.
 I too like others had problems with charger. Sound was great but first time charged it never worked again. Multiple diff chargers used all same result. Returning to Amazon and won't buy again. Good luck if buy this<br/><br/>Update-- shipped back to amazon for refund.  The company obviously monitors their feedback and emailed me and offered free replacement.  Arrived quickly and does not have issue with charger at first use. Will keep posted if this changes.  Company gets 5 stars!! for customer service as this return was through amazon and not there warranty.  review only 4 stars as this seems to be a known defect and a little better quality control would fix all the negative reviews dealing with same issue.  Again sound is GREAT and now their customer service made up for a defective product without asking  Thanks highly recommend company and speaker just make sure charges well.
 I have only been using this speaker for a couple of hours, but I love it.  The sound quality is great.  I can be listening to a show and carry the speaker wherever I am working in the house.  The down sides:  The instructions are not clear on connecting and disconnecting the Bluetooth.  The speaker is black and the labels are either dark gray or they are 3D black.  They are hard to read for my old eyes without the brightest of conditions.  I dislike the black, rubberized coating... it shows shiny fingerprints on the flat black, which are hard to clean.  Other things I own that have rubberized coatings usually degenerate and turn sticky within a year or so.
 The first one I bought was awesome, but after a year the port melted while I was charging it. So I bought a new one.  The new one SUCKS! It’s not as loud, the sound is blurry, and it barely holds a charge. Don’t wate your money.<br/><br/>***Update Anker saw my review, and reached out to me.  Not only did the replace my first speaker, but they upgraded the second speaker. Both of the new speakers are clear loud and perfect.
 I try not to give too much praise to just one brand, but there are a few that deserve it and Anker is one of them. This speaker won't blow you out of the water and it's definitely not the best out there, but for me as a casual listener it's perfect. The price is just right, it's attractive, offers Bluetooth and aux connections. The sound is just what I need it to be for listening on my own, watching a movie on my laptop, having a get together with my friends, going to the beach or the park.<br/><br/>There are two things that I would change. The Bluetooth connection, while simpler than most processes, is a bit slow and buggy at times. Most of the time it connects right away though. The next one is more of a suggestion, but it'd be nice to have USBC charging instead of micro just since I really don't have any micro devices left
 This sound bar offers decent sound for the price. The big draw back with it comes down to the buttons.... they are so hard to see. If you have poor eyesight you may want to avoid this particular item. There are raised icons on it however they are as black as the casing they are poking up from... The buttons are barely visible at an angle and definitely indistinct in low light. However if you are young and your eyes are fit, this is still a good sound bar for the money. Easy to pair with Bluetooth devices, it also has a port in the side for your standard 3.5mm aux plug, and will charge using the USB B port on the side while running. All in all it is okay for what it is....
 Great sound from an Anker speaker, as usual! I have been using Anker speakers for more than a year now, and I love them so much that I have bought more than a dozen of them. Based on my experience with their speakers, I have purchased other kinds of Anker products and I do not regret at all. Unfortunately, one of my speakers broke and I was not able to replace it because it has been discontinued. Anker refunded the purchase in full, since the speaker is no longer manufactured, and recommended this one as a replacement.<br/><br/>With the above said, I will be comparing this speaker against a Bose SoundLink Color speaker. I have been using the Bose speaker for about 2 months now, and the Anker for 2 days. SIZE: my first impression with both speakers was: "it is so tiny". But Anker's impressed me more, because I truly believed that it would me at least twice of the actual size. So, size wise, both are good. WEIGHT: Anker speaker is super light, when compared to Bose. So, Anker won this one. POWERING ON/OFF: First of all, I thought that this category should not exist on a review since you just turn on and off a device, there should be nothing special about it, but I had a special experience with the Anker speaker, so I had to write about it... This fight, I have to give it to the Bose. The Bose speaker works as it should, quickly press and release the power button and that's it. Unfortunately, on the Anker I have to press and hold for a bit to get it to turn on/off, and the buttons are kind of hard to press. I am not saying that they are hard to press, but comparing with Bose's, Anker's are hard to press. BLUETOOTH PAIRING: Bose won this one too. I just had to power on the speaker, press the bluetooth button, select the speaker on my mobile device, and bingo! The Anker should follow the same process, but it did not work. I had to set it to pairing mode 4 times and power cycle the speaker 3 times before my mobile device was able to find it. I must mention that the Bose tells you the name of the devices that are currently connected to it, while the Anker just beeps. I understand that this is like a premium feature, that I would say Bose MUST have due to the price!!! For me, this does not add anything that would put the Bose before the Anker, but I just wanted to mention it. RECONNECTING AFTER POWER CYCLE: Both speakers reconnected right away after powering up; so there are no winners here. Now, SOUND: both speakers sound very well. As expected, Bose's sound, when it comes to base and deep sounds, it rocks, nothing can compare. But the rest of the sound spectrum sounds incredibly well on the Anker. I played the same song at the same time, in sync, on both speakers and I was able to identify sounds on the Anker that I was not able to appreciate on the Bose. But, due to Bose's emphasis on bass, the overall quality of the sound, which surrounds and strengthen the rest of the music, is still better with the Bose. I must say, that if you are not a musician, music freak, sound engineer, etc., you can easily pic between the Bose or the Anker based on how much bass do you want to hear. If you are not a bass lover, go for Anker, no questions asked, you will not regret at all. But if you want your bass, do not look at Anker. VOLUME: Anker's volume can go a little bit higher than the Bose. Surprisingly, at max volume, it does not distort that much. If you are at a considerable distance away from the speaker, you may not notice distortion at all, compared with the Bose speaker, which you will notice regardless of the distance.<br/><br/>Bottom line: For less than $40, Anker is a BOMB!!! You will not regret buying this baby, for real. If you are not a sound maniac, buy it with confidence. The star that I dropped on this review is related to the pairing issues that I had and the "difficulty" of powering on/off the device - everything else is just perfect! Anker's customer service is out of this world, they really support their products, so you cannot go wrong with either them or the products that they manufacture.
 The other day, I was chopping vegetables in the kitchen.  From the bathroom, I heard Journey blaring and it was loud enough to interrupt my t.v.  What the Hell is THAT!? I knocked on the bathroom door and called to my son, who was in the shower, "Hey! Did you bring your stereo in there?" He said, "No, Mom ... it's that bluetooth speaker you got me."<br/>Really didn't expect THAT.<br/>This has fantastic sound and is better than I thought it would be.  I am very impressed!<br/>If you need a quality bluetooth speaker, this is it.<br/>If your kid has discovered 80's music and you don't want anything to do with it, DON'T  buy this ... because you'll be back in the 80's whether you like it or not.
 My kids have two of these and they both worked well for about 2 months.  Now they BOTH are experiencing spotty connections and disruptions even with the phone 4-5 feet from them.  The phones work fine with every other device we have so it is clearly a  problem with the anker speaker.  My only guess is a problem with a receiver starting to fail in both speakers.  While they were working, they worked fine with decent sound and battery life but they clearly are not made for longevity.  Don't think I'd buy these again.<br/><br/>***Update***<br/>Anker direct contacted us regarding our problems.  They helped us trouble shoot the issue and replaced the defective items.  Anker Direct's customer service was top notch in getting us fixed up and working units to us.
 I received this speaker about a week ago and I am very pleased with the purchase.  I had seen a review on a tech news site and was a little concerned that it was one of those caned reviews .  The unit paired with no problems and once it is paired it loads overtime I turn it on.  The sound is great at moderate levels and even a little high still has good highs and lows. At very high levels the mid levels become a little muddy. Now these are my opinions as others hear sounds differently. The signal to noise levels seem good for a speaker this size. When this unit is not paired with something I plan to use it with Google Chromecast.
 Surprisingly good sound from this little speaker.  The user manual has very, very tiny print, but the one I found on line is fine.  Easy to pair with my iPad, Nexus 5, laptop and Mac.  The remote is useful, but the layout is far from intuitive and the volume up/down keys seem to be hard to consistently hit.  I streamed from Spotify for 11 hours at a medium volume and it was still going strong.  Presets were easy to set, but every time the power hiccups, the presets are lost.  No battery backup built in (or maybe I'm doing something wrong).  The Anker graphic is rather prominent and annoying.  The control buttons on top are virtually impossible to see and pressing the intended one is basically by guess and feel.  Well worth the price despite the cons.
 I have just started using this speaker after I purchased my Amazon Echo Dot. I have it in my bathroom and it pairs quickly and works flawlessly. I tell Echo to Connect to my speaker and Shuffle my playlist and it starts playing in my bathroom. I can then start giving the Dot commands in the bathroom and the speakers in the bedroom stop working. The bass is quite good on this little thing especially in such a little room. I would definitely recommend this above any other speaker I have tried, most definitely the  "Volume and Bass Hi-Fi Wireless speaker" I just returned that was twice the price. It had a built in SD card and boasted 360 sound but the mid range sound was really disappointing. Anker makes great stuff!! Plus this works so well with Amazon Dot!! I didn't even know this had a built in microphone.
 If you don't use the bluetooth connection (which doesn't always work), you will have to watch the constantly blinking blue light that seems to be forever searching for a connection. You can not turn this off. If you are using this speaker in your line of sight at all, it's quite annoying. When the bluetooth does work, it's a VERY LOUD connecting and DISCONNECTING sound... You can't change this volume. When the battery is nearly dead, it will make another very loud, annoying sound two loud, long BEEEEPs. You can not change this volume. I have dealt with many other portable bluetooth speakers, this one is not worth the money.<br/>**EDIT: I almost forgot to note that it will no longer connect via bluetooh, after just over a year of owning it. It's a real useless POS.**
 I'm actually impressed by how long the battery lasts.  If you've seen the episode of Rick and Morty where they go into smaller universes that generate power for the larger ones, you'll actually consider that as a possibility for these bluetooth speakers it's really ridiculous.  When you do have to charge it's really quick, really not a nuisance at all.  The sound quality is also great, and the issue I sometimes face when playing bluetooth speakers at full volume is that the intensity of the bass in songs will actually shake the speakers.  This can be an issue if you place the speakers on an elevated surface, as they can essentially try to destroy themselves by shaking off a cliff.  This is not the case at all for these speakers and it's really baffling because I feel like these are some of the louder speakers I've owned.  Literally 0 shaking it's unbelievable and I listen to music with really obnoxious amounts of bass.  If you don't even really have a need for bluetooth speakers these are still essential, even to watch tv or Netflix with.  I hope to one day pass this on to my children as an heirloom because I feel like this has Jumanji like powers.
 I don't think you can find a better value for $35.99. I bought this as a portable speaker for camping, the beach, back patio and it works great for all of these uses. Are there better speakers out there? Sure, but this speaker is easy to use/pair with my devices, sounds great, gets loud enough to hear in a ≃50 foot radius, has great battery life (especially with an aux cord -- went camping for 3 days and a full charge lasted long enough that I didn't have to recharge it), and is sturdy enough to withstand some bumps and bruises. Ultimately if it gets too beat up I didn't lose much and got the use out of it I was looking for. Would definitely recommend this for someone who wants to make their music portable and isn't looking to blow their budget.
 Amazing Bluetooth speaker at a really low price!<br/><br/>Pro:<br/>- Amazing price for a great product.<br/>- Good battery life (good for parties).<br/>- Premium built<br/>- Easy to navigate with all the buttons on top.<br/>- Easy to connect and good bluetooth connectivity.<br/>- Nice packacing and customer service (never disappoint me).<br/><br/>Con:<br/>- I havent found anything wrong with it yet.<br/><br/>Overall: I would recommend this product if you are looking for a great product at a low price! Good for college students, on the go people, parties, and Christmas gift!
 I have other more expensive Bluetooth speakers with 3 times the power and price tag of this unit. I needed something for travel that was portable, solid and cheap.  I have many other products from this company and so I was fairly sure I would get more than my money’s worth.  Boy was I right!  This little speaker is tight, clear, bright and punchy.  I just ordered the case for it too.  My only less than perfect comment is, I wish these things had some tone control but none of them out there do.  You don’t really need it however since most IOS devices have playback setting with tone adjustments if you want to make them.  I was immediately impressed with the heft of the build quality and how nice the textured rubberized covering felt.  I have an office full of products from this company and two vacuums as well. They are all really amazing value and this speaker is no exception.
 Anker products as a whole are great and the SoundCore bluetooth speaker is no exception.  However, this review is as much about Anker's customer support as it is their products.  I purchased my SoundCore in Oct 2016 and have used it regularly since.  However, recently it appeared to stop charging and I contacted Anker customer support via email.  Within 24 hours I received a response requesting a couple items of information and then within a couple hours after my response they responded saying they would ship out a new speaker and I should receive it in a couple of days.  It couldn't get any better than that.  I own numerous Anker products and will certainly keep buying them.
 Like an idiot I spilled a glass of wine right into my Echo dot and now it sounds like it's underwater.  Rather than taking the time to rip apart the Dot to clean it out, and since I was looking for an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker already, I purchased the Anker SoundCore speaker.<br/><br/>Right out of the box, this Anker speaker feels really solid. I am not sure, but it seems to be built from metal and hardened rubber. The instructions that come with it are minimal, but after about 10 minutes I was able to decipher it in its entirety. Basically, I pressed "on" button for a couple of seconds to turn it on, then through my Alexa app, I paired my Dot with it.  Took all of 1 minute tops.<br/><br/>The sound from this speaker is very good for the price.  My kids have a Bose Soundlink Mini Bluetooth speaker and that sounds incredible compared to this Anker.  However the Bose costs about $200 and should sound better.  For the price of this Anker, the sound is quite acceptable.  The highs are present and there is just enough bass to feel it.  It won't rattle the windows, but it is great for the price point.  I pumped the volume up to the max on the speaker and on the Dot and had no distortion whatsoever.  The sound remained clean, clear, and quite loud.<br/><br/>If you don't need the top of the line sound, I highly recommend this.  I use it mainly for audiobooks, news, etc.  So this works perfectly for me.  But this is still great for listening to music as well.
 I bought this to listen to podcasts while I shower. My shower and bathroom fan are incredibly loud, so volume was of the utmost importance. I did not place this where it might be splashed, because it's not rated as waterproof. But, it was plenty loud for me to hear my podcast, throughout the entirety of my shower. The sound quality is crisp and distinct.<br/><br/>Be warned, when you unlock your device, the speaker will chime to let you know. If you have it turned up all the way, that chime WILL startle you. This little speaker holds a lot of power.<br/><br/>I love the battery life, too. I've been using it on and off for the past week since I charged it up (which can take a few hours), and it still has plenty of juice.<br/><br/>I'm pleased with my purchase.
 I have been shopping around for some time for an affordable, compact, Bluetooth speaker to provide a simple and convenient way to play my music on the deck and when camping.  When I saw the ANKER speaker on sale for $50 off I could not resist and went ahead and ordered it.  I'm so glad I did.  I love this little speaker.  From it's nice hefty feel to it's rubberized coating this speaker has quality written all over it.  Using it is simplicity in itself.  The controls are pretty much self explanatory. A power button, volume controls, and a Bluetooth connect button.  Connection options include a plug to connect directly to your device with a cable if you choose but the Bluetooth operates so flawlessly that I don't know why anyone would want to connect it with a cable.  When I got it I plugged it in, (you're supposed to fully charge it before using it for the first time) and found that it was already nearly fully charged so this only took a few minutes.  I synced it with my phone and it worked flawlessly.  I was blown away by the sound.  It does what it is designed for.  To provide quality sound for small spaces or for close proximity outside.  It will not fill a gymnasium with sound but hey, that's not what it's supposed to do.  I mean, look at the size of this thing. It plays with amazing sound quality and volume enough to enjoy out on your deck or around a campfire.  The sound is crisp and clear and provides amazing tonal detail for it's size. I am totally please with this speaker.
 This speaker definitely does not have 'rich bass'.  Sound is weak and dirty.  Muffled highs and little bass.  Sound is very directional, so don't plan on this flooding your ears at close range, like at a desk.  I knew this little speaker isn't going to amaze anyone, but i guess i just wasn't expecting the sound to be so annoyingly dull.<br/><br/>With that said, it's exactly what i was looking for.  I listen to talk radio and news in my work van, which doesn't have Bluetooth audio streaming.  This little speaker will happily live ziptied to the roof, just behind my head, where its directional speaker can project against the windshield, bounce off, and into my ears.
 Before I started going in depth I have to say first.<br/>This speaker lacks bass. I really don't know why everyone says the bass is solid because it isn't. The bass is almost identical to my Google Home Mini.<br/><br/>Now, that being said, I will still give this speaker 5 stars. For the price of the speaker (in the $20s) this speaker has crazy battery life. It really lasts a long time. Secondly, the sound is pretty clear for the size, without sound distortion. Thirdly, again for the size it has quite decent sound, and that also makes it very portable. It is also light enough to bring around while traveling.<br/><br/>So, I will give it 5 stars given the value of it, and overall features. If you are limited with budget this is great. Otherwise, spend a little more for more bass. I know I would.
 *** Update ***<br/>So after my so-so review; Anker reached out and offered to send me their next best speaker free of charge! I must say, the Soundcore 2 sounds much much better, with depth and richness in the sound. So glad I took the time to write a review. Thanks Anker for the awesome customer service! And I got to keep the original speaker! Awesome work, guys!!!<br/><br/>I bought this for my office at work. And that's the best use for this, IMO. The sound quality is not that great. It's like using generic headphones instead of the iPod ones that came with your phone. There's a noticeable difference in the richness and bass tones in my favorite music. But, it's a great office speaker, and it's blue...
 Smaller than expected--I was a little bummed at how small it is.  Pairing with my phone was effortless.  I was amazed at how loud this little thing is!  Good thumpy bass too!  This thing has amazing stereo sound.  I'm putting it under the Christmas tree for my son.  He'll love it.  This is by far the best sound for the least bucks that I've ever found.<br/><br/>I had my son bring it over after Christmas so I could give it a proper workout.  Test tracks included "Pull Me Under" by Dream Theater, "Bridge of Sighs" by Robin Trower, and "A Evaristo Carriego" by Color Tango.  I turned the speaker and the phone all the way up.  I also turned on Bass Boost on my phone equalizer.  I'm sticking with 5 stars.  I got excellent audio with zero distortion.  Amazing little speaker and improbably loud.  Too cool.
 Was good while it lasted, which was probably a total runtime of 2 hours. Then the bluetooth got choppy, the battery started dying way too quickly and now it has completely stopped working. I've heard good things about Anker's support though, so let's see how that goes.<br/><br/>Edit: So the customer service reached out to me without me initiating contact (I was going to, okay). They sent me a new one that works very well and has been my bluetooth speaker of choice for the last one month. Feels good to have your faith in good service vindicated.
 UPDATED REVIEW<br/>It is noteworthy that Anker followed up with an improved version 2 of this speaker with better base.  My original review was based on version 1.  Based on the improved version, I have changed my rating.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW<br/>Okay sound, especially considering the price.  It's louder than the speakers on my smart phone, tablet and PC.  That's what I was looking for.  It is relatively light weight.  It mainly suffers in the bass range.  I have a far more expensive Sony speaker ($100) that sounds far better overall, has good bass and does't have noticeable distortion at high volume.  We would expect that.  The old "you get what you pay for".  While I would like more bass, for less than $30 I can definitely live with this speaker.
 Battery life and portability are excellent!  I would say I'm a medium to light user and I have only had to charge it twice during the past 4 months.  There are no controls to customize bass or treble.  You would have to customize via your tablet/computer/phone.  Bluetooth connect was always stable.  Actually, I had problems with the AUX port not working.  After several trials, with other cords, it turned out it was the speaker.  Customer service was OUTSTANDING.  They (particularly Cherry from Customer Service), was very prompt and fair.  In fact they responded even faster than I was responding.  Once I sent pictures and serial numbers of my product, a replacement was sent right away.  I received my replacement within 1.5 days (delivered to Los Angeles).  I have never experienced such organized customer service in my life.  I own other Anker products (flashlight, battery pack, cords)... I will always consider Anker my no. 1 trusted brand!
 You need to face the speakers up (unlike the pictures).  Kinda disappointing sound.  Some types of music sound OK: dance music sounds OK - the bass is adequate but acoustic guitar sounds like music pumped through a tin can for some reason.  Especially if you are close to the speakers and the volume is low.  We have a Creative Sound Blaster with speakers all around it- granted we paid a lot more for that but this doesn't even come close to comparing.  It was a gift for our 9 year old so its fine but I would have spent a bit more to get better sound quality.  It is small and lightweight but that's about all it has going for it.  Maybe the mini ones just can't compare and something that you spend 25 bucks for just can't cut it.  I don't know.
 I originally bought two speakers.  One did not work; I had a great deal of trouble with it.  Customer service with Anker has been tops, though, and they have replaced the defective speaker with no trouble at all - even after the "return by" date had passed.  They have been attentive to all my concerns and very conscientious about following up.<br/><br/>The other speaker I have had no problem with.  I am pleased with the speakers themselves - very small and portable, a long battery life, but good sound quality.
 The battery on this thing is insane. It lasts for a very long time on a charge. I use mine for about 40 minutes total every week, and I haven't charged it in over 6 months. I don't know how Anker pulled that off.<br/><br/>As for sound quality: It's acceptable. It won't blow you away. It can get decently loud without getting distorted. It has an acceptable dynamic range, what a reasonable person would expect from a portable budget Bluetooth speaker. Bass? It's like someone whispered a rumour about it, but you haven't seen it for yourself. You can tell where the bass is supposed to be, but it is mostly absent.<br/><br/>The speaker is a quality product.<br/>All in all, I'm happy. I think you will be too.
 Battery life and quality of sound are phenomenal. ONLY Understand that this is a very compact speaker and if your looking for sound for a room bigger than 9X12 then this is NOT going to do much. If you need something to enhance your phone's speaker sound, or your ipads volume and quality then THIS IS THE PRODUCT for you. Its only limitation is how far it will project; remember it is a very compact speaker.
 This thing works great, a majority of the time- I use it regularly. Sounds good, for it's size and price. Only thing is, and I don't know if this is the item or bluetooth generally, sometimes it cuts out a little, or sometimes it doesn't want to connect to a given device. But I really think that's the case with all bluetooth. So upshot is- great for home listening, better than the computer built-in speakers for sure (and can move to different parts of the house with me), but if I absolutely need to count on it (like for lessons, I am a music teacher) I would rather use an old fashioned corded set of speakers.
 Good speaker in a small package.  I'm not an audiophile but I appreciate good sound.  This certainly won't replace a home stereo, but it gets loud enough for most situations.  I use it while on the deck grilling and in the kitchen.  Don't expect Bose quality, but it handles most kinds of music well enough.  People who think they're going to get great bass from a pair of 1" drivers need to adjust their expectations.  You can hear that bass is there, which is about all one should expect from something this size.<br/><br/>It paired with my phone very easily and I like how you can skip tracks directly from the speaker.  Battery life is phenomenal.  I just throw it on a charger every couple of weeks (just make sure it has power), but have not run out of juice.<br/><br/>The only reason I can't rate it 5 stars is because I felt like the bluetooth connection is a bit week.  With my phone in my pocket, I sometimes be 10 feet away, but the connection will cut out.  It's not awful, but can be very annoying.
 I had to send it back.  The battery would not hold a charge.  I fully charged the unit, then, a few hours later tried to turn it on, only to find that the battery had fully discharged and wouldn't turn on.  The unit must be defective and I'm returning it (Only had it for a few days, so the return should be no problem).  I imagine that this unit was defective.  Others may have better luck.
 I received my Anker SoundCore Bluetooth speaker yesterday, 6 days earlier than it was supposed to be delivered. Very happy about that. Now to the speaker. It came as expected, in an attractive black box and the speaker was in perfect condition. I opened it and was able, quite easily, to connect to my iPhone. (The directions could have been a little clearer) The sound was fantastic for what it is. (It's not a stereo system costing thousands of dollars) All levels of sound from the lows to the highs sound great. The bass was impressive. The distance that it kept playing from my phone also impressed me. I was about 30 ft away from the speaker with my phone in my pocket and it never missed a beat. Then forgetting that I still had the phone with me I proceeded to walk another 20 or so feet away and then even into my basement and the music was still playing without missing a beat. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a real nice portable Bluetooth speaker. You will NOT be disappointed!!!
 My sister had purchased an anker speaker for xmas 2016 for me and I really liked it. Great sound, long battery life, perfect fit for me. Unfortunately, the charging port broke and it seemed easier to just buy a new one rather than to fix the old one.<br/><br/>The new anker was smaller, but still very nice. The decibel level on the new one seems lower, but I can't be certain. The battery life on this model is excellent.<br/><br/>The reason I only give it 3 stars is twofold. First, when you turn the Anker to maximum volume it emits a high pitch beep, louder than the actual music, to let you know it can't go any louder.<br/><br/>Second, and more importantly, the Bluetooth capability on this model is ridiculously poor. I can't go more than 5 feet away from the speaker before it begins to cut in and out. The older model's range was much better than this one.<br/><br/>While the price is very reasonable, I don't know if I'd buy another one. There are plenty of Bluetooth speakers on the market currently and for its shortcomings I'd say it's worth exploring other speakers.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Anker contacted me about the issues with the blue tooth range, stating its an anomaly.  They were very proactive and immediately shipped a new Anker to me, without even asking for the old one back.  I haven’t had a chance to retrieve it yet, but based on the customer service experience they’ve provided I’m looking forward to enjoying using their speaker and look forward to my next purchase with them.  5 Star Service

With 24hr of power man its good. Plus I use this Bluetooth Speaker when I open it and it had enough charge for me to use it all day.
 I originally bought this speaker to use in my truck, so I could connect it to my iPhone instead of using the wireless headphones. I have yet to try that. I do however, use it when I am in the kitchen or any other room in the house and working for an hour or more.  I could play my music on my PC, but I have a wimpy speaker system, with the actual speakers mostly covered by the monitor.  So I can't turn the sound up as much as I need without distortion.  With this little speaker, I can set it up in whatever place I am working and get great sound!  I did however, just a few days ago, turned the music up too loud and for the first time got a small bit of distortion.  Would I plan to use this as my primary "party" sound system at home?  No I wouldn't.  Would it work great for an outdoor gathering? Absolutely!<br/>I highly recommend this speaker to anyone who needs or just wants good sound without having to adjust earphones all the time.
 I love listening to audio-books.  This speaker fit just right in my bathrobe pocket so I could walk around listening to my books.  I loved it so much I just bought another one to us as my computer speaker.  ONE WEEK after I bought the new one this one stopped working.  I could not get t to charge.  Now I see several others have had this problem.  Anker has been my go to company for quality products.  Now I am quite disappointed and wonder when the new one I just bought will stop working also.  $30 some dollars may seem like not a lot of money for some, but as a nurse, I have to save to buy these little gifts for myself.
 Not that I expected to be blown away by the sound, but for the price and size, these speakers have been great to use around the house and office. It is enough to fill up my classroom (I'm a teacher) if the students are working silently. It is okay as background music for a party as well. The best part is the battery life which has totally lived up to the 24 hour playback. Used it for roughly 6 hours a day all work week and there is still 10% left (according to my iPhone). It would be nice if it were a little more powerful and had a little more bass, but for the size and price, no complaints here!
 Sound quality was ok..battery life..excellent..fit an finish good.<br/><br/>Thats where the good features end..<br/>bluetooth dropped repeatedly..songs were crackling at times...volume was so so..range was not what was specified (66 feet)..more like 25-30 feet with little obstruction....can't use it through out the house....other options (JBL) do that easily.<br/><br/>All in all a below average speaker from a company who (in my experience) has delivered some pretty good mid level priced products<br/><br/>Footnote...I tried their "newer' model and it was not even as good as this one...quite disappointing<br/><br/>Returned all three and moved on...
 update: Because I loved this speaker so much I orderd Soundcore Flare Portable Bluetooth 360° Speaker by Anker, Party Speaker with All-Round Sound, Enhanced Bass &amp; Ambient LED Light, IP67 Waterproof Rating and Long-Lasting Battery Life  it sounded wonderful but it didn't last long, I think this was a fluke.  The reason I am updating this review is that this companies customer service is Amazing. The time was up for Amazon to help me so I called the company directly.  Rochelle at Anker helped me , she got me a new speaker shipped out and even voided my having to return the defective product. I will continue to do business with this company because they are so geared to customer service.<br/><br/>This little speaker is awesome.  The sound is great.  I was looking for something to listen to my television on because the speakers on it are way to loud and located in the back of the television so it directs sound everywhere but where I wanted it.  I had tried headphones but they are hot and stuffy or just not good sound, also inhibits my being able to hear things like the telephone and door bell.  This speaker has been my remedy.<br/>Easy to pair and the Anker people are wonderful I love all their products.
 I really like the product. Robust sound, excellent Bluetooth function. I use it in the shower (inside a plastic bag). This would be a 5-star review except for one problem. The recharging connection never worked all that well. For a while, I successfully used a rubber band to stabilize the wire at precisely the right angle. That angle is increasingly difficult to achieve, so recharging is a ritual, like a tightrope wire act. I have used numerous other connector wires, none any better. The part inside the ANKER is just not stable.
 I can honestly say out of the dozens of Bluetooth speakers that I've bought over the years, none of them top the Anker Soundcore! The amount of bass and crystal clear sound that this thing emits you would expect it to be a $200 speaker the size of a brick. Not this one, it's sized about as big as a glasses case. (BUT IT'S SO LOUD AND SO GOOD) The pros and cons of the Anker soundcore consist of:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Tremendous sound quality<br/>-Amazing bass<br/>-Bluetooth connects in seconds<br/>-Lightweight<br/>-Portable<br/>-Long lasting battery for the amount of sound and bass<br/>-Sleek and good looking<br/>-No unnecessary sounds like beeping on volume change<br/>-It feels heavy duty (idk I haven't dropped it yet)<br/>-It fits anywhere practical<br/>-Extremely low price for the quality of product<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Smudges appear on it like a sore thumb but can be wiped off<br/>-The manual is a bit difficult to read due to all the languages that Anker caters to<br/>-The edges petrude from the body a bit making it uncomfortable to hold in certain positions<br/><br/>And that about wraps it up. I, Joe Nobody, completely endorse this speaker and would guarantee satisfaction!
 Bought this and immediately had issues with it turning on.  Searched YouTube and saw someone say if you hold all the buttons down simultaneously for 30 seconds it would power up and work fine. Did that. Worked for less than a month and now it is a paperweight. Anker let me down with this one and I don't usually have problems with any of their products but now I'm second guessing ALL of their products.
 Received in 2 days! Was shocked to say the least.  I bought this because of the good price ($26.99) and past ANKER items I have purchased. (portable battery charger) and reputation of ANKER as well as reviews of this product.  Even though reviews list the base sound not so good, I disagree, and I was pleasantly surprised as to the all around great sound out of this small Bluetooth connected speaker and speaker volume more than adequate with no distortion of sound. It is surprisingly very good and I like it so much I am buying another for a friend of mine for a Christmas gift.  I followed someone's suggestion that if you place this speaker closer to a wall behind it, the sound will be enhanced, and it is!  I highly recommend this small ANKER speaker for a very modest price, I don't think you will be disappointed. Very easy to connect with my Bluetooth in android phone.
 Let me start with the main reason I bought this product was the pairing with my phone to use the built in voice speaker.  For that it works awesome.  You can very clearly and easily hear other person.  The 2nd reason I bought it was for use with audio books and some music.  Music is fine but a bit flat and clipped at louder volumes.  Great for audio books.  I think that this speaker plays well to the mid-range audio spectrum at a solid cost point for what you get.  I had a jam classic and this beats it hands down.<br/><br/>The biggest reason I gave it 3 stars is the inability to pair with more than one device at a time.  If I have it paired with my ipad it drops it to pair with my iphone.  My audio books are on one and phone on the other.  Just a small annoyance.
 The description says "astonishing sound" but it doesn't mention the maddeningly difficult process of linking with the speaker. Whether it's my computer or my phone, I've yet to find a combination of button pushing that quickly links either device with this speaker. It holds a charge well, it does what it's supposed to do - the sound is fine, but for god's sake - the idea of having no input cord is that it's supposed to be CONVENIENT. If that's not the case, I'm not sure what the advantage is...if you're a patient person who likes to keep trying, trying, trying to accomplish a specific task, this is a perfect opportunity for you to test your mettle.  Some Bluetooth devices are great - others, like this one...not so much. Very, very difficult to link...
 The sound quality is very good for the size of this speaker.  I wanted a small speaker to connect to my Amazon Echo Dot to improve sound quality.  Blue tooth connected easily.  My only issue (through my own ignorance of the technology) is that I wanted a speaker that could be plugged into power continuously so I didn't have to remember to charge it every couple days and this one cannot.  It seems that all the small blue tooth speakers are presumed to be for portability and therefore have a battery which is not recommended to be charging all the time.  I called Anker and they told me that all their blue tooth speakers are battery operated.
 Unbelievably HIGH-QUALITY &amp; BIG SOUND for the small size &amp; tiny price!!  Sounds GREAT, even near its Max Volume.  Amazing how Fidelity has Improved vs Price over time.  When I think of how much you'd pay for a GOOD BOOMBOX back in the day, and how Big &amp; Heavy they were along with the relatively Low Audio Quality - Loud Yes, but SO Much Distortion... and COMPARE ALL THAT to the pittance I paid for this thing and the Relatively EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH FIDELITY it produces - sure Not As Loud, but Who The Heck wants DISTORTED Music That LOUD anyway??<br/>When I bring it poolside and friends hear it, they LOVE it.  When I tell them how much it cost me, they Can't Believe It and Trip over themselves to get the Make &amp; Model so they order their own on Amazon ASAP.  Probably the Best $25 I ever spent on an audio purchase. Remember, it's Not a Big $1000 stereo so it's not going to sound like a Big $1000 Stereo, BUT... considering it's a single little speaker and that you could buy FOR of Them for $100, this Thing is AMAZING... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!  PS - When I think about a JVC Boombox I had back in the 80's that I spent $250+ for, this thing isn't as Loud overall, BUT from what I remember, I believe this little Anker will Play Better Fidelity Audio than that thing did, decibel for decibel.  Not Too Shabby.  Of course, back then, the Audio Source was part of the boombox.  You couldn't just buy a speaker to carry around because whatever system you took with you to enjoy on the go also had to contain the cassette player and/or the radio tuner in the same system as the speakers... one of the reasons you spent so much more for a portable audio system back then.  Even when the Walkman came along, it wasn't powerful enough to power anything more than the little headphones it came with.  We still had to have portable amplification and portable speakers.  So, the boombox was the ticket.  It's awesome now that we end up with what we'd consider back then as a set of "components" because you choose your audio player (mostly our phones now, even the iPod is pretty much obsolete with Pandora and increased internal/removable memory) and you can choose the size &amp; power of your "system" simply by picking your portable amplified speaker, like this little Anker.  You can get something bigger I guess, but to me this thing is more than loud enough for listening to while hanging out around the pool with friends. especially if friendly conversation is part of the plan.  Now, if the music needs to drown out a bunch of kids yelling &amp; splashing around, or if the music needs to be loud enough for a dance party, then you might want something bigger &amp; louder. But, if you just want something nice to listen to at a decent, adult volume, I think it's perfect for that.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot, Grab the Anker carrying case... Definitely worth it!  Enjoy!!
 I have had this speaker for about 3 months I use it every night at work and as the sound system in my truck it goes everywhere with me. I use it about 8-10 hrs a day usually at full volume and only charge it every 2 or 3 days. I work as an overnight freight associate and this speaker takes a beating, so far it has resisted the concrete floor from a 7 ft fall, the volume is loud enough to be heard 30-40 feet away and because it is blue it stands out so I haven't lost it. I saved the best for last the sound is fantastic not tinny like so many of the other speakers I have tried. I listen mostly to heavy metal, blues, and classic rock they all sound great on this speaker. I will highly recommend for anyone who needs portable music that is durable and on a budget it is a great buy
 I purchased this brand after enjoying their Bluetooth headphones for my workouts.  The Anker speaker arrived yesterday. Set up was easy and paired with my smart phone without any issues. I use the speaker for my room when I want to stream music or podcasts as I’m cleaning or getting dressed etc. For the price, the speaker works great. I wish it were a little louder but not a big issue.<br/><br/>Just so you know, I’m not paid for the review. I would give 5 stars if it were loud enough for me to hear in all rooms but it’s tiny and not intended to be surround sound lol. I’m very satisfied with the purchase.
 Good sound, but like some BT speakers, the charger input starts getting loose.  Reached out to Anker customer support nearly two weeks ago with only an automated response.<br/><br/>EDIT:  ANKER followed up quickly to that review, however, sending out a new replacement speaker quickly.  I bumped to 4 stars for good customer service, just wish the more private email attempt would have worked.  But job still done.  Good product.  If the charger input survives a year, I'll update to 5 stars.
 I originally purchased the Cambridge Sounds Oonz Bluetooth speaker but returned it due to it's terrible sound.  I purchased this Anker SoundCore and have been much happier.  It's not as good as a JBL Flip, but then again it's half the price. I would recommend this product if you're looking for a budget Bluetooth speaker.
 The charge on this speaker lasts me for a few months. I use it a few times a week and for a few hours a day and this charge lasts so long. I’m pleasantly surprised. It’s a heavy little speaker, which I like because with me, I associate heavy products with well made products. It’s also pretty darn loud. It’s syncs up to my iPhone 8+ easily and it also syncs up to my daughters iPhone with no problems. After she uses it, she just shuts off her blue tooth and when I need to use it, I just turn on my blue tooth and it syncs up with out any problems. I never had an issue with syncing.
 Absolutely amazing product! I was very surprised and impressed by three things. First - the overall weight, size, and craftsmanship is impressive, lending to an overall feel of high quality. (I've owned other wireless speakers which weighed very little, were incredibly small and assembly was sloppy.)<br/>Although the speaker is larger than I expected, it is a wireless speaker that one can hold in one hand!<br/>The sound quality is amazing..... I can actually watch videos and movies on my android and hear what is being said clearly with the Anker wireless speaker! I love it!<br/>As a previous satisfied Anker customer for a different product, I felt confident purchasing another product of theirs. I am not in the least disappointed. I plan to purchase more for holiday gifts. Enjoy!
 I love the Anker portable speaker. Quick pros and cons:  It has great range with the bluetooth, and it connects easily.  It is plenty loud, and there is no delay.  This is really important when listening to audiobooks.  I have had other bluetooth speakers that play music fine, but clip the first bits of words in an audiobook when there is too lengthy a pause.  They somehow require constant sound to keep from clipping.  There is no delay with the Anker so NO words get clipped.  It is plenty loud.  I can watch Netflix and the sound is in time with the action!! Yay!! The sound is very good.  It has good high, and good low range, but is missing a bit on the middle range.  This is not noticeable at all in an audiobook-- and not even in all music would it be noticeable.  However, my music for testing a speaker, is something from Michael Jackson with a heavy beat.  This will show a speaker's range from low to high including all the middle grounds.  Sadly, the Anker does not pass my "Michael Jackson" test, because it is lacking in the middle range.  However, it is still a full sound for most things, and it rocks my audiobooks.<br/><br/>Oh!!! I almost forgot battery life!! I should start by saying I fully charged it before using it, and then I ran it all the way out.  It took me more than a day.  It goes a really, really long time.  The battery life of the unit I have is fan-fricken-tastic.  I love it.  I listen to it a lot throughout the day, then I leave the house, and forget it, leave it going in standby mode, or go off into another room and forget my phone is connected to the speaker-- and still the battery keeps going for a few days on one charge with my use.<br/><br/>One of my least favorite things as an audiobook listener, in the past, has been that I forget that my phone is connected to a speaker, and I end-up leaving voice messages for people that are garbled and hard or impossible to hear.  Then I get a message from my husband-- "Hon, do you have your speaker on?"  That never happens with the Anker, unless I am upstairs and it is downstairs.  Messages left using the microphone on the Anker actually sounds better than messages left using the mike in my iphone.  I don't even have to be close to the speaker, I just have to be in the same room as the speaker.<br/><br/>Sidenote for people who are super sensitive to radiation levels of electromagnetic fields-- you might find this noticeable.  The benefit of great range in a bluetooth can't really come without just a little of that feeling.  I notice it a little-- but it is really otherwise such a great speaker.<br/><br/>Model I am reviewing (don't know it's number but this is the description): Anker Soundcore Bluetooth Speaker with Loud Stereo Sound, Rich Bass, 24-Hour Playtime, 66 ft Bluetooth Range, Built-in Mic. Perfect Portable Wireless Speaker for iPhone, Samsung and More.  Sold by Anker Direct, Fulfilled by Amazon. I got it in black.
 This speaker defies all expectations!  I don't listen to very loud music anymore. Frankly I use this mostly to watch YouTube videos, including, sometimes,  music. But this does get pretty loud, at least for indoor use. And the battery -- forget 24 hours. I couldn't believe how long it was going, so I wrote down the last time I charged it and turned it back on which was Sunday, 7/28@1:46am. It just conked out this morning, Friday, 08/03@10:03. That's over 5 DAYS folks! Was it CONSTANT play? NO, to be sure it was not. But it did stay connected to my tablet that whole time and was ready for a few hours play a day.  That's just amazing to me.
 Very happy with this purchase.<br/>Been looking for a good, cheap, stereo bluetooth speaker for awhile, this one came up as a gold box deal at a great price with excellent reviews so I just bought it on impulse.<br/>Never had a bluetooth device before so was a bit worried about pairing it with my MacBook Pro, but it was effortless.<br/>My laptop sits at one end of the house and I've been using the speaker at the other end of the house, which is about 50' and not a clear line of sight.<br/>Occasional slight hiccups in the signal, but really not a problem.<br/>The sound is good, plenty of volume and there's a surprising amount of bass for such a small device.<br/>Minus one star for a small complaint which I easily remedied; the buttons on top can be impossible to see in some lighting situations (particularly the situation in which I'm using it).<br/>I used a silver Sharpie to paint the raised shapes of the buttons - problem solved and it looks good, too.<br/>Seems like the manufacturer could add color to the buttons as easily as they paint the brand name on the speaker grill.<br/><br/>Would be nice to have separate buttons for skip forward and back, but for the price I paid, I'll make do with just double clicking the "play" button to skip forward and no skip back - no complaints, it works for me.
 Updated 09/2018.  I like this speaker so much that, after using one for a couple years, I bought a second one to use in the office. It sounds very well balanced to my ears, especially considering it's size.  Reasonable bass, although it benefits from some boundary reinforcement. Voices in podcasts sound realistic without becoming tubby. Treble sounds decent without becoming splashy.  It can play loud enough to fill a medium sized room with sound, although it won't blow you away when used outdoors.  If you want something to fill the backyard with sound for a party, a larger speaker would probably serve you better.  I use this speaker for several months typically without charging it, so the 24 hour rating is probably realistic.  And the Bluetooth range is sufficient that I can move this speaker anywhere around my house without losing the connection.  There's really very little to criticize here, especially for the $28 price.
 We have enjoyed this item after it was turned on. To turn it on however requires skills.<br/>Buttons are behind thick rubber lining (you need to press the rubber in a locations marked hoping to depress a button behind).<br/>Seams easy but it is not. I am strong man but I had to press so hard until my fingers hurt. It is possible that my fingers are too fat.<br/>My wife is not a weak person either but she was not able to turn this unit on at all.<br/>At first you may think that the unit is broken or discharged as there is no response to any buttons. Than you realize the problem and you get disappointed with the product - such a waste.<br/><br/>Regardless of good sound quality and significant loudness of the speaker we were forced to return this unit as it was not usable.
 I'm not one to continuously write reviews and I want to thank EVERYONE who submits reviews.<br/>I came across the packaging for this speaker today and checked my orders to see when I purchased this.  I have had this speaker since January 2016.<br/>I love this speaker.  It's not the best out there, but it is MAD AWESOME for what it is.  This is a simple bluetooth speaker that does not stop.  I have used this speaker almost every day since I received it.  The lows are low, the highs are clear with very little distortion in sound.  It's not extremely loud, but is loud enough to hear throughout my two story house.  The battery life is insane.  I didn't believe the 24 hour claim, in fact this was my first Anker product and didn't know that they manufactured some great products, and inexpensive items. But it lasts at least 24 hours on a charge.<br/>For a comparison, I also have a UE Boom.  The SoundCore's sound is less distorted for the most part, until you raise the volume up to max levels.  The UE Boom is louder, but again, there is some distortion in the sound at times.  Here's the kicker, almost the same sound, for $60-70 less.<br/>I would venture to say that if the SoundCore 2 has been improved as it's page says, I will definitely purchase that version when...if...this one dies.
 Wow! What a speaker! I do not claim to be an audiophile by any stretch of the word, but I do appreciate good sound. When I first purchased a surround sound system for my TV, I wondered why I hadn't purchased one earlier. It was the exact same thing with this speaker. The build quality is phenomenal. The rubberized material covering all but the front grill feels and looks great.  The little feet on the bottom keep it from sliding around. The blue LED indicating that it is on and connected isn't overly bright, but I don't tend to use it in the dark much.<br/><br/>It has great clarity and volume. I have used a few different Bluetooth speakers and this is definitely the best one I have had the pleasure of listening with. It is a smidge on the larger side (compared to some others I have used) but it is still very portable. The battery life is right on par with how Anker rates it. The microphone is a very nice feature to have added. I have used it a few times and it appears to work well. One thing I don't like about it though is that it is off on one side of the speaker. I feel that if you are located on the opposite side of where the mic is, it doesn't pick you up quite well enough.<br/><br/>All in all, this Bluetooth speaker is awesome. It is very convenient when moving around your house when cleaning and such. It is also a bit more convenient than getting my surround sound system hooked up to my phone just to do some general listening in the family room, while still being loud and clear (though it obviously isn't to the caliber of a 5.1 surround sound system). The other day we went camping and used it to listen to an audiobook for a little before turning in for the night. It really takes the audio and brings it alive regardless of what is connected to it. Going back to my first couple sentences... I can't believe I didn't buy one of these earlier!<br/><br/>**Update a year later**<br/>We still use this speaker on a regular basis. It works just as great as it did when I first reviewed the unit. My only complaint is that the USB port for charging has come a smidge loose. Sometimes when I need to charge it I need to sit there jiggling the USB cord for it to take the charge. I thought at first that it was the USB cable, but after testing other cables it is definitely the port on the speaker at fault.<br/>****<br/>Pros:<br/>+ Beautiful aesthetics, great rubberized texture<br/>+ Clarity and volume are fantastic for the size<br/>+ Lengthy battery life and can be used while charging<br/>+ Built-in mic for calls<br/>+ Very portable<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Blue LED might be annoying if using in a dark room<br/>- No charger included so you have to use a tablet or phone charger you already have (but you know that from the product description)<br/>- A smidge larger than some other comparable Bluetooth speakers<br/>- Mic totally off on one side, which I feel (maybe it was just me?) makes you need to be on that side when using it for calls
 UPDATE:<br/>I was very dissatisfied with this speaker because of the bass (lack of it), but Anker has a great customer service. I received an upgraded SoundCore 2 speaker within 3 business days and that one was just awesome. I really thing that it was is one of the best speakers on the market.<br/><br/>Very good sound quality, perfect battery life and awesome bass for the price. Strongly recommend it.<br/><br/>____________<br/>That's the first time when I am dissatisfied with Anker products.<br/><br/>Despite having almost 9 thousand reviews with 4.5 rating, this speaker is just bad.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- the price looks too good to be true, but once again, you get what you pay for.<br/>- the battery life is good,<br/>- I don't have any connectivity issues<br/><br/>BUT the sound quality is just not good. And the bass is just terrible. In fact, there is no bass at all.
 My phone can be plugged into a projector to watch a movie on the big screen, but the built-in speaker doesn't do it justice. I used it for a meeting and no one could year what the guy on the video was saying.  This speaker fixes that. It's loud, it's clear, and it's a surprising good frequency response. it claims a 24 hour battery life, but I haven't tried to run it down.  It took a few hours to charge up the first time and I haven't had to recharge it yet.  As with all Anker products the packaging was really nice, and it really makes it feel like a high end device.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R3NLEZVCR16O0G"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/D1riq9TvlxS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sv6FFiDHS.png"/> The coolest thing is that if I stream to 2 different ones at the same time, and they seem to be self correcting if there is a lag. I'm not sure if Anker company even realize, they self correct the lag, and sync the sound. Check out mine. Also, if they do fall out of sync because i moves further away from one,  I just stand between them with my S8 and they self correct, or I bring them close together. I call them my TWINS! I'm a Dj and have quite a few big speakers and am particular when it comes to sound, music, and ease of use! These speakers are nothing short of AWESOME!!! I HAVE 4!!<br/>Dj Supa Phly<br/>p.s. I have a plastic school container for a kids pencils, rulers, pen, (school supplies)  for my Twins.
 I received this as a gift and initially wondered what I would use this for. After a long motorcycle ride in 35 degree weather, I got home and jumped in the hot tub to warm my bones. I decided to give it a try. While getting feeling back in my body, I was surprised at the quality of the sound. I find myself using it anytime I'm in the garage wrenching on my bike or just hanging out on the porch having a beer or grilling.. Connection was quick and easy and the distance is more than acceptable. I'm not really sure of the battery life since I usually only use if for a few hours at a time. Fit and finish are very nice and I'm very happy with the flexibility of having a small portable speaker any time I need it.
 WoW! Great BIG sound in a little package. Bluetooth works well and the speaker can control volume, pause/resume and request a bluetooth connection. There is a small blue light to tell you that the unit is on and there is an audible tone to let you know when the unit has been turned on or off and when a Bluetooth connection has been made or terminated. You can keep the unit plugged in to any cell phone charger and keep it powered while listening or unplug it and move it anywhere within the 66 foot range of the signal. The battery will last an incredibly long time. I have been getting about 12+ hours of use out of a single charge and plugging it in for 20 minutes charges the battery another 30% or more. Charge port uses micro usb. A USB to Micro USB comes with the unit but you must supply a charger. I use an old 5w iPhone charger or my old 5w android phone charger. Bass is awesome in this speaker and it is about the size of a cracker barrel cheese brick.
 I got this little beauty January 7th.  I charged it once, and listen almost daily (give or take a few) often for hours at a time.  I am still listening on that first charge!<br/>I had originally purchased an Archeer A320 and loved the sound for music.  That battery would no longer accept/hold a charge only a year later. In reading reviews I found the battery to be a huge positive on this one, so I purchased.  I like the sound on this Anker for listening to podcasts much more that my previous speaker, however it lacks a little in the music department.<br/>I hope the battery continues it's stellar performance for much longer than the old speaker - that will make this  one the clear champ.
 i've used this several times and like it.<br/>the quality of materials and workmanship is high.<br/>it appears to faithfully reproduce the tones presented to it.<br/>the same artist will sound good or bad depending on the quality of the source.<br/>this is true with any speaker, the anker being no exception.<br/>give it a good signal and a good sound, and it will produce that music faithfully.<br/>overall, i'm satisfied with my purchase.<br/>it does last a long time between chargers.<br/>it can be transported anywhere in my apartment with no loss of quality.<br/>i can work in my kitchen and listen to any kind of music i want coming form my living room that is approximately 20 to 25 feet away.<br/>most of the music that i listened to came from youtube which is a decent source, but not the highest quality source as far as i know.
 This little speaker packs a lot of punch. Although the bass could be more pronounced, the 24 hour battery life more than makes up for it. I brought it to work, and used it on the factory floor, and was able to hear it above the presses. The rubberized coating on the speaker also offers a good grip surface. The only thing I found that was a teensy bit annoying was the control buttons being the same color as the speaker, it's easy to hit the wrong button accidentally, but it's not a big deal. I also tried it outside on a couple occasions, and it still had decent sound. Someone even asked where I'd gotten it, because they were looking for one. Walls do affect the range on this speaker, watch out for that. Overall, a very good speaker for the price.
 I've come to appreciate the quality performance of Anker products. This bluetooth speaker is no exception - I'm listening to as I write. Nice sound from a small package. Easy to pair with my phone and it quickly finds it each time I turn it on.<br/>I went ahead and purchased a hard case for it for protection. https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01F570JGC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/>I expect I'll get years of high performance service out of this product.  Thank you
 Sound is ok but really is missing the low frequencies, so not much bass comes out of this box. I could live with that, but what I can't live with is the ~3 second delay it has when it comes out of sleep mode. It's paired to my Alexa, so I ask a question or whatever, I don't hear anything except the tail end of her response. Got annoying really fast. So decent product buy poorly implemented design on the wake up response time.
 Purchased this to replace my Jabra Solemate that I somehow lost. I was originally excited because of all the great reviews, but found myself ultimate disappointed in the sound quality. The sound was a lacking the lower base. I returned it, and purchased a referbished Jabra Solemate for the same price. *Update* I have returned the item, and Anker reached out to me and offered a Anker Premium Bluetooth Stereo, which I accepted to try. I received it today and it a much better product IMO. I would say it would be worth the extra cost (currently $10) to buy the better version.
 Fast ship. Good product. My husband wanted a blue tooth speaker to listen to music as he worked on our rentals. He loves it. Kind of funny story, he came in one evening saying it saved his hand! A worker did not notice an older window was propped open by a wedge. The worker knocked the wedge out. The window came whizzing down before my husband could remove his hand - the ankee speaker that sat in the window opening absorbed the impact!
 Listen up - This review is NOT intended for audiophiles. This is a $35 bluetooth speaker. You are getting what you pay for.<br/><br/>That being said, for the price you pay for this speaker, you are not going to find a better bluetooth speaker on the market anywhere. Period. Sure, you can pay $99 - $499 and get a higher quality sound. But the difference in price between those speakers and this one is NOT going to improve your sound quality enough to justify the higher cost. This speaker is well built, has ample volume, decent (but not insane) bass and clear enough mids to satisfy anyone who wants portable sound.<br/><br/>The speaker can be used while it is being charged, it has a fairly long battery life (I got over four hours on a single charge before it started beeping at me) and it connects very easily.<br/><br/>This is an amazing little product.
 I am pleased with this purchase. I set it up with help from a YouTube video, the instructions were small print and videos offer more information. The speaker was plenty loud for my use.  It is not meant to fill a stadium. As mentioned the bass will not knock you out but again met my need. It is quality construction and should last with reasonable care. It took a couple of hours to completely charge for the first time. It is very easy to use and the buttons have a positive feel. It paired right away and continues to operate well on Bluetooth platform. I got it on a lightning deal but would have purchased it at full price and been happy.
 I have used this mostly a bluetooth speaker in the car for spoken audio (talk radio, podcasts, etc.).  It has great clarity for dialogue and the frequency response seems well-suited for my use.  I would not be happy if I was using this for music because there is very little bass, and secondly the maximum volume is barely adequate for even my uses. It fits great on the dash and wedged against the windshield, which helps amplify the volume.<br/>Bluetooth pairing was easy and reliable.
 I've had the black one for a month and it works great. Bought it to listen to music and watch movies indoors; paired with phones and laptops. Nice packaging, easy setup, and it's about the size of tv remote but twice as thick. Sound quality is not as good as some folks would like, but for a $30 bluetooth speaker, it's a great deal. It automatically turns off within a few minutes if it isn't paired with a device. To pair with a device, you need to be around 50 feet away, so not far off the listed 66 feet mark. Haven't had any issues with charging; not sure how long the charge lasts, but I use it while I'm working during the day for at least 4 to 6 hours. I've only charged it 2 or 3 times since I bought it; 1 charge out of the box and a couple random charges. I wouldn't be surprised if the battery lasted longer than 24 hours, but I haven't tested that yet. I've also dropped it from the kitchen table and it still works; glad for the rubber-like shell, otherwise, hard plastic could've cracked.
 Just received this and it was really easy to set up.  I paired it to my Amazon Echo. Setup is really straight forward and the echo does all the work.  It comes with instructions if you want to call them that. They are printed in several different languages and not separated by language. Each sentence is repeated directly underneath with the other languages. Very confusing.  And the print is sub-molecular and you need an electron microscope to read them.<br/><br/>The look and finish are top notch; as is with every Anker product I own.  Not a light weight toy, this unit has some gravity in it.  As for sound quality, fantastic for such a small device. Volume and tone are par with upper-end table radios.
 So excited when I got my notification that my speaker was delivered. I instantly torn open the box and was delighted to find my speaker. First off, it's smaller than I expected and I even looked at the pictures posted online. I thought maybe this will do for now. Powering it on was easy and so was pairing it to my iPOD. Turned on Venus by Lady Gaga and was instantly disappointed. I could fell the bass but I couldn't hear it. If that makes sense. I thought maybe I should change it to another song. Nope, still let down. I turned the volume all the way up and heard some beeping noise. My ears aren't clogged or filled with air like on an airplane, so I'm really puzzled. I have a JBL Clip and it's louder than this speaker. I guess maybe I shouldn't be as disappointed because the speaker only cost $36 but I still am. Returning as soon as possible.
 EDIT---- Customer Service has been wonderful. I was contacted immediately after this review and they sent me a new replacement speaker at no additional charge!!! This one is working great. I have had multiple emails and phone calls following up with me from ANKER to make sure I am satisfied with their service and my new speaker. EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!👍<br/><br/>Its a decent enough bluetooth speaker for the price. we bought it to use on the beach. the problem wasn't being at the beach, it was always on top of our wagon, never wet or with sand. It worked fine the first day, then started blanking out, but it wasn't the volume. I had to keep restarting songs from apps that I was in. If I just listened to the same song list on my phone, it played fine so I know it was something with the speaker. The problem is my husband threw away the Anker box that it came in before I could get to it.
 Love this thing, especially for under $30. Sound quality is great for the size, battery seems to last forever (I’ve owned it for months and have only charged it twice). Just ordered a second one. Only downside is the Bluetooth connection gets funky when you try to switch paired devices. You need to disconnect and connect via the device (phone, tablet, etc.) and not use the Bluetooth button on the speaker, as that will wipe out the other stored connections. Other than that one minor issue, this thing is great for a little speaker.
 Love this little speaker for the price!  I don't know how much playing time I get out of it but it seems like I rarely need to charge it.  I use it at work out in the field while I'm working so It gets sometimes a few minutes to a few hours here and there throughout the week.  Connecting via bluetooth to my phone is a breeze and volume level is decent for it's size.  Maybe it's no JBL or Bose, but it packs a lot of sound for it's size and cost!  I would not feel comfortable taking a $100+ speaker in the environment where I work, but again for the cost of this, I don't feel so bad..  This speaker is a very portable size allowing me to place it on a variety of surfaces and it's fallen several time and gotten a little banged up, but that hasn't affected anything so far.  So far I've been impressed with Anker products for build quality, performance and price!
 I've had this for about 9 months now. So far, no problems with anything. The number one thing about this speaker is how long it lasts! The fact that I don't have to charge this every 3 or 5 or 7 hours is a big thing because I already have enough devices to charge all the time. I think there are times where I didn't charge this for up to 4-5 days!! (with minimal use). This speaker is always connected and designated for my laptop since my laptop speakers suck. I have to say the sound is not bad for how small this thing is. I'm not picky when it comes to sound. As long as the highs are not too high or the lows are not too low, then that's fine with me. This goes pretty loud as well. The sound's not distorted either when you go to the highest volume. It does sound a bit controlled maybe to avoid the distortion. Also, the connectivity on this speaker can go very far. I remember bringing my laptop in the game room or downstairs, and it was still connected. (I couldn't hear any sound from my laptop speakers).<br/><br/>The only thing I don't like about this speaker is when you try to pair it with another device like a phone or a tablet that it takes too long to connect or sometimes it doesn't connect at all. I also have to pair it back again to my laptop because my laptop could not recognize it.
 This is plug and play at its easiest.  I bought it to augment the speakers on my laptop and can hear much better with the speaker hooked up.  The fact that it is Bluetooth instead of wired is great.  There are no cords tethering my laptop with the speaker.  The sound is crisp and clear and the volume levers are more than sufficient.  I also like the size as it isn't too large to be easily carried wherever you want to place it.  I have purchased several Anker products in the past and have never had any trouble with any of them.  I would definitely recommend purchasing this Bluetooth speaker.  The one small thing that could be improved is the visibility of the controls on the top.  They are difficult to see unless you have bright lighting.
 Buy it. Seriously. I had previously bought a little Bluetooth speaker that lasted a few months. I had to change it a lot, and dropped it a few times. It fell apart. I was trying to decide wether to buy one one of the $120ish Bluetooth speakers or this. Read some reviews, figured I’d give it a shot. It does not disappoint! Have had it 9 months. Sound is very impressive coming from such a small little speaker! Has good range, I can be upstairs with my phone and it’s about 20 feet away and through a wall and works fine. Has incredible battery life, I am always surprised how long it lasts. Have dropped it a few times with no issues. A great purchase!
 This little thing is loud! I like how is has some bass to it. Doesnt take the quality of the sound away. For its price and for its size. It does a hell of a job! I would buy again.<br/>Bought this way before it had became super popular, was also on youtube reviews and made me happy that I had purchased this and hearing them also agree it being so good. I am not being payed for this, but I just love it. I use it for my monitor since my monitor doesnt have any Speakers and this makes up for it. Portable, compact, bluetooth and headphone jack.
 So I'm a mom of teens now, and I need to crank up my music when I need to drown them out. Unfortunately, this little speaker isn't loud enough to cover their whining &amp; complaining. If anyone has any suggestions for a louder speaker that rattles the windows, for under $50, lmk!<br/>The Max volume on this thing is my low average listening volume and has good quality, albeit with the base on the wimpy side. Overall, it sounds good at "conversation" volume, but don't expect it to deliver sanity-restoring, club-like, exhilarating high volume.
 I can hardly believe what a fantastic deal this speaker is! Compact, nice looking, great sound quality and range for an AMAZING price. Seriously, just stop looking now, cause you aren’t going to find anything better at this price point.<br/><br/>As a bonus, Anker is an awesome company with stellar customer service that makes quality products at affordable prices, a practice which I make a point to support whenever I can. And no, I don’t work for them, I’m just a long-time fan :)
 The battery life on this speaker is pretty amazing. I bought it in January and have used it about half an hour to an hour a day since then. It has never ran out of power and I have only plugged it in once. The sound is excellent for a cheap speaker. Unfortunately, it's very hard to connect via bluetooth. I connect it to my computer and phone and you have to forget the speaker on one device to use it on the other. Moreover, sometimes it doesn't want to connect at all and you have to forget the speaker and re-pair it with your device. Sometimes it takes a few minutes to set up. I don't think there is another way to connect it besides Bluetooth either which is a little unfortunate. Other than that, it is an excellent speaker.
 Im enjoying this inexpensive bluetooth speaker; I use it with my iPhone 6.<br/><br/>Update:  the item I enjoyed, but short lived, it lasted about 9 months. It just won't wirk, I fully charge then turn on, but won't connect to same iPhone it's the only device I use it with.<br/><br/>Another update:  the vendor saw my review about his lasting about 9 months, they said they wanted to make good and send me a new one which after several emails of promised to send new updated one, NEVERTHELESS THEY DID NOT EVER SENT THE PROMISED ITEM REPLACEMENT.  Bummer thought what a great promise of building my hope...  actually it was a nice speaker if 9 month is all you need.<br/><br/>Update:  vendor never did honor there promise to send replacement for an item that last least than a year.<br/>If you don’t mind replacing the it 2x a year; it’s sounds good<br/>Vendor makes promises and never keeps them, I would find a different vendor.
 I ordered this to use with my tablet. Item was as described and delivery was fast. Good sound and easy to connect to my tablet. Only negative thing to say is that the volume is a little lacking for me. Even at full is is still not enough for me. I will admit that my hearing is poor at best. This is a good product for the price. Just not enough for my specific needs.<br/><br/>A few days after writing the above review I was contacted by the seller. They offered to send me a better SoundCore 2 speaker totally free of charge. I was told I would have it in about 5 business days after it had shipped. I got it in three. Same quality and esse of use but a MUCH better sound and much more volume. If you are thinking about getting something like this I highly recommend the SoundCore 2. Little more money but it's worth it. And the customer service is second to none.
 I got this as a gift for my birthday and instantly fell in love with it. As someone who doesn't particularly care for reading the manual, I found using it to be such a seamless experience from the start. I just put it on and put on my phone's bluetooth and they connected almost immediately. And then came sound. The rich, powerful sound that came from such a tiny machine immediately caught the attention of anyone else in my house. My family all came around to marvel with me at the sleek black 'battery'(as my mom calls it haha) give us an auditory experience as we tried a wide range of genres ranging from classical music to hip hop and even some country. The deep bass, and well balanced highs and mids made it pretty amazing.<br/>Lastly, the battery life. I've never left it on for 24 without taking it off, but i've had it for a few months, with fairly regular use and have charged it about 2 times. And not even because it was discharged but because I just figured it must be low on juice.<br/>All in all, amazing product and well worth the money. A must buy if you're in the bluetooth speaker market.
 I would like to give it 5 stars.  The battery life and sound are just great.  I love the thing and have used it for a whole year almost every day.  But now I'm having problems getting it to charge.  The mini usb port is having trouble holding the mini usb charging plug and maintaining contact.  The red light will not stay on consistently.  If I fiddle with with it and hold the plug at exactly the right angle, the red light will stay on briefly, but the minute I let go, the light goes out and it's not charging any more.<br/><br/>Since the Warranty is 18 months, I have requested a replacement from Anker via their website.  I hope they will send a new one because other than the charging problem I love this thing.<br/><br/>Update:  Anker shipped me a completely new unit.  I am delighted with it and with the incredible customer service.  I love a company that stands behind its products and works hard to build customer loyalty.  I will definitely look at Anker in the future for these kinds of purchases. Changed to 5 stars for the overall experience with unit and Anker customer service.
 I read a lot of reviews about this product before I bought it, I was not disappointed with the product I received. It is just loud enough for my needs and it is very clear. The outside soft rubber feels good to the touch and it is appealing to look at. My one gripe is one I've seen mentioned before, the blue light that's off-center behind the speaker grill, using the speaker at night can put that light right in your eyes as you're sleeping if you're like me and you position the speaker facing you. Overall a very good speaker.
 Just got this bad boy, and I love it, I got the red one because I think it will hold up better in the sun and not overheat as quickly or possibly not at all but Texas heat is pretty intense in direct sunlight.  They connect very well and easily, I haven't had it disconnect at all but I have set to really test the distance and the "through walls" connectivity.  Crystal clear with little or no distortion.  Some songs a full volume have a slight and occasional rattle.  Overall I'd say these are great sounding, small speakers with great battery life.
 If there is a purchase I have been completely satisfied with, this is it. You guys have no business selling these for that price. I am blown away by the sound quality. The build quality is tough, like you would expect something of high quality to be. Has taken some hard drops(on the road, in the bathroom, while playing soccer) still working perfectly fine.<br/>Sometimes people do rev battles with huge cars, I have been doing sound battles with BOSE and JBL and would you belive it? ANKER won every time. When it comes to the speakers of this Tier, ANKER is leading it<br/>Amazing Battery Time; I really have not charged it for like 2 weeks, my daily usage is around half an hour still running. Definitely gonna buy Anker's portable chargers now because it's battery quality and lifetime has seriously impressed me.<br/>Fits Perfectly in my backpack's side pockets.<br/>Half of the football field can clearly hear my song collection with Anker's amazing speakers.<br/>Belive me I never expected this to be so good.<br/>Definitely Recommend it
 I'd like to start by saying I detest false advertising/claims. And while vendor/seller wants to move product, at the very least, every buyer/client wants what was promised and to be treated fairly when things go awry.<br/>This is my 4th Anker product (backup battery, USB chargers, cables) and they never make claims their products can't support.  This is not a bass thumping portable speaker, and Anker never said it was...there are 2x40mm speakers, that's essentially a tweeter on larger speakers; what's amazing is the bass you do get.  It's not alot and it's not going to shake your world, but considering the enclosure size, it's very enjoyable to be able to listen to your tunes anywhere!<br/>I'm comparing my old Creative D100 to the SoundCore and yes the larger speakers on the D100 produce more bass but the SoundCore generates more volume at max; and like everyone says, it's pretty clean with very little distortion.  But this is not a party speaker, it's for light listening, maybe to enhance a movie on your laptop/tablet, camping, background music at the BBQ/beach, etc. And for these functions this speaker over-delivers, at $35, you can't help but smile :)<br/>Seriously, why spend more for nominal return on reliability and sound quality.
 Revised Review:<br/>After my initial review(below), Anker promptly reached out to me, apologized for my inconvenience and offered to send another speaker for reevaluation. I agreed and received the new speaker soon. Anker also made effort to explain that the primary purpose of the speaker was for listening music and is not intended as a speaker/mic. for phone(although, it can be used as one).<br/>I like the fact that even though my return timeframe had expired and I had no expectations from the sunk costs, Anker customer made up for for my experience.<br/>I'm impressed by Anker's customer service. 5 starts for the customer service, reaching out, damage control...<br/>Overall, in this price range, the new speaker holds itself well. Battery life is pretty good too! I also like the premium surface finish.<br/><br/>Original Review(1 star rating) : RETRACTED:<br/>Disappointed. It used it only a couple of times, and am unimpressed with its sound quality. While my original purpose for buying this unit was to have hands-free calling, the favorable reviews of listening music on the speaker raised my expectations. Turns out, the sound quality isn’t good enough for indoor hands free calling. I use my phone’s speaker for hands free calling instead!<br/>Originally bought after taking note of the favorable reviews and rating, my trust in amazon ratings is now shaken. How can such a poor quality product have such a good rating.<br/>I realized I’ve gotten late in returning this product, so I’ll likely throw it.
 I don't know if there is much else I can add about this little speaker.  It had very favorable reviews which is why I purchased it.  I think the sound is great for such a little thing.  One caveat, as others have mentioned, the blue light on the front to indicate pairing status is extremely bright in a dark room.  I took others advice and slapped a piece of black electrical tape over it and we are living happily ever after.  I use it at night to listen to music to fall asleep so I can't speak to the overall loudness but it has a great overall sound.  In fact, vocals sound better on it than a much more expensive speaker that I use on my computer.  Had no difficulty pairing to my iTouch (5th gen. I think) and pairs easily with my iPhone 8.  I would buy it again but I hope I don't have to any time soon.
 We have to use our phones hands-free in NY state.  My new iPhone has only the lightning connector, so if I use a headset (like I did for years), you cannot plug in the phone to charge.  I bought this to use as a hands-free as my car does not have built in bluetooth.  It works great!.  It wanted to slide around on the dashboard, so I used a little tacky putty like you use with pictures on the wall - problem solved.<br/>Beyond that, the sound for music is plenty good and loud (at least in the car).  I would put this even with the Jawbone Jambox (which my son has) which is quite a bit more expensive.  I am totally satisfied with this purchase.
 This is the third Anker speaker I’ve purchased so I can use them around the house and outside. These are  extremely easy to use, surprisingly good quality sound, good volume level, and amazing battery life. Also, they are easy to grab and take to my elderly mom’s apartment to play her favorites. I also own other Anker products (mobile charging units) that I’ve used for years and I’ve never been disappointed with their quality and durability.  Can’t beat it especially at this price.
 Love this speaker. Bass is decent and highs are clear. The battery last forever. Best $30 I have spent in awhile.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Battery will not hold a charge only 4 months after minimal use. Pretty disappointed.
 I was very surprised with the speaker. I'm a borderline audiophile and I bought this for the Samsung Tab a 10.1 because anything sounds better than the speakers on it. The speaker is definitely not an audio file category, but it puts out a really nice clear sound. I messed with every setting possible on my tablet and hook it up to my note 9. I would have to say it sounds the best right on the box. If you're on the fence about buying this. Don't be it's a very nice solid sounding speaker. With very good sound reproduction.
 You get pretty good sound with such a small device. You get what you would expect. Forward 3 years later, I have found the charging port is broken. I emailed Anker and yes I was beyond the 18 month warranty so I was refused service. I guess that is reasonable. I've always been a fan of Anker products, I have some of their batteries and recommend them to my friends. While I can't really complain, I really wished they would have helped me out. Broken charging ports are very common with micro usb devices....Therefore product loses stars for material quality.
 Great product and great customer service.  I had this for about 6 months, and all of a sudden, it refused to turn on.  Charged with different cables, sources and charging seems to complete, but still refused to turn on.  I contacted support on Friday, got a response with diagnosis tips, and I responded with my trouble shooting and pictures on Saturday and was told that a replacement unit will be shipped under warranty terms.  Monday afternoon, a replacement product arrived.<br/>Bottom line, this is a great little speaker, great sound and ease of use, but their customer support/service is to be commended with a five star rating.
 This speaker is quite amazing. I barely remember charging it that's how long the battery life goes. Of course my usage is not extensive, I use it in the house while cooking or cleaning on the weekends for a couple of hours at time so it is not stretched to its capacity. But I still would recommend it for the price, sound quality &amp; battery life.<br/>Only took a star off due to the buttons being a tad bit hard to press &amp; oily fingerprints staying on the buttons. But that's not a deal breaker for me at all.
 I loved this speaker! You see I have an older car, with crappy speakers, no usb, no blue tooth, just the radio from the front right speaker! I decided to give the Soundcore speaker a try in my car. This thing worked GREAT! It always connected to my phone without issues, it had awesome sound quality, and the phone calls I received were clear to both ends of the call. I got to use the Soundcore for about a month during my daily ~2 hour commute to work. Sadly, I came outside one morning, and it was no longer in my glove compartment! A thief had broken into my car and got away with the Soundcore. So dear thief, I hope you enjoy that Soundcore just as much as I did. It's a great speaker, and for people like myself (crappy sound/no connections in your car) it is a very good (and inexpensive) alternative for listening to things in your car.
 GREAT little speaker with excellent sound quality. Rich bass tones. Totally portable &amp; easy to use.
 I bought it for me, so I could jam out while showering... then it was moved to the living room so the kids could jam out while I made dinner... then the husband hooked it up to the TV as a soundbar and realized it was better than the actual soundbar we had... I haven't gotten it back yet. Grr. Buy more than 1. Oh and the battery life is fantastic. I've only charged it once, when I first bought it a couple months ago and I haven't had to charge it again yet; I don't use it every day, but roughly 2 or 3 times a week for about 3 hours at a time.
 UPDATE on 1/9/18: After posting my review, the company contacted me by email. They replaced my speaker with a new model at no charge. It's working great. I have to give them credit for their A+ customer service!<br/><br/>I bought this speaker less than six months ago, and now it won't even turn on anymore, even when fully charged. It's junk! Do not buy this speaker.
 I have been looking for a bluetooth speaker for while now, but I just didn't want to spend a ton of money. This is a great little speaker. I haven't had any issues connecting to the bluetooth. It gets pretty loud (loud enough for my whole apartment). The only issue I have had is that it will sporadically beep really loudly. At first I thought it might be because it is at full volume (which it wasn't) or that it needed a charge (but it does it after it is at a full charge). I'm not really sure what the beep means but it is a minor issue.<br/>I'm going to try to call Anker customer service to see if they have any fixes for the loud beep.
 I've had a handful of bluetooth speakers over the years.. this has been my favorite so far!<br/><br/>I listen to the news in the morning and music in the evening... this speaker is exactly what I've been looking for! It's splashproof so I can listen with it in the bathroom and portable so I can bring it to the kitchen or a friend's house!<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Battery: I charged my speaker when I got it in the mail on 2/7... I use it for an hour or so every day (it's 2/22) and I haven't had to charge it yet!<br/>Size: I thought it was going to be larger than it was, but I'm glad it's not so big-- it travels really well, and is sturdy.<br/>Quality: I've dropped it from my bathroom counter and no ill effects.<br/>Sound: Sound quality is great-- I keep it on a shelf near my shower and I can hear my music and my news over the water and the shower fan running.<br/><br/>Cons (very minor):<br/>Bluetooth: The bluetooth can be a little spotty with the connectivity-- It's not so great at "remembering" my phone if I leave the speaker turned on and leave the house... the speaker doesn't automatically connect as I thought it would.<br/>Buttons: The play button isn't so responsive when it's double-clicked (to skip songs)... sometimes it pauses instead of skipping ahead, but that's a very minor annoyance
 Was looking for a good speaker and after looking at so many, I came across this Anker speaker. I read many reviews on it, many which were good reviews, so I decided to purchase it. Received it the following day but not working! It would not turn on at all. Charged it for a little over an hour (thinking maybe it didn’t have battery) and all that I got was a hot speaker. Pretty bummed. Will look for another speaker
 Love it , it connects instantly &amp; batt life lasts about a week not super loud but nice volume &amp; clarity for the money &amp; love the rubberized coating sticks anywhere you put it &amp; very compact more for indoors though not loud enough for outside use in my opinion but still happy with purchase nice lil Bluetooth clear speaker &amp; connects instantly have a 10× bigger bob Marley wood Bluetooth speaker &amp; it doesent connect as fast as this 1 sometimes it will loose connection never happened with the ANKER I LEFT IT ON BY ACCIDENT ALL DAY WOKE UP NEXT DAY STILL ON LONG BATT LIFE FOR A LIL GUY
 I admit that I wasn't expecting much. I watch many documentaries on YouTube on my phone and the sound is just atrocious so I decided to give this a try. To put it mildly I was floored.<br/><br/>The bass is very nice as I tested it on the Temptations Papa Was a Rolling Stone. I'm using it at home, I use it while driving in the car, and I take it to work where I hide it on a shelf and the first day both fellow employees and customers thought it was our in-house speakers but wondered why it was coming from a different location. I take it 2 floors down into the cellar when I do my laundry and it plays clear as a bell.<br/><br/>I put it in my inside breast pocket of my jacket and take it with me wherever I go. I know this may sound over the top but it's the best purchase I've made in a long time.
 This little Bluetooth speaker is amazing. Well packaged, paired easily with my Android phone. But the best part is the sound quality and the way it interfaces with my music app. I saw in a review that another person had similar positive results with his music app. I can control volume and song selection from either the phone or speaker itself. I heard instruments on familiar CDs that l hadn't heard in a long time. I have played it in my car and in my camper.  I have used it for multiple phone calls  as well. I will admit that the first one was by accident as I did not realize it had this capability. One feature they could add that would be nice would be a better level of charge indicator. It only blinks red when low but until then l have no idea what percent charge my speaker is at. Overall, excellent product all around. I will be demonstrating this speaker to others. It is well worth the price.<br/>6/28/2017 update: I am in my camper listening to peaceful music. This little speaker sounds wonderful like the day l bought it, plays on and on without charge (l cannot think of any battery powered device that even comes close to this). One amazing product. Cannot say enough good about it. This is not even a review in return for free product. Don't even own stock in the company but wish I did.
 I am SO happy I bought this and didn't invest hundreds in another bluetooth speaker. I was apprehensive because I wanted good sound quality. We take this camping, listen in the kitchen and in the backyard at home and it's perfect in every setting!!<br/>We have had multiple friends come over and ask what kind it is and everyone buys it immediately. It holds a charge for a really long time (I've never kept track but I've only charged it a couple times since I bought it last year).<br/>My mom has a Bose and I can't tell the difference and I like the look and controls on this one better than hers!
 I normally don't write reviews, however after I initially planning on buying a small wifi speaker to use with my android phone, I purchased this one for a slight bit more based on the great reviews.<br/>I can hold this speaker in 1 hand, very quickly charged and paired with my phone.<br/>Once on, I was EXTREMELY IMPRESSED with the sound, clarity and overall quality and performance of this speaker.<br/>The sound is truly outstanding for the size and cost!<br/>I am certain paired with a TV, the sound is equivalent to an expensive soundbar. With 2, I am certain it would surpass.<br/>And......this is portable!!<br/>You will not be dissatisfied!!
 When I opened the box it had just a single speaker and a card that was ripped in half.  I was a little disappointed that it didn't come with a charger or manual but i found a USB cord and started charging it.  After the red charge light on the side turned off i attempted to pair it with my phone.  My phone said it was paired and i could get the songs on my phone to 'play', skip, etc, however there was one problem.... NO SOUND. My phone said it was all working, etc, but there was no sound coming out of the speaker.  I started googling reviews and tips for getting to work. Nothing helped.  So within a couple hours of reciving it I decided to return it and debated about whether or not i wanted to order another one. I gave in and ordered another one before i had even returned the other one.  I received the replacement today and was surprised at what i found.  The new box had the speaker in a sealed plastic bag, a charging cable, a manual, and the same card that came in the firat one, only this card wasn't ripped in half. (?) I broke open the box i had sealed waiting for UPS to pick up for return to take pictures. I paired the new, already FULLY CHARGED speaker to my phone and it made a beeping noise when i turnes it on and when i paired it up, which the first one did not do, and it works like a champ. Luckily I have prime with free shipping and returns or i might not be so happy right now. 😊 Now if i can just get UPS to come pick up the defective one they were supposed to pick up yesterday....
 I have been through a few smaller, cheaper bluetooth speakers and they were always glitchy and couldn't hold a charge. After searching for the best speakers under $50, I decided to put my eggs in the Anker basket - and I couldn't be more pleased! I ordered the speaker to provide ambiance at a BBQ while my son was in town visiting, so I charged it fully a day before the BBQ, which was on June 24th, and I haven't charged it since. It's still showing over 1/2 battery full as I'm listening to it while I write this review. And, I haven't taken it easy on the speaker. I have listened to it while cooking, reading on the back patio mostly every summer night, wile cleaning, in the shower (it's on the counter, not in the shower - not waterproof), and while getting ready for work in the mornings. I've definitely put it through its paces and it's standing up beautifully and hasn't been charged except that first time.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Excellent battery life<br/>-Great sound quality<br/>-Easy to set up and pair with both my phone and computer<br/>-Compact enough to be unobtrusive, but big enough to provide loud sound for those of us who like to rock out!<br/>-Great price<br/><br/>I highly recommend it!
 Sound quality is great, the battery life is obscene, and it connects easily.<br/><br/>JBL can suck it with their equivalent models, this is the one you want.<br/><br/>The range is fantastic, the built in mic makes answering phones on the road easy.<br/>I bought this for my Echo dot, and I take it in my piece of junk KIA that only has a broken CD player.<br/>Very solid quality, it has some heft, and the size is perfect.<br/><br/>Notable, though: the built-in mic doesn't work with the Echo dot, but that's normal for bluetooth devices and the echo.
 Great sounding portable speaker.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Clean, crisp sound.<br/>- Easy sync thru Bluetooth.<br/>- Has alternate headphone jack<br/>- Super long battery life<br/><br/>Cons;<br/>- Plays EVERYTHING from your phone when sync'd; plays notifications, alarms, ringers, etc. which isn't bad...it is just way louder than the music that is playing.<br/>- Auto sync feature can be a little annoying; always want to sync when my phone is in range, even when it is already being used by anther device plugged into the jack.<br/>- Only sync one device at a time with auto sync on.<br/><br/>Great sounding little speaker for the cost (~35 USD). Mostly the cons are around my stubbornness to set-up a profile when synced to this device. The speakers are a little on the heavy side, but I expect that from a Semi-premium product.
 I received one of these anger sound codes in Black last year for Christmas and my husband is always stealing it! For his birthday a few weeks ago I thought I’d grab him his own, but in blue. The sound quality is awesome and the volume gets pretty loud too. For the price, it can’t be beat! Great little speaker for while cleaning the house, working in the garage or out at the park or beach! My husband loves his and has used it everyday since. The only trouble we have is sometimes the wrong phone will try syncing to the wrong device, but it’s a quick fix :)
 I’ve had this gem for slightly over a year and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this speaker! The price was beyond reasonable, the battery life is great, and the speaker quality is amazing (at least for me). The range of the Bluetooth capability allows me to leave my phone in my bedroom while using the speaker in my kitchen which is on the other side of my apt. It’s also great in the shower. I’m able to use it to listen to music or even talk on the phone while bathing. I think the capability of talking on the phone while in the shower is the most exciting part for me. The people I speak to can clearly hear me on the other end and I can clearly hear them.<br/><br/>I charge this speaker so infrequently I can’t even tell you how often I charge it. That’s how great the battery life is. I use it for about an hour a day. I would DEFINITELY recommend this speaker and plan on buying another one.
 Great little speaker at a very reasonable price. Considering its low cost, I was worried that this speaker wouldn't produce good sound, but I decided to take a chance since the vast majority of its reviews here on Amazon were very positive. I'm glad I did - this speaker is compact, elegant, and produces a nicely balanced range of sound that's perfect for my needs - I stream music and podcasts. The bluetooth pairing with my Echo went flawlessly, too.
 The sound quality is rich particularly if you like treble and mid range.  The bass is just the slightest but lacking.  The range of sound is really surprising.  This small speaker casts off sound as if there were two or three speakers in the room.<br/><br/>I've bought Anker in the past and liked it.  This is an improvement on that now years old model although it is still working excellent at my office.<br/><br/>The Bluetooth connection was quick and without and challenge on my Pixel phone.  Enjoy-I surely am.<br/><br/>Finally the photo is of the red Anker I just bought and behind it is a standard size smart phone so you can see the scale easier.
 I can't say enough good things about both the product and the seller. I'd been using Oontz Angle speakers before, and though they are about the same price, Anker is in a different league entirely. They're really well made, the sound is great, I don't have any bluetooth issues (as I did with Oontz), and the battery lasts a really long time.<br/><br/>As for the seller, when I did have a problem with a speaker, they responded to my email almost immediately and took care of the problem in a way that made it really easy for me.
 Bought this to use when giving presentations’ When I received it I charged it and it worked fine, I was pleased with the sound and size. It replaced a unit several years old and cost 3X what the Anker Sound Core cost. Was very surprised that the Sound Core sounded better than the older unit did when it was new. Put it up and took it out when I needed it but it did not come on. Contacted Anker after trouble shooting via e-mail they sent a replacement. It sounds good customer service was great very pleased with the Anker Sound Core.
 I bought this speaker because my son already had one and am really impressed with the quality of his for the price. I mainly bought mine as a computer speaker which would take up minimal space on my desk. Two big concerns using it as a computer speaker. There is no earplug jack. You must connect with Bluetooth.  The jack on the side of the device is for the mic and audio in. Also, since I have 2, I have trouble separating them with the Bluetooth signal. This may be an easy fix but I just haven't put a lot of effort into it yet. But in all, I'm happy with the purchase considering whats available for this purpose.
 I would like to start with customer service.  It is outstanding.  I had a problem getting the speaker to connect to my phone.  When I contacted them, they were prompt and more than willing to help me solve the problem. Even through several emails they were cheerful.  It turned out that you need to hold down the "on" button for about 15 to 20 seconds until you see the blue light flashing on the front.  They offered to send a new unit but we figured out the problem.  They stand behind their product.  Packaging is great and their customer service is stellar.  I did give it only three stars for sound quality but I don't think you should expect more sound quality from a $20 speaker.  It is great for what it is and I definitely would buy from this company again.
 I had previously owned two other Bluetooth speakers. Now that the novelty of hearing "big" sound from a small speaker has worn off, here's how the Anker compares. I commute 3 hours a day, so audio books have become my lifeline to an already fragile sanity. If I detect even the slightest delay in the audio playback, I won't care how good the music playback is. So the Oontz Angle now stays at home. Also the Anker has a better mic, so I need to make fewer corrections during voice to text messages. Everything about this speaker feels like the quality will last the usual wear and tear of daily use. Highly recommended.
 I purchased this speaker 6 months ago, which isn't even a full year and I am highly displeased with the results! The first 5 months were great, the speaker had great sound quality and battery life. However, within this last month (January) I suspected that something was wrong with the speaker when I charged it and it would not come on. This device is capable of charging and playing music simultaneously, so I was shocked to see that it was not working. I assumed that I just needed to let it charge with no interference so I did so for 5+ hours and again it would not turn on. I'm very upset with the results of this purchase because the speaker didn't even last for a year! This speaker is not worth the purchase, do not waste your money!
 This speaker is pretty nice, there are a lot of speakers online, but I think this is up there will beats and apple and other name brands. The battery life on this thing is pretty long, I think I have gone up to two weeks of using it, maybe about an hour or so each day, and it still plays. The reachability is pretty standard too but not crazy. Overall the sound quality on it is pretty nice and I think I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for something that is a good price.
 I like this product a lot! My husband and I share this. We don’t use it daily, but it seems to hold its charge pretty well between uses. The top volume is pretty decent, and the quality is very good. I only have two complaints:<br/>1. I wish there was a battery life indicator<br/>2. Sometimes it is difficult to connect the Bluetooth. It is easily solved by deleting the device and connecting completely fresh, but it’s a little annoying to do so often.<br/><br/>Overall, it’s a good product and I the issues it has I can easily live with. I would buy it again.
 I bought 3 of these on a Gold Box Deal. My son is traveling in Europe this summer and absolutely loves it. He using it as a mini amp for his guitar. I use mine connected to my Echo Tap in the bedroom. It provides great background music while I am getting ready for my day and my alarms have never sounded better. My wife uses hers when she is working in the garden or chilling in the pool. She likes this speaker much better than using her headphones. They sound great for such a small package. The only con is, since it is basically a big battery it is heavy, but for our usage that has not been an issue (keeps it from getting easily knocked off of the table). It has a rubberized coating that is easy to grip and won't slip out of sweaty hands.
 You really can't go wrong with Anker as a company. Their incredible service and responsiveness is just off the chart.<br/><br/>That said, this is a product that is somewhere between good and great. Connectivity is great, battery is great, and build is fantastic. If I have to nitpick, here you go;<br/>- when you use aux, the blue light constantly flashes and it is supposed to to that according to the manual. This will definitely bother you if you are using it in a dark room, and might bother you even in the bright room if you are sensitive.  If you are using bluetooth it would be a none issue<br/>- you have to know that this is 6w speaker; it will not produce the volume of 10w~50w speakers that are similarly sized. I recommend choosing this product if you are going to be using it in a regular sized room.<br/><br/>You will not be disappointed with the product if you make sure to remember the above points.
 Solid little speaker. Very good battery life. You can literally listen for over 24 hours straight. I bought it 8 months ago and have had only one issue. I've used it daily for the entire time I've had it, mostly for background music in my apartment. It's quite loud, and the sound quality is surprisingly good.<br/>The only problem I've had is that once it disconnected from my computer and wouldn't reconnect. I tried everything I could think of (forgetting device, restarting all devices, connecting from multiple devices, etc.). Nothing worked, and since it was within the 18 months of warranty I contacted Anker to return it. They replied with a nice long troubleshooting list for me to try first. I'd tried everything except holding down the bluetooth button for "3-5 seconds". Apparently the reset's the device's bluetooth, and it fixed the issue.<br/><br/>Sounds good, tougher than nails, amazing battery life, and very good customer service. 10/10 would buy again.
 It is alright in that it works reliably. However, the sound isn't that loud, with there being louder speakers at this price point. The physical buttons on the speakers are annoying to use and can be finicky. Overall I would have gone with something else.<br/><br/>Edit: I was contacted by their customer service who offered me a different unit which worked much better than the original. I can safely say that they are willing to back up their products if you happen to get one that may not be up to par. I'm more willing to buy from them now, because I know that they support their products.
 Long story short; I returned it.  Bluetooth connectivity with this one is not as well-implemented as others. I compared this side-by-side with a Jam Plus we've enjoyed for a couple of years, and found that the Anker was consistently troublesome to repair, requiring multiple steps to first delete the device, then re-pair; it sounded about the same as the Jam Plus with a little less bass and more directionality, and the battery-saving power off feature  per spec should power off after 10 min with no input] does not work consistently.  The Anker would in some cases stay on for hours with no input from anything.
 Very portable and light weight.  I sometimes use in my kitchen, in my old truck that doesn't have bluetooth, and for travelling.<br/><br/>Sound - excellent for a portable speaker.  Crisp and great quality.  Very little base... if you want that get something larger.<br/><br/>Battery - Not sure yet...  out of the box I used it here and there for about 5 weeks without needing a charge.  I charged before taking it on a trip.  So expect at least a month of light use between charges.<br/><br/>Paired very easily.  Range is excellent.  Feel very sturdy and well put together.<br/><br/>Excellent choice for music and phone on the go if you want a portable blue tooth speaker and don't need strong base.
 Got this when it was an Amazon Deal of the Day. Couldn't be happier with my purchase.<br/>This speaker feels really solid, is super easy to use, sound quality is excellent, and has no noticeable change in quality until max volume (which is very loud). I'm still waiting for the battery to die, so I can't report on whether it actually makes it to 24 hours yet, but I'm over 10hrs of use at this point.<br/>This speaker is just plain really good.<br/><br/>UPDATE: This speaker is still excellent and has continued to exceeded my expectations. The battery still lasts a mind blowingly long time, I've gotten at least 20 hours of play time out of it plus at least 30 hours of leaving it on between uses for the past 8 months. This speaker produces better sound at both low and high volumes than any other speaker that I have ever heard at this size with the exception of the same sized Bose speaker that costs over 5 times as much (and that speak blew out, so it couldn't actually handle the high volumes it was producing).
 The two stars are because you’re getting what you paid for. A small Bluetooth speaker with sub par sound quality and OK speakerphone abilities. I’m shocked with all the 5 star awesome reviews, apparently this is the best speaker since sliced bread according to them, and what drove me to purchase it. These people must never owned a decent Bluetooth speaker that actually has some base to show for it.  Sad to say, it’s sound quality is barely better than my phone speaker so I’m not too excited.
 Ever wanted to make phone or VOIP calls via Bluetooth-connected speakerphone?  Look no further.  Plus you can dance to your tunes between calls!  Between conference calls?  Everybody dance now!<br/><br/>The microphone works well for phone calls; I bluetooth this speaker to my phone and use it to make phone calls all the time.  Other reviewers have commented that the microphone does not pick up sounds from far away.  I place the speaker within 2-3 feet of me when making phone calls and I've never had a complaint about sound quality.<br/><br/>Incredibly punchy sound for the size; bass is surprisingly good.  Everyone who hears this speaker is surprised at how small it is compared to the big sound it produces.  Build quality is good; unit is substantial and well-made.  I like the rubberized coating on the entire speaker as it is anti-slip.  Great battery life, though I have yet to test the limits of the 24 hour battery life claimed.<br/><br/>This is the fourth piece of Anker tech that I've owned and I've had great experiences with all of them.  I spent my own money on this speaker. I received no compensation, product samples, back-slaps, atta-boys or other incentives for this review.
 I paid $43.99 at the time of purchase. I love Anker products as they are always of quality. I purchased two other Bluetooth speakers (total of three) so that I could compare them all together. I found that Anker was clearer, but lacked in volume and bass compared to the other two. I'm sad to say that it came in third place which was a surprise because out of the three it was the most expensive lol. I tested the DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth and Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3. I have left reviews for both, but the OontZ wins hands down. I plan on buying more speakers and testing them out soon.
 Like others have said, this little guy has battery life for days! I used it across two separate camping trips for at least 8 hours and the battery was still reporting full. Awesome to have something I can charge up at home and know I can lug it around and not worry about the music stopping.<br/><br/>I also like the size and texture of the little speaker. The sound is quite nice for this size of a speaker as well. It isn't going to bring the house down, but if you are looking for something that you can have on as some background music when doing other activities, then this is the speaker I would recommend. The value provided from they speaker certainly matches or even exceeds the cost!
 I was in the search for a good portable speaker and so far this Anker speakers is meeting my daily commute needs. Previously, I purchased 2 non-Anker portable speakers and it disappointed me. Both speakers did not last more than 3 months and I had to replace them due to the faultiness of the charging port.<br/><br/>I really prayed that this 3rd portable speaker purchase would do the trick since apparently I do not have good luck with my speaker selection in Amazon. There is only one thing that bothers me about this speaker which is the inconsistency of the bluetooth connection. There would be times where my music would disconnect but it comes and go as it please. So far it has not reach the point of frustration so I think this product deserve a 4 star review!!
 Bought this speaker in 2017 and had it sitting around for months because I had no immediate use for it. Last night, I took it out of the packaging, put it on charge, and tried to use it this morning. However, it would not turn on even after a 12 charge. There was no light indicator and none of my bluetooth capable devices could detect it. I tried using it while also on the charger and I got nothing. So, I called Anker's support service, and got the issue handled. Wonderful gentleman named Spencer got the problem dealt with and sent a brand new replacement speaker. The product may have been DOA, however, the customer service was fast and easy to take care of the problem.
 I left a negative review for this speaker a couple weeks ago because of poor Bluetooth reception, within a few days there customer support team contacted me to ask for the serial number and assist me in fixing the issue, I was told the speaker was defective and somehow slipped thru there quality control process. They replaced the speaker and even upgraded it with a SoundCore 2, both of these speakers sound amazing and the Bluetooth works great also. very happy with there customer support team. For the extra money the SoundCore boost is fantastic also great sound for such tiny speakers, water and dust resistant also.
 This little device does not disappoint.<br/><br/>I've had my unit for about 2 months now and have only had to charge it twice. I keep it in my backpack and use it at work for music and to watch movies with at home.<br/><br/>While the sound quality it not top of the line, it is more than satisfactory to replace tablet, cell phone or monitor speakers.<br/><br/>It has a soft finish and is light enough to forget about in your bag. I haven't tried the 66 foot range, but I can leave my phone on the charger in the bedroom and walk around with the speaker while I take care of chores.
 what am very happy with the SoundCore.  Like other Anker products I own this is well built.  I purchased the SoundCore because it supports USB 4.0, and I wanted to have a speaker when I am sitting in out backyard.  Because it has a rubberized case I am not worried if it sits on the grass, even if the grass is wet.  The embossed control surface on the top of the speaker suggests that water will not get into the controls.  Note: this is not advertised as a waterproof device, and AUX and microUSB connectors on the side are certainly not waterproof.  I have not used the SoundCore to answer a call, so I cannot speak for the quality of this feature.
 FINALLY a small bluetooth speaker that attempts neutral tonal balance. This is quite a departure for Anker, which has been as bad as most companies in trying to create an "impressive"  sic] but artificial sound by zapping up the bass (always) and treble (usually), leaving the all-important mid-range a casualty of marketing war. For this reason I much prefer this speaker to some much more expensive speakers of the same general size.<br/><br/>And at the price, this speaker is rather amazing.<br/><br/>THE DARK SIDE<br/>That said, I hate the damn blue light in front --- REALLY annoying. An "on" or "connected" light is fine, but DISCREET, please. I also dislike the beep arpeggio that sounds when you turn it on or off, but it's not as bad as some units with a loud voice indicating same. Lastly, the large ANKER across the grille is a tad annoying, though it is toned down from a previous Anker speaker. I LIKE Anker, to be sure, but making me glare at their name doesn't help me like them any better.
 I have had this device for 3 months now and it still amazes me! I am a UPS driver and sometimes my music is necessary to get me through the day. I needed a bluetooth speaker that was loud enough to hear over my truck and would last long enough for 9+ hours at a time. This was exactly what I needed.<br/>Pros:<br/>-Sound quality is amazing. Clear and crisp and a surprising amount of bass for such a little thing.<br/>-The battery life? Yeah, it's amazing. Went two full 9 hour shifts at full volume and still wasn't dead.<br/>-It looks nice. Such a simple design.<br/>-Easy to use. You can even skip songs by hitting the play button twice.<br/>-Long range connectivity. Sometimes I will have my phone in my pocket as I walk up a long driveway but the music in the truck never stops.<br/>-HOW CAN YOU BEAT THAT PRICE?! I once spent $100 on JBL flip and the charge barely lasted 5 hours.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-none
 I have to admit I was a litter worried about buying a blue tooth speaker for this cheap of a price because we have a couple decent blue tooth speakers already made by Bose and Sony.  The purpose of these were to pair with some Amazon ehco dots we bought for our kids room and boy was I surprised by the quality of sound from a sub $30 product.  They were easy to pair with the echo dot and a great improvement that provides great sound for a bedroom.  These and the echo dot make a great pair for providing audio to a kids bedroom.  I wish they could be paired together in pairs but not many speakers actually allow this and definitely none at this price point.  Don't be scared by the price as the quality is great and will definitely meet your expectations.
 It’s a Great  clarity speaker  Long Battery Life it’s Not Like Most Chargeable Speaker When Anker Needs Charging It Beeps Loudly Where You Can Hear it The Battery Life On This Speaker is A Couple Of Weeks We Use Ours With Alexa For Music Alarm Clock Check Weather Temperatures It Let You Know When Order From Amazon Will Arrive Sounds Like a $250 Speaker Get Some You Want Be  disappointed  Great Price FYI Get The Red One My Wife LOVES IT THANKS AGAIN AMAZON FOR ALL YOU DO FOR US GOD BLESS Ken Pike
 I love this thing! Battery is even better than what I was expecting by a lot. When they say 24-hrs they really mean you can use it 24/7 and rarely need to charge it. I've had it since mid-November and  I have it in my garage so when I work on my cars I can listen to music with better quality than the speaker on my phone. I don't recommend expecting to make phone calls with it though. The mic is pretty poor at picking up my voice standing right in front of it while it's on my shop counter (kitchen counter height). That's definitely not what I bought it for though so not a problem for it.
 My car doesn't have any type of Bluetooth connectivity or even an aux-in jack. I was looking for a way to play podcasts, audiobooks, and music on road trips. My goal was something affordable, with long battery life, sufficient volume without clipping or distortion, and decent tone. I am not an "audiophile" but I am a musician and I have pretty clear preferences on an EQ balance that's pleasing to the ear. Out of the box I was really impressed with the build quality. The santoprene exterior makes it very easy to grip, and it keeps it in one firm location on my dash without sliding around. I tested the volume at 60mph, with the windows down, and the regular radio playing over the rear car speakers (since my kids are usually watching movies back there). I was pleased to discover that it was plenty loud with a few clicks to spare. No clipping or major distortion at max volume either so it's good to know that I can push it if needed. Tone wise, at first I was really disappointed. The signal was so flat. It almost sounded like an old landline phone. Then I went to the EQ settings on my iPhone in settings-&gt;music-&gt;EQ, and it came to life! It is absolutely necessary to run EQ when playing music. I sometimes still run the EQ with audiobooks and podcasts to allow the voice to cut through whatever ambient noise I have going on. I've found either "treble booster", "spoken word", or "small speakers" are great options for voice. For music the "rock" option works great in most cases. The bass response is as expected for a device so small. It doesn't rumble your chest of course, but the lows do sound decent. This effect can be magnified though by smart placement of the speaker. If I put it on my dash and let it touch the windshield, the whole front of the car reverberates the sound at me and it sounds really big. If you put it on a thin flimsy table like a slide-out cup holder, it will sound weak and very mid-rangey.<br/>Overall I'm really pleased with his product and I'll be checking out other Anker products as well if this thing continues to perform well.
 This is a great little speaker for an awesome price. I bought it about six months ago and I have put it to task on camping trips, during house cleaning and just general usage. I looked around at a lot of other speakers at a variety of prices, but the great reviews and affordability of this speaker initially made me buy it.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>1) Battery life. There is nothing worse than a speaker dying mid dance party. This one isn't likely going to do that because of the 24 hour battery life.<br/>2) Bluetooth distance. I don't have an official distance that I tested, but I have taken my phone pretty far from the actual speaker and it still plays<br/>3) Aesthetically pleasing. This might be a dumb thing to comment on, but I love the way it looks. It is small and sleek and awesome.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>1) Volume: This is not going to blow anyone's eardrums anytime soon. It gets pretty loud for its size, but it is best used for personal listening in my opinion.<br/><br/>I am neutral on the sound. I don't think it sounds any better or worse than I was expecting. I consider myself somewhat of an audiophile, and I don't notice anything off on the sound from this speaker. In summary, if you want a speaker to carry around with you and play music for you and your friends (assuming you aren't like Kim K. or something with 1000's or friends) this is the perfect speaker for you.
 I love this little speaker! Lots more power than you would expect and the battery life is exceptional. I use it with my phone and the only issue I have is that an incoming text will pause it and sometimes you have to wait a while before the text clears the screen and the sound restarts. It'd be better if it just notified you of the message by a tone but didn't affect what was playing. In fairness, that could be a phone issue instead of a speaker issue.<br/><br/>This speaker is a GREAT value.
 I was looking for a nice sounding, inexpensive Bluetooth player. So, I did my research on various sites. Anker Soundcore kept coming up on top or near the top.<br/><br/>Sound quality: Best I've heard from a small speaker set up. Nice midlows and mids. Doesn't sound like it's playing in a can. It can get distorted at max volume from phone and speaker. Overall I'd give it a 7/10 without price consideration and a 10/10 with the idea that it is inexpensive.<br/><br/>Volume: At max volume it fills my 600 Sq ft apartment nicely. Which is exactly why I bought it. 10/10 for my intended use.<br/><br/>Bluetooth: It has both auxiliary in and Bluetooth connectivity. Bluetooth sets up vary quickly and has nice muted notes to let you know when it turns on, off, connects and disconnects. The blue light is behind the acoustic screen. So, it's not blinding. Vary large radius for Bluetooth. 10/10.<br/><br/>Other: Huge battery life that can play while charging, so I still haven't run it out of battery. More than 10 hours constantly on and unplugged and didn't show signs of stopping. 10/10<br/><br/>Overall: Perfect for my small application and a little more. Very satisfied.
 *UPDATE*<br/>Anker reached out to us after this review and worked through some troubleshooting of the speaker. Additionally, they offered to send us a new speaker as a replacement. Awesome customer service Anker!<br/>For the price, the sound quality of this speaker is good. We’ve had it for a few weeks and it’s been fine. Recently, however, the Bluetooth connection process has been horrible. Once I turn the device on, instead of connecting to my phone, it just continues blinking as if it can’t find anything to connect to. I have tried turning it off again and on again, holding down the Bluetooth button, removing the device from my phone and then reconnecting to it. Most of the time, it doesn’t even show up on my phone as an option to connect. I am occasionally able to get it to show up and connect after trying for several minutes. Most of the time though, I just give up on it. Super disappointing.
 UPDATE: 3/21/2017: I am very impressed with the battery life. I have been using for just over a month and today it finally ran out of juice. Also the customer service for this company is outstanding, I would definitely purchase other products from them.<br/><br/>Way under performed, I was expecting more but for $30 I suppose I shouldn't have high expectations. I would say it performs a little bit better than the speaker on your phone. It fits a need for budget buyers. I can't compare it to other ANKER products and I would be happy to test out higher end models.<br/>If you are an audiophile, I would not purchase this. I am very picking with my sound that comes from speakers. I know what I like and what I don't.
 I am pissed!  I assumed (stupidly) that since they are competing with Oontz they would match the contents.  NOPE.  No aux cable.  Clearly, shaving off a dollar cable to have a lower price than Oontz.  Shame, cuz I'm returning it and keeping the Oontz (I bought one of each to compare).  Sound quality being equal, the Anker lost.
 Excellence in quality.  This is the second Anker SoundCore speaker I have purchased.  I keep one on my nightstand for streaming ambient sleep music during the night and one in my workshop.  As I keep the volume at 35% to 40% the playtime actually exceeds the 24 hours as described.  Pairing is super simple on my iPhone 6s.  Of all the Bluetooth speakers I have tried,  this is one of best.
 Well I was not expecting much from a small speaker and I was very skeptical about the 24 hour runtime, but so far after a month of use there's very little wrong with the product. The 24 hour runtime is true if not underrated I didn't use it continously but over the course of a week I didn't have to charge it turning it on and having it on standby while sitting at my desk occasionally playing some music and then taking it into the bathroom while I took a shower and listening to music or a podcast in there.<br/><br/>Sound quality is almost perfect. The speakers definitely cater more toward the low end (meaning bass) in the higher pitch range they tend to start crackling and loosing quality. The unit does also put out quite a bit of noise in a 2200sqft house it's audible across the house.<br/><br/>Downfalls/issues the power button is finicky sometimes it prefers to be pressed very hard and to the left and the ring tone for incoming calls is not changeable. However for the price it's definitely worth it
 I have had the speaker for at least a month and have only had to charge it once.  I listen to New Age Music every night to go to sleep.  It doesn't sound as good as the Bose speaker, however it's not objectionable.  The Bose speaker as some internal problem and doesn't always charge, or goes into sleep mode.  Got tired of dealing with it.
 I am quite pleased with this speaker. The battery life is excellent and for me the sound is great. I have had a mini Bose for a few years and I could buy 7 or 8 of these speakers for what I paid for the Bose. One of the reasons I bought the Bose was that it was advertised that the battery could be replaced at home, but If I understand correctly the speaker has to now be mailed in to get the battery changed. If this is true, it is deception on the part of Bose as it was advertised that the battery could be replaced and gave instructions how to do it.
 This speaker is really great!  I have owned several Bluetooth speakers and this one is by far the best value.  I purchased this speaker because I always have a problem with the battery dying in speakers and this speaker has a 24 hour battery life.  I haven't had any such problem with this speaker.  I have left it in a bag, not charged for weeks and used multiple times without recharging.  The battery life is better than expected.  When I received the speaker I was skeptical of the sound quality because it was smaller than I expected.  I thought it would not be loud enough or be poor quality when turned up.  I was wrong it sounds great!  You really can hear all of the detail in the music.  I have had several friends comment on the quality of this speaker.  It's a great buy
 We purchased this speaker in March of 2016 and use it in the kitchen 4-5 times a week to listen to music and podcasts. Every few weeks I would ask my husband, have you charged the battery on the speaker yet? "Nope." October 2016 - the battery on this speaker finally died. That is 7 months on one battery charge. Amazing. I wish my phone would do that. HA HA. It recharged quickly overnight. Great sound quality, lots of volume, never a problem to connect to our devices easily, unlike the cheapo speaker we bought for my mom from Wal-Mart. Let's see if it goes 7 more months on the next charge.
 I can't comment on longevity since I've only had it a week. But overall I'm pretty happy with it, and I'm a very picky person. For under $40 I don't think you can go wrong. I bought it to use out by the pool on our deck for the times I don't want to kick on the 4 large speakers I have placed in the yard. And we just got back from vacation at a lake house rental that had a flat screen TV with horrible sounding speakers, so I paid my Anker via bt to the Amazon fire stick and we enjoyed much better sound.<br/>I'll update my review if anything changes, or if the speaker breaks. But so far so good
 So far after a month, I really like the sound. Very balanced between highs and lows. The speaker itself is very substantial feeling out of the box compared to the last bluetooth speaker I had at the same price point. I think that was a DKnight Magicbox.  That also was a good Bluetooth speaker, a little less bass than the Anker but enjoyable too. I lost that one and am glad I chose the Anker because of the increase in bass and battery capacity. It isn't a booming bass but more than adequate for the size speaker it is.  I haven't tested the bluetooth range which is supposed to be a strength so I can't comment on that.  All in all, very pleased with the purchase and would recommend the speaker.
 My desktop monitor did not come with a sound system, so I use the speaker as a replacement sound. I use the speaker daily, for watching youtube videos and music at least 5 hours a day. So far the battery is really long lasting and I charge it maybe every couple weeks. I'm happy with the quality of the product and it is exactly what I expect from an Anker product.<br/><br/>I will say that the sound could potentially be better quality but it works great for a normal person who doesn't need the highest sound quality. In addition, the power on and off button is a little hard to press and hold, but it's not a dealbreaker for me.
 Can't be beat for the price point. Sure it suffers a little in the bass department, especially when it's trying to mix with high-end sounds, but what do you expect from a small speaker that's less than $30?<br/>For what they're charging it's fantastic. Has a really good battery playtime on a full charge as well which is impressive.<br/>Vol is decent, could be louder, but again for what it is it packs a decent punch.<br/>I also highly recommend you get the carrying case with it
 My mother had me order this speaker for her I tested it out and I must say it’s one of the best ‼️ We stay in a four bedroom house people who were in the kitchen thought it was a surround sound system need I say more ? Lol but I don’t work for this company we bought everything with our own money this is a Bluetooth speaker and compatible with any smart phone including iPhone 5 and up I also recommend you buy the headphones as well there noise cancellation best amazon purchase ever well for my mom I definitely will purchase this for myself as well 😃😃 very pleased
 Came within two days and was packed pretty good with no damage can.Wowat's all I can say , it's a small speaker but packs a punch with sound quality. It's pretty loud too and connects straight to my cell phone . For the price it's a real great buy , I might invest in a few more around the house. And the best part is that they have a 18 month warranty , a speaker you must buy.
 This is the most amazing little speaker. It pairs in no time by just pressing a button and selecting the speaker from your device. This little thing is LOUD too! I put it on a table on my porch and was able to hear it loud and clear in all corners of my nearly 1/4 acre yard. The charge lasts FOREVER I didn't have to plug it in once the several hours I was using it-- not even my phone lasted that long. I plan on taking this camping with me next week so I can use it while on the beach.
 Love this speaker.  I would probably give it a 4 out of 5 on sound, but the battery life is incredible.  I have used it multiple times at 50%+ volume for 8-10 hours, and still had battery left!  Plus, the range is great.  This is the fourth Bluetooth speaker I have owned, but it is the only one that works consistently through the walls of my house.  When all the other speakers cut out, this one maintains connection and keeps playing.  Additionally, I love the soft buttons on top that control the volume - the big + and the big - are easy to locate in the dark to adjust the volume.  The rectangular design of this speaker makes it good for sitting on the dash of my car when travelling, and the volume is more than sufficient for car use.
 I've been a big Bose fan for a long time, but wanted a speaker i could take to the park or use riding bikes or at the pool and not worry if it was stolen or damaged or wet. Got this because if the reviews and Christmas deal. It's plenty loud, holds a charge, pairs easily, lasts a good long while. My only complaint is it sounds a tad muffled. Not terrible, not unbearable especially for the price, but it's not a direct competitor for the $100-200 speakers
 Got this for my daughter and did do a "test" when it came as it will be a gift. It was painless to setup and had good sound from such a small enclosure. I read reviews where there isn't enough bass, or clarity or whatever, but you have to stop and think what you're using it for. If you want dynamic big bass sound enough to blow your ears off, this isn't going to do it. However, if you need something to play music and sound good in a localized area, this is just fine and will give you good sound. Range is very good and I was over 40' away and could still hear and control the volume levels.
 I am not kidding. I have run this speaker without charge for over 90 hours. The battery will not die. Anker, I think you sold me a special edition with a nuclear reactor. I can't say enough about the battery life. I don't know if everyone will experience this level of battery life but the numbers they claim are WAAAAY underexaggerated. this speaker does not run out of juice. There is simply no better speaker under 50 dollars and maybe even under 100 dollars. the sound quality is good for it's size, the bass could be louder but it doesn't peak and this battery makes up for all of it. At this point, i'm just trying to let the battery die and it wont. I am still using it as I write this review. Absolutely incredible job Anker. Keep it up!
 Had read reviews about how good this speaker was and ordered it and I have to say it meets and exceeds expectations did notice some reviews talked about lack of bass but I found that it is great sounding and just right amount of bass as I am not one that is about the heavy thumping sound . The clarity of the music was spot on Its small but is loud when needed .<br/> Package was good and in red it looks very sharp and like it costs more than I paid for it so I recommend it highly. shipped promptly so overall I'm very happy
 Great little speaker, really for what it is. I was impressed with how this sounds. I've purchased and been happy with many Anker products in the past and this is another added to the list. Feels well built and performs better than other small Bluetooth speakers I've had in the past. Just keep in mind the size of what you are buying. It won't knock you off your seat with Bass but will fill a small to medium room with great sounding music. Good value here. I would recommend.
 I put this little guy tucked away behind some stuff on our kitchen counter and leave it plugged in. My wife and I use it all the time to listen to music via bluetooth while in the kitchen. Puts out plenty of sound and bluetooth pairing is quick every time. I think we paid like twenty bucks for it during some Prime promotion and its worth every penny. Dunno how well it would work in a larger room or open area like a porch or garage, but for our application it is perfect.
 Just received this today &amp; am really impressed with the fidelity for such a small device.  Will work very well when we need to amplify video call volume for hearing-impaired family.  Terrific value.<br/><br/>Granted — I’ve had it less than a day so I can’t address its longevity.
 Seriously the best Bluetooth speaker I've ever owned. The sound quality is terrific and LOUD for such a small unit. It holds a charge forever. I charged it the day before I gave birth so I'd have it in the hospital and I haven't had to charge it since even though I use it frequently. My daughter is 3 months old now so that should give you a good idea of how long this thing lasts. I totally recommend any anker products. They're amazing and reasonably priced.
 I just purchased this Bluetooth portable​ speaker, and could not be more pleased.  It replaced an Altec Lansing H2O speaker of similar size (which died at only 18 months, 1-star rating in a separate review) and I can already tell is far superior.  It pairs easily, the controls and sounds and lights are intuitive, and it sounds great.  I had already purchased an Anker portable battery charger, and I am impressed with the quality and design of this company's products.
 I like everything about the Soundcore speaker except for the sound quality which is the most important element.<br/>I download high quality music from Joox which plays back great when i connect my phone to my car audio; I'm not an audiophile but when I connect to the Soundcore speaker, the music sounds a bit 'tinny'; the speakers sound cheap with a distinct lack of bass.<br/>I suppose at this price point, one can't expect all the bells and whistles but I am still disappointed.<br/><br/>April 6, 2019 - Intervention from the Anker Direct customer satisfaction team:<br/>I purchased the Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker last year October based on the positive and bullish advertisement and reviews from other buyers including the 4.5 start rating.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the product (sound) is disappointing and I voiced this through a subsequent review (see above).<br/><br/>Much to my surprise I was recently contacted through email by Cherry from the AnkerDirect customer satisfaction team.<br/>She was not happy that I was not happy with their product and offered an upgraded version of the speaker (SoundCore Version 2) or a full cash refund.<br/><br/>I opted for the full refund and the cash was paid into my account within a few days. I did not have to return the product.<br/><br/>I will like to take this opportunity to thank Cherry and her team for following up on my review and for the very generous compensation - I certainly did not expect this level of service.<br/><br/>5-star customer satisfaction guaranteed.
 Purchased this speaker after researching a few in the same price range. For several months I was happy with the overall quality (strong sound, acceptable battery life) but just after about one year it no longer charged properly. I tried a few different charging cables to confirm that it was the device and not the cable. I contacted Anker customer service by email and explained the problem. They asked me a couple basic follow-up questions, which I answered, and then within two days they sent another email saying that I'd be receiving a new device. They didn't ask me to ship the other back nor did they tell me that I was outside the return period - they simply sent me a new one, and quite promptly (it arrived within the week).  THAT is the definition of great service, and that's why I am recommending this product. Too often you find a decent product made by a company with terrible customer support. In this case you get a solid product with top-notch support. As the other reviews like this one attest, Anker stands by its products, without question.
 I'm not a person who needs a speaker that can provide a whole BBQ with music. I wanted a speaker to use while i work around the house or watch a video on my phone. Its perfect for just that. It can get loud, loud enough to fill a home with music and would be great for small gatherings around the fire pit. The battery life is amazingly long compared to my last speaker. When it says 24 hours it means 24 hours. I do not use it everyday so i can go almost a month with a single charge, and i love that it notifies me on my phone when its battery is low.
 Gotta admit, this brand is growing on me, and fast.  Build quality of the four items I own all feel top notch, and I don't have any meaningful complaints against any of them.  The worst thing I can say for this speaker is that I'm not a big fan of the press-and-hold power switch, but I fully understand why they would have gone with this design.  For me, it just sits on my bedside table, and occasionally follows me to the garage.  If, instead, you were actually "porting" this portable... this helps insure you don't waste battery life (of which there is an absurd amount.)
 I looked at the Bose Soundlink Mini, but I couldn't justify spending $200 for a small speaker I use to listen to podcasts while I cook in the kitchen, so i went looking for another option.<br/><br/>For $30, this thing is amazing! It has great sound and the charge lasts forever. I have used it for hours and hours on end and never run it completely down. It charges quickly, is a breeze to set up the bluetooth and never drops connection to my phone. You can use it anywhere and it's light and portable to take with you. It pumps a lot of sound for such a small speaker.<br/><br/>It's a steal at $30, I totally recommend it! Plus, Anker makes great products!
 Please don't buy a UE boom don't get me wrong it's an amazing product (One of my previous purchases) but on terms of volume, sound, quality, and battery these are almost parallel. I live in a 3 bedroom house with two living rooms and it fills my house. So if you're looking for volume it's got it. The sound is amazingly clear. The highs and mids are the most prominent and clear the bass isn't shake in your hand but it is definitely there. Another thing with the highs and mids is they are above the quality of my cars stereo and they will bring your music to another level. The battery hasn't went out yet and I used it all day the day I got it and used it as an alarm clock in the morning without charging it. This thing is also incredibly well built it feels like i could throw it from my car on the highway and pick it up still playing music. Nothing on it feels like cheap material (plastic).
 It sounds really good. I placed it on the bathroom sink and I used the bluetooth feature to connect it to an old iPhone that I don't need any more. This way, I can listen to music while I get ready in the mornings. I charged it for several hours when I first got it out of the box, and I waited for the red light to turn off (as an indication that the device was charged), but it never did. I got tired of waiting, so I decided to start using it. So far, it has worked just fine without plugging it again.
 Let me preface this review by stating that this could've been five stars but sadly the speaker no loner works as it did just 1 month ago. When powered on and off it makes a loud popping noise and also when connected to a device. The volume is no longer as loud as it was before. I don't know what happened but when it was working properly we loved it and now we're sad and disappointed<br/><br/>Update: The speaker is back up to five stars, I contacted Anker directly and they responded the next day. Customer service was/is awesome and the speaker itself is performing as it should after some troubleshooting help from customer service. Great job Anker!!
 This is a good speaker for the price. My opinion on it, I wish it was a little bit louder. It does have good sound but you’re definitely not gonna blow any eardrums out with it. this is a good speaker for in home use, in the backyard, in the car if needed, maybe at a park. Definitely would not use this speaker in any loud settings. Bluetooth works good for this speaker. I’ve become a fan of Anker products. I have Anker lighting cables, power banks, and Bluetooth speaker. I haven’t been unhappy with any Anker product I’ve purchased. Would purchase again.
 I bought this speaker to use with my Amazon Fire tablet. This is the first time I have used a Bluetooth speaker and chose this one by Anker since the reviews were so positive. The sound is excellent and I was amazed that such a small speaker could produce such superb base. Controls are easy to use and the rubberized case prevents movement. I live in a Colonial style house and can say that it reaches to all three floors with no problem. It is also a bonus for me that I do not have to monitor it closely for low battery.<br/><br/>Can't wait to take it outdoors on my terrace in the warmer weather.  Highly recommended!
 I have owned this speaker for a month now. When I recieved it I fully charged it. I have been listening to this speaker 5 days a week for a minimum of 5 hours a day over the last month, and that battery is still pumping out power! I am shocked and amazed! I love Anker products and my decision to buy this speaker comes from ownership of several other Anker products.<br/><br/>The sound quality is equally amazing for the size. I'm in love with this speaker. And I paid for the speaker so when I say it is amazing I mean it. Best value and sound for your money. Pairing is effortless and fast. But the battery life......Outstanding!! I'm still waiting for the thing to die so I can give it a second charge.
 Having read reviews on the SoundCore, I decided to give it a try.  To say I am amazed and very pleased just does not quite cover my happiness with the sound this small speaker can produce.  Fantastic highs, mids and lows.  I listen to dub-step, hip hop, remix, classic rock and some heavy metal and the bass this speaker puts out is more than adequate to make my listening experience as perfect as imaginable with a speaker that is 6 1/2" L X 1 3/4" W.  Small in size, large in sound and more than perfect in value.  Anker has produced a little gem in this SoundCore.  I am highly impressed!<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/>I have had this quite awhile and wanted everyone to know that my Anker Soundcore has been sturdy, still works perfectly and has had no issues.  I use this almost daily and I am still impressed with it.  This speaker keeps playing for about 24-30 hours before it needs charging.  It really is a great bluetooth speaker and I really recommend it to everyone.
 This is truly an amazing product for the price. I love the blue color, and I love the feel of it. It’s easy to use and he gets decently loud considering the price you pay.  My favorite part? The battery last forever! I use it in my car almost everyday for about 30 minutes (sometimes more) and I charge it every l2 months. Seriously!! This product is a total win.<br/>Side note: my car does not have an AUX line therefore I need a way to stream my jams and get pumped to teach 8 year olds for hours.
 Excellent high volume easy to setup bluetooth<br/>Setup to my lg s tylo4+ fast also with Samsung 9note<br/>Quality of the material looks good<br/>For length of battery not sure how long it will last but I did have it on for about 4hrs with no problems hearing it<br/>I didnot have to reconnect Bluetooth like some other wireless speakers<br/>Just hope it last long maybe in 3 or 6 months I update my review<br/>I may buy another one and give it to my nephew and or niece
 I did have an initial problem but when the Anker people found out, they sent me a newer better speaker without me even asking. This is just one of a number of very good experiences I have had with Anker. They take the time to answer my questions about simple cables or anything I don't understand. This replacement was above and beyond. They are the only true name brand when it comes to these type purchases.
 Great little speaker. It gets kinda muddy when playing music, but you can't expect much from a speaker this size--even the Bose Soundlink Mini gets muddy. The reason I got it is because it reproduces sound 10x better than my iPhone's built-in speaker can, which lets me listen to podcasts or music while I'm getting ready in the morning. It's loud enough to overcome the noise of a shower (just don't take it in the shower--it's not waterproof). I also use it to help fall asleep at night (with the Simply Rain app). The battery seems to last forever. Overall build quality seems fantastic. Very satisfied.
 This little device does not disappoint.<br/><br/>I've had my unit for about 2 months now and have only had to charge it twice. I keep it in my backpack and use it at work for music and to watch movies with at home.<br/><br/>While the sound quality it not top of the line, it is more than satisfactory to replace tablet, cell phone or monitor speakers.<br/><br/>It has a soft finish and is light enough to forget about in your bag. I haven't tried the 66 foot range, but I can leave my phone on the charger in the bedroom and walk around with the speaker while I take care of chores.
 I must have gotten a dud.. I plugged in a stereo cable from it to my amazon alexa and there is horrible distortion.  I use other speakers with other alexa devices and works fine.  The bluetooth is fine for a bit and then it starts getting distorted  and the anker needs rebooted to get it to play correctly for a bit.  The anker is on 24/7 and wired to a power source. I wish it would be more stable with audio quality.
 My sturdy Photive speaker finally died and I went looking for something a little cheaper. I spent way too much time reading Bluetooth speaker reviews before finally choosing this Anker model, as it came closest to my specifications. The only thing it's missing is a set of forward/backward buttons, since I mainly bought it for shower use. Not a huge deal; what it does have is excellent battery life and sound quality &amp; a pleasantly smooth encasing, and so far I've had no problems with getting it wet. Felt strongly enough about the results of my Amazon search that I felt like I should share, I'm very happy with it!
 Thing is awesome! Sounds better than Eton rugged rukus I previously had and went bad exactly a year old due to a faulty battery with no repair possible. I like the warranty on this one is longer. 24hr battery play time on this one is a good feature next to the small size with loud, crisp sound. Would recommend this anytime someone is looking for a portable bluetooth speaker! Good music keeps me in a good mood. Happy!Happy!
 I'm not sure how it stacks up against other Bluetooth speakers as this is my first time using one, but so far I'm very impressed. It's compact but packs a bigger and deeper sound than I expected. It has a good heft to it and feels sturdy; I don't feel afraid of dropping it all. I've owned it for a week now and haven't charged it once besides the initial full charge. I took it camping for 3 days and used it ~12 hours a day, and ~6 hours a day for the 4 days since I got back (at med-high volume throughout; Bluetooth while camping, aux at home). The battery life on this thing both pleases and confuses me. I'm not sure if these guys discovered cold fusion or what, but I'm not going to question it.<br/><br/>Unless this thing fails out of the blue, or gives me radiation poisoning, it's going to be one of my favorite purchases.
 Smaller than I thought and the bass is not as strong as some of the reviews stated; overall I think this is a great little speaker.  The charge seems to last forever and the sound quality is good.  (I would never say great as I have some more expensive speaker that sound quite a bit better)<br/>If you want a portable speaker with good sound and long battery life this the one for you.  I will update my review after a few months of use, but as of now I really do love this little speaker!
 This is a decent-sounding Bluetooth speaker. I mostly use it to stream music or radio/podcasts from my iPhone or iPad in the background while I'm doing other things. I haven't tested the range on this yet but from what I've read it's impressive. Battery life has been excellent so far. Sound is clear but it could use more bass! My only gripes: the logo on the front could have been more subtle (for my taste) and the buttons on top should have been painted or made more substantial. They blend in with the matte finish of the unit in most light. Luckily I only need the power button (far left) and the Bluetooth button (far right) to operate it, so that's not a huge issue. I'm very satisfied with this Bluetooth speaker and would recommend it to anyone who has thought about buying one, especially if it's on sale.
 Amazing speaker!  This is worth more than they're asking.  It gets really loud, great build quality.  The two HUGE pluses for me, Great bluetooth range and amazing battery life.<br/><br/>Of all bluetooth devices i've owned I've never had a product that could stay connected with such long range with no interruptions.  I can leave my phone charging in my bedroom with the door closed and be showering with the bathroom door closed down the hall and experience no issues.
 I love this little "brick"!<br/>The sound is superior to other built in speakers and is perfect for my mac mini.<br/>It regularly pairs when turned on with no glitches.<br/>It is heavy enough to stay put, but versatile enough to put wherever works best.<br/>I have used it daily for the past month.<br/>There are downsides, but they are more on the line of annoyances, not function.<br/>The case is all black as are the buttons so are impossible to see in the dark. However, they are easy to feel.<br/>It charges well, and can operated while charging if needed.
 Bought during Black Friday deals. I use this speaker daily and so far have only very minor complaints. Battery life is outstanding. Starting with a full charge, I used it for 10 hours, streaming music all day and the Bluetooth battery life indicator on my phone has barely dropped at all. Sound quality is clear, detailed and gets plenty loud.<br/><br/>It did randomly unpair from my phone once and took a few cylces of turning my Bluetooth on and off to get it to reconnect. The range isn't anything to write home about. It works great if you're in the same room, but any obstruction (walls, doors) reduce your range drastically.
 I use this little speaker for listening to books on tape and its great. I also listen to music and for a little speaker it does fine (definitely not going to rattle the windows but great if I am painting and just want some music on). After 10 months the unit would not take a charge and basically died. On the up side, I contacted customer support (support@anker.com) and they could not have been nicer. After a few emails where they just asked me to go through a few steps to confirm it wasn't working, they sent me a new speaker with no charge. Didn't even have to send the old speaker in (they suggested I drop it at best buy to be recycled). I would give this unit 5 stars but seemed pretty odd that it would just die within 12 months. Hopefully the new unit will last longer. Currently the speaker is on sale for $25 with prime shipping so really can't beat that for a nice little blue tooth speaker and I listen to it almost every day for 30 minutes to an hour and probably only charge it every couple weeks which seems pretty impressive to me. Note, I think the warranty is 18 months so not sure if they would be so quick to send a new one if it was 2 or 3 years old (hopefully won't need to find out). &lt;grin&gt;
 I bought this speaker for my mom for Christmas and we were surprised at the sound.  We compared it to my more expensive AYL speaker and the Anker Soundcore by far had the better sound.  It has a clear sound and gets pretty loud for it's size.  It's a little bigger than my AYL but still plenty small enough to be easily portable.  I was so impressed I bought myself one and use it now instead of my other bluetooth speaker.  The only one thing I wish it had the capabilities to do is to skip songs from the speaker.  You can pause songs or raise and lower the volume, but cannot skip songs which I could do with my AYL.  That's not enough of a problem for me to mark it down a star.  I love this speaker for the price!
 I'm a dance instructor, so I got this speaker to hook up with my mp3 player wherever I'm teaching. Super convenient, the sound quality is more than adequate for my needs and for the price, so I'm definitely a fan.  However, after a year and a couple months, the audio input quit working. I was still within the very generous warranty period, so I contacted Anker, and after a fast and professional/polite troubleshooting exchange (around the holidays no less), they sent me a new speaker, and then followed up.  The devices are good, but the customer service is what will make me a repeat customer.
 I really like this speaker. I wanted to play my Pandora stations and sometimes listen to Podcasts while I work outside or move around in the house.  I used ear buds and head phones but my ears got very hot and sweaty working in the garden or washing the car.  I looked at a lot of speakers but I'm 66 years old and most of them were too "expensive" or seemed complicated.  I just wanted a decent quality sound, battery life, and easy portability.<br/>This Anker SoundCore Speaker sounds very good with the music I play (lots of Jackson Browne, Mandolin Orange, other soft rock, bluegrass).  The Podcasts are easy to hear.  I haven't had a battery issue yet - typically play for blocks of 4 or 5 hours and it connects easily with my iPod. Its heavier than I thought it would be so that might be an issue if I were worried about weight when traveling...but that also means it feels solid and well made.  I'm thinking of buying another for my daughter.
 Incredible battery life, good sound for the size, solid heavy duty build. I love this speaker - it connects easily (automatically) to my iphone, puts out great sound and recharges quickly. I have 4 different portable speakers for my phone based on the situation and this is my go-to speaker around the yard or a large room. Really great value.
 I use this everyday as a booster to my laptop speaker.  Play hours of Pandora and Spotify every day and still only charge it once a month. Super easy to connect, works great as a conference call speaker as well. I always want more bass from a speaker, but this one is pretty dang good for it's size. Good bluetooth range and battery life is WAY longer than the advertised 24-hour playtime.<br/><br/>I am buying these for everyone on my Christmas list this year and replacing a Bose at home. This is the real deal
 Pairs well, decent volume, great battery. My main issue with it is that when a loud or bass-heavy portion of a song occurs, the volume cuts dramatically and noticeably. I assume it’s to prevent distortion, but I personally don’t like the ‘feature’. But, for the $, it works ok. FWIW, I listen to mostly metal. Maybe the pop songs of today do better with it since they’re more processed with more clearly defined ranges since they are computer-generated. Just a thought.
 This was supposed to have great bass quality. IT DOES NOT! I am very disappointed. I was looking for a great speaker that would bring the bass out.  I use this speaker while working out in my basement.  I like having a speaker with great bass to keep you pushing on the exercise.  I tried this speaker set up with my computer to see if it pushed more bass. NOT. I played in my dining area, more enclosed, to see if the bass was better NOT. I am thinking of returning.
 I'm working away from home living in a hotel room for several months. I really wanted something to play music on but couldn't see spending money on a Bose. This seem like just a choice. I was right! Linked easily to my Android and also to my laptop. Great purchase!<br/>6 months later:  Still loving it!.  I'm now working 10 hrs. a day from home and listen to it while working.  I probably actually listen to it about 5 to 6 hrs. a day.  I only have to recharge it every two to three weeks.  Highly recommend this speaker.
 Paired nicely with my LG K7 android phone. Had pandora streaming in just a few minutes.<br/><br/>I have had this unit for 6 months with no technical or performance problems. A full charge (I assume its 8 hours) lasts equally as long with portable music if not longer.<br/><br/>The top buttons are hard as heck to see because the raised rubber is the same black color as the unit. If you can read braille with your fingers, you are in great shape.<br/><br/>Overall it has nice clear sound, very good battery shelf life and easy portability :)
 Alright this was my first Bluetooth speaker of any real quality and I have to say it's worth EVERY penny. I use it for work everyday outside in dirty environments and it's keeps on on taking a beating. I've used it in the bathroom while showering and have yet to have a problem. It's doesn't really get super loud but loud enough for my needs. I've dropped it out of my 4 x 4 on gravel and it's yet to crack. And don't even get me started on the battery life. It's simply amazing. Love it and might need to buy a spare if I end up breaking this one. The only thing I would recommend is a after market case to keep it from getting banged around in you backpack.
 Update,<br/>Anker Customer reach me, and ask about the problems. I feel they are really caring customer, that's why i am going to add 2 star for they customer service. Still the device have several problems.<br/><br/>Before getting it, I read a lot of reviews and i thought this is a perfect speaker, but they are not, at least the one i received are not.<br/><br/>Sound is alright, I will never expect a $36 speaker to have excellent quality, but still, this speaker provide low volume and little bass. With this price, I am pretty sure they can do much better on sound quality.<br/><br/>Besides I use Bluetooth speaker for conference call quite often, and Anker speaker does not work well. The mic is quiet, it is hard for the other side to listen my words. Even worst, when I switch to Aux-in, I cannot hear the other’s voice, while they can barely hear mine. For some reasons, I used Aux-in a lot, and these really make me feel frustrated.<br/><br/>Besides, the material chosen are not good, the plastic get fingerprints easily, which makes it really bad looking. Furthermore, after I put it on the table for a month, it starts getting dusty!<br/><br/>For a relatively cheap speaker, Anker is one of your options, but at this price, I would suggest others to try something else
 The charging port stopped working within a couple of months. I'm not sure what happened. I love Anker products, I've purchased car chargers, house chargers, etc. but this is the first products of Anker's that I'm thoroughly disappointed with. I plan to send them a message and see if this is something that happens with the hopes of them remedying the problem, but for now I have to leave a 1 star rating here.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Anker was kind enough to replace my SoundCore with a working speaker within a couple of days of me reaching out to them. They have proven to me, again, why I continue to buy their products. The new speaker works fine so far.
 The range, which is the primary reason I bought the device, is not even close to what it claims.  Probably half that.  The sound is average.  Lots of trouble synching.
 Unbelievable sound quality from such a small device. Bluetooth pairs with no issues and battery life is outstanding. Have gone several days with 4-8 hours of use without needing a charge. Does not distort when volume is maxed out when paired to a device capable of quality audio output. Pairs well with the DSALL travel hard shell case which doubles as a stand for using your Soundcore in any active environment.
 This is my second Anker product. The first was a 10000mah charger about 4 years ago. They have continued to impress me with the quality and affordability of their products. This speaker absolutely cranks for its size and clarity is awesome. I wanted to be surprised by how awesome it is but I really shouldn’t be at this point. Great company and products. Just bought 2 new candy bar chargers from them as well. Support Anker if you want to see continued production of exceptional electronics!<br/><br/>Update: This is supposed to have a 24 hour playtime. That simply couldn’t be farther from the truth. I’m pretty sure they have wizards making these. I received this on June 26th 2018. It is now August 2nd 2018. I have used the speaker virtually everyday since I purchased it, only charging it once initially when it was received. It plays for 4-6 hours at a time in my home office and has been camping with me, virtually playing all weekend. Currently, the battery indicator on my phone says that it still has abou 60-70% power left! This is simply mind blowing. Anker’s portable batteries have been incredibly impressive, and this speaker is right up there for quality and battery life. I have literally never written an update on a review, but I had to share this. Hands down best portable speaker for I have ever owned. Must be purchased by anyone who likes quality sound with an unreal battery life.
 Solid build quality, great sound.  Bass is a bit lacking, but if you're buying this, you should already know that it's not about the base.  This little guy really fills a room with good sounding music.<br/><br/>The real bonus for me is that I use it with my Google Home and a Chromecast Audio.  So when I tell my Google Home to play music on this device, it starts up automatically!  I don't have to worry about having to manually turn it on.  This is a HUGE bonus for me, as I just leave the power plugged into it via the micro usb cable.  I've got other portable speakers hooked up to other Chromecast Audios, and I have to manually turn them on each time :(
 This product is total junk. I purchased it shortly after neck surgery hoping for good sound and convenience while recuperating. Battery would not charge properly the second time I tried to use it.  Useless. I am disappointed and angry.  Due to surgery I was unable to return it in time for an exchange but I wouldn't want anything else from this company.  Buyer beware!  Within hours of my posting this first review I received a kind and apologetic e-mail from ANKER from their customer service department. She apologized for the trouble I had and went into detaik explaining that her company takes pride in thorough inspections and top quality products. She asked if they could replace it, I said yes and within 48 hours and within 48 hours a new one arrived.  This one works perfectly and has all the properties I'd hoped for.Since replacement I have received two concerned and personalized follow-up e-mails. This company is dedicated to customer service and they bring it.  For that reason alone I would definitely buy again. Again, stellar service.
 Man let me tell you about this speaker. It is crazy loud and it actually sounds good. Battery last days and it does not feel cheap. I have been using this brand for a few months now and recommend it hands down! I have had this speaker for about 6 months and it still works like the first day!
 Great little unit. Not quite as loud as I had hoped. I bought it to use for predator calling and it is not quite load enough. BUT for it true purpose it is great. Small, compact, well made, seems quite weather/water resistant. I use it now for listening to NPR and podcasts instead of turning on the big stereo unit. I found the bluetooth has a range of about 20-30. So I can move it with me room to room when listening to a podcast. Once paired it automatically pairs with iPhone when it is turned on. Much smaller than I expected but that is an asset to me now. Sound is really good except when on full volume setting, the quality fades out a bit. I think a great product, made very well for it's intended purpose. I am not one to heap praise on most products. But for it's intended purpose it really is a great product and well worth the $40 or so I paid.
 For the price, you can't beat this speaker. It has Bluetooth, it's sleek and simple. It's got a great matte finish to the top, bottom and sides that makes it easy to grip. It has an AUX input. It plays a long time on a single charge. Minus one star because, in low light, it's very hard to see the buttons on top. They're raised but basically just formed out of the rubber/silicone material that makes up the shell. A great little travel speaker if space and weight is a consideration. Also, I use it with my large monitor that has no speakers (via an AUX cord). Great purchase.
 It's an alright little speaker. Good battery life, and pretty loud. The problem comes in when you turn it up too loud. Coming from an audio guy, when you turn it up all the way there is distortion. It's not bad, however I never turn the volume up past 2 notches below max to correct it. The highs are a little soft but as I said it's a tiny speaker and for its compact little size I am very impressed. I just wish the audio had been worked on a little better.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting studio quality sound out of this speaker, and it does its job. For the price I am satisfied with the purchase
 To begin, I will say that I purchased this speaker as I have purchased an anker power bank in the past and was impressed by its quality. I am equally impressed with the quality of this speaker! I had no difficulty connecting it to the bluetooth on the phone, and the sound quality is wonderful! I purchased it as a gift for my mother who wanted a speaker that would be able to play all night without dying. This is perfect as it has the 24 hour battery life. The buttons on top are large and raised so they will be able to see and feel at night as well as during the day. The item does have an indicator light on the front that shows when it is on and when it is connected. I did not have any issued with the connecting dropping or anything like that.
 I love this speaker and for $22 you can't go wrong.  It is smaller than I expected but I didnt read the specifications, so that was my bad.  However don't let the size deceive you.  This is an awesome little speaker to use with my android phone.  It is super easy to take along with you and when I put in the center of our house I can hear it perfectly from two different adjacent rooms.  I also hooked up my daughter's android tablet as the speakers are pretty quiet, so it is perfect to use while at home for her tablet.  I barely had it turned up and could hear a movie perfectly on the tablet.  I purchased this to replace a bigger speaker bar in my kitchen.  I am glad how small it is.  I may try to mount it under a kitchen cabinet or attach a small shelf to a kitchen wall so it has a set spot.  Highly recommend this speaker.
 This speaker is solidly constructed and even beautifully packaged. The sound quality is clear and the speakers are loud with much stronger bass than I was expecting from such a small device.<br/><br/>The most impressive thing about this speaker is the extreme range at which it operates; I originally thought there might be something wrong with the pairing function after I had moved it to a different part of the house until I realized it was still pairing with my Echo Dot on a different floor and through multiple walls at a distance of about 75 feet. No other Bluetooth devices I have are able to stay paired at anything close to that distance.<br/><br/>My only reservation about the device is a background hiss which can be heard at high volumes. However, this may be due to interference based on where I have the speaker (nestled among several kitchen appliances).
 Amazing<br/>As I made another purchases this is my third cable usb c power + besides the gold plated usb micros i have from yall and 2nd charger from y'all besides the anker sound core ankersoundcore 2 and the powercore 26500 plus and the regular version!<br/>All products work amazingly for incredible price.. retail stores can't beat the price nor the customer service<br/><br/>Y'all really know what your doing and know how to take care of your customers!<br/><br/>Thank you again and lots of love to the anker company<br/><br/>The anker quick charge really is a quick charge and paired with there powercore plus c cable this thing is really a beast
 This product is one which can fit in any style of life. The various colors and small size can mean it can blend with most anything and be put almost anywhere. For those wanting to use it for many different devices, switching bluetooth connections is as easy as pressing a button and connecting to it from that secondary device. If you are looking for an alternative to your pc speakers or wish to use it to fill a dorm then this speaker is perfect for you.<br/><br/>Sound quality - 9/10<br/>(bass could always be better but regardless it sounds fantastic)<br/><br/>Sound volume - 8/10<br/>(Soft to loud, but loud is more like a "I don't want to wake the neighbors but this movie deserves a bit more sound" kinda loud)<br/><br/>Build quality - 10/10<br/>(The product feels pleasing, I have done drop tests and various other small bump tests and nothing seems to breakout r otherwise disable. Other speakers in the same price range did not fare well as most are made of cheap plastic or weak metal but this Anker speaker is sturdy and has wonderful drop protection surrounding the entire speaker.)<br/><br/>Overall this speaker is a definite buy and one to get yourself, a friend, have in a an office or dorm. Wherever you end up using it Im sure you will love it as much as I do.
 This small bluetooth speaker puts out surprisingly good sound quality and volume on a charge for hours and is easily carried around the house without losing quality or volume. When the sound quality starts going bad, that's the signal that it needs to be plugged into an electric outlet for a recharge. One of my very best buys over the last couple of years. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Anker-SoundCore-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-24-Hour-Playtime-66-Foot-Bluetooth-Range-Built-in-Mic-Dual-Driver-Portable-Wireless-Speaker-with-Low-Harmonic-Distortion-and-Superior-Sound-Black/dp/B016XTADG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker with 24-Hour Playtime, 66-Foot Bluetooth Range &amp; Built-in Mic, Dual-Driver Portable Wireless Speaker with Low Harmonic Distortion and Superior Sound - Black</a>
 The bluetooth pairing between my phone (nexus 5x) and my computer (macbook pro 2011) and the speaker is nearly flawless.  For the price I paid ($25 on sale) this speaker has been a pleasant surprise.  I charged it up the first night I got it and the battery has lasted since then nearly 2 months), although I dont use it every day.  It goes loud enough to be uncomfortable, and still sounds good doing it.  The size is small and it doesnt weigh a ton, but it still feels solid and portable.  I would recommend this to anyone.
 I was amazed that I could connect this to my laptop &amp; projector in an AUDITORIUM and run a short video that everyone could hear clearly.  It was as loud as my mic through the sound system, except localized. There wasn't any bass distortion either.  The only thing that challenges me is the Braille system for the buttons.  In low light, you can't see them at all, so discreetly bumping the sound is not possible.  Other than that -- I love this thing.
 Solid construction and premium feel. Good sound quality and volume considering the size of the drivers.  If I wanted to be critical, there is no "deep" bass, and there is a lack of the crisp, high treble... but the sound that is there is fairly balanced.  Battery life is really 24+ hours.  Connected with my Nexus 6, Nexus 7 (2013), and 2 different laptops quickly and easily.  Being able to use it for teleconferencing is a really nice option (since it has a built in microphone).  Since I don't have a home phone, and I telework, I have used it many times while using google hangouts dialer.  The mic pickup is great.
 This is a sweet little speaker. The price is right.  It was a snap to connect to our Echo Dot. It has great quality. Iit ports to the back rooms or out to the patio.  The only problems are: no instructions to indicate what the almost invisible buttons are, and there is no indicator of how much battery is left. When the battery is low it produces a strange intermittent beeping sound, not described in the non-existing manual. That said, I have recommended this speaker to the many friends and relatives who have admired our Alexa setup.
 I have a variety of Bluetooth speakers around the house but this one is proving to be the most handy one I've bought yet.<br/>The sound that it produces is very clean and the unit is extremely mobile.<br/>Slightly smaller than a 16.9 oz water bottle, this little guy does the job just fine.<br/>I save five star reviews for the most spectacular items but this one is worth the $$$ spent, in my estimation.<br/><br/>Edited note:<br/>I had a problem with the charging port bending out of shape which caused the unit to stop charging.<br/>It happened just after the return by date.<br/><br/>Not trying to get any reimbursement or replacement but I bought a different from another company and I found the Anker speaker to be easier to hold without pressing any function buttons while grabbing it. The volume and forward/back options on this unit are much more user friendly.<br/>I just get tired of spending so much money on charging-related devices.<br/>I swear my second largest nut to cover every month is USB charging equipment.<br/>It's definitely 4 star worthy and fairly priced.<br/>I am buying it again for another room.
 The unit charged slowly and works as advertised however I personally do not like the sound quality or lack there of. It paired ok and no issue playing. I would recommend saving more to pay more and get a quality brand. There is no bass and sounds kind of "tinny" and cheap, because it is. $40 more and I got a JBL unit that blows this cheap version out of the water. Yes, it cost more but for this type product it is worth paying more for quality sound that you will enjoy for a long time. I recommend passing on this product.
 I bought this on deal day and I am glad I did. I do a lot of outdoor chores and I often have headphones in while I'm working outside. Sometimes those headphones just get bothersome. I used this while I was working on some barn doors outside and there was plenty of volume for me. I also used it while I worked out in my home gym and it was plenty loud there as well. I listened to country music while working and metal while exercising. Both genres sounded equally good on this speaker.
 I bought this speaker for my wife to use while she exercises. With that said, it had to be louder than her exercise equipment and other background noise and also provide an environment that would lead you to want to work out. This speaker does that and so much more. It pairs well with iPhone, iPad, and Android devices. Its plenty loud to use in medium sized room and provides adequate base... but not so much that the walls shake. This speaker seems to be made for pop music. Spoken word, audiobooks, and netflix play very well with this speaker. I was able to compare to a Bose soundlink... these two speakers are comparable. Of course the Bose had a deeper base and was louder. The Bose sounded just a little better or rather had better audio quality. The Anker speaker was better at pairing with multiple devices. With that said... you can buy 5 of these Anker speaker and have change left over. I would not hesitate recommending these speakers to anyone. They are an excellent buy, sound good, and built to last.
 This thing is awesome! I just spent two weeks fixing up my new house and this was a life saver. I could carry it around with me from room to room, or put it somewhere centrally located. I kept my phone in my pocket the whole time, and the bluetooth never cut out no matter where I went. Granted, it's a small house, but I was happy with it. Sound quality is surprisingly good for such an affordable speaker.
 I thought that this speaker was okay for the price, but I was not impressed. The Soundcore had such high reviews that I guess I expected a lot more from it! Many reviews mention that the sound is very clear, but I found the sound to be a little muffled, especially on louder volumes. The bass is pretty insubstantial as well. However, these speakers look and feel nice; I like the design, it's easy to turn on/off and pair with devices (the automatic unpairing by pressing the bluetooth button by accident is a little annoying), and is fine for general listening. I'll probably keep these for casual use but I'm just a bit disappointed by the sound quality. I haven't tried other speakers in the same price range, but I'd imagine you get what you pay for.<br/><br/>UPDATE: after my initial review, Anker reached out to me and offered to send me the upgraded Soundcore 2 because I was disappointed. They were very prompt with getting back to me and are genuinely interested in customer satisfaction. The soundcore 2 is much better in sound quality! I found that the sound was more clear, and there’s a significant improvement to the bass. Maybe not the best speakers out there, but you can’t  beat the price and outstanding customer service!
 I purchased this a few months back for a summer trip, and have been using it consistently since then. The sound quality is very solid for the price. I would consider myself a discerning listener, and have been happy with what the Anker puts out. It could stand to be a little louder at max volume, but it makes sense given the size.<br/>The most notable feature has been the battery life. I think the 24 hour estimate is pretty accurate. I never find myself worrying about the battery, as long as remember to charge it every week or so.<br/>The signal range is pretty good. I don't know exactly, but if you are within earshot of the speaker, you're probably fine.<br/>The build quality is solid, it feels appropriately weighted and there aren't many seams or flaws that will fall apart. The buttons are pretty clicky and work as expected.<br/>The speakerphone functionality isn't great but I've only wanted to use it once or twice. Just not a big deal.<br/>Pairing is easy enough, but you will sometimes need to delete the device from your phone's Bluetooth list in order to reconnect, especially if you have paired it to multiple devices.<br/>Overall, for the $30 or so I paid, this is a fantastic device. My friends and I were thrilled to have it with us on our travels, and I have enjoyed it in a variety of other situations since we returned. It has worked well for office listening, outdoor use, while showering, etc, etc.<br/>Maybe soon there will be a new device to supersede it, but I highly recommend the SoundCore
 I’ve used this devices regularly since purchasing it over a year ago and has not ever disappointed.<br/>The sound quality has been absolutely amazing and isn’t expected for a sub $30 speaker of this size. It can easily fill a room with audio.<br/>It’s super simple and fast to pair without any concerns.<br/>My favorite part of this device is the STELLER batter life. Anker has it listed as 24 hours of playback. Over the year that I’ve owned it, I’ve legitimately have only charged it 5 times, max. IN ONE YEAR. I never actually ran out of juice, either.<br/>The best part of purchasing an Anker product is price of mind. One year and three weeks after my purchase through amazon, for what ever reason, it stopped working. After contacting Anker’s customer service, I was told that there’s a 18 month warranty. Before I even finished troubleshooting and answering questions, I received an email that my new device is on the way!<br/>I’ve used a range of Anker products in our household and will be countinue for years to come.<br/>Quality products with affordable pricing!!
 So far so good, i dont really wasn't really looking for a new speaker, but i saw this one in discount, so i pull the trigger, and i dont regreat it, its an awesome speaker with an more awesome play time, im using it right now in my office to play some Rime game soundtracks, as some one mention, you cannot go wrong with this speaker<br/><br/>Pro's :<br/>-awesome playtime<br/>-nice sound with no distortion  ( not súper loud but good enough<br/>-portable enough (not súper Tiny)<br/>-aux in<br/>-pricetag<br/> cons:<br/>-not really one, Would be nice a Little more power on the sound, and Maybe a model a bit more compact (with out losing Quality)
 You can't go wrong with Anker products. This is another solid unit with good sound, great feel, and a long battery... a great overall value. My only complaint – small that it is – is that the blue light signaling BT connection is every so slightly off-center to the right. I mean, come on! It's out of alignment with the K and the Play button on top! Have you no taste? Have you no design ethic? Who signed off on this???<br/><br/>But, seriously, I love Anker products. They can do no wrong in my book.
 As usual Anker products have gone above and beyond.  I have several different charging cords, charging blocks and portable charging blocks from Anker.  I have purchased two of these SoundCore Speakers and am regularly blown away.  Previously I had purchased another Bluetooth Speaker fro JBL, and while it is a good speaker it was almost $100 more than the Anker and honestly, the Anker is just plain better.  Holds a charge beautifully, sound is amazing, and easy to use.  Again, Anker has outdone themselves and I am and will continue to be a loyal customer.
 The good:  nice sound, good battery life.<br/>The not-so-good: controls hard to identify,  Very slightly raised areas in the rubber wrap-around mark the locations of the control buttons underneath.  Not easy to find either in light (by sight) or in dark (by feel).<br/>The worst: Thick rubber wrap-around hides orientation of USB charging receptacle, makes insertion difficult.  Good lighting and extra-ordinary attention are needed to determine proper orientation of the USB plug.  Bunged mine up after four months, making the speaker un-rechargeable.
 It was great with beautiful sound and no annoying “POWER ON/BLUETOOTH MODE” voice yelling at me when we would charge it or travel with it. But now a year later it has begun to crackle every time we use it, like an old stereo speaker on a record player.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>Sooooo....customer service saw this review and have since gone way above and beyond to make sure we are happy with the product. They sent a new speaker that arrived literally two days after they spoke to me and that did the same thing, which was very weird. They didn’t stop there and sent me a shipping label for the first two so they could check the speakers for defects and once they saw those were in the mail, they sent me an upgraded version of the speaker which so far has been wonderful except for a shorter battery life because of the added power output. Five stars for customer service, even if the speaker weren’t that great. But it is! The sound is amazing and still no annoying voice, so thank you!
 Just received my Soundcore today and I have to say it has exceeded my expectations.  I own 3 other Bluetooth speakers:  Logitech 100X,  Anker Classic, and Anker Aluminum.  Compared to the other 3, the Anker Soundcore is the hands down the sound quality and volume winner.  The Anker Classic is a close second in the sound quality department,  but it can get nowhere near as loud as the Soundcore.  Cannot comment on the battery life because I only just received it but all of my Anker products have performed very well. The Soundcore isn't as cool looking as the Anker aluminum or as portable as the X100 but if you are just looking for the best sounding speaker at this price point I highly recommend it.  For 29 bucks it is a great bargain.
 First:  I am a regular customer, just like you, I've never been asked to write a review in exchange for getting the product free.  I paid the regulr price for this product, etc.<br/><br/>Delvery was excellent as usual for Amazon.  The packaging was actually awesome - very secure, sturdy box.<br/><br/>The speaker is very sturdy and has substance.  I've only had the product for a few days, so I will update if anything changes, but the speaker is great for these reasons:<br/><br/>1)  It works!<br/>2) Sounds great -- good enough to play music and feel like you're hearing most of the music (tone, depth, notes)<br/>3)  The Bluetooth connects first time, every time - flawless so far<br/>4)  You can connect to the mini-plug directly from any sound source--it works great, and I think you can leave it connected and still play from a Bluetooth source<br/>5)  It looks great--I got red, and it makes a fashion statement in my office<br/><br/>I would recommend this to a friend who needs a Bluetooth speaker for office or home....
 I bought a iPod Nano 7th Generation, and my old iPod dock died on me (different manufacturer). So did some research on a new speaker. I found this one and it had high reviews, and purchased it. It actually exceeded my expectations. I found I can use it with my older model iPod Nano, which is not Bluetooth capable, I just needed to hook it up with an audio cord. It works, wonderfully.<br/><br/>If you want to keep it plugged into the wall, just make sure you have an USB/wall adapter, since it does come with the USB cord, (which is rather short) it does NOT come with a wall adapter.<br/><br/>The size is compact, so it's very easy to pack for travel. I purchased a travel case for it, (that came with a carrying strap and an audio cord) which I found it to be pretty durable.
 Sound quality is very poor.  For something as relatively big and heavy, it should sound considerably better.  Look folks, if you want a speaker that sounds good, really good.  Good like the one's you walk by in the store, then you're going to have to spend a lot more than $25.<br/><br/>Updated:  After reading my review, I was contacted by Anker.  They apologized for the experience I had and offered to send me an Anker Soundcore II to review.  It arrived today and I was very pleasantly surprised at how much difference there was between the Soundcore I and Soundcore II.  Moving this up to 4 stars just for the support and concern.
 I hadn't used my speaker for a month or so, and when I went to use it, it wasn't working. After a lot of back and forth by email, Anker sent me a new speaker. I wish they had the kind of support that Apple provides, namely, someone to talk to on the phone, because I had trouble pairing my new speaker with the Bluetooth on my iPhone 5. However, I finally figured it out. The sound is great on the new speaker and best of all, it works. One thing I don't like is that all the buttons on the speaker are virtually invisible. Would it kill them to make them in white on black, instead of black on black?
 I use this at my construction work site job,, and while it's definitely not the loudest Bluetooth speaker around,,, its good enough for a speaker you can throw in your tool bag and whip out any time for a full work day of music play,,( battery has lasted all day for me) ..probably not good enough if you're on an outside job with alot of loud construction sounds going on..,, but for my indoors new construction work site,,, it's been serving me well,,,<br/>So far so good.. Thanks for another great Product Anker<br/>Update... So while the speaker still works well... The Micro USB port has just fallen apart overtime and will no longer be able to charge... If there is a weak point to this lil Bluetooth speaker... It would be the just that... ( flimsy micro USB port ) So  l will deduct one star from my original 5..
 Bought 3 of these at a great discount during the holiday season (Prime sales) to give as Christmas gifts. Super happy 2 of them stayed in my own household. I'm no sound engineer, but the quality of these are right on par w/ our Bose Mini (which we love). Hope to catch one of these for myself next year!<br/><br/>6 month update - love them even more.  The 2 in my house are used regularly (teens), surely knocked around, and since the initial charging, have NEVER BEEN RE-CHARGED. Seriously.  I've taken to borrowing these over using my Bose bc they connect so much easier - they instantly pick up signal &amp; just, play. The Bose always takes a few tries to sync and/or play when it is synced - it always has!<br/>Every time I use one I'm updated, "Mom - still haven't charged it." Seriously doubt they even know where the chargers are. Maybe there's a backup battery? Maybe I'll go back &amp; check; regardless, these are amazing.
 Bought it in 2017. Used it a couple of times, less than 35 time, mo joke I barely used it. It never got wet or dropped. The speaker sounds like it has popped, everything that I play can't be understood unless I lower the volume. The battery life never worked for 24 hours (some 7 hours, yeah maybe, it always made the low battery sound), I barely used it with Bluetooth.
 This is a great little stereo! It projects lots and clear and well. It's really compact and is sleek, perfect for teaching Kundalini Yoga where every I go. 😄<br/>The only things I have come across so far (used it 3 times so far) is that even with my phone on silent mode for phone calls, it made noises when someone was calling me. I would put it on airplane mode, but I needed internet connection to play the music...<br/>The other thing is when the volume is turned up all the way it makes a beeping noise which interrupts your music, so I've learned to just put it to the volume just below the highest option.<br/>Other then these few little quirky things I'm really pleased with it and I'm excited to get to know it more.
 Watched a review on YouTube about these before I bought this for wife. Was impressed with what I heard and specs I saw on it. So I chanced it.<br/>Don't let the low price make you nervous,  really this is the best cheap end wireless speaker you can find. Has good bass for a little thing.  Wife takes it to beach near us to work out (yoga). It's range of sound is really well distorted. As far as range from speaker to device wasn't as good as we hoped but mainly we just got it to boost volume of sound. It even came a day before it was suppose to. Shipping package unharmed. Beta even has enjoyed the tunes ;)
 UPDATE:<br/>Excellent customer service! Mine was not working after a year use and they contacted me right away and they told me the warranty is 18 months. I tried all their suggestions but the old one still cannot connect to any of my devices. Then they sent me a new one very soon! Will see if this one can last longer! Then it will be 5 stars for sure!<br/><br/>Original review:<br/>first of all, I like this product a lot. it's convenient and the sounds are good. But after a year use, it failed to connected to my devices. The blue light keeps blinking and unable to connect anymore. One year life is pretty short for a speaker.
 this thing is great. this is my first bluetooth speaker and i love it. I actually got it to help the girls during cheer practice hear the music better, so I bought it becuase it was very affordable. I'm so glad i did! This thing is great to keep music in the bathroom or other parts of the house where I don't have speakers.  Lastly, my little one thiks it super cool to "talk to Grammy in the speaker"  sound is great considering how small it is.
 I bought this speaker to use at work because I read that the battery life is great. Great is an understatement. The battery life on these speakers are phenomenal. I use it for a couple hours almost everyday and after the first year of owning it I’ve charged it twice. TWICE! The sound quality is incredible for its price. The speaker is super durable. It’s been dropped many times and it doesn’t do any damage to it due to the soft exterior. And it can get loud without losing it’s crisp sound quality.
 This is simple to pair and provides very good sound. I use mine while outdoors to stream music. I took it on a short trip with my daughter since the car is old and enabled her to stream music while driving. It helped solve a problem she had while driving on the highway so I let her keep it and purchased another for myself. It does work while charging but only comes with a USB cable for charging but I wouldn't hesitate recommending it to a friend.
 I'm a big Anker fan.  I  own many of their products.  I'm sorry to have to say that this Soundcore speaker is the first time I've been disappointed.  The sound is just OK.  It is somewhat tinny sounding.  I hoped for it to be fuller sounding.  The bass is pretty minimal, despite the claims in the product description.  Of course, with no tone/equalization adjustments, I'm stuck with the way it sounds.  It is what it is, as they say.  I wasn't expecting it to sound like something four-five times more expensive  JBL, Bose, etc.]. I'm not "that guy".  I was just expecting better based on Anker's own product description and, yes, based on the many 5-star reviews.  One other issue for me are the controls on top.  They are aesthetically cool giving a seamless look to the unit  which is solid in its build].  However, I can't see these controls and I can't seem to get them by feel.  No don't hate on me kids, but I'm 60 years old this month!  I have to actually turn a lamp on right over this speaker to be able to see the controls.  Even in regular room light they are invisible to me!  Don't laugh, you'll get here someday if you live long enough!  So, I wish I could be more enthusiastic about this speaker.  I think my expectations were realistic, based on my great experience with Anker products in the past, Anker's product description and the vast majority of positive reviews.  This time, with the Soundcore, my expectations were not met and I'm a little disappointed.  I'll still buy Anker in the future.  You can't win 'em all!
 When I played some music at high volume I didn't hear any distortion so I'm impressed by that. The bass is not strong but it isn't distorted either with the music I was playing, which was admittedly not often bass heavy. Even so I love the sound. It is rich and full, not the tinny sound I expected.<br/>Pros<br/>- Feels great in your hands. It's got some heft and it is soft and slightly rubbery to the touch, which is nice.<br/>- Sound quality is very nice. It has a full, rich sound rather than the tinny sound of some other speakers<br/>- I got the color blue<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- Not much bass. I haven't heard it distort so that's good but it's not there for the really deep bass.
 The sound is nice, clear and loud but the battery and charging are terrible. It will never last 24 hrs. The battery charge is really weak and yes I'm using that USB cable that comes with it. This thing works well as long as it's on and plugged. If it's off then you will have a hard time turning it back on. Since the charge is really weak you need to plug in the power and let it charge for about 5 mins to attempt a paring otherwise you will end up frustrated because it will not turn on. Perhaps they should add a wall charger instead that gives the power it really needs.
 First off I'm already a fan of Anker, so it wasn't hard to convince me to buy their Bluetooth Speaker. Look I'm not going to dissect both this Anker and more expensive ones, but I can tell you for the price your paying, its worth it ten folds.  The wifey boss has the main ownership of the more expensive one and I needed one for when I'm at my 2nd job, which is remodeling the house, and this is unbelievably amazing and once again, for the price, its worth it.  Bass good, loudness good, connectivity good, battery life good.....what more do you want, just buy it.
 Inexpensive! Great battery life!  Very portable! Sound quality is better than expected!<br/><br/>This is the best portable speaker on Amazon by far. If this is your price range, be reasonable. $40 won't get you far when it comes to speakers except for here
 Looks nice feels nice but broke down so fast I only got to use it twice.<br/><br/>It is very difficult to power and adjust settings.  In order to power on and adjust volume you have have to push hard to power on the device.  The power button ended up breaking and customer service was awful and not helpful.  I wasted my money.  If you're looking for a Bluetooth speaker I suggest finding a different model avoid this brand.
 For the price...Amazing! No regrets! Wanted a speaker that would last for a camping trip. Battery is fantastic. Connected easily. I am picky about sound - we have a Harmon Kardon speaker at home that is amazing but not very portable, we also have an i-home portable speaker that I paid more for and the sound does not compare to the Anker! Clear not fuzzy. Love it! The only thing that would make it better if it were water-proof/resistant.
 The battery won't charge after 19 month of use.  I emailed Anker about  the issue. First email, they said it's out of warranty and there is nothing they can do. Then their rep reached out to me and help me to fix the issue. I am very happy with their customer service. This review was changed due to their care to long term customer. I would recommend SoundCore 2 for the much better sound quality and it's good value with the sale price.
 Absolute bang for the buck! the sound is clear even the tiny background ones and the bass of this speaker complements it. I am quite happy with this speaker and satisfied by its quality. The built is good and looks uber. I would recommend this speaker without any hesitation who doesn't want to spend a lot on speakers such as jbl, bose, etc. and yet get excellent quality sound. The main feature is the freaking battery! I have been testing it since it got delivered on 18th Feb and playing it for an hour or two or less. I think I have used it so far for about 20-21 hours without any problem. The Bluetooth connectivity is reliable too and establishing a connection is child's play...just turn it on and it'll connect within few seconds. Awesome product for the price tag it comes with.
 For the price the sound is superb. The range is exactly what you should expect for any bluetooth device around the house. And maybe better outside.<br/><br/>So far we haven't pushed the battery life but six hours was no probllem and a full charge took about an hour.<br/><br/>It does have occasional lip sync issues but that seems to be a common bluetooth problem.<br/><br/>This isn't Bose quality sound but buck for buck it is better.
 Anker Products does it again, over the years I have owned numerous products from Anker and find them to be top notch and their customer service is great. I purchased one of these speakers and was so pleased I immediately bought another. I also own several Bose products and will admit that these speakers are equivalent to them.
 The speaker paired with my iPhone and iPad very easy. Played a song and the sound was alright but not great as you would expect at this price point. Honestly I was pleased with the way it sounded for what I was going to use it for. However half way through the second song it just stopped playing. I cleared the device from my iPad and paired again. No sound. Paired it with my iPhone, still no sound. The device pairs and connects fine, just doesn’t have any sound. And with a speaker sound is rather important.<br/><br/>I called Ankers self described “friendly” customer service, well that didn’t go to well. The gal seemed friendly enough at first, then I asked if this was a known issue like I have been reading online on Ankers supported website. Immediately after that question she became not so friendly, almost defensive. After she raised her voice I thanked her and ended the call. My summary, to much hassle for a 30 dollar product. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more on a better product.
 Simply won't stay synced. Bought this to listen to audiobooks. Syncs with my Note 4 seamlessly, and then bounces in and out of connection after a few minutes, and ultimately loses it completely by 7-10 minute-mark. Connection sequencing and proximity have no effects. Returning immediately.<br/><br/>UPDATE: 15 January 2016: To my surprise, ANKER responded energetically, to my initial negative review, and after a sustained appeal, persuaded me to give the SoundCore another try. Despite my skepticism, the second device works works flawlessly. I've been using pretty hard for nearly a fortnight, and there have been absolutely no issues whatsoever. I guess that the first purchase was simply a lemon. Number Two is the bluetooth speaker that I desired, and I am eager to continue making good use of it.
 This little speaker is a nice sounding speaker for it price. Does the job just fine for my needs. I was surprised when I got a phone call while I was listening to music and it came across the speaker and was able to talk thru the speaker without having to switch to the phone. For the price, the quality of sound is very good and has plenty of volume. I bought this to replace a much more expensive wireless speaker that quit working. It is very easy to pair and has a decent range as I have had this speaker outside on my patio and had my phone in the house and all worked flawlessly. I may get another in the near future.
 It's a blue tooth speaker. That works and surprisingly, it works pretty well. It has a cool rubberized coating so it's non-slip when you are moving it around. The controls are easy to use. I dislike the brand name smeared across the front. And it only pairs to one phone at a time. We found this out the hard way when my wife and I both tried to pair our phones to it at different times.<br/><br/>Additional notes.. I got a TrendNet Bluetooth 4.0 USB adapter for my 2010 Mac Pro and now I can pair the SoundCore to my Mac. This little speaker works better than the discreet  Boston speaker I've been using for some years. Pretty sweet.
 I wanted a portable speaker and this thing delivers. It's battery life is so long that I forget to charge it, well above the 6-8 hours I would have realistically have expected. The sound can at times sound slightly tinny, but arguably better than the price tag.<br/><br/>The amazing part however is how harmless the Anker warranty is. My device had failed and wouldn't power on, so I went to the warranty claims on Anker's website. Not only was it easy to find and fill out, but the rep I spoke to about it was kind. She asked me to test charging it with another cable. That didn't work, so she put in for a replacement to be sent to me. No crazy nagging questions, no having to return my device first, no paying shipping, nothing. Just a brand new, working Anker product. These guys stand by their warranty!<br/><br/>If you need a speaker for cheap that can do bluetooth, get this.
 AAAHHHH!! This is more like it! I ordered another brand, then sent it back because it was barely louder than my IPhone. This is exactly what I was hoping for. This Anker speaker has a strong, clear sound, and I haven’t even chosen the enhanced bass option on my phone. The sound is AMAZING for such a small speaker (it’s maybe a 1/2 inch longer than my iPhone. Thank you, Anker. Now I have something to listen to while I am cooking!😃
 We have received, charged and done one test run of this unit.  The sound was surprisingly good for this little performer.  The initial test run involved range testing (moved from one end of the house to the other and then down to the basement).  The signal resulted in performance issues only at the extreme of opposite ends of the house on two different levels.  The performance was still good if the speaker was taken into the garage or outside of the house to the front porch.  This exceeded my expectations.  I have not done a charge duration test (run the battery down and track the time it takes to run out of power).  If there is ever a concern or long term performance issue I will update this review, but at this time I am very happy with this purchase.
 This is a sweet little speaker, really impressive. I use it when I'm doing projects outside, or even while tending to lawn chores. It produces clear sound, even at surprisingly high volumes. Depending on where I'm working, I sometimes set it in the bed or on the bumper of my pickup, which helps to focus and direct the sound, but it sounds good playing from the patio table, too. The range and battery life are both much longer than expected. I've taken the speaker into the back yard and it was still cranking out the tunes even though I forgot to pick up the phone and left it in the garage. After coming in from the yard, it easily wipes clean with a damp cloth. It has a good, sturdy weight to it, and slips easily into my backpack without making it feel like I've added a brick. (It really does feel like a brick in your hand, but is a bit smaller than an actual brick.)
 In less than 6 months after purchase the battery is dead.<br/><br/>SECOND REVIEW:<br/><br/>I first made my ONE STAR review because the box stopped working after 6 months and when I tried to return it through amazon and it did not allow me to do so. However, the manufacturer, when saw my review contacted me directly and sent me a new one, which works great. But what I liked most onthis whole process was their customer service.
 This little blue speaker box is just AMAZING !! It can get loud, I mean loud! Pairs with phone and iPad easily and plays movies great! I've had for for a few weeks and just last Saturday afternoon it needed a charge, after using it every workday for a minimum of 5 hours of uninterrupted play time? Never in my life has a bluetooth speaker done so well! I may have to order another in a different color for home! Thanks again Anker, you've got a lifelong fan!
 Just received my speaker in the mail today. Right off the bat, I was impressed with the box of the speaker. Feels quality and looks good. Inside the box, you get the speaker, instructions, and charging cable. There is no charging brick, so you'll have to use one of your own. The speaker looks and feels really nice too! It does not feel cheap. The top buttons look good and operate well with my iPhone 7.<br/>Another plus - the charger is the typical USB that most android phones use currently (not USB C, I know most android is changing to that now). A cheap walmart speaker I tried for a bit used an old version of USB charging that was a pain to replace if I lost it.<br/>Connecting to my phone was super fast and easy. I've had horrible experiences trying to connect to other speakers, so I'm very happy about how fast it was. The speaker itself is pretty bass-y and LOUD. And the sound quality is pretty impressive. This assessment was done inside my apartment. I haven't test it outside yet, but I will update when I have.<br/>As of day one with the speaker (Oct. 3), I am very happy with this purchase. I would recommend it to friends and family.
 I purchased this speaker at the end of October 2016 and charged it to full before use and I just now had to charge it for the first time. 3 and a half months later. And I use it about 4-5 times a week for an hour at a time for in the shower or around the house. Definitely the best speaker I've used and especially at this price point. Previously had another speaker at the same price and the battery lasted about one use and would die while it was beteeen uses so just not turn on. And the sound quality is great too, better if you put it in the corner but great overall! A+
 Very nice bluetooth speaker. Small, sound quality is great and battery life is excellent. As far as sound volume goes it would be nice to have a little more volume. That said it still work great around the campfire with 15 people.
 Stopped being able to connect via Bluetooth in under 6 months :(<br/>Update - customer service was excellent to me and replaced my product free of charge and super quickly! I greatly appreciate their commitment to excellent customer service and satisfaction! I added another star to my original review for this. I am very satisfied with my anker speaker, but time will tell if this issue occurs again with the replacement speaker.
 Amazed at the quality of the sound yet the Bass wont shake your windows. Of course this is a small speaker so, hence the physics of what its capable of limits the amount of Bass generated, but the volume exceeds all physical dimensions and can get quite loud. I used this while riding my Motorbike through town and it held up under the engine and road noise. Light and easy to place or hide in any pouch or bag.
 A few nights a week, I use this to stream background noise for about 5 hours at a time, so this product easily meets the 24 hour playtime. Never have had a dead battery from charging this only ONCE per week.  Of course you will spend a little more time when recharging, however, the ability for me to use this all week without a charge is what I care about most (nothing like a dead bluetooth speaker in the middle of the night) . One reviewer complained about the "power on" sound. Oh boo hoo. It isn't a nuisance and really don't think the workers in close proximity would mind hearing that chime. Even if they did, they're likely the type who are a downer on everything so who cares.
 I have owned three of these Anker SoundCore speakers since 2016.  In that time all of them have had the same problem:  the power cord jack expands and the power cord will not fit snugly in the enlarged power cord jack and therefore will not charge. I got a replacement from Anker for the first one.  The second one was unable to charge one month after the 18 month warranty date and I was told Anker would not do anything about it.  I bought one August 1, 2018.  I bought a three year warranty with it.  Why did I buy a third one after the other three (two purchased, one replacement) ?  The sound is fantastic, the pairing is easy and works every time and the speaker lasts a very, very long time on a full charge  (I'm speaking of at least a week of listening to audiobooks). The cost of the speaker and the warranty makes the speaker still a bargain.  Buy this, but insure it.
 i bought this speaker with not a lot of expectation but I was blown away at how good it sounded. Later down the road I bought a different brand thinking we will just see the difference. I was very surprised how sub par sounding it was to this speaker. The battery lasts for ever, the sound has good bass, it pairs up with no problems and let me tell you, Anker customer support is the BEST. They stand behind their products. I have some Of their cables that fritzed out. They made it good. So don’t by that triangle waterproof speaker. It’s not worth you money. Stick with Anker.
 I got this speaker for general purposes. The first day, the speaker was perfect! After the second day of using it, I noticed a buzzing noise coming from the speaker. I didn't know what it was at first since there was no noise that was going thru the speaker at all. The volume was all the way down and the buzzing noise was still there. I am still not able to figure out what is happening. I could have given it a better review but right now I am not too happy about my purchase. I hope that Anker customer support can assist me and give me a refund or replace my speaker.<br/><br/>Edit: They replaced my speaker and it works perfectly fine. Thank You Anker!
 Awesome little speaker.  The blue definitely looks a lot nicer in person than online.  The finish of the color also makes it feel really nice in the hands.  Sounds pretty good for being so small.  I don't like that when you reach the top level of volume it makes a really loud tone to let you know.  I don't mind that it notifies you, but the tone is quite piercing and louder than the music.  This freaks everyone out who is in the vicinity.<br/><br/>The battery is absolutely phenomenal!!!  I leave it playing as I sleep and it still has juice in the morning.<br/><br/>The controls are simple, and it connects to my phone flawlessly everytime.<br/><br/>Great purchase, and I will look to the Anker name again in the future.
 When it worked, the sound was great but after two months it completely stopped working.  It never left my desk top during this time so it wasn’t due to rough handling.  Sad quality!<br/>UPDATE 8/18/18:  After my original review, the manufacturer contacted me and offered to replace my failed unit.  I received the new one promptly and it has been working great.  As with the original speaker, I love the sound. My new one has reliably connected with my iPhone at least twice per day since then.  If this one continues to work as it does now, I would upgrade my rating to four stars because the manufacturer stood behind their product.
 Anker has been my go to for phone accessories and now is my go to for bluetooth speakers.  Battery life is amazing, sound quality is excellent.  You won't find a better speaker at this price point.  I've recommended them to family and friends, and have heard nothing but great feedback.  Range is also excellent.  I didn't have to deal with their customer service on this order, but did once before, and they are professional and awesome.
 At the $20-25 price point, you can't go wrong with this Bluetooth attachable speaker.  Sound is a 7 out of 10, with good volume levels and descent lows and highs.  One of the best sound outputs at this price.  The construct is the best part... Feels similar to the Bose speaker I paid $199 for.  Very solid feel and great quality materials used.  Weighing in all aspects of price, sound quality and quality of materials, I give this an easy 5 star rating.
 I have had a few of these little speakers - always by different manufacturers - and this one could be the best, at least when considering the cost vs. the value. It lasts forever. Last week, I was working outside with music on this fellow, the battery got low and started to chirp, and it continued to play for just over 2 more hours. It may have lasted even longer, but I was done working so I shut her down and plugged her up. The only slight knock that I have is that the supplied charge is almost required. The rubber protectant adds some thickness where the charger plugs in, so Anker's charger allows for this, whereas most others do not. While other charges will work, the don't really "snap" in so you have to keep on eye on the progress.
 I've been wanting a bluetooth speaker for a while but never did because I do believe it is something nice to have but not essential. a luxury item.<br/>Seeing the Anker soundcore on "Today's Deals" was very exciting.<br/>I trust the Anker brand so I was more inclined to purchase.<br/>I bought this for $20 (ish) and I do enjoy it. Im using it as I write this review!<br/>I would NEVER have bought it for the original price.<br/>Something nice to have but nothing quite impressive.
 Edit: I contacted Anker customer service right after posting the previous review. They replaced the speaker completely free of charge after I described the problem. VERY happy with their customer service and the replacement speaker works great just like the original did at first. Updating to five stars.<br/><br/>Loved this while it lasted. Great sound for the price. But a little over a year after purchase--it has stopped working. Just suddenly stopped working one day after the battery ran low (tried multile different chargers).
 I was looking for a small portable Bluetooth speaker that I could use around the house or at work that wouldn't break the bank but offer good sound, so, having good luck with Anker products in the past, I bought this little guy.<br/><br/>The sound is clear and clean and the battery life is awesome, but there is simply no bass.  After playing it for a few hours, I shut off bluetooth on my HTC 10 and played directly through the phone's speakers and I have to honestly say the HTC 10 BoomSound is just as good if not a little better (to put this in perspective, I liked the HTC One M8's BoomSound better than the HTC 10) So I'm afraid this one is going back.<br/><br/>So three stars because it delivers clean, clear mids and highs and performs well at it's price point, but it doesn't match the sound of my cell phone speakers, so that's a deal breaker for me.
 I’m very disappointed in this product. It worked wonderful from December - April, but then started automatically disconnecting and eventually the sound was so fuzzy I had to throw it out.<br/><br/>I’m an Esthetician and use this speaker during services, so it completely ruined the service every time the speaker malfunctioned. Very sad.<br/><br/>Update - speaker was replaced quickly by the company. Works pretty good at the moment.
 I use this since my iPad lost the speaker function, but blue tooth works.  The greatest merit of this device has the long battery life.  It said 24 hours, and I didn't measure the time, but I can sense it could be very true.  I only charged three times since I bought it two months ago.  The sound quality is doable but I can't say it is better than one I have other blue tooth speaker.
 Works wonderful. The sound is great. No problems connecting the Bluetooth.<br/>an add-on to my review...Had a problem with the speaker having no sound after a few months of playing.  It would connect, but no no sound. I contacted the company and they were WONDERFUL!  Even sent me a new speaker to replace the faulty one.  No fears dealing with this company and the new speaker plays great.<br/><br/>I just ordered another one of their products. A power bank battery.
 While is not the best sound quality, for the size and price, it is a great speaker. I bough it over a year ago and it is still strong.  The bluetooth range is great.  However, if there are two of these speakers within the same building, there might be some issues.  I turned my speaker on, and a co-worker on the second floor (I was on the first floor) accidentally connected to my speaker and I was hearing his music.  Great battery life, and I highly recommend this product.
 I was skeptical when my wife bought this speaker due to its low price (I associated low cost with cheap product) but I was sorely mistaken. This little speaker produces great sound and easily fills a small to medium room with ease. The biggest surprise was the battery life. We spent a weekend away and forgot the charger yet it lasted the whole time with 4ish hours a day. No, it's not going to give you the sound quality of your full blown home system but great on the go, a great value for the price, and a heck of a lot nicer than your phone speaker.
 Had it for a little over a month and use it pretty regularly and I've never charged after the first time. My phone once connected says this bad boy is still at 90% charge which can't be true after the hours I've played it but I don't know for sure because it hasn't died yet.<br/><br/>So battery life is absolutely incredible. Sounds pretty good but the bass could obviously be richer - I really have no complaints about this $40 speaker. I even made my mom buy one and she loves hers too.<br/><br/>I've had nothing but good results from Anker. Once a battery charger I bought from them broke about 3-4 months after I bought it, I have them a 1 star review and they mailed me a free replacement - no questions asked.<br/><br/>Highly recommend.
 I bought the Anker Soundcore for two reasons. First, I enjoy listening to music in the bathroom while I am getting ready for my day. Second, I travel and use the Anker for music in my hotel room, stretching exercises and for music in the room I do my corporate training in. This is not the sound quality of a Bose, Beats, Marshall or other excellent speaker systems. But the sound is good, fairly loud and the EQ is balanced well. Set up is a breeze for the Bluetooth with a mobile smartphone or iPad.  Will probably buy more of these for my kids to use in their rooms and as gifts for friends.
 I really like this little speaker but it doesn't have a lot of bass and makes all of the songs sound flat or lack luster. Connecting to it is also a pain every now and then but my major complaint is the lack of a good bass and that it doesn't get as loud as I'd hoped. I personally wouldn't buy again if I had an option but the quality of the material, and the battery life are great! The sound isn't bad either!<br/>I am looking for another speaker but this one is okay for now.
 This thing is amazing...<br/><br/>I wasnt sure I wanted a purely bluetooth speaker that didnt have AM/FM and other features, but this thing is very compact and sounds better than any cheap boombox alternative I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Excited to use it while working in the garage, in my office for talk radio and also on the golf course for some tunes. It sounds great and holds a charge very long.<br/><br/>I absolutely love it, and ANKER delivers a great product as usual. Buy with confidence and don't bother with overpriced stuff from Bose or Beats. This gets the job done superbly and I'm not some speaker snob. Im sure a Bose nut could tell be why a soundlink is better, but I will tell him that I don't care.
 Great battery, solid performance.  The sound is a bit flat.  Could have a bit more on the high end.  Also not the loudest, but for my use it is sufficient.  I wish for a modern phone it was waterproof, but I knew it wasn't when I bought it.  I believe the 2nd Gen is, though.  Battery life is great.  I have yet to see what the total length is, but it goes well beyond an entire day of normal use.
 This Bluetooth speaker is absolutely fantastic! The highs, mids and lows are all very clear even at full volume. The build quality is very good albeit a bit simplistic in its styling (it still looks good so I really can't complain). Its the Sound Cores function that matters more to me, in that regard the Anker Sound Core delivers on sound quality, battery life and its ability to quickly pair with my phone!<br/><br/>If there was one down side it would be a small issue which doesn't affect me. But if your into Rap music or any other Genre that focuses on heavy electronic bass then look at Anker's higher end speakers. The Sound Core produces wonderful lows, but it will fail to recreate heavy electronic bass with any authority. This is to be expected at this price point and also for the size and wattage of the sound drivers.<br/><br/>I also wish the Sound Core came with a small bag to protect it, The A7908 and A7910 come with one and an Auxiliary cable. But I suppose those extras would have driven up the price?  I still think it would have been a nice touch.<br/><br/>But all in all I am happy with my purchase, I would recommend these speakers.
 We wound up returning this unit as the bottom end sounded very hollow. If you are looking for a cheap speaker to just tote around to the beach or family BBQ then by all means pick this little guy up. Do yourself a favor and spend a few more bucks and upgrade to the Anker 20w version though. The sound difference is amazing.
 My husband bought this for me for Christmas, and I absolutely love it! the sound quality is great, its easy to take anywhere I go, I have it on 80% of the time! He has a different brand that isn't as great on the sound, and two other brands that my children own, and now, everyone wants to use mine. I can't say enough good things about it. I just wish it would let me know when it connects to my device, that is the only thing I do not like about it, I just have to start playing music and see if it connects. other than that, its a great buy and a great price!
 I knew my wife wanted a speaker to stream music to from her iPhone 6. After looking at many portable speakers and reading Amazon reviews, I purchased this speaker. Wireless, Bluetooth, with 24 hour play time. My wife Loves it!! Good clear sound with good volume. It was easy to pair the iPhone to the speaker. My only suggestion is buy a longer recharge cable. Great it has rechargeable batteries. Seldom have I given my wife a gift she loves as much as this low cost great little speaker.
 I've linked it to my Echo Dot in the kitchen.  Mostly play Pandora radio.  I have a large kitchen area and it fills the space with music.  Sound is good, not great, but more than I would expect from such a small speaker.  I had a bit of a struggle pairing it with the Dot.  Don't know if it was the Dot or speaker.  It eventually paired and has worked flawlessly since.  I have the speaker plugged into power and in its first week of operation it's never dropped connection.  One thing to note:  When paired, the speaker takes over the microphone function of the Dot.  It took a little bit to realize this when giving the Dot commands and wondering why the Dot's response wasn't quite as good.  Alexa commands through the speaker's mic are not quite as good as the Dot's and you must remember to speak loudly or direct your speech in the direction of the speaker.  It's not that big of a deal to un-pair the speaker except the blue link light on the un-paired speaker blinks which it more annoying than it is when steady. Also, it seems you can only refer to the speaker as "Anker SoundCore" in Alexa commands which I have a hard time remembering.  I am wondering if this can be renamed in Alexa?  In all for $35 it's a great value.
 My review is after only one week using the SoundCore device, so hopefully, long-term usage will remain a positive experience and not require me to revise my 5-star rating. In the meantime, the SoundCore fulfills my particular needs perfectly. I am a frequent Pandora user, and though I have a great sound system in home and in my car, there are a couple recurrent situations in which I simply want a way to hear the music. For instance, on my patio. Now I can simply carry the Anker SoundCore out there (it's small and lightweight) along with my iPhone and instantly have music from Pandora via the Bluetooth connection. No muss, no fuss. Also, I have a rather huge music collection which I still maintain on my beloved iPod 80GB Classic. If I carry that iPod to the patio also, and feel like listening to any of my life-long collection of tunes, I simply connect the Classic (which is non-Bluetooth capable) to the SoundCore line input via a short 3-foot cable I purchased separately. I may even take the device along on some travels. I've read/heard that Anker customer service is very good, so I feel confident that, as time goes by, if I have any problems I'll find a receptive and helpful ear. So far, good.
 I purchased this speaker back in December 2018. I have used it on an off since and it’s been amazing. Great sound quality, it’s durable, easy to connect. But last week it stopped connecting to my iPhones Bluetooth. I tried not my friends same thing. So I know it’s not the phone but the Anker speaker. It turns on and then the blue light indicating searching for Bluetooth just stays flashing. And it continuously rejects connecting. I’ve tried resetting it no luck. I’m hoping Anker sees this and try to do right. Because I know I’m not the only one whose had this issue.
 Saw a review in USATODAY and decided to check it out in amazon. Got great reviews there too.<br/>Since my husband wanted a $300 Bluetooth speaker I thought we would give the $35 a try first.<br/>Super easy to use, sounds great!! And technically saved my self over $250. Lol.<br/>Really, don't hesitate to choose this over a fancy brand. It's great!
 Simple to connect to, and holds a charge for a long time, even playing music at high volume! I have had NO distortion, even at full blast. I bought this primarily to use as a speakerphone with my iPhone and it has performed beautifully.<br/><br/>Update:  after the initial pairing with my iPhone, every time I want to reconnect, I have to "forget" the device and add it again. Even if the speaker is in pairing mode. Happens with both my iPhone and my iPad. That's a little frustrating.
 There is nothing about this speaker I don't like.  Lasts a long time, have never had it shut off because off low battery.  Volume is much better than other bluetooth speakers I have had.  Another plus is the fact than even if my devise is connected to another at the time when I turn on the Anker it immediately connects.  My other speakers I had to disconnect via settings in order to use.  I love this thing
 I love this Bluetooth speaker. I use it as a speaker phone in my car. I just put it in the cup holder and speak freely. It's just that simple. I charged it about once every other week. The sound quality is great. And since I don't have a Bluetooth stereo, I play most of my phone's music through this speaker. I rarely turn my car radio on.<br/><br/>I have purchased six of these total. The five were gifts. And one is mine. I've had no complaints. Everyone loves it.
 Great speaker, awesome battery life but it can be a little bit tricky connecting it with my iphone 6, macbook pro and ipad. If I connect to one of my devices it works great, but for some reason if I want to disconnect and re connect to another device it struggles to connect. My iphone wasnt able to reconnect and I had already connected and it was listed on my bluetooth devices but was unable to connect, I usually have to forget the device and then pair it again. Even though the blinking light to pair the device is flashing I am not able to connect to my devices again unless I press to forget and pair it again. Not sure if it is an apple issue or the speaker.<br/>Even with this issue it is a great device.
 The battery life is excellent and the sound quality is ok for the price but the quality of the speaker leaves something to be desired.  At about the six month mark the speaker would get really hot when charging but still worked ok. After about a year the speaker no longer holds a charge.  I was a very light user using the speaker only occasionally and I'm not  usually much of a reviewer but if you want cheap and short lived but decent, go with this speaker.  Mine is heading to the trash.<br/><br/>  ***Edit*** Anker reached out to me and offered to send me a replacement speaker.  They did this without me even having to contact them directly so the customer service gets an A+ from me and I have moved the review from 2 to 4 stars.  I am a fairly big Anker fan having bought several chargers/cables/bluetooth headphones from them and I appreciate the customer service.  I remain dissapointed by the quality of the original speaker.  The replacement speaker does currently work 100%.
 I like how easy to use this is. Once it's paired with bluetooth, once you turn it on it automatically connects to the device you last used with it. The battery life is really pretty good. I sometimes leave it on almost all night to listen to music to get to sleep and I only have to charge it every week or so, sometimes longer depending. It disconnects if it's inactive for a while so I don't waste the battery which is super convenient since I forget to turn it off a lot. The only bothersome thing is that the light for when it's one is kind of bright. if I have the speaker facing me when I'm trying to sleep the light is pretty distracting. Sound quality is decent for the small package, a lot better than my phone and laptop speakers. Overall, was a really good deal and I get a lot of use out of it with my phone and computer.
 3/26 Update almost a year later still 3 to 4 hr 24/7 day on a single charge<br/>Well worth the money<br/>The best thing about this speaker is it long life on a single charge. The book says 24hr life but when I first received this i let charge over night before I used it.  Now I get 3 to 4 days of continued use.  This is my second one I own. I use both of them 24/7 they are never off.<br/>What is the bad point in this brand of blue tooth is nothing.  Can't go wrong here
 For educational purposes, I needed a Bluetooth speaker to use with my Kindle. I wanted a speaker that is small and has a clean sound.<br/>There are many choices. Many other speakers are about the hype and a "coolness" factor.<br/><br/>The Anker Soundcore is about being a truly fine, small speaker. It produces a very clean, undistorted sound. The bass response is quite good. The controls are straight forward, simple. Battery life is amazing. It is obvious that first consideration in designing and building this speaker was" let's make a really good product with value".<br/> I listened to other speakers, some with "names". In most cases, they were much more expensive, mediocre performers.<br/><br/>I can reasonably say that this Anker speaker outperforms speakers that cost 3-4 times as much.<br/><br/>Buy this speaker!<br/><br/>Update, April 2018<br/><br/>I have used this speaker heavily. It is a fine small speaker. Recently, I tried to use this speaker and it would not turn on.<br/>I emailed Anker as I still had 2 months left of the 18 month warranty. Long story short,  Anker processed my warranty claim very quickly and pleasantly. Within a week, I was sent a replacement speaker.<br/><br/>The product is very good. The service behind the product is even better. I would buy another Anker product,  based on my experience and highly recommend Anker products .
 I've had this speaker for a few weeks now and it's been great!  For my purposes, it works well.  I mostly listen to my Audible books on it, but have also listened to music on it. It sounds bigger than it is.  It's small enough to take in a car (my son's car doesn't have Bluetooth and I drive it to work sometimes) and it fits perfectly next to the gear shift.  For a Bluetooth speaker, I highly recommend this.  It's got robust sound for a small speaker.<br/><br/>Update: Over 2 years later, still love this speaker. Still works and sounds great. It was my first Anker product, but not my last. This is a quality product made by a brand I took a chance on that has earned my trust.
 I'm always a bit leary when someone recommends a product/brand I'm not familiar with (aren't we all?). I was originally looking for a little speaker to use in my car until I could get my stereo replaced. Someone recommended the Oontz Angle so, being skeptical, I researched them through both written &amp; video sources. It sounded like a nice little option... UNTIL I heard it side-by-side with the ANKER SOUNDCORE. What an incredible difference in their sounds. The ANKER gives you all the highs, mids &amp; lows... so much so that it can actually be used as a room speaker, let alone in the cupholder/console of a car. That's right, it's like the Mighty Mouse of portable bleutooth speakers! 'Here it comes to save the day...' I just got this but had it on &amp; connected to my phone in about 10 seconds. I set it in my living room on about half volume with my phone volume @ 3/4 &amp; could hear it clearly through our dining room &amp; into the kitchen. You can't go wrong with this speaker, ESPECIALLY at this price. It's like we stole it!
 This is the 2nd Anker speaker I've purchased. The 1st one is the Soundcore Sport XL, which has more bass and is rated for outdoors, and I like it so much I decided to buy another for my office. The XL is more expensive, so I opted for the cheaper version, and I am completely satisfied. Study exterior and good output.  I luv loud rock and roll and the small speaker puts out a lot of sound and low distortion. Definitely a good buy.
 I haven't used it too terribly much yet, so can't speak that well to battery life, but the sound quality seems quite good.  (I don't have very picky ears, though.)  I was a little bummed that the range wasn't what I hoped, but it may be more due to the strength of the bluetooth transmitter I chose (Anker 2-in-1).  It really doesn't like walls -- only a problem when I want to play something off my computer.  Set up was easy -- I barely looked at the instructions, and I'm not especially tech saavy.  My only complaint about the design is that the buttons on top are hard to see and/or feel, so I have to pick it up and angle it correctly in the light to see where to push to simply change the volume.  Can't wait to use it in the car this weekend!
 This little speaker is absolutely amazing.  I've only had it for a few days, so I can't really speak to how well it will hold up over time, but I have absolutely zero complaints so far. The battery life is unheard of, no other speaker lasts this long.  This speaker is very loud, and sounds crystal clear.  The only way you will get a louder sound is with a much bigger speaker.  This one packs a punch, and is an extremely good value for the price.  Great bass, I never expected so much boom from such a little box.  Only complain I have at all is that it only includes a usb charging cable, and no actual wall adapter, but this isn't a huge deal, since we already have wall adapters from other tech in our house, and it can also be plugged into our computers.  I would recommend this to anyone.
 This little speaker packs a punch.  It has a nice exterior with a soft rubbery feel to the buttons on top.  There is a blue light right in the middle top over the K of Anker that helps you figure out if it's on or not. I use it connected to my Amazon Dot in the kitchen. I really can't turn it all the way up because it's almost too loud for the kitchen. The sound is full and rich with a good balance of highs and lows.  It has a plugin point on the side for a cable if you need that hardline connection too.<br/>Even though I turn it off at night, in the past few weeks that I have had it, I have only charged it a couple of times.  It's really lasts a long time on a single charge.
 I've tried a bunch of portable speaker solutions.  This one manages small size, decent sound, and good battery life. Yay!  But most of all, the bluetooth just works.  Most systems seem to require frequent fussing, with repairing and power cycling and searching and other time wasting to get them to start working after you've been away, but this one picks up whatever I'm listening to on my iPhone 6S as soon as I turn it on, without wasting a bunch of my time.
 I love the long lasting battery i hardly ever have to charge this speaker, the sound is ok not the best but for the price its good. The quality of the speaker is nice seems durable but haven't really tested it yet. One complaint i have is that theres no way to attach it to anything like a back pack for hiking or a belt loop for walks so it has to go in a pocket and that muffles the sound all in all a great speaker worth the price but could be better
 The battery does not hold its charge very well. In addition, every time I turn the speaker on, I need to forget the device and resynch the Bluetooth to be able to use it. It is royal pain in the back.  I purchased two different colors and both behave the same, which tell me that it is a design issue. Anker used to be a trusted brand. I expected more from this brand.
 Got this on a daily deal, and I’m fairly impressed with it. Good overall sound if you stay in the middle volume area. One gripe I have is that this speaker doesn’t get as loud as I would have thought l, my guess this is so that it doesn’t compromise the sound quality. Everything else is great. Holds a charge for a long time and Bluetooth connectivity is strong and doesn’t go in and out.
 I must say for the price of this speaker I was so impressed with the sound. I have had Bose speakers For the past 10 years and I just didn’t feel like spending another $150 for a simple speaker. The quality of sound is equal to the Bose speakers that I have had. The only downfall is the battery life is not really as good as I’d hoped But it is still acceptable. The  sound and quality for this price  is five star
 This is an excellent speaker for the price. In my opinion, it has plenty of Bass, and sounds wonderful! ( for voice and music ) It's easy to use, and lasts a long time on the battery. It pairs easily to your computer or phone or whatever device your using. I'm very satisfied with this speaker. The packaging is very nice, and the build quality is very good. For 35.99 you can't go wrong.
 ::EDIT UPDATE:<br/>After 16 months of use, several audible novels, and hours of music, I FINALLY had to plug in this speaker to charge. I’m in utter astonishment of how long it played straight from the box.<br/>I did order a second speaker for my husbands man cave, which we took with us on a 30 hr RT drive to vacation and back. It worked well in the rental that didn’t have Bluetooth capability. Even able to make hands free phone calls with it. I absolutely recommend this to anyone in the market!<br/><br/>END EDIT::<br/><br/>Wasn't really sure what to expect for the price. But we use it for everything! Nice clear, crisp sound and surprisingly booming bass. We're really happy with this purchase and have considered getting a second one as a back up.
 After listening to my son's Beats Pill, I decided I wanted a good portable device for my music as well.<br/>But I didn't want to pay the ridiculous prices that Beats charges!<br/>Then after doing some research, I found this gem!<br/>This thing sounds fantastic! It doesn't seem quite as loud, and not quite as bassy, but it is slightly smaller and that is to be expected. But the sound quality makes up for what it lacks! Great product! I would recommend this to everyone!
 Pros: Good sound quality. Well made. Small and sturdy enough to carry around.<br/>Cons: Switches -power, volume, bluetooth- are very hard to see. They are located on top but it's basically black-on-black embossing. You have to pull it closer to your eyes to see them. I suspect designers (most likely millenials) focused only on aesthetics, with no regard to function for customers that may wear eye/reading glasses. Hope companies realise boomer group is the one that has most buying power and wear reading glasses. Please see it for yourself in the picture. Can you find the power/volume etc. buttons on Anker? See the difference on Bose?<br/><br/>Update:<br/>After I posted my comment, I was contacted by Anker Customer Service and was offered to try out Anker SoundCore 2, higher version of Anker SoundCore. The button size I complained about is bigger (a plus), power input has a cover (neutral), and the sound quality is a big improvement. If you only plan to use it for audio books and lectures, it may not have much difference between Anker Soun2Core and SoundCore 2 and you may even want to save some dollars, but if you want to listen to music, then SoundCore 2 should be your choice. However, the most delightful thing was Anker Customer Service. They were responsive, attentive and provided superb service.<br/><br/>To be fair, though, with all of my personal pro/con comments, Anker products are in general very solid, good products for the price they offer.
 I read other reviews of the SoundCore speaker and thought it would be a good buy.  I am not disappointed!  The speaker quality and performance are all that has been advertised.  Yes, it may not be capable of the heaviest bass sound but all things considered it is really produces excellent sound for its size and cost.  The volume is outstanding, Mid and high frequency tones are great with (as noted) a little less than outstanding in the bass range. The battery life is second to none and linking to bluetooth devices is seamless.  The only issue I (might) have with the unit is the battery connector (standard micro USB) is a  little difficult to connect on the unit I have.  I works fine but it takes a little extra care to align and insure the direction is correct on the cable.  I suspect the female connector on the Anker unit might be a little too receded into the box assembly.  Again, not a huge deal but my old eyes have a difficult time identifying which orientation for the power plug is correct.  Just takes an extra second to do.<br/>All in all I would recommend this unit to anyone in need of a compact, high quality BT speaker.  For those that need an extremely heavy bass to annoy anyone around you then you may need to spend the necessary $$ to find the right speaker (yes, I'm old enough to be annoyed by the younger drivers with their "monster" bass speakers at stoplights who insist in vibrating the windows on other's cars for blocks with their hip-hop bass speakers).
 Better than I expected especially for the price, but could be better. Most of the time, the built-in speakers from your tablet/phone will be just as good, without the terrible security of bluetooth involved.<br/><br/>The main use for something like this would be outdoors in noise environments with a small group.  I use it around the firepit with the family and friends.  After everyone leaves, queue up the Barry White and cuddle with my honey ...
 I bought this about 6 months ago and have not charged it once. I only use it about 2-4 hours per week, but I'm convinced that it's being powered by either nuclear fusion, or unicorns. Maybe a combination of the two.<br/><br/>The sound quality is okay, it's not lacking in any area necessarily but it isn't extraordinary. For anyone concerned about bass, maybe I wish there was a little more but I can't complain for the size and price of this speaker. I bought this to be able to enjoy music anywhere I go without wires. You can't expect insane levels of sound quality in something like this. I don't really care, it plays louder than my phone and never dies.<br/><br/>Bluetooth connectivity is easy. It actually has pretty good range too.
 I bought this to listen to podcasts in the kitchen while I made dinner. I wasn't really expecting much other than a giant plastic brick, so when I got it, I was very pleasantly surprised. The speaker is actually pretty small and compact. I could easily see bringing this to a party or on vacation. The build quality feels really solid and has a nice rubbery coating on it.<br/><br/>Setup was very simple. Turned it on and easily paired with my phone and ipad mini via bluetooth.<br/><br/>The sound quality is pretty good, though I haven't really tested it with high quality source audio yet. It definitely serves my purposes for listening to podcasts in the kitchen though. I can turn it up far enough to easily hear it over the sound of the fan vent or sink running. I pair mine with our ipad mini which has pretty quiet speakers, so the anker really really helps out.<br/><br/>Overall, for the price, this thing is really awesome. I'd totally recommend it.
 The sound quality is good. It took a while until I was able to connect it to my Amazon Echo. I mainly bought it to be able to communicate with Alexa from another room. However, the microphone is not working with Amazon Echo and I could not talk to Alexa. I am very disappointed as I read that other Bluetooth speakers have the ability to use the microphone with Alexa. I contacted their customer service about this issue but I've never received a reply!<br/>Update:<br/>The customer service is awesome. They were willing to do anything to make my satisfy.
 Sounds great, but after a period of inactivity, the unit turns itself off completely instead of going into some sort of sleep mode. This means I have to hold down the power button for a sec to turn it back on when I want to use it again, which is a pain. I wouldn't complain about this, but I've had cheapo bluetooth speakers that went to sleep and woke up by itself when activity was resumed, so I'm just disappointed that it's missing what I consider to be a basic feature at a more expensive price point.<br/><br/>***Update: Anker support got in touch with me regarding the issue reported above and provided a partial refund as consolation. Given the adjusted price point and superior customer service, I'm inclined to update my review to 5 stars.
 Stopped connecting to bluetooth devices after about 2 months. Sound quality was ok for the price. Initially thought it was my devices so I took them in to get checked and everything is fine, it just isn't working anymore...
 I bought one 2 years ago loved it. So I got another there pretty durable. I left one out in the rain(don’t do that) but it survived. And the battery life is insane even after years of use it’s still runs 8-10 hrs easy. Sounds great bass is not awesome but for it’s size and price. It’s hard to beat. Bluetooth connection can be picky sometimes it’s ok at 120ft sometimes it cuts out with line of sight.
 The speaker is much smaller than I expected but the sound quality delivers exactly what I hoped. I have it sitting on my desk and it fills my office just fine. Used it last night to play music in the living room and it served the purpose.<br/><br/>The biggest frustration and annoyance is that the speaker and phone volume interaction doesn't seem accurate. It is possible to use both the phone's volume buttons as well as the speaker's to adjust playback. However when adjusting the volume using both options the amount the volume increases or decreases is different depending on what method used.<br/><br/>Also the speaker doesn't seem to read the volume level correctly sent from the phone. If I adjust the volume on my phone to the setting right before being muted the speaker treats this as being muted and nothing plays out of the speaker. I need to turn up the volume from the phone or speaker in order to playback to resume.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if it's a limitation of the speaker or of Bluetooth.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Anker customer service reached out to me and explained that this isn't expected behavior for the speaker. They issued a refund for the product explaining the phone and the speaker volume should be 1:1.
 I bought this as a gift for my 11-year old Granddaughter.  She came over the day it arrived and she set it up with her phone in under 2 minutes.  What great sound quality.  Well worth the money and it makes a great gift.
 We use this speaker in the bathroom for our Echo Dot. It works great, not too bassy(we were trying to stay away from that).<br/><br/>I am blown away by the battery life this little guy has. We leave it on constantly so we do not have to worry about switching it on and off when we are in the bathroom to play music from the Echo Dot, and I would say we have to charge it only once a week. Our old Bluetooth speaker would have to be switched off after use or it would die within 24 hours.
 You know when people say it is an okay product for the price!? Well, this is it. You kinda hope that it sounds better than it looks but it really lacks bass and highs are too high. It sounds good, though. Just be ready not to have any bass pretty much. Overall it is built very nice and I like a rubberized feeling when touching it.  Definitely worth the money!
 I bought this for my niece to replace one of those small mono accordion speakers of hers that broke. She uses it mostly for Skype calls and it's ok for that. I needed to test this before sending it overseas, besides I love audio gear, especially speakers. The sound quality isn't great. I was expecting more based on all the reviews and videos I watched. My JBL On Tour, that I bought over ten years ago, sounds much better. Of course the JBL cost a lot more. This Anker is a great value, and ok for a camping trip or vacation, but I need higher quality sound for my music. You really need to spend more to get good quality sound.
 I was looking for a new Bluetooth speaker to replace another one that I had and made no mistake going with anker. I have always been impressed with the quality of anker's product and this was no exception. It sounds great is loud and has a good battery life. For the price I would buy it again
 Excellent little speakers with great volume and the bass is on point for their size. After going through countless Bluetooth speakers to have out on the patio by the pool we have found our perfect fit. The price is exceptional, the size is convenient, and the quality is amazing. The best feature is how easy it is to switch between devices. Simply press the BT button once and boom, automatic pairing.  I will definitely continue being a customer if they keep up the quality like this!!
 Very good sound for being small &amp; portable. Bass is strong, and it's much less tinny than other similar speakers. The rubbery outside is reasonably robust (though it holds onto fingerprints and a bit of dust) and has stood up to quite a bit of outdoor use, even in drizzle. When you switch it on and connect to bluetooth it plays a friendly little beep, not the loud &amp; obnoxious voice that some other speakers have ("DEVICE IS READY TO CONNECT!"-- Aaah! Ok! I get it, be quiet dude!). Perhaps most impressively, I've used this little speaker every day for four months, often for several hours, and never recharged it once. The battery is only down to 90%.<br/>My only worry is that the charging port is a micro USB, which is really a flimsy Achilles heel. I've had smartphones, e-readers, and other speakers, all of which worked fine until the micro USB connection stopped charging. So I live in fear of the day this speaker needs a charge. Other than that, it's great and I like it very much.
 Liked it but the sound for me was lacking. I realize this is a small speaker. But I have heard other Anker speakers and like their sounds.<br/>Anker reached out to me and we were able to find another Anker BT Speaker to my liking.<br/>I returned this for a full refund. Anker Customer Service was awsome.
 I expected too much from this little speaker. I own a TDK A33 speaker which I have gotten accustomed to for being the standard in quality I want to hear. I know it's not the best but still pretty darn good. The only reason why I bought this Anker was because the TDK's battery sucks. The TDK doesn't hold a charge anymore and it only lasted for an hour and a half brand new. The Anker sounds decent at best. The big drawback is that it lacks bass and that is a big deal because the music doesn't sound complete without it. Overall it's good for watching YouTube or Netflix on the phone but not for listening to music.
 Got the Anker SoundCore on one of Amazon's daily deals back in December. The quality felt in the weight and build was high grade, as was the ease of pairing it to just about anything in the house (phone, laptop, iPad, Echo Dot, etc). I have, however, had issues with the Bluetooth connectivity after music has been playing for about a minute. It starts to pop and crackle, causing huge, loud gaps in the sound, making the sound unbearable. After looking online I found that having the Bluetooth activated on other devices it's not connected to can cause interference, but turning the other devices off hasn't changed anything. I've since connected an aux cord to put a "fix" on it, but that wasn't the intended purpose of the purchase.<br/><br/>***EDIT*** Anker contacted me within two days of my review and offered to send me their SoundCore 2, which is an upgraded version of this one, for FREE. Of course I said yes! This thing is a hoss and the charge lasts quite some time (we use it for Alexa and Spotify and will run it 24/7 for about 4 days with no charger attached/power constantly on). The customer service has been top notch and they're on top of making sure that their customers are happy. Thanks, Anker!
 Sound:<br/>Quality of sound from this speaker is very good. It does not have a super deep or loud bass, but for its size it is good. The speaker also does not get super loud; you must be near it if outside to hear well and it is not loud enough for a party. When using this speaker inside for music or a movie it performs very well. This is not a speaker you can throw a large party with or play very loud music, but for using it around the house or for small gatherings it works amazingly.<br/><br/>Connectivity:<br/>When in the same room or a nearby room you will have no problem connecting to the speaker. I have not tested how far I can be away from the speaker to play music, but I have never had an issue with connection. The Bluetooth connection is very easy once you get it figured out and have done it multiple times. You sometimes have to forget the device and then rediscover it to connect to it but this is not big deal. The battery has never died on me and I have played it on full blast for 6-8 hours at a time (it says 24 hour battery).<br/><br/>Value:<br/>This is the only Bluetooth speaker I have ever had but it is one of the best speakers you can get for the value. My friends have speakers that are $100+ with very similar sound quality but do get a little louder. My speaker and their speakers also have similar lengths of battery and similar connectivity as well as range.<br/><br/>Design:<br/>The Anker SoundCore is a very sleek and attractive looking speaker. Buttons on top are easy to push and control. It also has lights on it that show when it is on or it is charging which is handy. I have not had any issues with the speaker moving around or falling off of things when playing music due to the vibrations; which is amazing for how light and small it is.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>The Anker SoundCore is a very good speaker but not great. It has everything you want in a small, portable speaker for a great price. The speaker looks sleek and is very easy to use. If you want a very loud and deep bass speaker this may not be the one for you; but if you are like me and just want a high quality, dependable speaker for a great price that sounds very good this speaker will be the right fit for you as well.
 This product is amazing!! The quality is there and everything, here are somethings i like about it especially<br/>Pros:<br/>-the quality of the sound is AMAZING, unbelievable<br/>-the loudness of the sound is about x5 louder than a iPhone 7+, (my phone)<br/>-Feels very strongly build and very sturdy<br/>-It’s only $25!!!(at the time of my purchase)<br/>Cons:<br/>This doesnt really count because i don’t mind it but i’d be nice if it were fixed but i always like to see the producer to get closer and closer to perfect<br/>-My speaker,(might be technical) will pause when i press the pause/play button but when i press again it will not play, again this doesn’t bother me much as it takes no effort to press on my phone(it would still be nice if a customer service rep could get back to me on this)
 I bought this speaker over two years ago, and still pairs with my iPhone 7 and Windows 10 PC like a charm. I use it for an hour or two at a time at around 1/2 volume, maybe a few times a week. Haven’t charged it in 3 months, and the battery indicator on my phone shows a battery level of between 50-75%.<br/><br/>Battery life: top of the line<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I’m not an audiophile, but for the price, I have zero complaints about the sound quality. Even disregarding price, I consider it to be of high quality.
 This was going to be a temp replacement for my Bose Soundlink Mini, which needs a new battery. Great sounding speaker if you are looking for something that is clear and crisp, but if you are looking for bass this is not for you. There has zero bass, so skip if you listen to EDM or Hip Hop. For 30.00 I was willing to roll the dice.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I have bumped this up to 5 stars for two reasons.<br/><br/>1. Anker's customer service is outstanding. The company reached out to me after seeing my previous review, and apologized that I was not satisfied with the speaker and offered me the Anker Premium Stereo Speaker (A3243) as a replacement. Needless to say, it is impressive that a company would reach out to a consumer to ensure they are satisfied.<br/><br/>2. I received the A3243 and I have to say that it is a awesome well rounded speaker. Up to this point I had never heard of Anker. The whole reason I bought the previous speaker was to hold me over until I got the battery situation for my Bose Soundlink worked out. Turns out my battery showed up so I was able to do a side by side. The Soundlink still has a deeper bass, but the A3243 has a better overall sound for any type of music. For the price, I think any music lover would be satisfied. Not really a complaint but I would of rather tried the A7909 because of the portability and battery life. I mainly move my speakers all around the house, backyard or the beach. With the A3243 and the piano finish I will most likely leave it in one place in the house.
 It's hard not to like this thing.  First, it's way smaller than I thought it was going to be.  That doesn't keep the sound from being huge.  This thing cranks out the jams non-stop at full volume for hours and hours and hours.  I took it to the park with several other families, and we listened to spotify while playing at a large area.  We could all hear the music just fine.  The sound is loud and clear even at full blast - no distortion whatsoever.  This retailed for $80, I got it on one of the infrequent sub $30 days.  For that price, it's even better than five stars.  Great little speaker.  The only thing that would make this even better value is NFC, but I'm not griping for what it can do.  Buy it.
 I've had this speaker for about 5 weeks. I fully charged it on day one and today it finally needed a charge.<br/>That's 35 days of operation without a charge. Nice!<br/><br/>It has a deep rich sound. If you want big stereo sound to fill an auditorium then I'm afraid you're going to have to spend a lot more money to get it.  I use it mostly to listen to talk radio so  I'm easy but it still has a very good range of Hi's and Low's to enjoy music and at a reasonable price.<br/><br/>As to the range.  I haven't measured off 66 feet but it was still connected when I walked it out to my garden about 50 feet away. I suspect it has a range of 66 feet as long as you don't put obstacles in it's path such as cinder block walls etc.<br/><br/>What would a review be without a negative. There are 5 control buttons on top of the device. The unit and the buttons are all black so it's easy to hit the off button when you're trying to increase the volume. I just put a little white paint on the two volume buttons and problem solved.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Love it,  5 stars.
 Summary - physical size is smaller than expected, but the sound is better than hoped.<br/>Purchased to use on a patio that's 25'x15' and it's perfect. Small and unassuming but is able to fill the space with sound. It's not going to compete with a receiver/speaker combo but it's &lt; $30. The bluetooth paining is simple, so you can switch inputs on the fly. So far so good - very happy with the purchase.
 Good sound, easy to control the volume from my phone and easy to pair.  The sound is balanced but could use a bit more bass.  The battery lasts about three hours at full volume after charging.  I've had this since October 2016 and haven't noticed any loss in battery length.  I use it either charging or just on battery alone and it's fine.  I can't have my Samsung S8+ 16 feet or further from the speaker or it will lose connection (it's the same distance with my wife's iPhone 6).  I will say that I can go from one room in the house to another and it will un pair and pair again through walls when I'm in range.  This is a problem when getting phone calls and you forgot to turn the speaker off and it answers the phone while you're in a different room.  That's an easy fix in the phone settings to turn off phone calls to the paired device.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint about this Anker SoundCore is that if I have it in the sun and it gets hot no matter how much charge it has it starts shutting off and not keeping a connection.  I have to put a towel over it or keep it in the shade to stop it from over heating and acting up.
 okay so this speaker is godlike the battery last way longer than advertised i go weeks without charging it and i watch tv all day long the sound is awesome i do seam to have one issue with it after bluetoothing it to my pc its hard-coded itself into my pc ive tried to delete it from my pc and it will not go away very strange but works fine with everything else i think it may be a windows 10 issue NOT with anker just thought i would let you all know that
 This is a two part review.<br/>First part is about the performance and sound of the speaker.<br/>Second part is about my experience with Anker when the charging port on the speaker broke.<br/><br/>First part :<br/>Sound is very good in enclosed areas (inside)  and sits perfectly at the crossroads of affordability,<br/>performance and size.<br/><br/>Second part<br/>I used it on the job for three months with nary an issue.<br/>Eventually though the charging port became very loose and had trouble holding in the cord.<br/>I was making do like you do when that happens when out of nowhere (three months after purchase that is) that Anker sent me an email asking about how I liked their product.<br/>I informed them about the issue,  they asked for a serial number because they had received other complaints about this very issue and wanted to narrow down the production for the defective units.<br/><br/>That being done,  they replaced my speaker at no cost and without having the burden of returning the other one.<br/><br/>Class A customer service.<br/><br/>Recommended.
 This speaker is great because the price point is low but the sound quality is solid for what you're paying. I did a lot of research on what to buy and decided to go with this.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>35.99 is what I paid and feel this was very reasonable<br/>Sound quality is solid<br/>The speaker gets fairly loud for my needs<br/>Fairly easy to pair/connect<br/>Looks and feels sleek plus I feel like it will last a while (have had a few months now)<br/>I RARELY have to charge it because the battery life is awesome<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>I've heard that my voice sounds unbearable when using this speaker to answer my calls. I was really hoping to be able to take calls with this but avoid doing so. Instead I strictly use it for music.<br/><br/>Overall I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this to others.
 I may have just gotten a lemon. It started out fine but now I can not get a smooth blu tooth connection. Sometimes it connects, sometimes it doesn’t. So, I just use the aux cord and carry the phone with me while doing yard work. Not the same but it works.
 Hands down I would buy again!  This Anker Soundcore Bluetooth speaker sounds great and can use for small house parties, having a group of friends hanging out, and/or just yourself!  It does have a recommended volume limit and will beep when it may be too loud but the bass is amazing on this!  It does last for a while too which is another great feature!
 So I pretty skeptical seeing the other reviews about a speaker of excellent quality for such an affordable price and decided to give it a go after my last speaker went missing. I must say that the reviews are true. This thing is powerful, big sound and lots of power. I've had it playing music 6 hours straight off of one charge and it hasnt died out yet. So far it's been a week and everything seems great. I can pair it with my phone, my pc, my laptop and other electronics and it's the same quality throughout. A little blue light on the speaker flashes if its searching for a bluetooth connection and stays solid once connected. It has a power, play/pause, and volume up and down on the speaker. If you're looking for the best bang for your buck for an affordable price. This is it. It includes the speaker and a USB charging cable.
 I had concerns before I ordered this speaker. Those concerns are no more. In this price range, I don't think that you can beat this system. Sure, the bass could be better, but for it's size I think it is very good. It's heavy with plenty of volume and overall has great sound. I use it with an Amazon Echo Dot in my home office to listen to music and it works very well. While I got it on a lightning deal for just under $30, for $40 it's still a good deal.
 Received this is a birthday present and very happy. I had Anker's Classic Bluetooth Speaker and much prefer this one. Sound much fuller and dynamic. I don't like a lot of clutter on my desk so this is just about perfect for me. Small enough to tuck out of the way but without much of a drop off sound quality wise compared to larger speaker systems.<br/><br/>Had some trouble getting everything working correctly with Window's 10 but the issue isn't with Anker as I've had it with other speakers as well.
 Good price, good sound, does exactly what I need. Plays loud without distortion. I have not tested it with heavy bass though. I leave my plugged in because I use it for my Amazon Echo Dot, only complain would be the plug for the charger cords seems like it is really loose, but stays plugged in so not really a problem.
 Possibly the best speaker I have ever purchased -- and that's a lot. I own a full-house Sonos setup and I can't say it's much better than my Anker speaker. The sonos is louder and has better sound quality but the whole setup was around $1,000 or so and I picked up the anker for a fraction of thst cost. It takes longer for me to open up Spotfity than it does to connect to my anker speaker. I couldn't be happier with my speaker. It's been through so much wear and tear and it hasn't stopped working once. A waterproof version of this would be incredible.
 I want to like this product because when it works it’s good! The first one I got was a dud. Didn’t work at all, the company was awesome with customer service and sent me a replacement (but now I’m stuck with a broken one too, wish they would take a old one back). When the new one came it was great but it will not hold a charge at all! I’ll turn it off and leave it charging over night, unplug it the next morning and it flashes telling me it’s dead. So right now it only works if it’s plugged in..making it not a portable speaker... 😩
 This speaker sounds great for what you're paying for. I'm just using this in a small office. The sound is crisp and I don't have to blast the volume. I wish the controls matched the Anker headphones I have which allow me to skip ahead a song by holding down the + (volume) / go back a song by holding down - (volume). That's partially why I bought this but there's no way to go back a song on this speaker :(
 I really enjoy the anker speaker. The range is great, decent sound quality, and battery life is wonderful. I have encountered no interference and no issues with usage. I have linked to cells such as an LG, IPhone, and Samsung without use. Plus it has been linked to old and new Ipads. It is mostly linked to my Amazon Alexa so the speaker function is a great plus.<br/>I am a Bose user from my headphones to my home speaker set up. I bought this to go out with but find myself using at home for the quick connections.
 This is a compact/little ANKER Bluetooth speaker  with good sound quality.  I am not an expert on sound quality but it meets our listening needs as we move about the house.  Looking forward to warmer weather when I can take it outside when doing yardwork. We use it to listen to podcasts, sermons (on SA app - Sermonaudio.com) and other apps on our iPhones.
 I love this Bluetooth speaker .. nice and compact and just what I expected.  I am not an audiophile so, for me, the sound is very adequate. I love taking it outside with me when I do my yard work.  My only criticism is that the only way to carry it around is to literally grasp it in my hand.  I don't like that.  It would be nice of it came with an inexpensive case that had a carry strap that would also serve as a way to hang it on something rather than laying it on the ground or stool when I was outside.  However,  it's a good value for the money and seems to work quite well.
 The first product that I received was defective. Bluetooth connectivity cut out at just 12" away from source and it took forever to pair (10, 20, 30 attempts to pair). That was before I received a follow-up email from Anker customer service. I complained. Upon understanding what was wrong with the first speaker the customer service rep (very kind indeed) simply shipped us a new one. The replacement speaker was a whole new world. It functions as advertised. We have yet to find a room in our house that is beyond its Bluetooth range and it pairs with the source as soon as we turn on the speaker. The first speaker was a disaster but Anker followed up on the sale and made things right. I have no connection to Anker or Amazon and have not been paid for this review.
 Something happened to speaker and I could not it get it to pair up with any device. It was still within time to return  so I sent it back and then at a later time purchased a different Brand of speaker
 She just got it yesterday and likes it so much I have ordered two more to give to grandchildren.<br/><br/>BUY IT!  And no, I did not get it free.<br/>OK, I bought another one.  Four in 2 months.  This one for my desktop and it works great.  No problem with windows 10.  If you have Windows 10 and cannot pair up, the problem is most like your computer and not the speaker.
 UPDATE: the company reached out to me about my review and were happy to offer me a replacement free of charge. They were very efficient in their follow ups with me and I have since received my new speaker and so far I haven’t had any issues. Thank you to Anker for maintaining great customer service!<br/><br/>I bought this speaker last year and I got quite a bit of use out of it. Until one day it suddenly wouldn’t turn on. I tried charging it for a couple hours even though I knew I couldn’t have possibly run the battery down that much. The light never turned off to indicate that it was charged and since then I have tried multiple times with different cables and still can’t get it to turn on. I had seen other reviews similar to this so I guess I shouldn’t be surprised my product turned out the same way. But I am not pleased with the product for the short use I got out of it.
 I LOVED the Anker SoundCore. Great sound, very durable, no cracking in the low or high ends. Unfortunately the charging port is very very sensitive and after approximately 6 months of regular wear has completely broken and I can no longer charge my SoundCore. It is a shame because I loved the quality- but if I am forced to purchase a new speaker every six months I will have to go with a different brand.
 So far I am loving this speaker. It's small, but it has exceptionally good sound, especially considering how inexpensive it is compared to other speakers. The bass is nicely balanced and there's no discernible distortion, even when turned up pretty loud (and it does get LOUD--a lot louder than I would have expected with its compact size). Overall I'm thrilled with my purchase, which is not surprising since Anker typically puts out a high quality product for a reasonable price.
 very happy with this purchase. had very low expectations since i had never had a bluetooth speaker before and thought the sound would be unimpressive. pleasantly surprised by the experience.<br/><br/>it is very attractive on my desk; it is easy to use and connect. holds a charge quite nicely.<br/><br/>would recommend this speaker to anyone interested.<br/><br/>thank you, anker!
 Nice speaker. Battery lasts a long time. It is sturdy. I use the Anker Bluetooth speaker with my Fire tablet, iPhone and HP laptop. No problem connecting with any of these devices. At first there were a few glitches for me but I soon discovered that I need to turn off the bluetooth function on all of my devices and only engage the bluetooth with the device I am using at the time. Sound is very good and it's loud. For the money, a good deal.
 I love this thing.  It has good volume capacity: I used it to run sound for a video conference call.  Everyone in the classroom could hear.  The sound quality is good.  The Bluetooth connectivity is fast.  Best of all, the battery life is one step short of witchcraft.  I've been using it for months, usually just for an hour or so a day, but still: I haven't charged it since I first got it, and it's still going strong.
 Have a house full of Anker products but I must admit that I am disappointed with the Soundcore speaker.  The sound quality is poor, very muddled.  I purchased the speaker to improve on my built in iMac speakers but to be honest I went back to my iMac speakers.<br/><br/>Update July 9, 2018  Contacted by Anker and they promised to resolve issue.  Vendor response deserves a rating correction.<br/><br/>Received a replacement unit and sounds great
 Seriously it's been like a week and it still says full battery. I use it for a few hours everyday.<br/>As far as speaker quality, I took a nap in my basement and I got a message. Later I realized the sound I heard was actually coming from the SoundCore I forgot to disconnect from upstairs. It was about at half volume. I decided to turn it up and heard some music quite crisply (although somewhat muffled through the walls).<br/>Excellent product.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Owned it for like a year now. Listen with it most nights. Only charged it once. Still says full battery.
 We have had this now for over a month, and listen to it every morning when getting ready for work with our "echo" it has clear nice sound and goes pretty loud!  We have yet to charge it other then 1st full charge when received. We got it on "sale" and Paid 26.xx . I would definitely recommend<br/>it at this price for sure.  Like others have mentioned I could do with out the ANKER across the front, but not worth removing a star for it.
 I bought this in hopes of getting better audio separation on streaming such as Netflix and Amazon.  Netflix especially has the background music or other audio sometimes drowning out the actual dialog on all my TVs.  I noticed surround sound separates reproduces better audio as do headphones.  I wanted to try this speaker to see what the results were.  So far the results are very pleasing.  I can keep the volume low enough so that it doesn't bother my wife in the bedroom if I decide to stay in the livingroom and watch TV late.  I can also get great reproduction of sound on the verbal goings on without using closed caption!  The fix was very cheap with this speaker.
 Nice tiny little unit puts out a big sound. I teach QiGong at a senior center and the room is huge. This little unit fills the room with quality sound. I liked it so much I bought one for my daughter. On a side note, I've had a JBL which worked great but failed after about 2 years. I also had the BOSE mini and it was a piece of junk with only about 6-8 hours of use. I've also had a VAVA VOOM which is a nice unit, but was stolen from me. The VAVA VOOM only had about 8 hours capacity. This little unit goes on and on. My only recommendation is to put a battery indicator on the unit so I can tell how much more battery life is left.
 coming from the single speaker mini cube i expected it to be twice as loud, but it really isnt. also the battery life isnt 24 hours or really even close, more like 6-8 hours or so using bluetooth at full volume which is ok. other than this was a decent speaker for the 3 months i had it until it stopped charging. i popped it open what i believe to be the charging controller had burned up because the circuit board was browned around it.
 Real review- I bought this for our backyard/pool area. Shipping was fast and packaging was great. The directions were a little tough as the print was so small but I figured it out as it's pretty easy and straight forward. After charging tje unit my wife and I used it out back, I am surprised of how awesome the sound quality and range is. Its very easy to pair with my S8+ phone and it auto connects. Great product. I recommend this.
 I was stuck between this product and the Anker Premium bluetooth speaker. I'm glad I went with this one! Let's get started with the review.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-LOUD for a indoors and outdoors. (I'll never understand what these other reviewers are saying about it not being loud)<br/>-Almost zero distortion at max volume<br/>-Nice weight to it and has a nonslip texture<br/>-Size is small but packs a punch<br/>-Price... you cannot beat this quality at this price.<br/>-Backed by an 18 month warranty (Anker is awesome. 3rd product I own from them)<br/>-Bass is present, but subtle. (Not a big deal for me)<br/>-Battery life is ridiculously long. Around 18 hours at a full charge.<br/>-Bluetooth pairing is so simple (Never had a problem with having to reconnect over and over like other reviewers mentioned. I have an Iphone6s)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Microphone isn't too good. Then again I was outdoors using it. My friend mentioned a slight echo. (But I didn't purchase this for the built in microphone, from my experience headsets are the way to go if you plan host a call not using your phone mic)<br/>-Bass is subtle<br/><br/>Notes: 5 buttons on the top, power button, reduce/raise volume, bluetooth, and a play button. (Not hard to press like reviewers mention)<br/><br/>Operation: To turn on just simply press and hold the power button... not hard to understand. To pair this device, turn on your bluetooth device you wish to connect to it and press the bluetooth button on the anker speaker. WOW not difficult. I literally opened this up and started playing music in 3 seconds. I have been using this in my living room and it will fill it up, and if you raise the volume to the max, your anker product will make a beep to verify. I personally never use max volume, because I'm not deaf and don't wish to ruin my hearing lol. I have to share this review because I believe in anker products and their customer service. I spent hours researching other bluetooth speakers and looking through reviews, I knew I had to go with Anker again.
 I purposely held off on doing a review until I used this for some time (I received it on the 9th)....and OMG!! Seriously, this little thing is super impressive! I have been using it for my tablet everyday off of the first initial charge..no lie. I charged it once the night I received it, started using it the next day and haven't charged it since until just now! And the quality is just phenomenal...super happy customer here 😁
 Very happy with this speaker. It does not go really loud,  but the sound quality is definitely there. You can adjust volume on phone in addition to the volume on the speaker to maximize sound. There is zero distortion at maximum volume. I use it in kitchen primarily , as I spend lots of time in kitchen. I recommend this speaker and so does my sound engineer friend who is very impressed with the sound on this speaker.<br/>I am no expert, but this seems like an incredible little speaker. Also when doing my research, I came across many comments / reviews that mentioned how great Anker customer service is, which is something that matters allot to me.
 This speaker is loud if you play music in a small room. The bass is not too strong. There are definitely better speakers that you can get that are under 30 dollars. If you like strong bass and super loud music, this is not a good choice; If you are a person who likes to listen to piano or classical music, this might be a good speaker for you.
 This thing really packs quite the punch! It's loud enough to replace my car stereo even with the windows down. I've dropped it many times. It's withstood the 100 degree weather inside my trunk, but most amazing is that I've only charged it twice! The battery seems to NEVER run out. Even now thinking about it. I need to find its charging chord because I have no clue where it is..<br/>Another great feature is how quickly it will always and reliably connect to your devices and phone through Bluetooth. It honestly took my breath away. Just buy it.<br/><br/>CONS<br/>It's not as great at picking up signal as advertised. But I wouldn't say it's anything below average.
 The sound is very clear compared to another brand  I have. Even when I turned on to the highest volume level, it still remains clear sound with very minimal vibration feel.<br/><br/>However, It's a little heavy for me to carry on daily basis. And it doesn't come with any protective pouch to protect from dust and such. In addition, I wish it would either come with a wrist strap or some option that I can hook to my waist for more portable and security reason. Other than that, it's a great speaker.
 I'm really impressed with this little speaker.  The battery life is more than enough to make it through even my longest shift.  And the volume is loud enough to easily be heard over the hoods without having to push it to max.<br/><br/>The sound quality is decent.  It wouldn't likely impress any audiophile, but for a sub-$30 speaker, it's hard to complain.
 I bought mine 2 years ago. It works great i used it on my work truck, and it took a beating. I've dropped it from moving vehicles and the only reason im buying a new one is because i broke the charging port. Puts out decent sound for it's size, i didn't expect that much. The 2nd version puts out more wattage, but I'm a if you want big sound use big speakers kind of guy. so anything that this little guy can't do i will just use my expensive sound system.
 I love this bluetooth speaker! I originally bought the black one for myself, but after letting a few people in my family borrow it, I found myself never having it with me! Ended up buying two more for my family members so I can keep one all to myself. Sound quality is great and you will not be disappointed with it for the price point. These are not going to be any Bose killers or anything, but for the price, these are awesome. Easy pairing and never have had it skip or disconnect on me randomly. Would easily recommend to those looking to dip their feet into smaller bluetooth speakers.
 The sound quality is nice, at a reasonable volume. It is difficult to charge, but the battery lasts a long time, so charging is infrequent. There are 2 of us who use this regularly, and only 1 of us is able to sync to it now after only a few uses. It worked great and connected just fine for a week, then suddenly will not connect to my phone, no matter what I try.
 I have been extremely happy with this speaker, from the long battery life, small footprint and especially the volume and sound quality. Unfortunately, even with utilizing an Anker usb cable, I can no longer use it as the charging port does not work. It's a shame because this speaker has so much potential.<br/><br/>A courteous woman named Lena from Anker reached out to me and apologized for the faulty speaker along with sending me a new one absolutely free, no questions asked. With this type of positive customer service, it's evident why they are a successful company. Because of this Anker will be my first choice in the future. Thank you Anker (Lena).
 A very convenient gadget for parties or a home gym or outdoors... The volume is certainly decent enough that you might even find it too loud at its max setting inside the house. Bass is emphasized so I guess that somewhat limits what kind of music you can listen to, but I don't suppose you want to buy a bluetooth speaker to listen to classics at a summer get-together!<br/><br/>Have only charged it overnight when it first arrived and that has lasted me through the 4-5 hours that I've used it thus far... but a standard micro USB connector means charging anywhere isn't a hassle.<br/><br/>Haven't compared it in use with other products but given the build quality and price, it's tough to find many more negatives with the product. If bass isn't an issue, I would certainly recommend this bluetooth speaker.
 This is a great little speaker with a big sound.  It pairs nicely with my phone and the sound is incredible.  I am very pleased with it.  And I highly recommend it for the music lover.
 I purchased this speaker for when I was in the labor &amp; delivery ward at the hospital. Since most moms know that labor can take a very long time, one needs entertainment. I brought my Surface and connected the speaker via Bluetooth so I could watch Netflix at a decent volume.<br/>Well, the speaker performed just as magnificently as I did. I highly recommend this speaker to anyone who wants something portable with good sound quality.
 Great little speaker.  Pairs up very quickly (Nexus phones, iPads, chromebooks), sound is very good.  I play a lot of classical and pop/rock.  Easily fills family/living area.  Comparable to DH's Sony BT speaker, which cost a lot more and pairs up very poorly.  The material at the top of the speaker, where the power button is, is a bit of a fingerprint magnet, minor inconvenience for me.  I also own the cube version of this (classic portable) from Anker, the Sound Core is a bit louder and (IMHO) sounds a bit better, though both are very good.
 It is very durable, nicely sized. Bluetooth connects well. Give great portable sound, but don't expect it get too loud. I personally use it during exercise. Perfect. Also works well to sound a room. Sound quality is high. Everything is high quality. Really only downside is how loud it actually gets, plenty enough for standard needs. Probably wouldn't be loud enough at a party, more like background at quieter gatherings.<br/><br/>Update- doesn't play music really really low.
 This thing is perfect. I like to use it for playing music while I'm in the garage or out in the yard working. I regularly accidentally leave it on when I'm done with it, and it's never died on me. I just charge it every few weeks kind of randomly.<br/><br/>Tip: when playing music in the center of a room (like on a coffee table in the living room for example) tilt it onto it's back so the speaker is facing upward instead of projecting in one direction.
 Drops Bluetooth connection on iPhone 8 frequently when none of my other devices have this issue. Pretty loud speaker but not much bass definition at all... probably pretty good for the price
 This speaker connects easier than any other bluetooth device I own.  It connects just as easy to my laptop as it does to my Android phone as it does to my wife's I-phone X and her I-phone 8.  the sound quality is LOUD and crystal clear.  it is pretty small, easy to carry, easy to charge and I love the volume and pause controls built into it.  I really like this speaker.
 This speaker is the best small bluetooth speaker i've heard thus far. It has plenty of bass response for a small speaker and sounds great at all volume levels. The 24 hour battery life is a joke though...and by that i mean i havent charged it in 2 weeks and i listen to it close to 8 hours a night (not at full volume of course) and the battery is still going.  At this point i'm convinced this battery will never die!
 This product is great if you just want higher volume than your computer or having a bit of background noise at a party. Its amazing for the price and will be a great gift. When i got the order the amazon box wasnt opened or showed any signs of tampering. The packaging of the product did i only removed the instruction papers  to see the broken cable box and the unwrapped speaker. I dont mind a broken box but the cabled looked like someone used it and it wasnt tied like usually cabled are. The tie was inside the box next to the speaker if you can see. I tried turning it on (usually these products will have some sort of battery left) it didnt have any battery. When i looked for the usbport. It looks like its not lined well and was hard to connect. Then i found out the thing was DAMAGED as you can see in the picture. I dont mind keeping it because when i connected it it turned on but somethibg tells me it will stop working.
 product could not be made to work with Dell laptop.  Probably the fault of Dell, but  still nothing could be done about it.<br/><br/>I have to say, the Customer Assistance representative at Anker was incredibly helpful and nice, also very informative.  We spent at least a half hour trying everything that the rep could think of.  The whole thing is probably the fault of the Dell laptop's software.  I don't know whether to give Anker a 5 for customer assistance or a 1 for complete uselessness of the product, under the circumstances.  So I decided on a 5 because the rep seemed like such a nice guy, and because I know how seriously I read negative reviews and would hate to have someone not buy the product because of the number of stars on a rating.
 Love the product, and after a few months it stopped working, simply would not charge.  Reached out to Anker Direct and I had a replacement within a week, and then a follow up to make sure all was well with the product.  I wish everyone had customer service like these folks do.  Absolutely will be buying their products in the future!  Value, quality, and service!  That says it all right there!
 Another great Anker product first and foremost. Rubber non-slip outer shell, big bass and sound no cracking. Battery lasts for a very long time on a single charge. Small enough to travel with and I actually brought this internationally outside the country for those long whole day drinking parties. Easy blue tooth connectivity on any device and AUX input did help me some occasions when on a non blue tooth speakers. Button funcions are easy to operate and designed to be flat that it won't be rubbing against your busy bag pack. Now I use this on the beach and in the dining room.
 Don't second doubt yourself getting this speaker. Sounds quality is really good, battery life is amazing, and the max volume is perfect, no distortion. Been using it all week and still have not had to charge it. Great speaker and look forward to trying other Anker products. You can tell Anker aims for quality and good prices.
 After leaving the original review I was contacted by the seller.  They offered to send a new speaker and charging cord, as sometimes there are challenges with products.  They arrived as the CS rep said they would and work great!  We are very happy with the sound the speaker produces, as we have a child, who does virtual school.  Thank you ANKER for the great customer service and a good product!
 I wish it had a little more bang to it. Its good but I feel it could be louder. This one and number two are about the same for audio quality, proof on YouTube and so I just bought this one as I am not on the beach at all. I don't feel ot travels as far as described and it has static at times even when right next to the speaker. The devices connecting to it have a stable Bluetooth connection.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>IT HAS SOME STATIC AT TIMES AND CUTS QUITE OFTEN BUT NOTHING SIGNIFICANT AND IS STILL A GREAT SPEAKER. I WILL BE KEEPING. IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE CHEAP SPEAKERS YOU CAN GET AT THE DOLLAR STORE.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>THE BATTERY IS OUTSTANDING...<br/><br/>CMuha
 Good sound. My only complaint is that it’s not as loud as I was hoping. I’d estimate that 75% of the volume control is in the “too quiet” range. For that reason I would 1000% recommended this as an office/cubicle desk speaker as the dexterity in keeping the sound quiet is top notch. I need it to be blaring from another room over so this isn’t for me. The only super negative thing I’d say is that when you do turn the speaker up to full volume, which isn’t that loud, it makes an even louder tone to let you know it can’t go louder.
 5 stars because I'm a total Anker fan boy.  I do have some other bluetooth products so i can compare.  I have the UE boom and Monster Clarity HD speakers and this one beats all in price.  The UE boom performance to price ratio sucks.  The mids are slightly better, but not by much.  The Anker has better lows.  The Monster Clarity HD has battery problems and connectivity problems.  Best to steer clear from them, though, I think they don't make those anymore.  Get em!
 I'm pretty critical on bluetooth speakers, but this one is worth boasting about.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Extreemly well designed, solid and durable<br/>Very clear sound<br/>Stylish look<br/>Impossibly long battery life<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Not super loud<br/>Not the biggest base<br/><br/>My friends have been so impressed by this unit I'm going to have to buy a second one so I'm free to use it for myself. Its really well dsigned. Dropped it, kicked it, fell off a table.. nothing has shown any signs of damage. Once fully charged, it holds its juice for an impossibly long time.<br/><br/>Very impressed
 Wow, I am very impressed with this.  My expectations were not that great for something so small and so inexpensive but this thing rocks!  I am very very picky about speakers and thus generally prefer to purchase in store where I can test out but based on the reviews here I decided to give it a shot and wow!  Incredible sound quality and incredibly loud for something so compact.<br/><br/>Battery life is unbelievable.  Like, literally unbelievable.  I have been using this for days and days and it still shows 70%.  I'm thinking maybe Anker figured out a way to have a tech sneak in to the house and plug it in when I am not around to charge lol.<br/><br/>Buy it, you won't regret it one bit.
 The speaker was smaller than I thought it was going to be, but still put out an impressive sound. I used it to provide music for a wedding in a 120 seat chapel with very good acoustics (played from the balcony on high volume). I think this would work nicely to provide background music in any room under 1,000 sq ft, but you're not going to host a rave with it unless it's in your closet.<br/><br/>Set up, pairing, use, and instructions were all easy to follow. Haven't tested the battery life, but works well plugged in, and you can also use a 3.5mm - 3.5mm duel audio jack cord to output music from a phone or computer to the speaker.
 I only like reviewing products that are very good or bad.  I have to say that I'm really content with this speaker, its pretty sturdy, last really long on a single charge and has amazing range! I use this with mainly my echo dot, with the dot being in my room I can bring along this speaker with me to the backyard for quite a distance before it starts losing connectivity! I like playing a playlist and just chilling outside with this when going for a smoke or even just chilling under the orange tree out back.
 I received a red Anker SoundCore today from Amazon and am blown away by its sound, for its size and price. I am old school, but I know good sound since first getting into audio in the 70's. I bought this speaker primarily for vacations and will be running it from a Sony Walkman MP3 player via a 3.5mm cord. I am low-tech when it comes to phones, but have been using MP3 players for a while. I picked up a Kinivo ZX100 speaker from Amazon a few years ago and have been using that. Decent mono sound, both channels through a single 40mm, 3w speaker, but lacking in bass. It has a stereo line out which I run into the SoundCore and can now hear the kick drum and bass. By using both with a 3.5mm cable, a few feet wide spread is possible between the speakers and a small soundstage is created. For listening, it is great, highs to bass are present, though it will certainly not rattle the windows. For the variety of music I listen to, it certainly works. The SoundCore is compact, light, well-built and sounds great. For portable sound, it certainly fits the bill. Glad I bought it. I don't think you can go wrong w/ Anker products!<br/>Rock On!
 Arrived in smart, protective packaging. I love the compact design but I was doubtful anything so small and modestly priced could please me.....but it does! Read simple directions after charging overnight. Turned on Anker and it immediately connected to my iPad. The sound is big, clear and perfect. This speaker is absolutely void of any other sounds. Transmits the delicate sounds of Classical, R &amp; B, movies......PERFECT IN EVERY WAY.
 Use it everyday and the charge last for two to three weeks. Furthermore, the sound quality is excellent and it can actually get pretty loud for a small portable speaker. Obviously, this is not a home sound system with better sound quality and higher volume. However, for the price point this speaker is excellent. Looked at this one and a few others; very happy I went with Anker. If you are thinking about it, just buy it and know you cannot go wrong.
 I bought this device in December 2017 and had great luck with it, until after about 9 months. I had it connected to my Echo Dot, and one day I clicked the bluetooth button instead of the plus button and it disconnected. Now I can't get it to connect back to the Dot. I've tried numerous times with it plugged in for charge, fully charged without a plug. Nothing. I loved that it was portable and I could listen to my amazon music outdoors with it, but now it's just taking up space. Ultimately, if you aren't looking for a speaker to work for more than 6 months, go for this one. Otherwise, I don't recommend. Also, this particular model, the buttons are very hard to see, so use a Sharpie or something to draw them out so you make the bluetooth vs. plus mistake!
 Bought two of these speakers around December of 2016.  I don't leave many reviews, I do read a ton of them, so I'm trying to do a better job of contributing.<br/>This little speaker is pretty good.  The sound on it is amazing for the size.  It connects via Blutooth very quickly, especially compared to other BT speakers I have had.  The thing really holds a charge too.  I go quite a long time before I have to charge the speaker.  It's never just died on me from being dead, I just plug in it because it's usually been so long that I've charged it, I figure I should plug it in for a bit.
 Updated:  initially I posted a review stating that the speaker broke after 3 months. This is the case; however, after contacting Anker support, they set me up with a replacement.<br/>I give 5 stars for the customer support. I have received a new unit. I will review it again, after a few months. I'm hoping it was just a faulty speaker, and that this one will last.<br/><br/>The sound quality is decent. I use it for my tablet and better sound. It's easy to set up and I like it's small size and portability.
 This is an update to my previous review. Anker customer service contacted me due to my previous review with the bad charging port design. After trying their suggested solution they deemed that the unit I received is defective and they sent a replacement unit that I got it today, this device charging port works properly, USB locks in place when inserted and stays even when moving the device around the table.<br/><br/>The sound is good and is better than the sound that is built in on monitors or laptops.<br/><br/>Kudos to Anker's great customer service.
 This thing maintains a charge for several days - and I play it to death!  Decent volume, with more bass than others such as the Canz I have been using for years. This is not going to compare with a $300 speaker, but for the price it gives affordable "big" sound. Solidly constructed - it is a bit on the heavy side but it provides excellent sound while at work, or on my patio. And I am often asked to turn the volume down.<br/><br/>Sure, this is not a Bose - but it performs flawlessly - no breaking up at higher volumes. It synchs up nicely with bluetooth, and also has the micro stereo jack for devices that are no Bluetooth compatible.
 The sound quality was fine while it lasted. I bought the first one early in January. It only worked a few times and I got a replacement for which I was charged. I only used this one a handful of times and now *it* will not work. All I want is to listen to podcasts while I cook! No idea why this is proving to be so difficult.
 A surprisingly loud bluetooth speaker in a small package. I have an old jawbone bt speaker that's about the same size and this blows it out of the water.<br/><br/>The sound only comes from one side and is super loud, amply filling my apartment kitchen + living room with sound. That being said, it's not exactly made for audiophiles, but thankfully I'm not one. So it works well enough for me. The bass isn't that deep, but for the price, it's perfectly fine for what I need
 Can't believe the sound that comes out of this thing for being 6 Watts it sure sounds great lots of bass it's no Bose 301 but for laying around reading a book or watching the sunset on the porch it gets the job done. It's waterproof so if you knock your adult beverage over on it no big deal (that's happened already). I own multiple Anker products and they're always great and customer service is always great too it's a no-brainer buy it and enjoy it.P.S works great on the phone too
 I really enjoyed the speaker, while it lasted. I ordered it in March and by mid May the charging cable would no longer work with the speaker. I tried multiple other charging cables with the same connection, but none of them would connect with the speaker either. So I am using up the last of my battery now. I have already ordered another speaker by a different company. I hope I will have better luck with it. Cannot recommend this speaker at all!
 When I got this i really loved it. The first thing I did was to charge it over night. The next day I cranked it up and hooked it up to my tablet.  The sound was surperd but was not all I watch tv and do a lot of streaming.from 8 in the morning to about 9 at night. I read that it was good for 24 hr.  When low on juice there is a red light that flashes. After 4 days no red light so I charge it overnight.  I'm my opion you can  or go wrong with setup.
 I still haven't run this speaker until the battery died. The only times I charge this are when it's just sitting around and I think "wow, I haven't charged that in a long time, I guess I'll do it now." Aside from the great battery life, it'll get pretty loud, but nothing crazy. You probably won't be able to play music for more than like 10 people without it getting drowned out by crowd noise. If you're just playing music for yourself, however, it's excellent
 Clear and loud. So far I've been enjoying my portable speaker. Have taken to soccer and on outaings. Even used it for the sound when watching movies instead of the tv speakers.  Sound with this is just more crisp / clean. Easy to connect to. Highly recommended.
 I originally left a negative review here and wanted to come back and revisit it.<br/><br/>I had originally paired my Soundcore to my MacBook Pro and the audio quality was horrible. I don't know exactly why that is but it was enough to want to make me return the speaker.<br/><br/>I then tried it using my iPhone and the sound is very good. Since that is my primary use case I decided to keep it.
 The sound is great on this,  however, I seemed to have gotten the lemon....sound kept pausing constantly for three - four seconds at a time.  Moved wifi, etc but to no avail..Finally dissconnected it and the echo worked fine but then again not when connected<br/><br/>sending it back...a little annoying 'cuz I am travelling and of course can't get a refund to buy something else until this is received.  Think when it's broke...it's broke...unless they are selling refurbished ones...don't know why they need it
 Excellent speaker for the price. Sharp powerful sound. Compact, yet feels very sturdy, has some weight to it. not cheap. Fairly straightforward to use. Has audio input, but bluetooth has worked fine. Charging cable is very short but I had extra old phone charger cables to use that were longer and worked fine. I'd prefer a light indicating that its "on" rather than a "boop boop boop" sound when turning on and off, but that's minor. Power and volume buttons are black on black which make them hard to see, but I mainly use the phone for volume control anyway. Happy with it so far (a few weeks), will probably purchase another of the same.
 If I could give this product 10 stars, I would.  It delivers on all counts.  I attached it to Amazon Echo and it worked two flights up in a bedroom.<br/>The sound is just great.  I also attached it to my Android phone.  Again, great sound although could not seem to get quite as far away for some reason.  But I was able to use it outside the house with no problem.  The volume control is excellent - it can get very loud.  Bluetooth setup<br/>couldn't be easier.  You cannot beat this speaker for the price.  I just love it!!!
 A fine speaker. Sync'd fast. The battery life is very impressive. I use this at work at a low to medium volume and this hasn't needed a charge in a week. However, the phone I'm Bluetooth-ing from needs to be plugged in because the Bluetooth feature drains the phone. I also recommend the LTGEM optional case. It makes it easier to transport it to and from work.
 I just ordered 2 of these.  I had 1 for about 5-6 years and we LOVED it ... but I accidentally dropped it and broke the plug connecter off.  We more than got our money's worth out of the first one, I think we paid $40 at the time.<br/><br/>When I ordered my replacement I ordered 2 - 1 to replace the one I broke, and a 2nd for my office.  Nothing complicated about them.  They sync easily, and hold a charge for a long time.  They take up so little space, and the black cube just blends in wherever you put it.  The sound is great for the size.  Oh, the new ones are about 2/3 the size of the first one, and the function buttons are more user-friendly.  Good things come in small packages.<br/><br/>We absolutely love these and would definitely buy again ... as we already have.
 I have had this speaker for over a year and it’s been great. I use it regularly for a few hours at a time and it lasts for weeks before I need to recharge it. The connection distance is great. I can roam all around my apartment with my phone in my pocket and Bluetooth connected to this speaker and there is minimal-none interruptions. I have also taken it camping and to the beach so I can say it works great outdoors too!
 I've heard a lot of portable Bluetooth speakers and this one is up there with the big name brands. I had another Anker speaker before this that sounded great but I gave it away... I think it was the nano speaker? And that thing would get loud! And you could fit it in your palm.. but I wanted something that was even louder, and this is it! Twice the volume and bass... Sounds clear and not distorted or muffled. You can definitely hear this in another room with the door closed. I seen it had good reviews and now I can see why!<br/>I recommend it....
 For remote TV listening, voices are decently clear. Excellent battery life! Flawless Bluetooth connections.  I'd give it five stars if it didn't suffer from that way-too-bright front facing blue LED - remember, I'm watching TV with it in a dark room - it's annoying at close range in those conditions. (The fix, though, is easy - a tiny piece of black electrical tape with a pin hole in the middle to let just the right amount of indicator light thru.)
 We received our speaker promptly and I had some trouble hooking it up to our Echo Dot. I had received an email that morning asking how we like their new speaker and if everything was going well… I replied that I couldn’t manage to connect the speaker and was looking for some assistance. The response was prompt and helpful! I was easily able to hook up my speaker after some great and specific directions from the service department. Additionally they emailed me to make sure the solution worked and that I was fully pleased with my purchase. I am pleased and I highly recommend the Anker speaker.
 I had bought my wife this speaker a few years ago and it is still working. I was using a smaller different brand whose battery was starting to go(2-3 hour charge). When I saw this on sale I bought it because I knew it was much better than what I was using and it played a whole lot longer on a charge. It is working great.
 I ordered this as a gift for my brother. Unfortunately, by the time I got it to him, roughly 45 or so days after the purchase, it would not turn on. I called Amazon and spoke with someone who attempted to help me get it to turn on. The rep was unable to do so, and, because it was past Amazon’s 30 day warranty, I had to go through Anker. Over a couple days, I worked with an Anker rep named Jenny. She was phenomenal. She was able to send me a new one under Anker’s warranty and I returned the bad one back to them for testing on their end. After the new one arrived, Jenny checked in to make sure it worked, which it did. Kudos to the team at Anker. I will continue to purchase their products!!
 Nice little speaker. Good sound and range. It arrived on time and in good condition. It failed to pair after a few months. I received another on warranty and it also failed to pair after a few months. Customer service promptly replaced both. Follow up 05/17/2018. The second warranty replacement speaker (third speaker I have tried including original purchase) failed after two weeks of use. They are sending me a refund.
 Great Speaker!  I bought one as a gift for a friend and liked it so much that I purchased one for myself.  It has such great sound for a small/portable speaker so I have been able to take it to the beach and to work.  I want to make sure that it doesn't get damaged, so I purchased a carrying case on Amazon as well.  I am completely happy with my purchase and it deserves the 5 stars!
 I LOVE my new bluetooth Anker speaker.  I charged it up the day I got it (Sept. 23, 2016) and have not had to recharge it yet, this is using it approximately 3 hours on weekday evenings, and over 10 hours on the weekends!  I'm wondering if i'll ever have to recharge it again!!!  i am utterly amazed at how long it's held its initial charge.<br/><br/>I LOVE my new Anker SoundCore  Bluetooth speaker.

 I rarely write reviews, but this speaker deserves one. I’ve owned my soundcore for almost two years, and use it a few hours a week on average, often at pretty decent volume.<br/><br/>I’ve charged it three times.<br/><br/>THREE TIMES. In almost two years of consistent use. This still blows my mind. They claim 24 hours of use battery life, and it may even be longer than that.<br/><br/> I use it in the shower, while working out, during cookouts, pickup basketball, and doing chores around the house. The sound is clear, with surprising bass and more than enough volume for use outdoors. The sound beats out speakers that cost 3x-5x as much. While the design isn’t waterproof, essentially the only way for water to get in is through the speaker face or through the charging port on the side, so I don’t worry about using this speaker in very light rain or around water where splashes could happen.
 It really is a great speaker. The battery life is excellent. I charged it once and I used the speaker constantly during a 23-hour drive, and have since used it. The charge is great. I can't comment on the sound quality. Sounds fine to me. I haven't used it for any calls yet and doubt I will but it's a nice feature. I only wish it had controls to skip or repeat a song on the speaker itself. But that's just me. All in all, I love it and am pleased I decided to go with this one instead of cheaper Bluetooth speakers.
 I bought this speaker to put on my vanity and listen to music/podcasts in the shower. Admittedly, this is a slightly expensive product to be used solely for that purpose, but this little guy holds a charge great! After being used 30 minutes at a time every couple of days, it's still halfway charged a month later. The sound quality is great, much better than the speaker on my phone. There are also a ton of features that are in the booklet that I don't use, but I'm sure someone would find useful. All in all, I'm very pleased and I'll definitely be looking into more Anker products in the future.
 A little lighter on bass then other Anker products I tested at Walmart, but at half the price it is well worth the money. I am well pleased and would highly recommend this to all but audiophiles or those expecting subwoofer level bass response. 5 stars on everything except bass respose which is still good for such a small device.
 Wow!  I am seriously impressed.  This is a quality product for about 1/10 the cost of my Bose Soundlink Mini.  The Anker has a rubberized finish with embossed buttons and LEDs hidden in the speaker grill.  The device--and even the package it came in--are very well-designed.  The sound quality is excellent, battery life is great, and the device is small and lightweight.  I bought it to carry in my cooler for picnics and sitting by the pool.
 My wife had a small underpowered Bluetooth speaker for the bathroom while she showers. I bought this for Christmas, as it was a good price and I have become a believer in all things Anker. We have not been disappointed!  It sounds much greater than its size and price suggest. It is actually smaller than the unit it replaced, but sounds better, has better battery performance, and just seems to even connect quicker. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
 It sounded good initially, but it just stopped working after about a month.  But the bigger problem I had was no way it had a range of 60 feet.  It had similar range to $10 bluetooths that I have bought, maybe 30 feet; I think that was my first disappointment with this item, which I was willing to overlook until it stopped working.
 Anker for the win! This little speaker packs a punch! great sound quality with a nice loud volume. I used it at max volume and expected the bass to blow out or distort the sound but it sounded great still! The bluetooth is quick and easy pairing and the battery life is amazing! I use to bring a beatsbox to basketball for music while we play, but this speaker is so much more portable and sounded loud enough to replace the beatsbox. It doesnt have the volume or capability of a beatsbox but it was enough for my purposes!
 I bought this to pair with my iPad and iPhone to play music and audio for videos.  It was easy to pair and produced a volume more than loud enough for my needs.  The battery life is decent.  You do need to remember to turn off the power when you are not using it.  It does not shut itself down if it is not used for a while like some Bluetooth devices.  I thought the sound quality was fairly good but I am not an expert at evaluating sound quality.
 My husband has a wonderboom and it is phenomenal but three times the cost. I purchased this one and it is definitely not as nice as the wonderboom but I feel as though I got my moneys worth, considering.<br/>I haven’t had it long enough to comment on the battery life but all in all if you’re not a sound junkie, this is a nice speaker
 I had wanted to buy a Bluetooth speaker for years but was put off by the price and functionality of some devices. Ive known Anker to make good products and figured what do I have to lose? The sound and bass coming out of this box is great. The battery holds up but be prepared for a lengthy first time charge. Mine had no charge when it showed up. The price, performance and design are all good to me. There may be better for more money but I'm not trying to shell out a bill over a little portable speaker.
 I have no complaints with this.  I'll mainly use it in the bathroom to listen to podcasts or music when I shower.  It doesn't get overwhelmingly loud but you cannot expect that from a small speaker.  It is definitely loud enough to hear over the shower.  I have not had any issues with the moisture build up from the shower at all.  I am not one to comment on sound quality.  I don't have that attuned hearing to tell you what the quality is.  I can hear what they are saying and it does not sound muffled or crackly.  Good enough for me.
 I love this speaker. Anker is such a great brand, I love their speakers and bluetooth headphones and will probably never buy any other brand. This speaker is so small and easy to carry but produces a crisp, clear and loud sound. The battery life is fantastic and their customer service is UNMATCHED. One day (after using my speaker twice a day every day during the week for months) stopped charging. I was at my 18th month (the end of the warranty) and I reached out to the customer service and they immediately shipped me a brand new speaker, no questions asked and did not require me to return the old one but just asked that I recycle it. I was so happy that I didn't have to purchase a new speaker and could not be happier!
 I really have enjoyed owning this small speaker - more than I thought. Specifically purchased to remain outside on the front porch, it has weathered the storms and gotten wet and still works. The battery charge seems really good. It is very easy to connect. I pair my phone and listen to YouTube audios, Audibles and Pandora while sitting on the front porch. It's light weight, but sturdy. Pretty decent sound quality and loudness.
 I picked up a less expensive speaker from a local store and the sound was screechy, so I was a little hesitant to buy another speaker, but thought I'd take a chance for this price range. I'm so glad I did because the sound quality is unbelievable!!
 I ordered this little guy at the start of September. Speedy delivery, had about half battery life when I got it. I HAVE YET TO CHARGE IT. I put about 8 hours a week of playtime on it at medium volume. I still have not charged it yet (writing this Dec 24). When it said 24 hr play time, I had my reservations, but this is crazy. Great little speaker at a good price, although bass-heavy songs get minimally distorted at loud volumes. Overall, I would most definitely reccomend this speaker especially if you like long battery life (did I mention I haven’t charged it yet???).<br/><br/>Update: Writing this May 15, 2018 (purchased September 2017). I have charged it once total when it said low battery, it didn't even die. That charge was at least 3 months ago. I still use it for about 15 hours a week. This battery life is the working of gods. If all appliances had this good battery life, the world wouldn't be in an energy crisis.
 Bought this speaker for my mom, as she uses it when she’s working, or cleaning in the house. She’s not to tech inclined but she was able to set up a connection with her phone and iPad by herself. She leaves it in the kitchen and there’s no echo, but if she puts the volume up I’ll hear it upstairs. Crazy loud little speaker. Battery life could be a bit better as she is charging it after 3 days on average, but she does use it frequently and with loud volume.
 This is the best little speaker I've ever had, and I've had quite a few of them.  I have nothing negative to say about it.  The battery life is awesome.  I used it on the beach two consecutive days from 9 AM to 7 PM without charging it.  It's LOUD and distortion nonexistent.  And it sounds great.  I'm not a sound or speaker expert but I do know that my classic rock and roll sounds great on this speaker.  I highly recommend.
 I was initially very happy withthis little portable speaker. The price was right and the sound was good enough. Unfortunately after about 5 months in, a crackling feedback sound started to occur whiche necessitated n turning the speaker on and off to clear the sound. Now, after about 7 months it will not hold a charge at all. I recommend spending a little more and finding a product that will last.
 I truly do not understand HOW its battery lasts as long as it does. I use this to listen to music at work- so the volume is not turned up a whole lot. I don't have to charge it for weeks! It sounds great- even when it IS at loud volumes. SO worth the money. If you have a normal sensitivity to sound, do not waste your money on a Bose. This Anker bluetooth speaker is the best on the market.
 REVISED REVIEW<br/>After submitting my original review about the anker soundcore 1, a representative contacted me and stated that she believed I had received a defective device and offered to send me the anker soundcore 2 at no cost. It arrived within just a few days and works perfectly! Couldn’t be happier!<br/><br/>Bought this because my son has soundcore 2 and I love it. This speaker is nice and loud but DOES NOT hold a 24 hour charge as advertised. Simply not true. Holds a charge for about an hour if I’m lucky. Bluetooth range is also falsely advertised. It will play within about 15 feet of my phone, but nothing more. Will be returning. Don’t waste your money.
 I got this to use for a music appreciation class I teach. I download the songs we listen to onto my phone through amazon music, then play them through this speaker in class. I couldn't ask for better sound quality. It's easy to connect and I love that I can adjust the volume on the device itself without picking up my phone.
 Not a lot of base but sounds good.  I have this linked to my Echo Dot for a bit more volume and better sound for everyday listening. Loud enough to fill a living room.  Not much bass and not much fidelity listening to music.  My other Echo Dot has a Bose Soundlink II linked to it and definitely a better set up for streaming music.  But, for everyday use, it sounds just fine.  It was easy to link by bluetooth to my phone and the Echo Dot.
 The "volume down" button on the first Anker speaker that I had stopped working after 6 weeks. I called the customer service number on the box, explained the issue and they replaced it quickly. My new speaker has worked flawlessly. It's a great travel speaker. I take it on business trips for music in my hotel room, on vacation to the beach, and I use it in my bathroom while I'm home. Love this speaker.
 So I was looking for a bluetooth small speaker that had enough juice and sound quality for when I traveled around and needed speakers to connect to my phone or bluetooth device.<br/><br/>PROS: Feels more sturdy and heavy. The Sound is strong and it has independent volume and play/pause features. It pairs pretty easily<br/><br/>CONS: Though quite loud, it's not loud enough for a studio environment and not as crystal clear as I would like. They should have considered neodymium technology
 I recently  wrote a negative review for this item so I wanted to update it. I was contacted by anker and they gladly sent me another speaker because they felt my issues was because of a defected model. At heavy bass or high volumes it became for muddled. They were correct. Compared to the new one there's a night and day difference with them.  So if you seem to have this issue contact anker they'll take care of you.  Fantastic customer service.
 Wow. Big bang for your buck. Works well with a Samsung S8, no glitching in the sound. Great sound quality, very solid unit.
 I just connected the speaker for the second time and the sound is atrocious? It has just been sitting on the counter since earlier today when I thought it sounded fine, so I'm not sure what happened.<br/><br/>Edit - tried again later and sounds better? So weird. I guess, at the price, it's what you get.
 I am shocked at the quality of this speaker and the range of the bluetooth. I am in a two story house and I was downstairs grabbing something and it didn't interrupt the music upstairs at all. The quality of the speaker is also very sturdy and doesn't feel cheap like when I got a hold of the beats by dre pill. It is comparable to my $300 boom bluetooth speaker if not just like it. Very loud, I never have to use the full volume. Great purchase, I will be buying another one for outdoor trips!
 This is the best small/portable speaker I’ve ever owned. I got one for my husband as a gift. I liked it so much that I got one for myself. I still like it so much that I got one for my friend and sister in law as Christmas gifts! Great sound and 24 hour battery life after being charged! I use it all the time to play iHeart Radio from my phone.
 1st one would not turn on, it kept chargin but would never power on. Contacted Anker through their website and they replaced it for free and didn't even require the old one sent back.<br/>The new one is great battery lasts a solid 10+ hours and volume is much louder than the normal phone speaker and sounds really good. Definitely woupd recommend.
 I wanted a decent quality/inexpensive speaker for listening at home, and this is perfect. Good, crisp sound quality, basses could be boomier, but overall they aren't bad. Takes up little space. I'd compare it to the Bose SoundLink that costs about $80 more. Its not very far off from that. Linked to my iPhone with little effort. I'd buy this again. I love it!<br/><br/>EDIT: 18 months later and this is still going strong. It holds a charge for well over a month of regular use. Theres no doubt that I'd replace this with an identical model when it finally wears out.
 This speaker is amazing for the price! It holds up well and the sound quality is fantastic. Long battery life too, and it produces a sound loud enough to fill a house. Great for dorms, parties, and even sounds great in the car. Only downside is that once the battery gets low, it’ll surprise you - the battery percentage displayed on your device is not always accurate to the actual battery of the speaker. Have had it since August and use regularly, have only had to charge a handful of times.
 This speaker is tiny but the sound is great.  Easy to clean,  you can bring it out anywhere.  Once is charged you can use it for a long time.  I used it when I do BBQ in the backyard and all of my friends are surprise of the loud sound but also sound ok not those crack loud noise.  The quality is definitely worth the price.
 I bought this speaker about a year ago and recently had an issue where no sound was coming out either through Bluetooth or aux cable. I contacted Anker and after a few quick questions, they immediately sent me a replacement within a couple of days since it was still under the 18 month warranty period. I've always had a great experience with Anker customer service and have always enjoyed their products (I have Anker wall chargers, usb cables, earphones, speakers, etc). I'll definitely be buying more Anker products in the future.
 I use it mainly for aux but through bluetooth is the same. Would be 5 stars all around if it doesn't have a second or two to "wake up" after not playing a sound for 5 seconds. Also occasionally has white noise when charging when on but that is because i don't like turning it off and on as i use it for desktop speakers.
 Best bluetooth speaker out there! I'm a huge Anker product fan, I always see if Anker has an electronic product first before any others! This speaker has great range, it's very clear quality, it's loud and I love it. I bring it to work and home on the weekends to jam to my music while cleaning! The price for the quality? Simply can't beat it.
 Im very pleased with the sojnd qualitu that ck es from these speakers.  I'd put them against any other speaker of the same size any day.  Plus if it breaks or dropped its not hitting my wallet as hard as its competitors.
 I bought this particular model because of its claimed 66 foot range.  I am pleased to report that it worked as advertised. It played perfectly out at my swimming pool after pairing with my PC which is inside my house. The frequency range is just o.k.  Other purchasers have commented on the lack of bass response, and I agree. All in all, I am pleased with this purchase.
 Had minor problems in starting it up. Did not operate right away immediately after powering it up and pairing with the Amazon Echo Dot, but with testing with the different buttons, finally was able to connect it to the Echo Dot. It needed to be fully charged and reset with the bluetooth button. The sound is acceptable for an inexpensive bluetooth speaker. Wish there were more information in the instruction sheets on steps to take in troubleshooting and starting it up. I have to resort to other web pages on troubleshooting it before I made it to operate properly.
 I love it. Great range and wonderful sound plus long battery life. But sadly something went wrong and it stopped charging thus rendering it unusable. But great news for all you out there, I contacted the Anker Help desk and spoke with Jill, who helped me go through a series of troubleshooting steps to check if it would charge again but no luck. But here is the very special part because of the "Super Terrific Anker<br/> 18 Month Warranty Program" Jill arranged for a replacement to be shipped out to me. Given I called the Helpline on Thursday evening the replacement arrived at my door Saturday Morning.  I could have not been more delighted. So all you potential buyers out there "The product is great and it is backed by a "Super 18 Month No Hassle Warranty Program"  if something goes wrong. Thanks Jill for all your help.......
 I'm starting to believe the reviews are skewed, this speaker is ok, (hence the 3 stars for "It's Okay"), I compared it to a fairly old bluetooth speaker from a competitor and I don't hear a difference in sound whatsoever, now, the battery lasting that long and the build quality might be enough to justify the price but please, don't think you are buying a high-end device here, it's not that, you wont "experience music in a new way", you wont "hear sounds I never heard before", nothing like that.<br/><br/>Also, its a fingerprint magnet!<br/><br/>Now, its an okay product and hence why I didn't return it.
 Its a great product, the battery life is awesome and the price point made it a great purchase. I Take it everywhere.
 I like that this speaker is compact small in size but big on sound and very clear enough bass too. What I don't like it's not as water proof as I would like but will not have by any water as I wouldn't want to take on a chance. Has been great for me and awesome 🔋 life as well and excellent Bluetooth range.
 Amazing. Wow.  I've tried a number of small BT speakers.  This one is spectacular... the sound is flat out the best of any small BT speaker I've ever heard.  For a speaker of this size, it's unbeatable...  the vocal range, the highs are both really, really good;  and the bass is fine for me  (I am not a bass-head, not even close, so what this puts out for bass is fine for me).  It is amazing the sound they can get out of tiny speakers like this..  just amazing I have to say.<br/>  To recommend this speaker, at this price, is an absolute no-brainer.  You won't be disappointed.
 I bought this a year and a half ago and I love it! The batter life is amazing, I use it frequently and only charge it once every month or so. It's small but gets pretty loud for it's size. It's loud enough to host a party with, but it's great for personal listening. Sound quality's good, and it is really durable. I've dropped it tons of times and frequently bring it to the art studio where it's gotten absolutely covered in clay dust, but I've had no problem with function. It occasionally has trouble syncing to my phone, but my phone (iphone5) is very old so I suspect that is the problem here. Great buy, especially for the low price.
 I knew this was gonna be good. I love Anker products and it felt this was just perfect. It was so much easier using this for music at the wedding than using an expensive sound system. Its way better than my cars stereo system.  It brought the whole wedding and party to life with this little guy. My whole new family was deeply impressed by the sound quality. Be careful though. Like all speakers, if your device is too far away it will distort. But notnas bad as what you would buy at the store.
 This is my first Anker product. I bought this to pair with my new Echo Dot. Pairing it with the Echo was not easy. Now that the speaker finally works the mic does not pick up Alexa commands. I'm going to contact customer service about this otherwise I'm returning. Deeply disappointed.
 Great sounding speaker. I still can't believe it sounds this good for this price. I bought it as a gift for someone. Tested it at home first and was really blown away. I consider myself an audiophile. Die hard Bose and Harmon Kardon user. .<br/>Lows and highs sound great from this little stereo box.<br/>I think I am going to look into Anker's catalogue for some addition speakers for our house/garage.<br/>Speakers really make the music. This little speaker packs a punch and sounds great doing it. Zero distortion at full volume.<br/>5 stars
 I bought this for myself and my SO so we could hear our podcasts and audiobooks while doing loud chores. I can hear everything over dishwashing, cleaning, etc. It gets super loud and is easy to move around from room to room when you need to. We love our Anker portable battery because of the quality and this speaker is no different. I highly recommend this speaker.
 Overall I really like this product. I use this occasionally and maybe not as often as an avid music listener, but I still haven't had to charge this since the initial charging after I bought it. I honestly am not even sure how you know if the battery is low. There are two things I don't love about this product and they are that it is more cumbersome to connect to different devices than I would like it to be, it takes a few steps to go from my phone being connected to my computer being connected, and I think it is lacking in a sound quality I'm not really sure how qualify it, maybe the treble? Don't know exactly. Overall a nice little sound box for the price!
 The Soundcore gets decently loud but there's just something about the sound that I'm not loving.  It seems to lack bass and clarity.  I tested it when I first opened it and I hated it.  It sounded so weak and muffled.  I then decided to get it to full charge and it sounded a lot better after a full charge.  I think it's an OK speaker but I don't think it warrants the 35.99 price I paid for it.  I usually love Anker products but I've noticed that I have been less and less happy with their quality lately.  I recently returned another of their bluetooth speakers - the basic cube one they have.  I really liked that speaker until the on/off switch stopped working properly. I also have their bluetooth earbuds - the Soundbuds Sport - and have been very dissatisfied with the cut outs from those.  I wanted to love this SoundCore but I just can't say it meets my expectations to be a great product like Anker used to produce.
 I ordered this speaker because it has both Aux and blue tooth. Well the Aux input broke while still within the warranty so they sent me a new one. Not long after they send me the new one, it had the same problem but this time they wouldn't fix it. Great speaker but yeah it's only blue tooth don't count on the Aux working for more that 6 months on any of their speakers. Waste of money.
 This is an absolutely amazing little Bluetooth speaker. It's lightweight, textures and materials are wonderful. The sound quality, which is why you're probably reading these reviews, is actually really good. I know a lot of people said there's more to be desired for low-end, but unless you're specifically really looking for that you really won't even notice. The buttons on the top could be easier to use. Overall, I am so thrilled I bought this it's such a great price, and the sound is so loud and good. It's been a great addition to my house.
 For the price, the sound is really good- excellent fullness and clarity for its size. I use this to record and playback rehearsals. It's compact size (along with the travel case sold separately) is perfect for my needs. It's low price means I can use it in schools and not worry so much if someone walks off with it.<br/><br/>JBL's Charge 3 portable speaker has better quality sound for sure, but at three times the price of this little Anker, it's hardly worth it.
 This is probably the best portable Bluetooth Speaker I have ever owned. I was a bit skeptical of the sound quality at first because of its price when I first bought it. Once I started using this speaker I was blown away with its sound quality and battery life. The first thing that attracted me to buy this product was its price (I bought it only for $22) and great reviews, but now I like it because of its portability, sound quality and battery life. We use this speaker 10+ hours a week, I don’t have to charge this speaker for 2-3 weeks. Great product if you are looking for a Bluetooth Speaker that’s not going to break the bank then this Speaker is perfect!
 Just purchased this little guy for my wife who cleans night shift. She needed something she could hear but not destroy your ear drums. this little device is it! it takes a few hours to charge and it has lasted her all week so far at work. She isn't listening to it constantly but so far so good.
 Despite others (semi)negative reviews this speaker is amazing. I buy Anker products for their battery life and they never disappoint. I've played countless rounds of golf (3-4 hours each) as well as relaxed outside all day while listening to this speaker on a single charge. As a result I've found that the 24 hour battery life is a conservative estimate by Anker. I'm hooked on Anker products because of their battery life and anyone who wants to spend $100+ for a more well known name can do so and keep these products as a hidden gem for me!! After seeing what this thing can do I've had 4 friends also purchase the speaker and for the price it just cant be beat. Anker has proven time and time again that they make an exceptional product and due to that they have a life long customer in me!<br/>(I also own 2 of their portable charges both are different sizes since I enjoy traveling and not being limited to a power outlet)
 Wow, it's great. Got this for the bathroom to have music while in the bath/shower. This sits on a bathroom shelf (it's not water proof so keep out of the shower) and is miniature, just 6.5 inches long, but it sounds great and is loud enough to be heard over the water. There were some alternative products that were cheaper but I went for this one due to the size of the battery and reported long playtime. Nothing worse than havinge to charge up a battery all the time and this one has a battery twice the size as the other products I found. While in the rest of the house I use Chrom-cast Audio for streaming, that wasn't practical for the bathroom. This is an easy solution. Liked it so much I just ordered a second one for the other shower.
 For a small compact speaker, it has great sound. Good deep bass. The one drawback is when that one song come up that really needs to cranked all the way up 6 watts might not be enough. That's why I'm considering buying there 20 watt speakers, the hold up there is the battery life.<br/>  I would highly recommend these speakers.Perfect for the office desk.<br/>  I had to come back and add to this review about there false advertising. I recieved this speaker 7-14 and after the first charge I know I played this well over 24 hours. I am writing this on9-21 and I still have not to charge it back up yet, I'm trying to wait until it turns it self off. I will check back in when does. This has been one of my favorite buys. I bump this up to 6 stars, to heck with there 5 star limit.
 I find the battery to be well suited for my use. I've not had to charge it since the first charge two weeks ago. And I'm OK with the sound output. I usually use it for learning or listening to the radio and it has served me well these past two weeks. I would great recommend to anyone who wants a Bluetooth speaker.... Still going strong on that first charge.
 I purchased this product in May of 2017, it stopped working in July of 2017. Anker' customer service was nice and fairly quickly got me a replacement. By September that replacement no longer works again. I'm very disappointed. It was on several lists for best Bluetooth speakers. The sound quality is okay from the speaker. Not great, but I thought for the price it was okay. But neither speaker has lasted much longer than a month. Don't buy!!!
 After reading many positive reviews, my expectations were raised.  After living with this speaker for a few days, those expectations have been exceeded.  The design and build quality are very impressive.  The clarity and volume of the sound is quite shocking given the speaker’s size and price.  Obviously, bass is somewhat limited, but a truly exceptional value — sounding as good or better than portable speakers in the well over $100 price range.  Congratulations Anker on under promising and over delivering!
 Purchased this in August 2017. I use it around the house sparingly and have taken it to work maybe 3 times since my purchase. Last week it stopped working. At first I thought it needed a charge. It will not even take that. The red light does not come on when I try to charge it. Lets see how easy it is to get this replaced since It is still within the 1 year warranty.<br/>Just got a hold of Anker. Customer service was very helpful. They will be sending a replacement speaker that I should receive in 3-5 business days.
 Purchased this speaker as a travel unit. I've had it for a while now and use it regularly. Pairs easily. Like delay on off switch so it will not accidentally turn on in a carry-on bag etc. Sound quality is good however not as good as other more expensive options. Things to improve: buttons on top of unit are almost impossible to read (fixing this would be a big improvement); changing shape so it could accommodate a bigger speaker would solve the sound quality issues, a long shape is not as optimal as a more square design for placing a larger speaker, the volume of the unit (basic size)could stay the same and still hold a bigger speaker.
 The charging port broke during warranty.  It is an acknowledged Anker design issue.  Anker refunded my money and were very helpful.  I can not recommend the product until the design issue is corrected. I can recommend Anker the company.  Awesome to work with ... courteous and prompt.
 Plays great in my kitchen but I am quite disappointed with the overall product. It's smaller than I thought it would be, about the size of my beats pill. It's definitely not appropriate for outdoor use. I purchased the product because I saw a picture of it being used outdoors, specifically on the beach. I feel these photos were misleading. There is no way this speaker is durrable enough to take to the beach and expose to sand and salt water. The ports are all exposed to the elements. No cover to keep liquid and debris out. I will keep it because my beats pill died and I don't feel like spending the cash to replace it but I still need an outdoor, beach friendly device. Oh well.
 Very pleased.  Good sound and it connects easier than my Bose wireless.  Of course the Bose has a much much better sound quality, but the Anker works good for me when I am working outside or watching movies on my laptop.  I've purchased the Doss and Ontz wireless speakers before, and to me the Anker has the best overall sound quality.
 I bought this unit, more out of curiosity than a need for one.<br/>It was easy to set up. and the sound is very good.<br/>my only gripe about this unit is, that the control buttons. are Black and hard to spot.<br/>Admittedly being 80 years old, my eyesight isn't what it once was.<br/>,
 I really like this unit. I generally just use it for playing music at home, and I can leave it in the main room and hear it throughout the next few rooms. The battery life has been excellent, and I haven't had any connectivity problems. I don't usually use it for phone calls, but it has worked just fine for that.<br/><br/>I am no professional audiophile, but I did work in radio for awhile and I do appreciate a good sound. I really like the sound Anker puts out. It has good bass for the size, and puts out a good clear sound that seems to be well balanced. There are times I would prefer just a bit more volume, but for the size and price I am not upset at all. It has enough volume that I can use it at parties. I think it is higher quality than a lot of vehicle speakers I have had. All in all, a good deal.
 This bluetooth speak is everything I was looking for.  It compact enough and provides a great sound for hours of fun times!  Its built well enough to take to the beach or just about anywhere you want to listen to music or just a boost in the audio from your phone or pad.  Battery life is very decent and the whole unit is light enough that its not a bother to bring with you.
 This would be a great speaker if the Bluetooth didn't quit working the day after I received it. My friend bought one too and hers also quit connecting and as I've seen from other reviews this seems to be a recurring issue for this product and that's why it gets 1 star from me. Not worth the money I paid<br/>*edit*<br/>The company contacted me after review and quickly sent me a new speaker with the issue fixed for free without me even returning the old one! Great customer service
 Excellent value.  Excellent quality sound for general broadcast use, i.e. Sirius XM and broadcast radio, and music from any source including my Amazon music list.  Some reviews said bass was weak for listening to music.  I have no complaints at all about the range or quality of the music on the speaker.  I think it produces excellent performance and the price is very reasonable.  Setup is easy and device is well built and easy to use.  I was using a Craig unit in the same price range that had a limited volume range and was hard to hear when I was in the shower.  This is not a problem with the Anker unit.  The top end of the volume range was very strong (actually more than I need) and there is no loss of sound quality at the top end of the range. Easy to carry and very good sound range from base broadcasting unit (such as laptop). Strongly recommend.
 The first speaker I had received had a faulty charger port in it, Anker were happy to quickly replace it with a new one and it works brilliantly. I actually bought a second one as a gift for someone as well. Anker has been doing a great job with its product line AND (most importantly) customer service.<br/>As far as the speakers go, they work wonders, I use mine for a 20x20 room and it works flawlessly, also have tested it outdoors and in the  larger indoor areas of my house and have been completely satisfied. Job well done!
 Great speaker! My stereo went out in my camper van, so I thought I would give this a try instead of buying a new system. I can say that I am very happy with the volume and sound... All styles of music are very clear no cracking with the speaker even at full volume. Works flawlessly with bluetooth or cable. My van is pretty large and I can hear everything at mid volume even on the highway. The cool thing with this is that I can take it with me anywhere instead of a car system that only works in the car. Mind yo it does not reach anywhere near car stereo volume, but it works great for what I need... I would highly recommend this for anyone looking to take their music with them!
 I purchased this product a year ago.  I began having issues charging the speaker.  I contacted Anker customer service to see if I can get a replacement or fix for my problem.  Within 24 hours I was contacted by Anker. Less than a week later I had a replacement speaker in my mailbox. Very happy with product. More importantly, I was happy to receive the great support from Anker when I had a problem. Highly recommend.
 This speaker easily paired w/ my iPhone 6, and works throughout my home. The sound is very high quality &amp; I did not detect any distortion as I carried the speaker around the house into different rooms. The USB charging cable does not include the USB wall outlet plug, so just be prepared for that. The only small drawback is that the push button controls on top are not the easiest to see. But the sound is fantastic!
 I'm seriously impressed with this little guy. I've had this speaker for a few months now and am very happy I bought it. Bluetooth connects quickly and without any hassle. The battery life is stellar (can listen for several hours a day at medium volume over the course of two weeks before recharging) and the volume range is exactly what you'd want from something of its size. And for something roughly the length of your hand, the sound quality ain't half bad. I use it to play music from my phone while I'm working outside and to play music in my office. It's very travel-friendly and suits my needs perfectly. The price is spot-on for the quality/value of the product, so really if I had to be picky, I'd only like the bluetooth range to be longer. That's pretty much it.
 But not my last!  This is a awesome Speaker!  I am getting better than 24 hours Battery life and I love the sound quality. Played daily every weekday for about 8 hours.  Play everything from various types of Music to Podcasts. It's light and small and fits anywhere.  I cannot comment on the Bluetooth, as I have not paired it.  I use a 3.5mm Cable.
 I cannot say enough good things about this speaker.  It packs a lot of punch in a very small package.  Please don't expect the absurd levels of bass as heard on similar products from hip-hop artists, but what you do get is a clear, surprisingly loud speaker which you can hear all parts of your music.  What's impressed me most about this - and I can't overstate this enough - is the insane battery life.  This device delivered 1/23 and I paired it with my iPad out of the box without charging it.  I've been, literally, streaming music to it for the past 40+ hours straight and it is just about to 50% battery life.  And, when I say it's been playing straight, I mean non-stop.  I've muted the speaker in lieu of pausing the music and, now, it's become a challenge. I'm not shutting this thing off until it (finally) dies.  I will edit/repost once that happens to give the final duration.
 Loved it at first. Loved the look and portability and the long usage time.<br/><br/>However, now that we have bit the 2 month mark, the speaker often fails to pair and looses connection after paring.<br/><br/>I thought it was my phone at first but I tried connecting from my laptop and it could not paid either.<br/><br/>This product is only good for short term use. Less than two months
 I bought this speaker to use with my Android Galaxy S8 phone. I use it to listen to Pandora and it sounds great. The charged speaker lasts a<br/>long time. I use it daily when doing my horse chores, then have a cool drink on the patio. The unit sounds great and the charge lasts for several<br/>days, even when I listen for 4 hours a day. Definitely a worth-while purchase.
 This little speaker is incredible. It is portable, has a long lasting battery and was very cheap! For a small speaker, the sound is really good and gets loud enough. Most of my usage has been indoors and it gets the job done. Can't comment on outdoor performance, but indoors I get great sound. I love the option of bluetooth and a 3.5mm jack. I don't use this speaker everyday, but when I do it's usually for at least a couple hours at a time. I rarely have to charge it.<br/><br/>Some comments have been about lack of bass, I guess it depends on the kind of music you're into. I mostly listen to metal and I think it delivers a good amount of bass for its size. If you need a cheap, really portable wireless speaker with good battery life, I highly recommend this!
 The sound is crispy and clear. Although some smoothening and low frequency response improvement would be better. It's good for the price range but little improvement is always nice. The power cord supplied is a bit too short. If far away, bluetooth doesn't automatically  reconnect after interruption, has to be manually connected again. Works good on Ubuntu 16.04 ALSA/pulse combination. Best part is, physical buttons, not capacitive. Easy to turn on, easy to handle and hold.
 I bought this speaker over the summer for the beach and my small deck, as well as around the house. It worked great both indoors and outdoors. For such a little device, it is surprisingly powerful with great battery life.<br/><br/>But what really blew me away was the service. My first speaker's power button malfunctioned after about 6 months of regular use. When I contacted Anker, they quickly honored the warranty with personal service. After a little bit of personalized troubleshooting via email, a replacement was overnighted. I didn't even need to return the defective original. It's always great when a company stands by their products and trusts their customers.
 I’ve had quite a few wireless speakers and each broke down within two month. I owned two wireless Bose speakers which although sounded good they were made like garbage and cost me 100. The speaker from Anker is the best money can buy for what it’s made for. It sounds good and it’s durable. I work in construction so deal with all the weather elements. This speaker is my favorite. I even owned a Milwaukee wireless speaker and that stopped working within two weeks.
 We have owned the Anker Bluetooth Speaker for 4 months.  WHEN it works, the sound is good.  However, there are constant troubles connecting.  We have to constantly turn the bluetooth on the devices (2015 Macbook air and Iphone 6) on/off, as well as turn the Anker bluetooth speaker on/off to get a connection.  Most times it will not connect to the iphone 6 so I just gave up.  It is such a hassle. Over time this has gotten worse.<br/><br/>The Cons: Connection to devices<br/>The Pros:  Price.
 The battery life on this little speaker is outstanding even when used at higher volume levels constantly. I am able to use the speaker for days before I have to even think about recharging  it.<br/>The Range of the speaker is spectacular. I am able to move all around my house and outside without the speaker cutting out a single time.<br/>The sound quality is as good as it can get being on Bluetooth. Bluetooth isn't really known for it's amazing sound quality but this little speaker puts in work for such a low cost.
 The speaker is exactly what i was looking for. POWERFUL, clear, and portable.  Originally i had heard a SONY speaker like this.<br/><br/>This  speaker is as good as/better than the Sony. '<br/><br/>The Price point  is right on the $$$<br/><br/>Portable Bluetooth Speaker with Powerful Stereo Sound, Rich Bass, Virtually No Distortion, 24-Hour Playtime, 66 ft Bluetooth Range, Built-In Mic, for Home, Outdoors, and Travel]]
 I drive a truck at work with no radio and this speaker allows me to listen to tunein, podcast, and other apps from my smartphone. The sound and clarity is great. Long lasting and small enough where it can be placed in a spot where no one can see it from the outside of the truck and try to steal it. I really like having this convenience of sound. Nothing worse than driving around in a truck all day without having anything to listen to.
 It ain't a Bose or what ever,  BUT it is a great little sound box and to have quality sound you do not need to have a fancy name. Everyone who hears it is impressed, even a few Apple people agreed it was great and the price made it fantastic. We use it often.<br/>recommended<br/>`
 We bought ours exactly 266 days ago, and we have just pronounced it officially "dead".<br/><br/>The speaker worked great with no issues for about 250 days, and then recently it has been very fuzzy and the sound quality is very poor. It sounds sort of like we're listening through a tunnel now, and there are patches where the speaker makes loud bass noises, kind of like the feedback you hear if you have the volume turned up high on a corded speaker system and you plug it in. We treated it very gently - it was always inside and only went on one vacation trip with us.<br/><br/>All that said, we only paid $30 for the thing, so I can't be too upset. If you decided to get one, just remember it may have a finite life span.
 I purchased this because the speakers at work were dead. Can confirm for like 80% less money this plays better than the Bose Sound Dock. Not to rag on Bose because I know they're really good, but these are just as great. They play as loud and as clear, and I have not noticed any stuttering or disconnecting issues whatsoever.<br/><br/>Anker is a brand you can always trust with your devices and they've proven that. Great stuff guys.
 I’ve been using Anker charging products for years with great satisfaction, so I figured it would be safe to buy this inexpensive speaker. WRONG! The packaging was great as is typical with Anker, but the product simply does not work as advertised. Not sure if I got a lemon or not, but I’d love to hear from other users if they’ve had this experience.<br/>The unit will only play while plugged in<br/>(using Anker charging products too) and distorts at volumes above the middle. So it sounds fine at low volumes but anything medium to loud sounds very scratchy. Very disappointing 😢<br/><br/>Update:<br/>Customer service responded promptly and sent me a replacement speaker within a few days. No complaints with the new one; must’ve gotten a lemon with the first one. Still not the best bass but for $20 it’s a no-brainer. Best dollar for dollar Bluetooth speaker I’ve used.
 We love this thing!  Good sound, easy to use.  It only takes a few seconds to switch off bluetooth connections when we pass this off to each other.<br/><br/>Update --- 15 months after my purchase my speaker wouldn't recharge.  I contacted Anker Customer Service and received a replacement speaker free of charge, including free shipping.  A sign of a great company is one that stands behind their products. Nothing could have been easier. Through email they assured me of speedy replacement. I received it within the week.
 The sound quality, battery life, and build quality are all excellent, however when you turn the volume up to 100% there is a high-pitched, obnoxious beep that goes off. It's still a great device but some of your engineers need to think things through more before incorporating them.
 Love the sound quality. Impressive for a speaker this size. Stays high quality up to high volumes.<br/><br/>Aux jack broke from normal use in just two months. I've tried multiple cords and it still doesn't work. The speaker stayed on my desk, and I never dropped it or anything. Not happy about that!<br/><br/>Now I'm stuck with Bluetooth which is unreliable and doesn't always pair with my laptop. . .
 This is a seriously impressive affordable piece of sound equipment. Mostly I connect it to my phone to listen to music, but I also use the 3.5mm audio input and use it as speakers for my computer. The sound quality is pretty decent. Definitely better than just phone speakers alone. Sure, it isn't Bose, but even as a musucian who is a bit of an audio snob at times, I really like this speaker. It does what I want for a very low cost.
 I have used the speaker for more than 6 months and have had no issues.  The battery life is exceptional; I have not charged the speaker for 2 months and have used it 4 days a week for about an hour each day.  I have not used other bluetooth speakers so I can't compare the sound quality, but compared to a phone or tablet speaker the sound quality is far better.
 Worked like a champ for 14 months but now the Bluetooth will no longer pair. Average cost stands at roughly $2/month which isn't too bad but I had expected a longer life.<br/><br/>4/18/18 Edit: After multiple attempts to correct the problem I contacted Anker and they cheerfully honored the warranty and provided a replacement speaker which is working great. Excellent customer service!
 I received it yesterday. It's been charging for over 12 hours, and it won't turn on, regardless of whether the speaker is plugged into the charging cord or not. I was really excited to receive it but now I'm pretty upset, especially since I've found several instances of other people having this problem.<br/><br/>I contacted Anker and they shipped me a replacement within a few days! Didn’t even require the old one returned. Speedy and great customer service and follow-up, as well! This one works great, no problems!!
 I use this little speaker in my car, and having had several Bluetooth speakers in there before, I must tell you this is the best one! Sure it's no big Bose speaker, but the sound at this size and price is really great. So surprised! I've recommended it to friends and would buy it again easily.
 I bought this Anker back in July, and literally used it every single day since. The sound quality is amazing especially for the price, and I couldn’t be more satisfied! I did, however, have an issue a few weeks ago with it not turning on, I contacted customer service and had immediate responses and within a few days, I had a brand new Anker. The customer service is beyond amazing and I’d highly recommend this product to anyone!
 No issues connecting it to my Samsung tablet or note 9.  For the price it has great sound quality even  if the sound is a little bass heavy for my taste.  Truly a portable speaker. Great for travel since it does not take up much space in a suitcase but it's a little heavy for a backpack.
 This is a definite a buy item. I am a teacher and I needed to have music in background or enough volume when projecting a video clip from my laptop. The speaker works simply either with Bluetooth or a patch cord and in either case I can control the volume from my computer with the speaker. Lately I have used this for video conferences and it has been clear and impressive. Battery life is better than my Bose. Music sound quality is good but obviously cannot match the mark of products which cost so much more. I recommend this speaker for those who want a small solid speaker and like me do not want to panic if stolen or aggressively handled.
 I have a couple of concerns.<br/>Hard to read control buttons.<br/>The rubber type material marks easily especially with the moisture from your hands.<br/>My speaker has a bass/cheap sound especial when watching movies.<br/><br/>Good - It connected right away and stayed connected.<br/>Worked with every Bluetooth device I connected.<br/>I would not buy it again<br/>I expected more as I have a lot of Anker products and they have good sound.
 It’s Anker... they make great stuff. This one just fizzled. I tried all the usual flushing of the Bluetooth cashe etc.<br/><br/>It’s just dead, bereft of life, pushing up Daisy’s in the great speaker landfill in the sky... sigh...
 I recently purchased the SoundCore as I had seen it was one of the line-in/bt bestsellers.  I was satisfied with the build quality, sound quality, and functionality.  Then as I was about to write this review the devil's that be at Amazon decide to put the SoundCore 2 in my recommended.....so I did some research to determine if it would be worth the extra few bucks to get the SC2.  I was set on just keeping the SC1 as I didn't want to have to deal with repackaging it to return but then I figured let's see if anyone has gone from the 1st to the 2nd... Not much that really got me sold turned up aside from the expected reviews saying it's not much louder, and it can be near water...the obvious.  But in any case the splash resistance and slightly more powerful speakers for only a couple more bucks really does make it a no-brainer.  I order the SC2. Received it yesterday and played around with the two to compare throughout the day.  Here's my observations/opinions without stating the obvious two features the SC lacks or whatever is already on the manufacturers/Amazon product description...<br/><br/>*The SC2 is physically ever so slightly larger in all directions due to the extra "armor cladding," think chubby kid eating too much cake.<br/>*The buttons are more pronounced on the SC2.<br/>*The grille mesh on the SC1 is recessed a slight bit more into the speaker opening which I prefer as I feel it offers a bit more protection having the "lip" around it from denting the speaker grille should it land flat on the ground on say a tiny grain of sand. I'd eventually be annoyed seeing the tiny ding and end up having to replace it....<br/>*The SC2 grille sits out more flush(but not completely) with the surrounding so I feel it is more prone to my aforementioned ding.<br/>*The BRIGHT LED on the SC1 is annoyingly placed smack on the front....and boy does it scream at you.<br/>*The LED's on the SC2 are perfect!(think soft mood lighting) and placed on top next to the buttons.<br/>*The sound output of the SC2 at any given level is noticeably louder than the SC1.<br/>*The bass on the SC2 sounds better and "boomier" than the SC1.<br/>*Neither unit distorted at unacceptable levels at max volume playing the following songs I picked from my gym playlist at random: Jump Man by Buckethead, Soon It Will Be Cold Enough by Emancipator, Live Like You Were Dying by Tim McGraw, Like A Virgin by Madonna, and Tootsie Roll by 69 Boyz.<br/>*Don't expect either unit to put out the deep, rumbling, nose tickling, chest caving, hair moving bass you'd come to expect from an actual super legit subwoofer typically found in that annoying neighborhood kids car driving down your street at 2:30am every morning.<br/>*The SC2 bass is noticeably, slightly more punchy.<br/>*Justin Bieber sounds absolutely horrible from both units. For some reason both speakers make his music sound like a little boy crying...<br/>*Thank God Anker decided to tone down the ginormous Anker logo across the front grille of the SC2.<br/><br/>All in all the additional couple bucks is money well spent.  Do yourself a favor and buy the SoundCore 2(not that there's anything wrong with the SC1) as it's the upgraded version for the cost of tomorrow mornings Starbucks.
 I purchased to replace an older Bluetooth speaker that would work inconsistently with my Kindle Fire.  My older speaker had trouble connecting and would sometimes drop the connection while I was connected from my Kindle Fire.  This speaker has been rock solid.  My Kindle Fire connects quickly and operates without dropped connections.<br/><br/>This speaker has good bass and plenty of volume.
 I got this on a lightning deal for a great price, and I am not disappointed at all. This a decent sounding speaker, bass is good but not great, but I am using this mainly outside while working on the garden, and it has good volume for such a small size. It is very well built, solid unit, and it paired with my phone very quickly. The only issue I have is the controls. They are the same color as the speaker. They should have made the buttons white on the black box, it would make them much easier to see, a couple times I was trying to change the volume and hit the next song button instead!
 Got this puppy late June 2016, it is now  almost February 2017, and I still haven't charged it. You'll say I'm a liar. You'll say I don't ever use the thing. To you I'll say: shut up. I've used this devil box at least two times a week, hours at a time since I've gotten it. It may, in fact, run on human suffering, or my soul. Either way I'd buy it again.
 I bought a black one for my wife over a year ago, and she has loved it. She uses it almost daily, and it’s still going strong. I was about to get a more powerful Bluetooth speaker for using in the basement, something I could hear from anywhere in the basement without moving it around. After looking at several more powerful speakers, my wife told me to borrow hers to see if I couldn’t get by with a smaller one. Yeah. This little guy kicks it out. I guess I hadn’t ever heard my wife’s on full volume. When you put your hand in front of the speakers, you can feel the breeze bumping out. Got me a blue one, and it’s just as good. Highly recommended.
 This speaker is not as loud as it claims to be. The sub woofer is cool and all but it still doesn't handle real bass that well, it just skips over it. Very cute to look at, and the Bluetooth range battery life is amazing and it has a built in MIC so you dont have to disconnect to answer your phone!!!! how cool, the mic on it is crap tho but thats neither her nor there.<br/><br/>Bottom Line<br/>IF your use to buying cheap ass speakers from wherever, this will blow your mind, How ever if you ever own a great quality speaker you will end up disappointment.<br/>But for this price and this quality is acceptable.<br/>Worth the money
 This is a nice speaker for the price ($39) when I got it. It's solid and has good sound quality. It connects easily to my iphone. I mainly use it as a speaker for my computer (laptop). The only issue I've found is that when you connect a the micro usb to usb power cable to the computer while the computer is on, the speaker hums.  Slightly annoying, but since the battery life is rated very long, I just charge it to full capacity and wait until the speaker dies before I charge it again. I'd recommend this speaker.
 Sadly, I found this to have less than 1/3 of the receiving distance claimed. I own two bluetooth speakers for different applications, and the cheap one I bought for close to my computer has better range than this, which I need to work close to the alleged distance for a different computer. I bought this for the 66-foot range and 24-hour charge. Now I just use my cheaper one and wish I had just stuck with that one to begin with. Unfortunately, I will have to return it.<br/>This is the one that works better for me:<br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GF5AFB2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1
 sturdy!  use it around the farm and it sure takes a licking and keeps on playing my talk radio and music.
 I purchased my speaker in October and while I was pleased with the sound quality and battery life, I found that it would hiccup periodically. Since it never actually lost the connection, I figured I would live with it. Well, I recently received an email from anker checking to see if I was happy with my purchase,  emphasizing their 18 month warranty. I replied with my issue and they gave some trouble shooting tips as well as instructions for a refund or exchange...shipping included! Their tips solved my problem and I am now a very happy customer.
 The battery life on this thing is crazy.  We use our for out weekly DnD sessions and only charge it every few weeks.  We've actually managed to use it practically non-stop for several days straight without needing to charge it.  Graft volume too.  I ended up buying a second one as a gift
 I was nervous about the small size and how inexpensive this was. But it puts out decent volume! The music is clear and sounds nice. This isn't something that will blast through the whole house, but I can hear it over our whole first floor very clearly. We use it on our back deck and can hear it well outside too. And the size is great! Very portable! It goes in my bike basket and plays times for my family while we ride!
 This is smaller than I thought and it sounds better! Easy to connect and stay connected to Bluetooth. The sound could be a little clearer (maybe in the $80-$100 speakers), but this is so much better than I hoped. Happily surprised. I usually leave it in the main room and walk throughout the house with my phone. It hasn't disconnected yet. Volume is pretty great.
 Very much enjoy this speaker.  The sound is clear, and it stays charged for a long time.  The only negative is that the buttons that you use to fast forward, turn up volume, etc...  are just raised parts of the same black material that the rest of the casing is made from.  It is difficult to tell via touch which button does what in the dark.  I'm giving this product 5 stars, however, because after weeks of using it, I have memorized the button placement, and no longer have to guess.
 These are solid bluetooth speakers with pretty good sound and battery life. Prior bluetooth purchases were cheaper off-brand and this blows those away.
 Very happy with the sound and overall quality. I use this speaker mainly for listening to books so I may not be attuned to the same things music lovers are listening for. It was easy to set up and I like the size and weight of the speaker. I think this speaker works as well as the far more expensive speaker I bought my daughter
 The connectability to  Bluetooth was and continues to be difficult because of mechanical issues. This speaker is not nearly as sound as the one I ordered a few months previous. This one is not water resistant.<br/>The connections to Bluetooth is shaky at best. Don't buy if you want a quality product!
 This is an update to my original review. Anker contacted me after reading my review and replaced my speaker with a new one, which works just fine, without my requesting it. The excellent customer service alone should make Anker your first choice when purchasing speakers. Purchased this on 5/5 and it worked perfectly. I was able to connect my IPhone and IPod using Bluetooth. Sound was good. On 6/11 the Bluetooth stopped working. Now I have to always connect using cable which means the blue light continuously blinks and is very annoying when you are trying to sleep.
 I bought this to use with my phone in a work truck that doesn't have the capability to sync. I use it while driving using Google maps and so far it works great !  Loud enough that I can hear it and not have try &amp; hear or see the phone alone.  Haven't tried it with music.
 Thing crapped out the day after the return window closed. Of course.<br/><br/>*update 2/28/18- Company reached out and sent their newer version of this speaker at no charge. Have had it for a week and so far it doesnt suck. They asked me to update the review. The customer service was great, but doesnt change that the original product crapped out. Concerned the new one will also.. we’ll see.
 My speaker had become very hard to pair. When it works its great. I use it with my  Apple 7 iphone. For some reason the blue tooth was not working. My other Anker products are great. This one I became disappointed with. Had less than 6 months.<br/><br/>Up date. I finally found set of directions on line for this speaker. The problem was actually with me. I needed to delete the bluetooth setting on my phone. And repaired it to the speaker and iphone. Working fine again. Nice that you can answer phone from the speaker and change tunes.
 Take in consideration that I am not a high tech individual.  I am a 55 y/o college professor who used to be very active in music performance (academically, and rock band).  I LOVE my music and spend a lot of time listening to music throughout the day.  I wanted  something portable, yet a product that would provide quality sound and volume when outdoors.  I decided on this speaker after research and customer reviews.  This speaker is everything that I wanted.  Each time I use it away from home, individuals always ask about it, as they are impressed with the quality of the sound for such a small speaker.<br/><br/>I am also very pleased with the Bluetooth phone quality.  I previously owned a Bluetooth speaker that produced nice quality music; yet the phone conversation was less to be desired.
 I tried 3 different bluetooth speakers.  The build quality on this one is the best.  The sound quality is about the same. The bluetooth range is the worst.  If you even turn your body while your phone is in your pocket it will cut out.  I wish I would have returned it, but it's just not worth the hassle.  For the beach or camping it's fine, but I use it in a workshop and it doesn't perform well.
 This is one of my favorite purchases, especially for the relative price. This little speaker puts out rich sound quality, and maintains that on max volume (for it's size it get quite loud), and the battery life is impressive. I'll play it in the morning while getting ready, and then again in the evening, and I've never been prompted low battery. I'll charge it once a week if that. What a great find, I'm happy to have this little guy in my life ♥️
 Great 5 star sound. Matte finish shows fingerprints which is a bit annoying. Buttons on top require a overly firm push - particularly the power button which you have to push and hold down for a 2-3 seconds for it to turn on or off. Wish the buttons were not so firm. Turns off after 10 minutes of no blue tooth connection - this would be great if it were disposable battery powered but since it is micro-usb rechargeable this feature isn't needed and is a bit annoying particularly with the hard to push power button.
 This speaker works just as advertised, has really good sound from the 2 internal speakers instead of just having one like many other Bluetooth speakers have, it has a nice rubbery feel on all 5 sides except the front that prob helps make it impact resistant. I like the control and port setup with no irritating voice prompts, just lights to indicate on/off, connected and charging status. Haven't used the mic function for a voice call yet, or had it long enough to attest to it's durability, but I reviewed it early because I just like it and its sound so much! Glad I chose this particular Anker model, great job on design and build guys!
 It was cranking right out of the box - has a nice solid feel, the "buttons" are hard to make out, but that's minor - but the sound is pretty stunning considering the price point - I samples rock, hip-hop, classical and jazz - clear bass even at full volume - never went muddy on me - ALL THAT BEING said, I've had it for less than 24 hours and haven't taken it out side
 Great little speaker, and easy to setup. I got this for my mom, she is always listening to pandora on her iphone, so I figured this would make for a bit nicer of an experience with little hassle.<br/><br/>The sound quality is about what you would expect from a $30 speaker, its really not that bad. Not for the audiophiles out there. It's really just super convenient and better than the iphone or whatever smartphone speakers are built in.
 It's very well made and I like how it looks in that it just seems to be an undistinguished black cube, however this kind of makes it hard to see its controls which cause me to occasionally push the wrong buttons. The green light doesn't seem to work as per the manufactures instructions. The sound is pretty good at this price range. I like it at low volume best for background mood.
 Stopped working after 7 months of occasional use in the kitchen, won't connect via Bluetooth anymore. Had great sound and battery but useless now. UPDATE: the vendor replaced it for free without my asking. Added 2 stars back for customer service. Glad to have a working speaker again.
 The sound is great for the price.  Anchor customer service was helpful -their phone number is listed on the Anchor website, and Anchor’s url is listed in the “Welcome”pamphlet that comes with the product.<br/><br/>So why the bad review? It’s because of the consistent difficulty I have keeping the speaker paired with my iPhone 6s and New iPad.
 Yeah it could use a clip.  Yeah it could have deeper bass.  Yeah the squareness is ackward to hold BUT...  for the price you shouldn’t complain.  The great battery life makes up for the faults.  I just wanted a cheap unit I can keep in my car that I won’t care if it got stolen.  Overall it met my expectations.  If you want a speaker for a big party, spend $300.  Heck I’ll probably buy a couple more!
 This was my 3rd Bluetooth wireless speaker I've tried.  The other ones just won't not pair with my Samsung Galaxy Tablet.  The Anker Speaker was discovered by my tablet as soon as I turned the speaker on and it paired very quickly.  I am impressed.  My husband is a retired firefighter and has trouble hearing due to the roar of the fires.  Hear was able to hear and understand the words without any trouble.  This is a keeper!
 I can’t say enough about this, I bought it just for something fun to carry around out in garage or at work. I have had it since Feb 10th (now March 27th) and I’ve used it most afternoons at work and even at home for a few hours at a time and I still have 30% battery life left! Highly Recommend!!! I LOVE IT!
 I use the speaker all the time. It has great sound quality and a pretty good battery life. Most of the time I keep it plugged in but it's been unplugged for about 2 or 3 days with me using it and it still hasn't died. It's also a good speaker if you play the mobile app for Minecraft, it just sounds cool idk.
 Had my soundcore for a little over a year, in which it performed well, had decent sound for its price, and I rarely ran into problems with it connecting or during use. I got into the habit of playing rain sounds at night with it every night to drown out city noise, and it lasted a decent while with almost nightly use. A few weeks ago the usb port started connecting poorly, and has since degraded to the point where no amount of adjusting any type of usb cord charges it. I plan to order another one, the price isn't too bad for a year of fairly regular use.<br/><br/>Edit: I've been sent a replacement speaker for the one that stopped charging. I'm very happy with their customer service, the new speaker is working beautifully with no issues
 The unit I purchased did not work correctly so I received a new unit that works perfect.<br/><br/>Excellent support staff and help - I would give it ten stars if I could.<br/><br/>Thank you!!
 For 30$ you're getting sound quality better than the JBL Flip 4. The speaker does a splendid job if producing bass with no distortion noticed and does great with mids. The only downsides to this speaker is the highs can be pretty harsh at times, the ports have no defense against water and it takes quite a while to charge but that's to be expected with a speaker boasting 24hr battery life. I am also surprised as to how well it produces bass, Unlike most Bluetooth speakers this one uses bass ports as apposed to bass radiators. It pumps out more bass than the Sony XB20 and Altec Lansing Life Jacket 3 and can sometimes rival the Flip 4. Would definitely buy again.
 I honestly only had this speaker for a couple of days then had to return it. The sound quality was good but when you got up there on the volume then it started to rattle and crackle. Don't know if it was just mine or others also do that. I have a 3 year old Nakamichi speaker that's been through hell and back and soy de better than that.
 I've used Anker products for years... very highly respected company. I love this speaker! Had the JAM Plus 2 before this, and the Anker is far superior in sound and battery life and connectivity . I've used this at home and on the beach... great for taking your tunes with you. Not to mention I love that it came in Dodger blue! lol
 I researched this purchase before pulling the trigger and must say I made the right choice.  I wanted a small bluetooth speaker with good battery life and room filling - and high quality - sound. I got both. The sound quality rivals my larger and much heavier Bose speaker. The battery lasts a long time; I have not run it for the 12 hours advertised, but that seems likely. And Anker, nice job with the packaging! Barely bigger than the speaker, it is eco-friendly. For the price, you cannot beat it.
 My husband got me this for Christmas because I had been using a cheap speaker set for my desk at work. I love this! I use it all the time. It's an easy setup and the price is great for the quality of sound. It's nice and sturdy, not cheap. But, I'm blown away by the sound!!  The quality is amazing! I also love how far I can go with it still in the Bluetooth range. Even from up and downstairs. Great stuff!!!
 I saw this on sale and purchased this item and hoped that it might replace my Bose Soundlink.  The sound of the Anker Soundcore is good, but side by side, the Bose Soundlink has fuller bass and a richer sound.  However the Soundcore is 1/8 the price.  I think it is a great value for the price!
 Best, best, best speakers ever!!!! He sound, the quality and the design are amazing!!! I liked it so much that I bought some more as a Xmas presents for my daughter’s teachers and they love it too!!!<br/>The battery last forever, I forgot when I charged it last.
 Bought this for my wife to use to listen to music while cleaning out a house. Was just what she needed. For such a small single speaker, it really works well and sounds surprisingly good. I often take it out in the yard when doing yard work or cleaning bicycles. A solid choice, especially for the price.
 It’s great, the battery can last up to about a week before you charge it for only five minutes. It is pretty loud. If you were outside, people can hear it from across the street. The only thing I don’t understand is that it beeps when you type or put the volume all the way up. That’s annoying...
 Great sound quality and plenty loud for the car when I run the cell phone thru it for audiobooks or calls. Only downside is the mic is not very good. The mic has to be next to one's mouth for the listener to hear it. It cannot be used like mics in one's car where the mic is 2 feet away.
 I had to get used to getting this to pair and turn on. There were no instructions but I finally found the hard to see touch pads on the top. I had to HOLD DOWN the on button. Not like my Canz speaker that you pair once and then just turn it on. The sound is okay though
 I received this product on time, it plays well but the battery drains very fast, If I charge it completely once and play it for couple of hours in a day, next day it’s all dead, have to charge it again , basically the charging doesn’t lasts.
 The sound is pretty dang good for a $30 speaker, and compares favorably with the more expensive bluetooth speaker gadgets out there. I have this mounted (I mounted it on my own, there is no mounting hardware) in an old car without blue tooth capabilities and it handles phone conversations beautifully. No need for FM station tuning as the speaker is loud enough to hear on its own.
 Anker's SoundCore is simple to use, easy and quick to pair and puts out clear, powerful sound.  It's better than I hoped for and better than any bluetooth linked sound system I've ever tried before.  Operation is easy.  The power button, pairing button and volume up and down buttons are large and easy to see.  It can be charged using a standard micro USB cable.  I charged it up when it arrived and have used it for days without need to recharge.  I love it!
 My new favorite things. I like them so much I have purchased three of them.<br/><br/>They work well with my Macbook Pro and MiniMac. I don't have Bluetooth on my windows 7 desktop, and I don't have a dongle, so I don't know how they would work with that computer.<br/><br/>Recently tried to get them to work with my windows 10 desktop-so far no joy, I know Anker has good tech support, so I will be contacting them to find out how to get them to work with Windows 10.
 I very seldom write reviews of any kind, and I've only just received this speaker, but my initial experience was enough to warrant a comment. This is the second Anker product I've purchased, the first being a small portable charger that I keep in my laptop bag (in case my smartphone runs out of juice while I'm in transit). The speaker has the same solid feel and high build quality as the charger, and this morning I was thoroughly impressed with its quality of sound. I bought it so that I could listen to movies that I stream via my laptop, while puttering around my apartment (in this morning's case, while making breakfast in the kitchen; my laptop resides in the bedroom). Some devices have difficulty pairing to my laptop, yet the speaker connected within ten seconds. When the sound of my movie started playing, I was genuinely surprised by both the crystal clear quality, as well as the fact that it provides a very nice bass range, in a way that makes it sound like a much larger speaker. I charged the speaker for the first time overnight last night (online literature indicates that it takes 5 hours), and I suspect it will be weeks before I need to charge it again, based on the hour or two that I'm likely to use it from day to day. The controls on the top of the speaker couldn't be simpler or easier to use, and I like the small satisfying *click* I feel when pressing each button. The soft rubber-feeling casing is very pleasant to the touch, and the unit weighs enough that you know it's not going to fly off the table if you accidentally bump it. It's a terrific little addition to my untethered enjoyment of media, via whatever bluetooth-enabled sound source I might want to hear. I've never owned a bluetooth speaker before, and this is a very satisfying first experience thus far.
 This is the third blue-tooth speaker I've tried from Amazon.  The first two cost a little less (under thirty), but one didn't have much volume and the other had connectivity issues.  This Anker SoundCore speaker has great sound, including decent bass, and doesn't distort at higher volumes (it can get pretty loud!).  And no problems connecting to any devices within range.  Definitely recommend!
 Pretty good little speaker.  It sounds a bit hollow but its not bad.<br/><br/>The rubberized outside ensures you wont drop it.  The simple buttons on the top are raised so you can find the button in the dark.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the little blue light is painfully bright.  We now know that blue light disrupts your sleep pattern.  It should be a soft orange light.  Or no energy sapping light on it......<br/><br/>That's really the only reason I dont rate it five stars.
 Bought this back in December for around $45.  It worked well for about 3 weeks until it stopped charging. The charging port broke after plugging in the cable that came with it only a few times.  Most of my other Anker products have been solid.  Not this one.
 Easy to use. Just turn it on, then go to the Wifi settings on your phone and click on Anker. It has great sound quality and is much louder than my phone. I also put it on the ledge at the top of my sliding shower door and listen to videos and podcasts in the shower since it is waterproof. I love it so much that I bought one for the bathroom and one for the kitchen. My son also has one, so we have 3!
 This amazingly priced bluetooth speaker is a very pleasant surprise. I love ankers packaging and product design. It has a luxurious feel. Light enough to be portable but heavy enough so that you dont feel like youve bought a plastic box instead of a speaker. So sleek and extremely easy to pair and use. These make great gifts i believe. I tested the distance and it really depends on if youre using the speaker in an open space or if the signal is passing through walls. The issue with measuring distance in houses is that each house is different in build. But its safe to say you wont have issues with distance. Sound is great it gives a pleasant deep sound. All in all, great product.
 We've only had this a couple weeks, but so far we're really enjoying it. It was inexpensive, has a good sound, has quite a nice range that it reaches (I can go downstairs with the phone in my pocket while the speaker is upstairs and it doesn't cut out and stop playing), and the battery life seems to be a huge improvement over our old little speaker that gave up (that was $5 more expensive than this one). All in all, we are very happy with this speaker and feel pleased we went with this one.
 This is my first bluetooth portable speaker and I am very satisfied with it. At first I had a problem with the volume. My nephew told me to turn up the volume of my mobile phone and Wow,  plenty of volume! I got this as I don't love ear buds. I also wanted to be able to listen in my car. There aren't really any settings just the power, volume up and down and the bluetooth  but it works very well for my purposes. It showed up right away on my android phone and my ipod. Easy to use. The price was nice too.
 It's been a little over a year since purchase.  It is my go-to.  The sound is medium range, very nice at all volumes but muffled because bass heavy.  I have only dropped it once or twice from table height but it held up just fine.  Now the Bluetooth is starting to crap out as the connection would stutter sometimes.<br/><br/>Update I still find it a wonderful speaker for the price but after this review I received the Soundcore 2.  The S2 one has many meaningful improvements.  First the sound is more balanced.  Volume control is direct instead of independent from the bt devices; also without a jarring tone when reached the maximum setting.  Buttons are more responsive.  Auto shutdown.  Indicator tone is now a more pleasant one, putting led on top for better visibility, and adding a thick protective door to the charging port.  The shell is still the same texture but to increase ruggedness the corners has been rounded out.<br/><br/>Either speaker is a great buy.  Unlike most speakers, these speakers are well designed and user friendly despite not made for the high price range market.
 Since this is the first real review I’m doing I’m not really sure where to start.  I’ve been wanting a Bluetooth speaker for a while now. With a trip to the beach coming up I decided it was time to pull the trigger.  There is nothing better than sitting on the beach with a cold beer and listening to good music.  I am the type of person who likes good sound quality and that is going to be the number one thing I look for before I consider aesthetics or brand.  There is an exception here – budget.<br/><br/>When I first came across the Anker SoundCore on Amazon I was skeptical mostly because of the $35 price point.  The next speaker I consider was the JBL Clip 2.  The JBL did satisfy a requirement I had which was to be waterproof.  However I decided that sacrificing this to save a little cash.  Another deciding factor was the reviews that I read on Amazon.  While one reviewer (krwhome) did a comparison of the JBL Flip 3 speaker to the Anker.  Their initial observation was higher sound quality with the JBL (as I would expect).  However after further testing they edited the review to state that the Bluetooth range on the SoundCore was superior.  This is a bonus for me so I went with the Anker.  Full disclosure – I have not been able to test this claim so I’m taking their word for it. I have been using it for several days without a recharge simply cutting it off when not in used. Very impressed with the battery life so far.<br/><br/>Initial Thoughts:<br/><br/>The packaging is very nice.  Everything has its place and no space is wasted.  There is just enough room for the speaker and charging cable with a small manual  (who needs those things anyway?).  The design of the speaker is very satisfying.  I like how simple and sleek it is.  The logo on the front is a really cool touch to me.  It literally takes up a large portion of the front but still manages to not be overstated or obnoxious.  If anything it really adds something to the look in my opinion.  Some things I did not notice when shopping for the speaker are that it has a 3.5mm aux plug on the side as well as a microphone.  For me this is a nice surprise since I wasn’t expecting it.  I never really thought of using it for making calls or using the Google Assistant but that definitely makes it even more useful!  The buttons on the top are responsive.  I do like that they are the same color so it doesn’t take away from the sleek look but my initial impression was that this may make them harder to distinguish after a few beers.  After handling the speaker it has a very dense sturdy feel.  Overall my initial impression of the Anker SoundCore is very positive.<br/><br/>Testing &amp; Use:<br/><br/>Right out of the box pairing with my Samsung S8 was very quick and simple.  Right when it powered on the blue LED on the front was flashing.  Almost immediately it showed up on the phone and paired right up.  The LED is solid once paired.  First thing I did was fired up Amazon Unlimited Music and listened to the new Imagine Dragons album in an effort to test the range and see how good the lows are.  The highs sound great and overall sound quality is very good.  The lows do leave a little to be desired in my opinion.  Though I wouldn’t really hold it against the speaker due to its size and price point.  The lows are At the time of this review I see a new model (Anker SoundCore 2) has been released and it advertises better base and 66ft Bluetooth range.  The price is only a little higher at $45.99 it would be worth a try but I’m still very happy with the original SoundCore.<br/><br/>The call quality was decent on both calls I made in testing.  I don’t really have a baseline here but compared to the speakerphone on my S8 it is similar.  Callers reported a little better microphone quality from the S8 as I would expect.  However they had no complaints when talking through the SoundCore.  Testing outdoors on the patio by the pool as well as on the beach was very impressive.  The volume is plenty for several people to enjoy and adjusting is easy thanks to the large pronounced buttons on the top.  One thing to keep in mind is the fact that it is not waterproof or water resistant.  So if you’re taking this to the pool or beach as I am keep it safe!<br/><br/>The battery life thus far has been fantastic.  I’ve listened for several hours at a time and not had it go dead on me.  They advertise 24 hour battery life.  I have not put this to the test but have no reason to doubt it is obtainable at a reasonable volume.  I don’t have a lot of negatives for the SoundCore.  If the volume is up to maximum and you press the volume up button it has a very loud beep to let you know you’re as high as you can go.  It is in my opinion an obnoxious beep but I understand it’s purpose and don’t see a point in docking points for that.  The very first time I connected to the SoundCore I was testing the and went a couple rooms over to see how well it would pick up.  Once I got 25 or 30 feet away it began to break up some but bear in mind this was through several walls as well.  The thing that initially concerned me was that it did not reconnect once I came back into range.  Instead the blue LED was back to flashing but when I selected the devices in my S8 Bluetooth menu it never would connect.  Since then I have re-paired with the device and gotten out of range several times and it reconnected just like it should.  I’ve tried several scenarios and been unable to reproduce the problem at all.<br/><br/>To sum it all up I’m sitting here listening to some music with my lady writing this review and I am very happy with my purchase.  If you’re budget-conscious and want a quality Bluetooth speaker you can’t go wrong with the Anker SoundCore.
 I had a problem with my original purchase and Anker swapped it out for a new speaker. It was already my favorite BlueTooth speaker, now Anker is my favorite speaker company.  It lasts for hours when I unplug it and carry it around the house with me, whcih has turned my Echo into a whole-house sound system.
 I am impressed with the sound and amplification for the price of this unit. I have compared it to the similar Bose unit sold at Costco for about 5 times the price. Yes, the Bose has better quality sound and amplification, but not 5 times better. This works great for both sound from itunes on my computer in normal size living areas and for sound from projected video from my computer in training presentations.<br/><br/>The pairing is a little tricky. You must be certain each time you connect the bluetooth to do so before opening itunes.
 I decided to buy this due to the price I just wanted something good and cheap, due to my line of work I needed something durable or cheap enough to replace if it were to break, this thing surpassed my expectation, has rubber coated to protect it from falls and crazy good battery life, has really clear sound and decent bass capability....I had a UE megaboom I wanna say it can almost compete with the smaller versions of those. Definitely recommend this speaker.
 I was impressed by the quality of the speaker. Came in great packaging and looks/ feels very high quality. The music quality is also very decent. The overall volume is not very high, so nothing I would take with me outside (to the basketball court or other outside events). But very practical for music sessions in my room.<br/>It easily connects to devices, the operation is very intuitive.<br/>It is able to play music while charging.<br/>Can definitely recommend.
 Update: the great customer service folks at Anker just sent me a replacement and all is sunny again! Love these speakers and Anker too! Great speakers while they lasted. Currently I have a request in to Anker for repair or replace. Have to go with one star because mine died after less than 3 months of normal, indoor use.
 Great sound and quality, however - there is an incredibly offputting “beep” that chimes in as I near within two marks of maximum volume. I use this speaker while driving at work, so I have to crank it up loud to hear it - and that beep is pretty annoying with no way to shut it off. Additionally, the noise rings out when starting to record a Snapchat, or clicking play on a video or new song. This would have a five star rating if it wasn’t for that feature.
 Great deal in a small speaker. Obviously it doesn't rock out bass but for what it is, it is wonderful!!
 After about 14 months started having bluetooth connectivity problems.  The sound was distorted but would improve after I disconnected then reconnected via bluetooth.  Stopped working after 16 months, would not connect.  Soundcore was visible on the list of devices but would not connect to iPad, Samsung Galaxy or Echo Dot.  I complained and Anker contacted be and sent me a replacement within a week.  Great customer service. They stand by their 18 month warranty.  Other speakers I considered only have a 90 day warranty.
 I have another Anker portable speaker which also has very good sound quality.  This model, however, connects much more easily to Bluetooth (iPhone, iPad) and stays connected without ever intermittently cutting out.  And it’s small, only about 8” x 2”, and portable.  I like it very much and highly recommend it.
 Had a speaker from Home Depot that walked away from me on a job, so I tried this one.  It's solid, sounds great and battery lasts a long time.  I opted to add two small but powerful magnets to the back and it made this unit all the better.  Now I can just put it to a metal brace or case and it's out of the way!
 It lasts many hours with continuous playing. I use it mainly for outside however it’s not too loud if using outside. I don’t like how it beeps everytime you use your phone to take a pic or text, etc. It’s very annoying. Overall it’s good but will be looking for something that’s louder and hopefully doesn’t beep when I use cell phone.
 Besides maybe a little distortion when booming at absolute max volume on the unit, I've had almost no issues when using my Anker SoundCore. I use it as a replacement for the speakers in my car (they get cold, they decide to not work for a while) and it completely fills my car's cabin with sound. As far as one of the other reviews I read (I believe, it could have been a review for one of the other bluetooth speakers), there was one talking about this device not having an auto shutoff feature. Mine does, and shuts off after about 5 minutes of use.<br/><br/>Excellent product! Definitely worth the money, especially if you can catch it on sale!
 Blue tooth is VERY spotty. If you move your phone it will cut in and out. *original review*<br/><br/>*UPDATE* After leaving a semi-poor review I was contacted via email by seller and given a free replacement without needing to return old one. The replacement does not have any bluetooth problems as stated above (guess I just had a bad one). Really impressed by the customer service and the replacement's bluetooth quality/range now. Very satisfied!
 It's really good for the price I'm not disappointed with the sound quality.  I am self-employed in Skin Care. So the thing I realized with Bluetooth is that, when I want to charge clients with square it will interrupt the music with the shipper attachment.  I still need to check it out with a double Bluetooth connection. Otherwise I'll look for a internet connecting speaker.  But I still love getting rid of all the wires of the old speaker and not having to continue disconnecting my phone from the  speaker plug.
 Great bluetooth speaker for the price. I'm not an audiophile but I always check if I'm getting my moneys worth for a product. And this Anker speaker is really good for its price. Pairing it up to my laptop was extremely simple, holding the bluetooth button and detecting it on my laptop, then connecting. It also looks very sleek and durable. It's also very loud.
 I wish there was an app or little remote to control this things volume. I have it linked to my fire stick but can't adjust the volume unless I have the speaker in my hand.
 I work from home and use my cell phone quite a bit and wanted a Bluetooth speaker with a built in microphone so I could use it as a speaker phone as well as listen to music. After deciding on a price point and features, researching and reading tons of reviews, I decided on the Anker SoundCore and I am not disappointed.<br/><br/>When I placed my order, the speaker was out of stock but was expected to be available in a couple of days.  It shipped earlier than expected and was actually delivered on a Sunday, what?? Thanks Amazon! Happy me..this thing is super simple to set up.  I had the box opened, the speaker paired with my iPhone 6 and was streaming music in less than 3 minutes!<br/><br/>The sound quality was better than I expected for the price point. You aren't going to get thumping bass but you will be pleasantly surprised and definitely will not be disappointed. The speaker phone feature works really well and I have found that I use it all the time. It's comes in handy for sure. The Bluetooth in my car was having trouble connecting and I had a phone call so I grabbed the speaker, turned it on, it connected right away and I used it all the way to work,  pretty cool I thought.<br/><br/>Oh and did I mention that Anker has one of the best warranties? 2 years!  And a 24 hour battery life..I haven't tested the battery life yet as I've had it for a week, but I've used it everyday for 2 hours a day and it's still on its first charge, so that's yet to be determined but so far so good.
 I bought these to be the speakers on my Amazon DOT's.  When unplugged the life of the speaker isn't that great and when the start to get low they emit a SUPER ANNOYING BEEP.  It's like the beep on your low battery smoke detectors, loud enough to be annoying, to long between beeps to figure out where it's coming from and to close between beeps to just fall asleep and ignore it.  One of them is already getting distortion like the speaker is blow or something.
 I've had this a couple days, so maybe too early for the best review.  I ordered to replace an Oontz angle that I was happy with, but the battery would no longer recharge after 1.5 year ownership. I purchased the Anker because of the 66 ft range. I place it in my bathroom to listen as I'm in the shower, with my iPhone as the music source. However, if I take the phone just 20 ft away, just leaving the bedroom door, the signal drops.  The Oontz had a little better range.  But no contest for the best sounding, the Anket is much better than the Oontz.  Clearer and much better bass.
 I'm updating my review to 5 stars because of the stellar and immediate customer service response I received after I posted my 1-star review when the product simply stopped working.  They sent me an entirely brand new product free of charge!  Fabulous.  Unmatched customer service!
 Love the speakers.  Good sound, great battery life, and bluetooth range.  I heard no distortion in the sound even when I crank up the volume all the way.  I have charged the unit as soon as I got it, and havent charged it since then (about 10 days).  I play couple of hours a day in the morning.  The range is pretty good.  I can use it anywhere in the house.  Bluetooth connectivity was a breeze.  I haven't tried answering phone calls, or connecting to multiple phones.  I will have to try that also.  But overall for the price, this is a great unit, and I strongly recommend it
 I really like the heft and feel of quality you get with Anker products and this bluetooth speaker is no exception.  I'm not looking for concert hall or loud rock in roll, but do enjoy the solid sound you get from such a small footprint.  I like running off of my cell phone which means I can drag this anywhere in the house.  I compared this to the flip 2 from JBL and think the sound quality is about the same for about half the price.  You can't go wrong with this little beauty.
 Great Speaker!!! I have bought several speakers in the past several months, trying to find one that I liked enough to keep as my Kitchen speaker. (I am a Chef)  This speaker has all the volume I need and plenty of battery life to go with it!!!<br/><br/>Edit: I have now purchased a second speaker to go with the first.  I am now keeping one in my kitchen, and another in my bedroom for listening to music and the news.  They have excellent sound quality, decent volume range, and amazing battery life.  Best bang for the buck that I have found yet.
 This is now my second SoundCore, and I LOVE it. My use case may be weird, I have it to play podcasts in my kitchen and bedroom from my phone, and I find the sound excellent for human speech and even though I use it for 2-3 hours a day I find myself only needing to charge it every couple weeks. Have taking this to backyard parties as well with great effect.
 It's a good little speaker, but I was disappointed with it's depth of sound. I considered returning it for a Bose, but didn't. For the price, it will work well as speaker for camping, beach, etc where I wouldn't want to take an expensive Bose speaker. It works nicely on my desk for work, too. The size is compact and easy for travel. Would love it if they included a little travel case/sleeve. I'll just keep the box to keep it safe in my luggage.
 so far for the price this is a great little speaker. I purchased this to use in my toolbox at work and it works great. the battery life is awesome and the sound for the price isn't bad at all. there are better speakers out there if youre looking for more bass or louder speakers, but this should do the job just fine for the price. ive compared this speaker to my polaroid Bluetooth speaker and this one doesn't distort as bad during high volumes while playing songs with a lot of bass. if youre looking for louder you probably should check out bose.
 This is my second speaker since my husband stole the first one from me for his office at work.  The sound quality is great.  I purchased a different brand to replace my first, but found it was not loud enough so I  gave it to my son and came back to this one.
 Great looking speaker, nice feel and lightweight. Initially had a problem with the speaker I received but Anker has great customer service and they replaced it immediately with a new one and even followed up once I received it to ensure the replacement was working properly. For the price you won't find much better, in fact this could easily be sold for at least twice as much. The battery will last you an entire day and charges pretty quickly. Definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a great affordable bluetooth speaker!
 Bought this speaker because it was affordable. It stopped working after 2 months of use. All it does now is hum and won't connect.<br/>***So Anker customer service got a hold of me about my review and offered suggestions on how to fix the problem. The suggestions did not help. However, Anker immediately offered to send me a new speaker in exchange for the broken speaker free of charge. I can verify the new speaker is working well. I'm giving this product 4 stars for the customer service, but minus 1 star for the product breaking in the first place.***
 It doesn't do what I bought it for: I have been unable to get the Bluetooth to sync with my phone or PC, and it only sort of works with the laptop but not all the time. I've tried everything. But it's a nice, compact speaker and does work well with an AUX cable, so I can still use it. But I now use my echo dot more. My guess is that I just have outdated or incompatible equipment.
 This little speaker has a great sound for such a small speaker!  I ordered it for my husband, and he is very satisfied with the product.  I'd ordered a smaller version for my library and was satisfied with it, so I knew the quality would be great.
 I bought this to replace a nearly identically sized Braven Bluetooth speaker that spent the night in the rain.<br/>Sadly, this model has less volume and less bass.<br/>Not bad, just average at best.<br/>I'll probably give it away and get something better...
 This was a Christmas present to me and the sound from this little box is amazing! Easy to pair up to your phone. Not sure about battery life as I haven't had to recharge yet but it's an Anker so I'm positive it will last and it comes w their outstanding warranty!!
 Buy this, you won't be sorry. A small but powerful blue tooth speaker, worth the price. I love it. I did need to uninstall the Amazon music app on my Samsung smartphone, then re-install it to get it to work right. Once done, it's perfect. Very solidly built with a rubberized coating. Again, I love it. I also recommend you buy the carrying case made for it,  worth their price of $8.99.
 The speaker itself is good for the money. Good sound. Plenty loud but it's not going to blow you away. Battery life is fantastic though.<br/><br/>The first one I received was refurbished from Ultimate Electronics. I charged it overnight and it would not even turn on. Anker sent me a brand new one to replace it. Thanks Anker. Top notch service. I am now a loyal customer.
 I really love this speaker so far. I've had the speaker for a couple of weeks and I've encountered no problems. It's small and lightweight so it's easy to carry around. The design is sleek and the material doesn't feel cheap at all. The buttons are easy to press and the speaker connects to whatever device you want in a couple of seconds and automatically the next time you want to connect. It makes a beeping sound when turned on/off and connected instead of a voice which I like. The sound is great even at max volume. I haven't encountered any distortion in the sound. I charged it only once since I got it probably because I don't use it at full volume all the time, but I'm still impressed. I use it a couple hours at a time too. I recommend it to anyone on a budget that wants a good quality speaker.
 Excellent speaker for its size! I was skeptical at first about its sound capabilities but it really has a big sound like the other reviews have said. Am using it for my early childhood development program and it's so easy to operate, charge, and travel with from location to location. It basically fits into one of the front pockets of my messenger bag. I can also still fit the charger as well as my phone charger in the same pocket. Very pleased!
 Bought this a few months ago to run with a bluetooth transmitter off an older computer. The transmitter didn't work but this speaker did not disappoint. The sound quality and ease of use it amazing. For the price point I will buy again if I ever need to.
 First thing to notice is how heavy and rugged it is.  Not like the Walmart plastic cheapies.  Secondly is how easily it's recognized and pairs with your devices, and thirdly how good the sound is.  Some pretty impressive bass for its size, and it can get loud enough to hurt people's hearing if you crank it that way.  This is the second Anker product I've bought and both have been excellent investments.
 looks great, feels great...sounds ok, but not excellent, somewhat muffled and tinny, but for the size, price, etc., it is a good buy, if you don't want to pay for a better speaker. The volume is fine, has a solid feel, seems to be very well made. I have had other products from Anker and they have always been  good quality. But, in the end, it's going back. The sound quality is just not good enough. I will try the Sony x55, which is about 2x the price. I ordered it based on the reviews.
 I've had this speaker for about two months now and have not had to charge it once. This thing is a tank. It is the bees knees. I highly recommend if you are looking for a cheap and reliable speaker. I tried buying a DOSS Bluetooth speaker before this one and it was absolute trash. It malfunctioned within 2 weeks of owning it. So yea don't waste your time with any other speaker, this one bumps and has an outstanding battery life.
 Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it.  She uses it a lot.  The charge lasts a long time and I think we've only had to charge it once since purchasing.
 After my original misadventure with the Anker I am delighted with this company who reached out to me and sent me a wonderful fully fabulous replacement that works great!
 I bought this speaker as an impulse buy during a sale. Compared to my JBL Flip 2, the sound quality is close but just slightly inferior. The volume could go higher but at least the Anker does not really distort at its highest setting. The build quality is good, with soft touch plastics. The biggest difference between the two is battery life, hands down. The Anker Soundcore smokes the JBL's 4 hour (if you're lucky) play time. So far I haven't had the Anker on long enough to run the battery completely down, it is that good.
 I’ve had this thing for about a month. I use it everyday while getting ready for the day. I also use it when I’m doing projects throughout the house. I still haven’t had to charge this thing!!! The range is decent. I can get about 30 feet away before it cuts out. Sound is good for what I expected. Not a lot of bass but mid and high sounds right where I’d like it. I am 100% satisfied so far.
 Speaker was working great until yesterday now it won't take a charge anymore
 Loved how small it is yet has such a crisp quality sound.
 This Bluetooth speaker is WELL worth the money. Very loud, very clear sound. Impressive output from such a small speaker. Bass sounds very good as well! No weird distortion like I've experienced with some other brand speakers that I've had in the past. Bluetooth pairing with my Android phone and iPad is super easy. I can't say enough about Anker products. I've been purchasing Anker brand products for the past few years, and all of their products have been GREAT!
 I can use this speaker for 28 hours before charging. Great sound. The buttons are not sensitive; you must firmly press and hold to turn on/off. I did not like this at first but it beats grabbing or hitting it and your song suddenly changes or turns off. This is my second one. My first Anker was stolen when I got my oil changed. SO BEWARE!
 Excellent sound, perfect amount of bass, and what turned out to be the most useful feature, incredulous battery life. After a year of consistent usage (~1-2 hours, maybe 3 times a week), I honestly can't remember the last time I had to charge these speakers. I'm only giving this review now because I was hearing beeping while listening to a podcast and I realized I didn't know what low battery sounded like. While other speakers like the Wonderboom provides features I value such as being waterproof, there is nothing that matches the convenience and quality of the Soundcore. After enjoying 4 different, well-reviewed brands over the last several years, I finally know what speakers to buy again if these ever die, which I don't expect to anytime soon, even with the way I tend to go through electronics.
 Excellent sound for the price, suprising amount of bass, great design, and painless pairing process.<br/><br/>One great plus is that the speaker intelligently turns itself off after having no device connected for an extended period of time. My last Bluetooth speaker would just stay powered and scream in the middle of the night to get charged lmao
 I purchased this device to replace a similar product from another vendor at a similar price.  The Anker SoundCore has exceeded my expectations the couple of months I have owned it.  The volume level is adequate for use in moving vehicle w/ the top down and/or windows down.  In a normal environment - the sound volume/quality is very good - especially for the price.  I have used a much much more expensive product and even though the more expensive product out preformed the SoundCore...the value can't be beat.
 Use this in my 10-year-old (read "only has a CD player") van. Also use in home to listen to Spotify/NPR whatever. This is in no way a stereophile's dream. Music is a bit tinny. BUT it is excellent for listening to podcasts/spoken word. The battery lasts almost forever. Super good size--can just toss it in my bag and go. Reasearched, and for the price, am VERY happy with this choice. Anker really stands behind their products, too.
 Hard to beat the sound from this for the price. It’s small so it won’t rattle any windows with bass but it gets plenty loud and has good battery life. It has very impressive Bluetooth range. I haven’t measured it but it’s solid for Bluetooth.
 Originally, I wrote the following review and gave the product 1 star:  "The battery stopped holding a charge a few weeks after the return window closed.  We are unable to purchase a new battery.  Definitely would NOT purchase this again."<br/><br/>After writing the above review, I was contacted by Anker and they replaced the speaker, free of charge.  My assumption is that there was a production problem with my speaker, which can happen with any product.  The fact that the company stands behind it's product is what made me change this to 5 stars.  Thank you Anker!
 This has changed how we listen to music in the house. It pairs easily with our iPhones and the battery lasts a really long time. The sound is good and the Bluetooth connection is powerful enough for me to bring my phone upstairs while the music plays flawlessly through the speaker downstairs (our Vizio soundbar crackles and breaks up when I take my phone upstairs). We bought two of these for my daughter's playschool as well and I would recommend them to anyone looking for good quality at a great price.
 I've found many issues using this speaker.<br/>From big issues like sometimes when the speaker is turned on the sound is really weird for a few seconds, sometimes the volume is really low eventhough the computer is turned up the whole way only to go to max volume when one of the volume buttons is pressed, annoying recharge light blinking constantly when hooked up to the computer, having to manually 'forget' the bluetooth device and re-pair it with the computer every week or so...<br/><br/>I did not test this on PC so these issues can be for mac only. Bottom line, it works but it has a lot of issues, the sound quality is not great. I'll probably get a new one soon.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Two days after this review was posted I got a rep from ANKER trying to help me figure out the issues and offered to send a new one. Amazing customer service.
 Overall a good speaker. Upon removing it from the packaging, I could tell that the Anker Soundcore was a well-made product. Elegant design. Easy to use. Sound-wise, it does a good job filling my medium-sized room. The only complaint I have is that the battery life (at least for my Soundcore) is a lot shorter than what Anker has advertised. I gave it a full charge before usage. However, the battery only lasted 6 hours, meaning I will probably not be able to take it on long trips. Was a bit disappointed on that end, but if battery life is not an issue for you, I would recommend this speaker.
 **UPDATE<br/>I bought 1 of these back in February and left a review that it has great quality for the price. I want to update to say that It's July 2nd and I've only had to charge this once - I listen to it for 1-3 hours daily. I bought this same speaker as a gift and it was well received.<br/><br/>original:<br/>Really great quality for the price.
 Updated: I like Anker products but this Bluetooth speaker received has popping/static sound. Not very frequent. Nice high and mid range but no bass.<br/>Anker has excellent customer services that go above and beyond to resolve any problems with their products.<br/>I got an opportunity to try out Soundcore2 and it's wonderful. Sound is very nice and also has low range sounds. Will continue to choose Anker products. Worth the spending.
 This little speaker has a big sound! Great "surround sound" effect, too, especially if you put the speaker about 6 inches from a wall or similar surface. My only (very minor) complaint is that the battery takes too long to charge, but that shouldn't be a problem if you leave it plugged in (this won't mess up the battery, because the charger turns itself off automatically when the battery is fully charged).
 Update Anker has gone above and beyond customer service. They have always been in my top 3 brand choice's. For the product line's they make. Very good and sturdy products. There can always be a bad apple in ever bunch. Hey I got one of them. But this company ANKER is top drawer, Class act they took full control of this issue immediately resolved it. It's really nice to see that these days. Thanks ANKER YOU'RE MY#1Choice from here on. Happy Holidays to All
 Compare this to the oontz angle: form factor is slightly bigger, but build quality is better.  Sound can go a bit louder and battery life is way better.  I trust Anker.  This is a good, solid product.  Not for the audiophile, perhaps, but serviceable, reliable, and long-lasting.
 This is the best Bluetooth speaker I've ever owned.  I purchased it about 6 months ago, and I have charged it a total of 3 times in 6 months.  I use it just about every day getting ready in the morning, and in the fall I used it for over an hour straight raking leaves.  3 times!  That is unbelievable, I know... But it is why I had to write this review.  The sound is very good for what I use it for... And I like the fact that the top is made from a rubber like material, so when I touch it while coming out of the shower... There's no problem.  I can't think of a product that has wowed me like the Anker Bluetooth speaker.
 My husband loves to come home and listen to Podcasts in the backyard while he relaxes, but for the longest time he was just using the speaker on his phone. I purchased this as a gift for his birthday, and he absolutely loves it - we both do. He uses it everyday to listen to his beloved Adam Carolla Show, and then sometimes we use it when sitting in the backyard looking at the stars. It's come in handy on multiple occasions, and has a nice, rich sound.
 We love it!!! Husband purchased this to play White Noise for our newborn. This little speaker is shockingly loud and clear. We now play our times with it. Has a good range to play from source.Worth the purchase and would buy again. Great price, fast shipping and works perfectly.<br/>Smaller than our remote control and lightweight.
 Superior sound quality, but since soundcore 2 is released i would buy that instead, they really made the 2 at the end of the name worth it, so much better than this. And this was amazing! I had this for about 6 to 7 months before it sound quality started getting hazy, and its still going, its not like it just went and died on me i still use it but i have it connected to my amazon alexa and its phenomenal, but the soundcore 2 is so much better i would reccommend you atleast give it a glance, its not much more expensive than this and for the price, its totally worth it. Im not sayimg you shouldnt buy this, but atleast peek at the soundcore 2. You wont be let down!
 Wow. I'm really glad I went with this speaker. Considering what it is I was not expecting too much, but it has a surprisingly rich and full sound for its size. I have heard many other similarly sized Bluetooth speakers and none have compared. All have distorted at high volumes, but I haven't heard that here. Also, the battery life is fantastic. I leave it connected via Bluetooth to my echo dot, and regularly use it, especially in the evenings. I only end up needing to hook it up to charge about once a week. The only issue I have had is a connection drop once or twice, which is to be expected with anything wireless.
 Shockingly good speaker for the price! Doesn’t go super loud without distorting a little, but loud enough to hear in two rooms at a time or in the shower without distorting— would totally buy again for the price.
 I love this little speaker. I didn't own anything similar prior to purchasing this, but Amazon had a really great deal that I couldn't pass up.<br/><br/>I've only charged it a few times, mainly out of my paranoia of having a battery die when I'm away from a charger, but this thing seems to last forever. At home I'll go weeks without charging it and it just keeps on cranking out great sounding music. The sound quality is great. It has a nice full sound. I would definitely buy again.
 After reading a lot of reviews on a lot of speakers, I settled on this on a day it was on sale. I've not been disappointed at all. I've had zero issues with it and the sound quality is superb for a small speaker. Connects easily every time I turn it on and holds a charge for a long time, I think I've only charged it 3 or 4 times since I started using it.
 I really love the design of this speaker. Sounds way better than the Oontz angle 3. The high frequencies sound sweet, unlike the Oontz 3 which are shrill and awful. But... for around 15 bucks less I would get a slightly bigger unit that is capable of reproducing some low end as well: the Taotronics Rock. It's louder, has everything the Anker has plus a great low end, no distortion, just fully pleasing amazing sound. That is unless you want something tiny, in which case the Anker totally rules.
 This speaker delivers great sound - and  you can't beat its price. I had to replace the original one I bought because it malfunctioned. BUT, Anker was absolutely wonderful to work with! They replaced it with a new one that has no issues. They were so accommodating and understanding that I will purchase products from them in the future and I would highly recommend their products.
 I bought this to use with my LED light setup, and it works great! I haven’t charged it yet and it’s still going strong after being used pretty much all day yesterday. It’s got a nice weight to it, and it’s better sound quality than any other speaker I’ve used. It gets really loud, which is what I needed. I’m really glad I made the jump and got this! I’ll update this if any issues come about with the speaker.
 Nice for listening to podcasts close up.  Not as much resonance or volume as I expected, but nice quality of sound when it's, say, near your bed, or in kitchen while you're working, or setting next to you.  DISLIKE the very bright blue light immensely, when device is on at night.  It's obnoxious and right on top.  Otherwise, very nice construction and design.
 This little speaker is an amazing piece of engineering. It exceeded my expectations in every respect: it looks good, it feels like a quality product, it sounds great, and it works flawlessly as advertised. I use it with a Samsung 55" and a Denon soundbar. They all play well together. I carry my Anker around the house and occasionally park it on a table, along with my beer, in the backyard. It's great company and requires no attention other than a nightly charge. Thanks for a fine and well-designed product.
 This speaker worked great for a little over a year, with little use and a lot of care.Then the charge light fell out and now the battery will not take a charge.I guess the speaker is not made well!  Would NOT recommend buying without 4-year insurance plan which I did not purchase.So I'm SOL.<br/><br/>Addendum-<br/><br/>The company is amazing. After posting a somewhat negative review Anker customer service contacted me, sent me a brand NEW Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker.  Who does that? This company stands behind their products and provides excellent customer service. Kudo's to them. Would now recommend HIGHLY!!!
 I am a firm follower of Anker products, they are simply amazing. This speaker is nothing short of amazing, the sound quality is superb, the build of the product is awesome; fantastic product. If you are looking for a bluetooth speaker, look no further than this one.
 This is a surprisingly small unit that puts out great sound.  This is my first bluetooth speaker, so I can't compare to others, but it does a great job around the house and the battery lasts a long time.  With mild use, the battery still holds a charge from the day I purchased it and initially charged it up.  I like the fact that, when connected to my iDevice via bluetooth, the icon on my screen also has a battery indicator for the Anker.<br/><br/>Built well, feels solid and has some heft, so that it does not feel that it will easily fall or be damaged.  Very satisfied with purchase.
 Overall good speaker. The sound is about what you would expect from a small speaker this size. It is decently loud. My only complaint is that it does not pair flawlessly. Other Bluetooth speakers I have owned started playing as soon as I turned my Bluetooth on. Even though my phone 'remembers' this speaker, it just won't connect sometimes. I have to turn the speaker off and on a couple of times, and sometimes I have to manually go to the bluetooth setting on my phone to get it to pair. I know, first world problem, but just a little too glitchy to earn 4 or 5 stars.
 I got into the market for a Bluetooth speaker due to not being home all of the time and needed something small and portable. I've been into installing and listening to high end car and home audio for about 25 years now. Other than being small, I wanted something that had a decent sound. Naturally there are many brands to choose from in a crowded market. I started off by listening to a few but mainly reading about what others have said with their experiences. I came across Anker. I had never heard of this brand before but after some research decided to try the Soundcore out. This is a great little speaker. The sound is full and bass isn't bad, especially coming from a unit this small. There were a couple of times where I forgot that I wasn't listening to a home stereo that I was in fact listening to a speaker barely larger than my hand. It plays somewhat loudly, would be nice to have a tad bit more volume. The battery life is amazing, it takes a while to charge but after that the battery lasts hours and hours!  This is a great buy on a Bluetooth speaker that really sounds like a much higher dollar one. I would highly  recommend the Sound core.
 I don't know how the company can produce something this nice, this versatile, this good, for the price it sells for.  I bought this speaker because I had never had a Bluetooth speaker and wanted to experiment, something I am still doing.  The best thing about the speaker is that it is portable.  The sound is good for the size, but it can't compare to larger speakers or audio with a separate bass.  So if your greatest need is for portability than this is a great buy.  Just buy it.
 I'm hard of hearing and often irritated by the TV sound using my hearing aids. This little unit is wonderful. I place it beside my chair across the room and hear every little sound with no effort, distortion, and without hearing aids. It runs for 10 hours on a single charge, I control the sound on the unit. I am very happy with this little gem, and you will be too.
 Do not buy. The Soundcore 2 version actually has bass response; this model doesn't. Returning, in spite of the hassles. Can't live with the poor sound, since I already have a Soundcore 2 in the house and know what I'm missing.<br/><br/>Edit: The seller contacted me about this review and sent the Soundcore 2 as a complimentary upgrade, based on my original one star rating. I'm very pleased with the Soundcore 2. In fairness, the Soundcore probably rates a 3 in performance, by itself. Just know what you are getting.
 Works good, easy to set up, but I don't get anywhere near the 66 ft. range claimed. Very handy for sitting outside on the patio and having your tunes right there without fear of disturbing the neighbors. So far battery is living up to it's claim of 24 hours.  Wish the sound was a little louder and more "full bodied" but still impressive for it's size. If I was going to buy one again I'd probably go for one with a little bit bigger speakers for the full range sound.
 I always find myself switching this little device on when I'm making dinner (as I keep this on top of my refrigerator). I love the sound and bass that it produces, and I will always stand by Anker products for as long as I feel their quality is superior to others.
 This speaker is great!  Loud enough for our back patio without blowing out your ears.  Has great sound.  Before my husband heard music playing thru the Anker, he kept saying I should have bought a Bose.  But once the speaker came on, he agreed with me that for the price, it was def not disappointing!  Also, nice size &amp; very portable to carry around.  Definitely recommend.
 I bought this as a replacement for a broken Bluetooth speaker my wife had bought me a few years ago to use at work. I have been pleasantly surprised by the ease of Bluetooth connectivity, the sound quality and battery life that has lasted me about 15-20 hours over the course of a work week. It is not an expensive unit and I would recommend it to anyone using it outdoors, in a vehicle or inside the work office.
 I went to play it at a low volume say like at half for my phone and speaker, the damn speaker blew out, at a low volume, so now I can use it, and when I took it off the charger the next day cause I thought the blow out was nothing it died after like 30 seconds can't even charge it anymore and the was all after two days after it got opened wtf.
 Another nice looking, nicely packed sound speaker that doesn't live up to the advertised specs. Charged the little box up and hooked it up to my Galaxy 8+ and the sound was less then stellar and the range was about equal to the sound.
 I tested three different bluetooth speakers before choosing this Anker.  The Anker sounded the richest, cleanest, biggest sound with good bass.  And the battery life is unreal, i have had it almost 2 months and only charged it twice!
 Good for the price. Fine quality and I like that it is pause/play controls. But if your phone goes out of range while connected it seems like the speaker will forget your phone and you'll have to set it all up again. Or just turn of the speaker whenever you leave. Seems like an unavoidable problem.<br/><br/>Update: Anker sent me a replacement speaker very fast. My original speaker was defective, works great now. Up from 3 stars to 5.<br/><br/>Update 2: New unit has terrible range. Between 2 speakers I have a good one I guess.<br/><br/>Update 3: customer service was awesome. this speaker wasnt good for me but Anker still makes good products.
 Love this bluetooth speaker (so much so I bought two - one for home and one for work)!! Easy to use, easy to pair, holds a charge for seemingly ever (still haven't done the second charge on either of the two I've bought and one gets used almost daily). Gets nice and loud, fills whatever room I'm in with plenty of sound. Sound is clear and rich! Totally worth it!
 Sound quality is noticeably static filled, and it can be temperamental when it comes to pairing with devices.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  The people at Anker were quick to follow up about my review, and resolve my concern. They sent me a larger, better quality speaker from their product line which has a much  higher quality sound. I recommend you consider this product if deeper bass sound matters to your listening pleasure:  A3143.  No static  problems or Bluetooth pairing problems either.
 Sounded great while it lasted... Dead after only a few months. No longer powers up and no longer an option to return the item.<br/><br/>Update. Called Anker and they are sending a replacement.  Excellent customer service.  18 month warranty on the speaker.
 I've had this Anker Bluetooth audio speaker for several months now and very pleased with its quality, features, simplicity, and price, and can recommend to users looking for a single Bluetooth audio speaker for their home or office.
 This is a great speaker but i would LOVE to change one thing. I don't think volume control is important enough to be a primary control. If you're like me, you turn the speaker all the way up and control the volume with your phone. For this reason, I would love dedicated forward/back song controls as a single press for +\- and perhaps a long press on +/- for volume control. Just a suggestion. I know, I should have read more before ordering but I didn't. Still a great deal. 😎
 This is a terrific product! I got for $22.09+tax, to use inside an older car W/O Bluetooth to listen to music on quick trips, it works awesome, and is the perfect size to slip into glovebox or under seat to hide when not in use. I had another device, but that device would not allow charging while in use.It holds the charge between car trips, which is nice too!
 I love Anker, I have purchased their wall chargers, charge cables, screen protector, portable charger. So safe to say I like and trust Anker.<br/>Great Speaker and cant beat the price, I have used the speaker everyday for about a year and some time.<br/>I use the speaker strictly on Bluetooth now due to the aux port breaking. Also noticing that the micro usb charge port starting to become more and more loose. Just sadden by the aux port breaking after a couple uses of the aux port. Overall build could be a little better but cant beat the price.
 I was blown away by the sound quality of this Speaker. I have a Gizmodo 2014 Winner $100 SoundEQ Bluetooth Speaker that is 3 times the size. And it sounded good-I THOUGHT. Placed the Anker Sound Core on top of fridge on Christmas day and the sound quality is of the higher end of quality with the lower Frequency in the 45hz as the higher cruao &amp; clear, definately have a great runing involved volume is plenty loud to fill a 600-1000 sq/ft room during a family gathering or for wherever you need your music. I love texh.and wabted to try more in this aiE like oontz angle, and simular. Oontz is a little louder sacrificing lows and sound quality. Battery life was a good solid 7 hrs on volume levels of 65% with multiple attempts of 95%level 10evel  impress the Inlaws  will be getting these as gifts from now on  for all the kids. Great grippy outer.shell, and sweet buttons . My 1st Anker and really impressed.-I bought online amazon over christmas myself. This is My honest opinion for the Anker Sound core BT. Speaker.
 Replaced my JBL Charge 2 with this for a fraction of the cost.<br/>JBL battery life was going to garbage, then the speakers finally blew.<br/>This little thing sounds great. Haven't used the calling feature, but battery life is suspiciously good.
 Update: anker read my review and promptly exchanged thebdefective unit with a brand new one. Their customer service is top notch, as well as their product. Great speaker and great customer service. Highly recommend this speaker<br/><br/>I’m so disappointed to say that the female port of the charger on the speaker does not allow me to charge it anymore. It somehow came apart (pictures included but hard to see) and has rendered the speaker useless. I just came back on amazon to see the return policy but unfortunately it’s past. Hopefully someone from amazon or anker will read this and exchange my, less than one year old, speaker for one that I can charge and listen to. As of now, would not recommend this product u less you like wasting money
 Great, vibrant color. Loud audio that remains clear.  Bought this to use at an outdoor BBQ. Lasted all night (and then some) as well as could be heard across the entire yard.  It was great being able to use my phone to adjust the volume, so I could turn up my favorite songs while still playing cornhole.
 The product looks and feels solid. But this specific set does not link well with devices and when it does it unlinks after you turn it off once. Before leaving this review I asked product support button...person that called was clueless...pretty crappy experience overall.<br/><br/>I changed my review from 1 to 4 stars. Seller contacted me and will be sending a new unit. Great service!
 With the overwhelming number of bluetooth sound products available i've become very suspicious of product claims (and reviews). After purchasing a number of unexpectedly below par products I was not expecting a lot from this product. But, dang! I've had larger bluetooth portable sound devices that sounded "tinny" and did not expect the bass that came out of this quite small device. For my experience, I've had easy synching (not all products do this well) and strong battery life (again, not a common feature). I was pleasantly surprised by this product despite my cynicism.
 Although I am very impressed with the battery life and how loud the device will play, most everything played, podcasts, NPR, individual songs.....well, it just doesn't sound very good. I don't know how to really describe what I am hearing other than it sounds like it's passing through a large space with bad acoustics. I wanted to use this speaker outside when me and friends gather around the patio furniture but will resign it to the bathroom; playing it during shower time.
 I wanted  a speaker for my bedroom- this was amazing quality- for so cheap. Great sound, and unbelievable battery life- I didn’t charge it for the first month! It connects as soon as I turn it on- no cumbersome reconnecting every time. Good quality sound. Great small space speaker.
 I originally purchased this speaker as a cross reference for my music studio. I like the fact that the sound is crystal clear and gets pretty loud when in a quiet setting. That being said, the speaker does lack a bit when it comes to playing out at the factory I also work in. Along with ambient noise comes volume reduction. Since this speaker only has drivers on one side it can be hard to hear a constant quality when moving around. It does have enough bass if the speaker is being held in hand to enhance the feel of it, but when put down it loses some of its magic and sounds a bit thin. Overall this is a great purchase, but there is something to be said about adding a bit more volume to the product to compensate for the one sided drivers.
 Perfect little speaker for my Alexa.  I was not sure about connecting a Bluetooth speaker to my alexa, but now I don't know why I hesitated.  The speaker was simple to hook up and now my little alexa has a great, booming presence in my home. The quality of the sound from this speaker is fantastic!  This is worth every penny if you are tired of the tinny voice in the Echo Dot.
 This little speaker is POWERFUL and the battery lasts forever. I have had it for a couple months now and use it here and there and still haven't had to charge it. Comparing it to my husband's Bose speaker, I haven't noticed a difference. They both get just about to the same volume, sounds quality is great in both, and the Anker was cheaper. I'd definitely recommend this speaker for anyone considering a Bose but doesn't want to spend as much money
 I love the battery backup this speaker has. Lasts for weeks (avg 2-3 hours of listening/day) but 4 months after purchasing it, the audio quality has significantly deteriorated. It sounds like it's dipped inside a glass of water. Disappointed with the audio.<br/><br/>Update: The Anker customercare were very proactive to notice this feedback and they provided me with a replacement device immediately. Electronic stuff keep failing all the time regardless of who makes it, but it's support that we receive when something goes wrong really exemplifies the experience. Full marks to Anker on this aspect.
 I love my Anker speaker. Sound quality is excellent. It's a little heavy, but it's not like I'm walking around with it... Bluetooth connection &amp; USB charging port. I usually listen in the morning before work &amp; in the evenings. I say that too say, the charge last a really long time. I charged it yesterday &amp; it had not been charged prior to that until around Christmas. Oh &amp; I didn't need to charge it due to it not being operational. Overall, I am very happy with my Anker Speaker.
 I rarely write review product, but I gotta write this due to their positive customer service and quality of the product. The speaker came out to be really clear, not much bass. Bluetooth works perfectly, it automatically connects to my phone whenever I turn it on. The speaker itself could last very long as it mentions 24 hours. I use this to replace my pc speaker and it work perfectly due to its small compact size and clear sound. It is something I enjoy working and studying while listening to both jazz, classical, and may be even EDM. This little guy could blast the entire room with sound. Well, it was worth it and of course, awesome Anker customer service. Looking forward to see great product in the future
 I bought this for my husband for Christmas. It was by far his favorite gift. He is a music guy and likes to listen to his R&amp;B loud. This is small yet powerful and the sound quality is excellent. A great value. I love Anker products.
 Great for the price. It has great sound. It is sturdy, doesn’t feel cheaply made. My only complaint is the sound becomes slightly distorted when you turn it up almost all the way. But you definitely get more then what your paying for. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a solid sound at an affordable price.
 As someone who is going to college this fall, I'm always in the search for great products that don't blow the budget. This speaker was exactly what I was looking for. The design is great. The buttons are easy to use and have a nice click. The matte black looks good in any setting. While the branding is very large, it doesn't look like too much. Connecting to the speaker is a simple process and there's a light that lets you know when it's connecting and when it's connected. Audio quality is very nice; not too much on the low end and the high end isn't unbearable at high volumes.<br/>Overall, this speaker is fantastic, especially for the price, and anyone on a budget looking for a Bluetooth speaker should consider the Anker Soundcore.
 Great speaker for it's size and price. I've used it for over a week and still haven't needed to charge it. Purchased this to use in my shop and on the patio. It puts out a lot of sound for it's small size. The sound is good overall, but lacks a little depth. It was really easy to connect with both my phone and computer. This will be replacing an old stereo in the shop, freeing up space for more tools!
 I forgot that this uses a dedicated pairing button, so I spent a minute looking for a switch. For all non-stereo speakers (like for a home theater system), this one is the best I've ever come across. There's no distortions in music at ALL (even high bass  Koda Kumi, Blood on the Dance Floor] or high treble  Taylor Swift, Ylvis], and the ringtones/notifications come through perfectly. My only complaint is that charging is limited to 1A. That takes a LOT more time than if it could charge at 2A (or recognize its parent's IQ Technology, to charge at 2.4A).
 This thing sounds SO good! For the size, there is also a lot of bass, and volume. You can easily hear it throughout a small house. Connection is great and it’s easy to use. I got it for a couple friends and my brother and they all love it!
 This speaker is WAYYYYY more than I expected for the price! The mids and bass are awesome and unexpected for such a little speaker. The highs are great and just slightly less than crisp. I did research before buying a bluetooth speaker and the Anker Soundcore had high marks and was the only speaker in this price range with actual bass that you could feel and hear. It is not splash proof like some others, but it does fine on the sink while in the shower steam. The bluetooth connects easily and the range is very far. Never had a problem going from room to room in my house. The best thing by far about this speaker, besides the bass, is the battery life. I bought this speaker a week ago, used it every morning and evening, and have not had to charge it yet. It says 24 hour battery life and I believe it. I don't write reviews much, but this speaker deserved it. Great purchase.
 This does not hold charge and I haven't had it 2 months. No option to return now. Do not buy this. Spend the extra money for something better.
 Everyone at work wants to know where I bought this and have asked if this speaker cost me $200. Volume can reach pretty high levels but I'm so glad that the battery life on this lasts so long and I can play it all day.<br/><br/>Worth the price and will make a good gift for anyone!
 I have gone through a couple of speakers in my time, some big brand names and some lower end ones, Anker stands out amongst the crowd. I have had my speaker for a couple years now and used on the beach for 9hrs a day as a lifeguard. It would be right out in the elements, sand, saltwater, rain etc. and it is still functioning as well as the day I bought it. The distance on the Bluetooth is not the greatest but the battery life is nothing like I have ever seen before. Well worth the price I would buy it for way more.
 Love it!  Everyone else's reviews seem to be spot on - It's not a bass demon but it has enough "presence" to make it worthwhile.  Otherwise very "balanced" sound response.  Haven't tried the microphone yet.  Distance/range seems pretty good (had phone in basement on charger playing music through the SoundCore at the far end of the upstairs bathroom where I was showering, perfect way to get some tunes in the shower!)<br/><br/>Great premium rubbery feel to the unit, slick overall design, surprisingly loud for its size.
 For the reasonable price, I am pleased with the sound quality and how quickly and easily it pairs with the bluetooth transmitter. A charge also seems to last for many hours. It would have been nice if you could more easily read the black on black icons that identify the 5 control buttons on top.
 I almost hate to say it, but this is most likely unbeatable for the price. I had the Bose SoundLink and exchanged it because I wasn't impressed with the sound and battery life was very poor. I'd say the sound quality is slightly better than the Bose (too much base) and battery life is unreal.<br/><br/>The ONLY negative is you can't check battery power, but so good I still had to give it 5 stars.
 Couldn't make it work. Sent it back. Not saying that anything was wrong with product, I just couldn't get it to work on my equipment.<br/>Up date to review.<br/>Anker customer service got involved with my dissatisfaction, and wanted to make it right with me. They sent me a new speaker. It works great. This company has gone beyond the norm, to see that their customers are satisfied. I would highly recommend them in purchases of their products.
 I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. I bought this device based on the great hype around it and the overall good reviews I found on the internet. I only gave 4/5 because I feel it could be a little bit better, but well I knew what I was getting for the price point, and I'm still impressed and happy to buy it. I would by the better quality ones from this same brand if I could, because I truly enjoy this product. Oh, and the battery life last for a long time too.<br/>Would totally recommend for those who want a cheaper bluetooth speaker but are on a budget.
 I am very impressed with this speaker I took it off charge Monday and never charged it again until Friday and I used it with my Alexa to play my music. I have an echo dot and it is the only source of speaker Alexa has to speak through. Again I am super impressed with the sound and the death is it has of that sound. It was a great Buy
 Attractive...charged up okay...but does not turn on, pair or play. UPDATE: Anker reached out by email and after a few days refunded me without requiring the serial number or returning the speaker after I replied explaining I was traveling already without the dud, of course. So I've upgraded this to 3 stars because the company's prompt helpful response made this overall experience okay, and I do suppose my unit was simply defective, given the high numbers and percentages of 4 and 5 star reviews.
 Why love instead of just like for an inexpensive speaker?  It exceeded my expectations and sounds much better than a couple other speakers that cost a similar amount.  The Bluetooth connection has been flawless for me with several different sources.  Its construction seems to be quite robust.  The single flaw I have with it is that the controls are very hard to see.  I might use silver or white paint on the raised areas to make it easy to see.
 I use this speaker at night with my cell phone as a makeshift sound machine. Rather than buy an entire sound machine, I use this with an app that allows me to listen to whatever I want as I fall asleep. Great sound when I use it during the day for music also. The battery lasts a long time before recharging, about a week and a half for me.
 A surprisingly great little speaker for the money. The bass and lower tones do get a little muddy at higher volume, however. Overall it made a great addition to my workbench. Haven't really pushed the battery life yet, but I've used it on battery power for ~6 hours so far without issue. It appears to be solidly constructed out of good materials...it has a nice "heft" for such a small unit, and the non-slip exterior ensures that it stays put even on an incline. Connecting via Bluetooth with both Apple and Android devices was dirt simple.
 For the price point this speaker is outstanding. The sound quality is really good. The battery on it lasts a long time. I've used it for short bursts and then store it in my work bag for two weeks and it still had charge in the battery. The sound is not as good as a high end like Bose but it is pretty close in my opinion and not different enough to shell out the extra money for the high end speaker. I really am glad I bought this.
 Use a this speaker in my bathroom for listening to some tunes when I’m cleaning the bathroom  or taking a shower. My fiancé uses it to listen to music while she does her hair. Very top notch speaker easy to pair and has excellent sound. Really love the battery life of it with my intermittent usage of it I only have had to charge it twice over the few months I have owned it.
 I bought this speaker due to 2 factors. 1) it was an Anker product and 2) it was on sale. It's Bluetooth and it also has an auxiliary input to use it with other types of devices. I have used this with my Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, an my iPad Mini and an Ipod Nano and it works great. Pairing a device to the speaker is easy using the Bluetooth button on the speaker. Volume sounds good for a small speaker. I use it every day for hours and have only had to charge it once in the past couple weeks. I absolutely love this speaker that I purchased another one for my garage (even though it wasn't on sale). You won't be disappointed in the quality of the speaker or with the sound. It does exactly what Anker set out for it to do.
 I own numerous Anker products.  All have been excellent value for the money and high quality devices.  This Bluetooth speaker is no exception.  It pairs easily, sounds great and has very long battery life.  What I did not expect was how loud this box can play! Easily filled the room with music for a Christmas party.  No, it wont replace my PA System with 18inch sub-woofers, but then the PA Subs wont fit in my pocket either... :)
 I've had this for six months now. I used to have a Bose Mini Soundlink, which is an incredible speaker. No portable speaker I've met can really compare with the Bose, but with the changing of roommates, I lost the sounlink and was in the hunt for a more affordable substitute.<br/><br/>I got this Anker speaker for $26 around black friday deals time. The battery lasts an insane amount of time, even longer than the soundlink. And in my opinion the sound is comparable to some JBL's I've used. For the price, this was an incredibly great purchase, and I have not been disappointed with sound quality or volume.<br/><br/>Nice job Anker for making a quality, but affordable product. This is my second Anker product, and both have exceeded expectations, will buy this brand again.
 Cannot complain about this little speaker. Perfect for low volume use. It's not for those who wish to blow their eardrums out. I use it for background music and it works perfectly for my use.<br/><br/>One more thing worth mentioning. I had it playing music for 14 hours straight with no sign of the battery needing recharging. Not many devices can last that long on a single charge. I'm impressed.
 I've been using this for almost a year now. I carry it around the house with me all the time! It has held up great, and it connects really easily to my phone. Some bluetooth speakers seem to struggle to connect to my phone, but this does easily every time. The battery lasts a long time. The sound is great.
 Okay so it's not a Bose surround system but you wouldn't expect that for the money. What you do get is a Bluetooth speaker with a phenomenal battery life and the sound is pretty good. So if you're Frugal and don't want to worry about someone walking away with your speaker from your campsite this is a great product. The sound for the money is phenomenal also.
 I was very happy with my purchase. Sound quality was awesome. BAttery life stayed with me for days. I've only used it in my car to listen to podcasts and stuff from my phone and I loved it. I am very sad that it was stolen from my car when I parked with a ... I really miss this speaker. I also wished it was a smaller size. I recommend this speaker!
 Didn’t work wouldn’t charge not happy
 Excellent speakers.  The reason I gave 3 stars is because of<br/><br/>1) Constant background static while charging from a laptop and playing music at the same time<br/>2) Missing mute button on the speaker.  I have my cell phone plugged on to the charger and was taking some conference calls on this speaker p in a different room and I have no way to mute the mic.  Nice to have that feature.<br/><br/>Updated to 4 stars because<br/>1) Product lack of feature for Mute button is not a product defect.<br/>2) Amazing customer service to followup on understanding the needs and trying to improve the product.  I see sincere effort.
 I'm very pleased with the Anker SoundCore Bluetooth speaker.  I received one as a gift that I will use in my office. I like it so much that I bought another to use at home with my new Alexa Dot, another gift.  My 19 year old also received one of these speakers for Christmas and she is very happy with hers, as well.
 shipped quickly, solidly built, good documentation, performs flawlessly, excellent value
 This is the backyard pool master.  Battery life is great, and it supports hard rock and hair bands just as well as it does salsa and other stuff my mother in law decides to play.  Water resistant, as my kids have gotten it wet during play, and the pool robot has sprayed it, and my M-I-L has spilled champagne on it... Connects fast, stays charged, plays clean.
 I very rarely by an off brand electronic product, as I am also a wholesaler of off brand electronics. However this is the best bluetooth speaker i've seen yet. Great sound, looks good too. I use it at the beach, I put it in my bicycle cup holder, I use it on my back porch. I use it everywhere. Charge lasts hours and it doesn't have that tin sound other speakers do... I give it a 5 star !  I went out and bought anothor anchor product, with same great results.......
 Eneded up ordering a second one as a relative really liked the speaker. Its louder than the Bose speaker similar to its size. All though I do have connection issues from just a few feet away from the speaker. Even at 2-6 feet from the speaker, it would just cut off a bit. Could be the various devices I have though as I had no problems in other places besides my apartment. Besides that, it's worth buying.
 The reason I purchased this Bluetooth speaker was to use it in my daughters nursery. She will only sleep with white noise playing, I wanted  to be able to control the white noise in her nursery from our master bedroom across the house with my phone and the white noise app through a Bluetooth speaker!  It works amazing!! The Bluetooth connection travels through the walls and doors from our master bedroom over to her nursery on the other side of the house!!  For how little the speaker is it is extremely loud! I am extremely impressed with this speaker for so many reasons!!<br/><br/>Only wish would be that the charging cord was longer and came with a plug for a wall outlet instead of just the USB, but not a big deal at all!
 As always, very happy with my Anker product.  This is the first speaker I've purchased from them, but have bought many other products and they've always exceeded my expectations.  The volume gets quite loud, the speaker itself has enough weight to not blow away, but is not overly heavy.  The design is pleasant with a slightly rubberized surface around it.  Good stuff!
 Best bluetooth speaker I have ever owned.<br/>This sounds better than my $100 Altec Lansing Boomjacket.<br/>Battery lasts forever.<br/><br/>100% will be buying Anker products again.
 Amazing speaker! I’ve had this for 7 1/2 months and haven’t charged it once. I use it for about 1-2 hours each time and it has good volume. Only reason I don’t give it 5 stars is because sometimes it has trouble connected to my iphone and I have to forget the device before connected it again.
 This was around $22 when I bought it so I didn't expect very much. However, it has proven me wrong. This thing is great. It sounds very good and gets plenty loud. Also, it holds a charge for a long time. i use it almost daily and very rarely have to charge it. I use it both in the house and outdoors and it functions great. The case for it ($7) is worth the money also.
 Update 1/22/2016<br/><br/>Shortly after my original review I was contacted by Anker, and WOW!!! I've never dealt with such amazing customer service people. They not only sent out a replacement speaker, but they than followed up to make sure everything was okay with it. The customer service experience alone should be 10 stars!!! Outstanding!!!! Many companies out there should take note of how to properly treat their customers.<br/><br/>Now on to the speaker, By no means am I an audiophile, but this little speaker is quite the powerhouse. After listening to it for a little bit, I'm surprised by the quality of the sound. It's super clear, has great bass, and is plenty loud for the situations you would use it for. My only complaint is the power button, I'm not sure if it's by design, but it does take a little bit of holding down the power button to turn it on. When turning it off, it only takes holding the power button for about a second to turn it off.<br/><br/>Overall, the build quality is very good and the speaker feels very solid. I would highly recommend it, as I already do for all of their charging/power products.<br/><br/>Original Review:<br/>This isn't a review of the sound quality, but of the physical speaker itself.<br/><br/>While it is a very nice and small design, a problem was immediately evident when I took it out of the packaging, the micro-USB charging port. As you can see in the included picture, the port is extremely recessed into the housing and it's crooked making the charging cable next to impossible to connect. I don't know if this is a one-off problem (I seem to be lucky that way), or a manufacturing problem, either way, it's unacceptable. After seeing this, I put it back in the box for an exchange, but a return was the only option, so back it goes. I've purchased numerous Anker products before, all of which, I've been extremely satisfied with, until now.
 I'm just an average person who felt like giving this speaker a try. I've had had this speaker for about a month now and it's spectacular for the price. Usually when I look at the prices when purchasing items I think that the price reflects on it's "premiumness" but this is a steal. The sound is great and the radiator does do as advertised and delivers those low frequencies and adds a punch to the sound. What I really like about this speaker is it's 24 hour long battery. It's insane. If I use this speaker at full volume it's more like 15-16 hours but that's still a lot. The Bluetooth is very responsive and has a long range. I didn't measure how far but I could leave my phone in my room and the speaker would continue playing in my living room.The only problem I have with my speaker is that when I try turning it on it flashes red and blue at the same time so it illuminates a purple color and doesn't turn on. I have to then click the power button again and then it turns on. I have no idea what it means but it still works after a couple of clicks.
 Very, very good sound, easy to connect, great range. Super simple to use. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because of the button features. No fast forward to the next song or restart current song. I have not tried it yet for a call, but this is a solid Bluetooth speaker. For $27 I am not sure it can be beat!! Oh, and there is an 18 month warranty!!! I was not paid or got anything for this review.
 Pros:<br/>Good battery life<br/>Great price<br/>Good tech<br/>I will say I was more than happy with their level of customer service I received. Anker seems to care enough to reach out to their customers and go the extra mile for customer satisfaction.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Wish it were a little louder<br/>BT range could be longer<br/>Sound quality is subjective<br/><br/>*Full disclosure: I received a complimentary product from Anker after this one to make sure I was completely satisfied.
 I was blown away by the sound this small speaker puts out.  Also impressive is the 24 hour playtime Anker claims.  I have owned this speaker for 4 months now and I think I have only charged it 2 times.  I do not even know if this thing comes with a low battery indicator.  I also like the soft touch rubber material and the build quality seems on point.  This little speaker is extremely durable and portable.  I would definitely recommend this product for anyone not wanting to break the bank for a bluetooth speaker.  I listened to many smaller speakers in the stores and nothing impressed me like this little speaker.  Check out my YouTube review here:  ...]<br/>Great Job Anker!!!
 This really is the best you can get for the price. I have two of these so that I'm never stuck without one. Even though I had an issue with one of the speakers, the customer service reps at Anker were quick to respond and send a replacement. These things are durable and have high battery life. Anker is my go-to brand for headphones, blue tooth speakers and cables and cases.
 Sound is basically acceptable - not outstanding.  Control buttons too hard to see and too difficult to push in order to make them work. Needs its' own tone control.
 It's really hard to beat the quality of this speaker in its price range.  Pairing is easy, its quite loud, and it can even handle calls from your phone.<br/><br/>Pros: Battery life is beyond amazing.<br/>  Rubbery shell makes it easy to hold and fairly nonslip<br/>  Constructions feels very sturdy<br/><br/>Cons: Bass is lacking.  It isn't bad, but you aren't going to be listening to metal or dubstep on this speaker.<br/>  Can only pair and remember one device at a time
 I Bought the Anker Classic Speaker on sale last holiday season and I loved it. Never had any issue with it. Great battery life, super clean sound. I picked up two of these on sale this holiday season as I'd been eyeing it for a while. Again, super clean sound, better battery, power button rather than a power switch, roughly the same size although more easily portable than the cubical Anker Classic.
 This is such an awesome product! I have 2 or 3 products from Anker and I love every one of them! They make such great quality stuff at great prices. If you're looking for a speaker that has great bass, this may not be your top choice. But otherwise the sound is so crisp and clear. It's super easy to use and very easy to change between devices. It doesn't take long to charge and the charge lasts a LONG time.
 This is not as good as some of the $100-$300 speakers but you can't beat the bang for the buck with this one.  It's compact enough and sounds really good for Sirrius and Pandora and it lets me have hands free calls on my cell while I'm listing to music.  I like it so well that I'm going to buy one or two more so I can leave one in my motorhome, workshop, golf cart, and wherever I need.  That's what is so good about these, you can afford to have multiples.
 Edited: It broke, the sales sent me a new, upgraded version, which works fine. Will keep updating if it breaks again, but for now all is good<br/><br/>It worked fine for 2 months, but without any damage, all of a sudden, bluetooth system decided to break down.<br/>The blue light is constantly blinking, and does not connect to any bluetooth system, including laptop &amp; phone.<br/><br/>Total waste of money
 I just got this today and put it to use straight away and..... Wow is this the best little thing for the price. I hope it stays this way the the entirety of it's lifetime. Will be charging it for full battery life test but so far great!
 Unsure of buying a speaker but this item has met all of the known and unknown expectations (almost.)  I anticipated it playing a little louder, but this could also have something to do with my Samsung phone.  Overall, very pleased with the product and the price.
 This speaker sounds amazing and goes really loud and distortion free, it's priced amazingly compared to others in the same category, it even has a nice weight and feel to it. When synced with your phone there's a small battery meter in the corner of phone screen so you can see level of speaker battery. I've been using this speaker for about 6 hours and the battery is still completely full. You will not regret this purchase.
 Two words "The Bomb", this speaker is dollar for dollar the best buy I have made in years. Small, compact and brilliant sound! Clear and precise sound quality with acceptable bass. Not on the level of a 200.00 speaker but not far off, and for hundreds less. I use it every day on a school bus loaded with children and it easily cancels them out with volume. And the battery easily last 2 days!
 Not huge in size, but plenty of volume. I had it upstairs and could still hear it downstairs. When I go for walks around the neighborhood, I have to turn down the volume. Not a great option however if your car stereo is broken and like to drive with the windows down. I tried a lot of different genres and love the sound balance they went with. It is $30 though, so if you want to listen to songs with bass focus, it's gonna be flat. Everything else though is solid. The color though has a lot of life, which you'll love or hate. I like it, its great to bring to hang out with friends.
 This speaker is loud and lasts forever. I use it in the bathroom while I shower and when I'm doing work around the house or car. I only have to charge it maybe once every 2 weeks even with the extensive usage. The sound quality is great and it pairs easily with via bluetooth. It also has an AUX so you can use it with anything that doesn't have bluetooth.
 Very good sound volume coming out of such a small sized speaker. The BlueTooth connection works really well, and can go quite a distance. The battery life is exceptionally long, and I can honestly say that it beats much more expensive brands. I actually use this more, and the sound quality is almost just as good as my $300 Bose Soundlink III. Would give it 10 stars if I could!
 Nice little speaker with a crisp sound, not particularly loud, but adequate. The look and feel is solid, the battery lasts forever and syncs effortlessly. I own several other little Bluetooth speakers and this one will hold its own against some of the more expensive ones.
 I use my Samsung tablet primarily as a radio to play news and music through this speaker. It's not a home theater, so don't expect to be blown away, but it has a remarkably good sound considering its compact size. Bluetooth works great.
 Love it, loud for it's size. Sound quality is better than I expected, though I mostly listen to podcasts in my work vehicle.<br/>  Battery life seams good, I do leave it plugged in most of the time. The one time I did run it unplugged it did last a full work day, about 6hr on the road.
 Best blue tooth speaker with crazy long battery life. I have this in my office at work and use it every day. I have one at home for dancing around the house and cleaning. (Because you have to keep your Mom ears available in case your kids need you). I also have one in the garage to use while I’m breakdancing.  .....nah I don’t break dance. BUT if I did, I’d have an ANKER blue tooth speaker with me :)
 Great quality and hold a charge for a very long time. I'm a hair stylist and use this in my salon everyday. I don't even know how long the charge lasts, all I know is I've rarely charged it and it's never dies. The sound is excellent!
 it works good, not getting the range I'd like,tops 25/30 ft..using an anker Bluetooth transmitter, to get music thru TV and using a Bluetooth toggle to get Pandora thru computer that's even worse, have to turn volume WAY up on TV and computer to get good sound on the speaker, have tried different places and heights, nor much improvement, I put it on window sill  16 ft away  it's ok for deck, but still not doing what I purchased it for...-(
 This is a Nice little speaker<br/>Battery runs for my 8hr shift and recharging take about an hours drive home.  Nice sound quality and occasionally I'll pick up on something within new within a song...<br/>Mine mostly plays Rock n Roll
 I have the MP141 and absolutely love it, I take it everywhere. A friend saw it and wanted one, we ordered this instead. This definitely has a more clear sound with more range, seems less bass-y though. Overall, one of the better bluetooth speakers for the price. As I always say, it's not a Bose, but you're paying $40, you are getting very good quality for your money. The buttons on the top are great and battery life is awesome.
 We saw this speaker recommended on a blog we read often. It's a little more expensive than some similar AmazonBasics speakers but I think the 24-hour battery has been worth the little bit of extra money. We use this speaker almost every day. The quality of the sound is good for us. We have been really impressed with how long it can go between charges. It took us a bit to get used to the buttons though, they are covered by the speaker's rubber housing and sometimes you need to hold one down for half a second to get it to respond. We would definitely recommend this speaker to others and have been very satisfied.
 Great sound quality. I replaced my Boss Blu Tooth speaker my Ex got me with this. Sound quality is Amazing for the size. Very clear and Bass is nice too. I listen to R and B, Reggetone, Bachata, Hip Hop, Rock n Roll, Jazz and many other styles of Music just to give tou some info on the overall quality.
 We were very happy with the Anker speaker. We particularly wanted it to use with an MP3 player in the car as our new Honda CRV does not have an Aux input. The speaker has sufficient an clear volume to overcome any road noise. After 7 months, the Aux input stopped working. I contacted Anker Direct customer service through their web site on Saturday and they had delivered a new speaker by the following Tuesday. That was quite impressive.
 This little speaker performs better than I expected. Device pairing is straight forward.  Simply charge the speaker,  turn it on and connect from your device. The sound is great considering the cost and size. People who want hard bass should really look into subwoofers. If you just want your music louder than your phone speaker, you won't regret purchasing this. I haven't used it much, but I'm happy so far.
 I was looking at many different blue tooth speakers.  I love good sound but I also want a speaker that lasts a long time.  I was surprised how loud and great sounding this little speaker is for any price.  The main reason I purchased it was because of the expected battery life of 24 hours.  I haven't tested that out yet but I haven't run out of battery yet on several uses.  Anker makes a good portable battery pack that I have so I knew it was good quality.
 I love this little speaker! It paired easily with my iPhone after just a few clicks. The sound is surprisingly good, it's small enough to put in your purse or stow in your car, and you can raise and lower the volume right on the speaker. I would highly recommend it!
 Great small Bluetooth speaker with a lot of output. Have taken camping, used for Halloween sound effects, and all around general purpose when the cell phone does not output enough sound. No distortion and a good battery life.
 Wonderful sound that has nice bass and clean treble. Had a dud and Anker sent out a new unit, in just two days. Use it with my Apple iPod and Echo Dot-2nd generation. Directions could be lot better, but the unit is mostly intuitive. 24 hour battery is unbelievable in such a compact unit. Great value for the money. Returned the Amazon basic Bluetooth speaker who's sound was weak and tinny. Can't go wrong with the Anker.
 The sound is good and battery life is very good. But I have to constantly "Forget this Device" and "Pair" to connect with my iPhone 6s and iPad Air. This is extremely inconvenient and frustrating.
 Purchased item over 2 years ago and it’s still working as if brand new. This portable speaker has been hiking, beach, cross county and many more adventures. Always bringing good vibes. Definitely purchase. It’s worth the money:)
 This is the best Bluetooth wireless speaker I’ve ever owned.  The sound quality is amazing. I take it with me for long workout sessions outdoors when I need the extra motivation that music provides.<br/><br/>You won’t go wrong buying this speaker.  I took it to a relatives house recently and played them all their favorite oldies and they ended up ordering one themselves.<br/>It’s a great little speaker.  Great value for the money.
 Two years later its still going strong!
 so the first speaker i got from amazon was defective<br/>- it will play sound of a video after 4 seconds and always do that over and over again<br/>- did it on bluetooth n aux connection<br/>The replacement is good so far<br/><br/>UPDATE- Replacement has a power button issue after 2 days of use
 Over the course of the year I've owned this product I've found it to surprise me the more and more I use it. I am a big fan of music and sound quality and this product performs exceptional well with both. I've taken the speaker everywhere with me and have never had problems with it; durable, long battery life, easy to connect. All around a great product.
 Once I got all the cables and attachments I needed, this speaker operates wonderfully.  I'm somewhat hard of hearing, especially in certain frequencies, and besides the closed captioning on the movies I watch, this speaker makes the sound come in beautifully.  I'm not that much into music, but my son says, and I agree, that it produces excellent sound.
 This little speaker packs a punch! Great range, great sound, and excellent battery life.  I listen to it almost every morning for about 20+ minutes while getting ready for work....haven't had to charge it in a couple months.<br/>Haven't tested out HOW far the range goes, but we had the speaker outside during the summer under a covered deck and had the music playing from my phone inside several rooms away.  No interruptions in playback.<br/>Would definitely recommend.
 The DOSS Soundbox  I bought can be viewed here on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CRPV94G/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 As you can see from the photo, the Anker is smaller than the DOSS but to my untrained ear they both have great sound. To me the biggest difference was with the controls. The controls on top of the Anker are made of the same rubbery material as the case - they are just raised. Without looking I can reach out to the Anker &amp; easily, by feel, hit any of these: power on/off, minus sign for volume, plus sign for volume, Bluetooth sync. I'm not a techie. I like reasonably priced, easy to use electronics with clean lines. I was able to use the Anker without looking at the manual but had to check the manual for the DOSS to figure out how to increase &amp; decrease volume. I find the DOSS volume control annoying.  I will give the DOSS to a friend who could use a decent Bluetooth speaker.
 We originally bought this about a year ago and experienced a problem with a slight static sound coming from it. Anker sent out a free replacement to make sure we were taken care of.  The speaker really has good sound quality and doesn't have a problem filling a room with sound for the size of the unit. It holds a good charge and pairs well with our devices.  We appreciate the customer service taking care of us.
 I use it in my hockey locker room before and after every game.  It's loud enough to have a great, fun atmosphere and yet not so loud that we can B.S. with each other.  It's small and compact and fits great in my hockey bag.  I run it dead and then fully charge it.  I haven't had any problems with the battery.  I use it a few times a week and has performed perfectly.
 If you hadn't noted the dimensions of this speaker you might be surprised when you get it...it's small.  Don't let that fool you though, it sounds pretty good.  Not a whole lot of base but it's negligible given the small size.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a solid speaker with a great sound.  Blu tooth connection is a snap...and the charge lasts long.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a decent speaker.
 I'll keep it simple. I am blown away by this speaker. It is a STEAL at $35.99. Your mileage may vary depending on the type of music you like, but I am listening to smooth jazz right now and it just sounds phenomenal. I've played some classic rock, some Texas blues (Stevie Ray), Eagles, Skynrd, and it all sounded great. Exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend the Anker SoundCore.
 I got this for use in my car after the high-tech computer stereo system stopped working. It's almost perfect, and I love how long it holds the charge. My only issue with it is that the function buttons need quite a bit of pressure to work, which is a bit of a continual pain. It's loud enough to fill a regular-sized room, and unless I'm driving next to a semi with my window open, the volume in my car is perfect.
 When I first got mine in the mail, a little over a week ago, I was anticipating something bigger than what I had actually received, that being said, I noticed that what it didn't have in size, it made up for in sound atleast 3 times over. I was checking the different volume settings that the Anker Soundcore was capable of and initially was surprised to find out there had been an option to not only raise the volume through my phone (LG G4), which already fairly loud on it's own already, but that I could also turn up the volume on the speaker itself, which made the speaker even louder! This product actually blew me away, not only with its impressive clarity in sound, powerful bass, light weight design, and durability, but also in its range. This product actually delivered what it promised, in it's capability sound range, long lasting battery, Bluetooth range, adaptability, charging efficiency, and overall qualities! I am very satisfied with this speaker, and I take it with me nearly everywhere I go now, and have recommended to many of my friends! I love this speaker and have absolutely nothing but good things to say about it, during my time spent with it! And at its current price, I highly recommend everyone purchase this product! I know I will!
 Let me start by saying I thought this speaker was going to be substantially bigger than it is. The pictures and design made it seem bigger to me, and I was nervous when I saw that instead of "bigger than a breadbox" it was about the size of a burrito; I was concerned it wouldn't cut it for listening around the house or working outside.<br/>  But just like some burritos I've had in my day, this thing has pleasantly surprised me. The sound is meaty, the volume levels are as high as I hoped (not that it provides an ear-shattering like some people apparently want), and even listening to podcasts I notice the rich vocal tones. Battery lasts longer than expected.<br/><br/>  We use this daily and it has simplified things more than expected. looking forward to using it outside when we host guests on the back patio. I definitely recommend.
 Update: they sent me a cord and the speaker works great. I like the sound and range.<br/><br/>Old review: The box doesn’t look like it has been opened before and all the packaging is there, but the cord isn’t in the box at all. This thing is useless if I can’t charge it.
 So my original device would not turn on, Anker promptly and courteously contacted me to reach a resolution and make things better. They sent me a brand new one again, very quickly as well, and apologized. I understand 100% perfect quality control is impossible so I'm very happy with the customer service. Speaker is amazing!!! Very loud if needed, and battery life is incredible. Was rocky at first but I'm happy with this product.
 I am impressed with the sound that comes out of this little guy. Powerful and loud. While it's not the crystal clear level an audiophile would notice, it's still pretty amazing. Anker is quickly becoming one of my new favorite brands. The speaker has a built in battery which recharges with a microUSB cable, bluetooth, and aux functions.
 We needed an affordable speaker and this fit the bill. Obviously the sound quality isn’t on par with brands such as Bose, but for this price I’m happy. It’s easy to use and easy to carry around. The charge cord is short, it could def use a better charge cord.
 This is a great little portable speaker! Sound is amazing on it and it gets really loud. I probably only have to charge it once a week if that. Battery life is great. Highly recommend this for the price.
 The bluetooth on this speaker ended up giving out on me a couple of weeks after I bought it. It intermittently will accept a stream and will cut out multiple times in a single song. Using the AUX port the speaker works fine. Sound quality is good for the money.<br/><br/>Update 01/14/17<br/><br/>After posting my initial review Anker immediately reached out to me to replace my faulty unit. I have received the new unit and it works perfectly! The sound also seems to be much better on this one. I am impressed by the level of customer service I received. I can't honestly remember another experience like this following a bad initial introduction to a product.
 I have only used this speaker for a short time. I was a bit leary about ordering this because some reviewers said the charging cord didn’t work correctly.  So far no problems. The sound is very good considering it is so inexpensive.
 Tested three speakers.  This one, the Cambridge Soundworks Oontz Angle 3, and the 808 CANZ.  This one was by far the best. The Angle 3 was OK, but not as full and rich of a sound as the Anker.  The 808 got blown away (to be fair -- the 808 is half the price.).<br/><br/>I compared the Anker to a friend's Jawbone.  The Jawbone was a smidge better if you were really looking for the difference, but given how much cheaper the Anker is and how close they tested, I feel really good about my purchase.
 I used to host many backyard BBQs and had large heavy speakers i'd lug around.  Now with this little awesome speaker, I only need this to keep my friends and family entertained. Was impressed with the single charge all day running this device.  Planning on buying another.
 Would like a little more bass, but at this price, this is fantastic. You don't get fine tune controls at this price point. This works great, charges fast, lasts longer than advertised. I highly recommend.
 Guys my speaker lasted 48 hrs and still had half a charge on first use. Used over the course of 8 days while I drive all day. Totally impressed with longevity. I didn't play it full blast but not real low either. Well built unit with good sound I'm sure others sound better but I doubt will last as long on a single charge. New Anker cust. for life! This product was exactly what I was looking for, good sound and batt that will last a work week.

I didn't need radio or even water proof. not heavy at all. easy to pair with my laptop that has bluetooth function.
 This is my 1st review and the only reason I am is that I can't imagine anyone is having the experience I am. I got my speaker on August 17th. After charging it that day, I started using it that day and it ran loud for 7 hours straight. then when I went to bed I used it with my white noise machine over night figuring it would die, nope. now I have run it every night and a lot every day still trying to kill it, nope. Now it is the 25th and it has been running steadily for the last 14 hours and I still haven't seen the red low power light flash. By my estimate, it has run over 40 hours without a charge. If you don't believe it that makes two of us. BTW, it sounds good at high volume too.
 I'm blown away by this speaker. I have Sonos....a Bose speaker....and this is just as good. I purchased it for my office.  I love it. I can't believe the price. You will get your money's worth for sure.
 Well satisfied, thus far. Paired easily and dependably to my S5 Active. Want a question answered, if possible. Can I buy a second one and hook it to my first one with  a 3.5 mm cable. Can I use my first one as the master with the bluetooth connection and count on the second Anker to use the signal from the first, to play the same music?? A master / slave simultaneous set up?? Or am I dreaming of the future??
 This speaker is amazing! Sound is unbelievable and is LOUD! It is a great speaker for the money and is very durable as well! Anker sells great products and I would definitely buy from this company again!
 Battery life is great. Super portable. Great sound quality for the money. Don’t expect heavy bass or anything like that. Only downside is that there’s nowhere to hook on a strap to take it around with you
 I have just received my Anger and am impressed right from the get go. I turned on Bluetooth on my IPhone and it immediately paired to the speaker. I turned the volumn up a little at a time until it was quite loud. There was no distortion of any kind and I still could go higher if need be. It feels like a well made article as it has heft when holding it. I am totally happy with this speaker and would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves distortion free music.
 This thing is awesome, the charge is so long, I've had it for a month and only had to charge 2x and I listen to it at least 2 hours a day on the weekdays and probably 6 on the weekends. It's very small and can get very loud.<br/>The only downgrade to the 4 stars is because the sound only goes in one direction (my friend has another brand of speaker that is 360 and the sound is much fuller). But I knew that going in and for the price I can't really complain
 I bought this speaker to put on my motorcycle. It has great sound and amazing battery life! If I had to complain about anything, I wish it had a little more volume. That being said, the volume for regular use is great, I just have loud exhaust on my motorcycle. I would and have recommended this speaker too others. You will not find a better speaker / sound for the price, and will not be disappointed by this great little speaker!
 I've had this speaker for a while now and I've basically stopped using it. The audio cuts out pretty frequently for no reason at all and it's just too annoying. I expected better from an anker product.
 I've had a few Bluetooth speakers in the past and they had fairly poor quality and low max volume sound. I'm just a bit hard of hearing and these just fit the bill for loud, excellent sound for their size, not to mention highly portable and good quality construction. I'm thoroughly enjoying some great music while decorating a Christmas tree. And for the Black Friday price? Oh my! Great value either way.
 Wonderful customer service.  I received a defective one that went silent out of nowhere.  Troubleshooting made no difference.  I emailed anker support about the problem.  They needed pics of order and serial number, confirmed it was defective.  They immediately sent a new one and told me to dispose of the old one.  New one works great!  Love it, high quality sound, and like I said, great customer support.
 Bought this for my Mom.<br/>Distortion is awful.<br/>We tried listening to radio stations and music/mp3s.<br/>Everything sounds terrible on this speaker.<br/>I don't understand all the good reviews.<br/>Shouldn't have shopped so early for Christmas.<br/>Return window is closed.<br/>We will just throw it away.<br/>*UPDATE<br/>The vendor sent me a new speaker  after reading my review and it sounds much better.<br/>It is still difficult to pair, but the new speaker they sent  is much improved over the original.
 This battery literally lasted me at least 4 months off of one charge and I used the speaker every single day for at least 2 hours. It didn't make any kind of sense. Best battery I've ever seen/used. I am still amazed. Probably only will have to charge this bad boy twice a year at most. Seriously, I am  not affiliated with the company at all but i just felt compelled to write a review off the battery quality alone. They should power cars off of this things battery. The sound quality is good. Bluetooth range isn't that far but the battery is just A1
 With the exception of my son's older i-pad, it has connected to everything I've tried with bluetooth.  The sound is great and the battery life is very very long. Nice size to just grab on the way out the door and connect with phone or other devices while working outside or just doing the dishes.
 I have been very pleased with all my Ankernproducts, and this is no exception. Sound quality is excellent, and it is very easy to use. Occasionally the light will keep blinking, and I'll have to have my phone "forget" the speaker and re-pair it, --usually if I pair it to a different device, afterwards this is the case-- but this has been the case with most device pairing in my experience. Most of the time, it works seamlessly and automatically pairs to the previously used device. Battery lasts a long time!
 This speaker is exactly what i was looking for.  Very easy to connect via bluetooth and very well constructed.  Doesn't feel cheap.  Sure the sound isn't going to blow you away....but for the price you can't beat it!
 I love this speaker. I had one once before and it was stolen so I had to buy another. Surprising volume and boom out of this small speaker. Bluetooth setup is quick and easy. Buttons are on the top so you just need one hand to operate as opposed to other speakers that have their controls somewhere on the sides. The reason I bought this speaker the first time is because I bought an Anker usb type C car charger for my phone. It wasn't advertised as quick charging but it did and I was pleasantly surprised.
 My previous wireless speaker lost its ability to carry a charge. Though I liked the speaker (Nakamichi BTSP-70) and its price, this Anker SoundCore is in a completely different league! The charge for this speaker seemingly lasts forever! Silly to say, but I have yet (after several months), to have the "needs' charging" indicator come on. It doesn't mean the charge has lasted that long. It's just that after days of listening, I get paranoid and just plug in the charger until the red light goes off. The sound (I am no audiophile so don't go by my ears!) is sharp and clear. Overall, this inexpensive wireless speaker is a super bargain!<br/><br/>update: So I believed that I had discovered a flaw in the unit. It began randomly beeping. The Anker tech support emails straightened me out by letting me know that it will intermittently beep when it's nearing the end of the charge. It does take a while to get to that place with this<br/> speaker since it seems to hold the full charge for many hours! And what I especially like is that their tech support was fully ready to stand behind their product, offering a replacement if I weren't satisfied. To me, that says volumes about a company that I would like to support.<br/><br/>Update of the update: About seven months into using the Sound Core, the battery life went "blooey!" Anker's response, it's under warranty, a replacement unit is on the way. So how 'bout 6 stars?!!
 I bought the Anker red speaker - loved it for about 3 months, listened to it every day, bluetooth function worked great, decent sound and volume quality, and then a few weeks ago, it stopped working!  Not sure why -- I didn't drop it or anything.  I took it camping but not sure why or how that would affect anything?  I charge it, the red light goes on, but it does not turn on at all.... I push and push the "on" button and nothing.  Needless to say I'm very disappointed that I only got to enjoy it for about 3 months.  it's a pity because I was really happy with my purchase and thought I got a great deal for the good price, but alas, it is now completely useless.
 Generally underwhelming, does not get very loud nor is it made very well. Battery life was maybe 2 hours tops
 I brought the speaker to use it work and the back of a restaurant sound is okay but if there's other noises going on the sound quality is not that strong an empty room it's just you sound qualities okay the battery life goes a long time But needs a stronger speaker put in it
 I am a massage therapist and I needed a small, portable speaker to carry with me when I do house calls. There are so many choices on Amazon that it was confusing and it took me a while to decide which one to choose but I finally decided on the Anker SoundCore. I am very happy with the purchase. i don't know that much about sound quality but it sounds great to me. It's a big improvement over my last bluetooth speaker. And I bought the case to protect it from being bashed around. Thumbs Up!!
 I never do reviews on here but this product is amazing for the price,the sound quality is good and has full range with nice highs and decent bass,where it really shines is the amazing battery life,they claim 24hrs but it was still going after week of daily use,even played it overnight at low volume 5 nights for 8hrs,at low to mid volume I feel this will go for at least 40hrs,blows away the Altec Lansing mini h20 I had previously which sells for more in every way,highly recommend...
 Great sounding device. It has some weight to it, so you know the construction is good. The soft matte exterior material feels nice but it will get dirty very fast if oily figures touches it.<br/><br/>The sound is full and it doesn't strain at max volume. Plus it has a little low end to enjoy.
 Pleased with the results of what might have seemed to be an inexpensive speaker. I use Bluetooth to play music and podcasts from my echo throughout the house, and the speaker range is really impressive with very little chance to lost connections. The sound volume is nice and has been as good as the Bose my friend has for outdoor play.
 This little speaker is working great for me. No battery life issues, I have used it outside and it has gotten wet from heavy dew, not been exposed to rain. All around I have used it inside and out.
 This little speaker continues to amaze me. Anker hit it out of the park with this design! The body of the speaker is solidly built and the battery feels like it goes forever. I use it weekly, for 2 or 3 hours at a time. I've still not had to charge the battery even though it's been almost two months! The buttons are firm and easy to use. In my opinion the sound is very good for a speaker of this small size. Anker is thoughtful about their packaging and includes clear instructions that are easily followed. I use this speaker with my Samsung Galaxy S7, it paired quickly and easily.
 Bought this as a prime day deal.  Speaker was loud and sounded great but lasted only one charge and won't turn.  I've contact customer service but I have little hope.  Speaker was barely 2 weeks old before it died.  Otherwise size was perfect.<br/><br/>**Update** After the review and contacting customer service , the speaker was replaced and so far it is working good.  Time will tell but the customer service is really good.  They sent me a new speaker right out and received it in 2 days.  Only give it a 3 star cause the firat speaker shouldn't have died in a week but their customer is amazing.
 Decent sound for what you get. Love anker products, but have a UE boom and it's sound is 10x better (but also 5-8x the retail price). If I had to choose between the two, I'd take the UE even for more Bc quality is way better and Bluetooth speaker is not exactly something I need multiples of, just one really good one!
 Very impressed with the quality of this little unit.  It won't blow you away with sound but it's comparable (if not better) than the Echo.  It will definitely be used around the house (kids music, pod casts, yard music) and we may even take it on trips with us. The biggest surprise is the size: it's really small! I didn't read the size specs when ordering because I didn't care, but wow is this thing tiny for what it puts out.
 OK...I am Impressed.  After looking through many reviews, I bought this because I had very little to loose.  Being used to listening to a nice stereo, when High Fidelity actually meant something, not just speakers for a home theater, I was very critical.  The Bluetooth speaker's that I listened to, on display at big box stores seemed like they almost all had just a ridiculous amount of bass or hollow treble to fit some of today's music.  I have to admit that I finally settled on this mostly because of the price.  I am glad I did.  It surpassed my expectations, right out of the box.
 Terrific Bluetooth speaker, I like the sound quality and the auto switching to hands free phone calls. An incoming call pauses the music, tap the phone to answer and talk/listen thru the Anker speaker. When finished, the music resumes. Very convenient.<br/>I also have to commend Anker for outstanding customer support!! After enjoying the Anker daily for a month, the 3.5mm input jack became loose and would not connect. I emailed Support and their response was very quick. After recommending basic troubleshooting,  they said to return the Anger and emailed a shipping label. When I mailed the unit and it scanned, they shipped a replacement. Communication was at every step and very cordial. Actually a surprising level of service for a $30 speaker.<br/>I will be back. Thanks Anker!!
 I was very skeptical about this small, little speaker performing well. But it surprised me by being having a great build quality and clear sound. Only two gripes with it: one is that their is very little bass on most songs, and second is that it does not have a carrying case or sleeve like Anker's other products. But other then those small gripes, I would purchase it again, maybe even spend a little more and get the Anker Premium Speaker.
 This is my first bluetooth speaker and I am very happy with it. It's dead simple to use and the sound quality is excellent. I like the grippy cover on it. I had a moment of frustration with it in terms of pairing multiple devices. I mainly use it with my iPod nano but recently paired my iPhone with it. When I went back to try my nano, it wouldn't pair...I had to Forget the SoundCore on my nano and reconnect it. Slightly annoying but no big deal. Highly recommended...
 For an office or dorm, fantastic. Mobility is gonna depend on user as it doesn’t have a case however I’ve never had an issue and it’s travelled in my backpack. Nice battery saving feature it will auto shutoff if not promoted over a certain period of time so if you want to sleep with it on you won’t wake up to a dead device.
 Absolute trash. Seriously do not buy. Started getting staticy after about a month. Now wont connect to my echo dot at all. Do not buy. I am a real person who paid with there own hard earned money.
 I had a few issues with my Souodcore, but very shortly after leaving a 1 star review I was contacted by Anker directly to make it right.<br/>Wonderful customer service!  Above and beyond my expectations!  If I could give Anker 10 stars I would!<br/>Thank you Anker!
 Ok so I saw the sele and I've been looking for a little travel speaker to play toons and enjoy some quality music. I was sceptical at first just how great they could actually be.... I was blown away. They are very loud and have decent base and for the price you cannot go wrong. These are perfect for the beach or backyard BBQ with some nice background music. I would buy these again.
 Good enough loudness and a great Bluetooth receiver.  I can use it anywhere in my apartment.  If you need more loudness, they make higher powered versions at some cost to the battery life.  A solidly constructed product.  These people are great engineers.  I like their USB chargers also.
 This is amazing , the sound is very clear , I absolutely love my Anker Bluetooth speaker. I highly recommend this product
 Maybe I just don't use my speaker a ton - but I'm really amazed at how long the battery lasts!<br/>Good value overall - I can't really speak much to sound quality, but I mean sounds great to me and at a great price.
 I bought the Anker SoundCore specifically for my Echo Dot.  At first it worked well, but after a few days I noticed that it kept disconnecting from the Dot and would not reconnect.  When I tried to connect it through my iPhone, it still wouldn't connect.  I was planning  on returning it to Amazon when I figured I'd try one more time to reconnect - and it worked!  After some trial and error, I figured out that I was leaving the speaker on constantly (plugged in) and it would disconnect when it got hot.  Once I let it cool down it would connect immediately.  Now I turn it off when I'm not using it and it works and connects perfectly.
 This was a gift for my husband. Hes a mechanic and uses his phone to listen to music at work. He absolutely loves this. Its small and fits on top of toolbox, and produces some great sound. His co workers really like it and had a hardtime finding where music was coming from at first because of size.
 I love this box. Works great with my Alexa and my phone. The range is good and battery life is exceptional. I use it everyday for hours and never had a single issue. The low battery tone threw me off because it's so subtle and gentle; it does not even interrupt me while listening to music. A great buy and I'd totally buy another as a gift for someone.
 At first I was effy about getting this speaker because of all the reviews I had read it. I was looking at a whole bunch of them here on Amazon, and I decided to go with the Anker Sound Core. BADASS little speaker for the price! I am completely happy with it. It's loud, well built, and connects to my phone every time it comes on. Its pretty awesome. I would recommend it.
 This product (so far) delivers everything it promises. Easy pairing to both my phone and Alexa and works out on my deck. Though my neighbors probably aren’t fans I’m respectful and only play at low volumes and stop before 8 pm. Totally worth it so far and just day 1!!!!
 I got the black speaker. It looks nice, is small enough to be easy to carry around, and is sturdy.  The battery life is unreal! I honestly can't remember the last time I charged it and I use it every day- usually for at least an hour or two.
 Ive used LG phone for the past few years and knew I was missing out on good speakers but I never could make the jump and buy a speaker.<br/>I figured I wouldnt make THAT much use of one. How wrong, wrong I was.  I am constantly using this speaker. On my laptop when watching videos, on my phone when socializing, friends take turns during kickbacks. I was seriously missing out.<br/><br/>Not to even freaking mention the customer service. I'll spare the details but I want to stress that they value you and will help you if you reach out.
 Smaller than I thought it would be...which is good. It sounds pretty good overall, seems like it's equalized pretty good, but I'm critical on sound. Yes you will get better for more money, but that jump up to the next better, is big! Totally worth it. Buy it, don't doubt it
 I like it because it's cheap and loud for the Price I brought it because my sony speaker kept turning off after I turn the volume up a certain level.. however I'm probably going to buy a better speaker with better base but I'm going to keep this as my pocket speaker<br/>Update: I had it for about 2 and idk why but every time I connect to it and listen to music on full volume it shuts off even on fully charged hope... kinda disappointing cause I liked it
 Bluetooth won’t connect anymore to my phone
 Very impressed!  I wasn't sure what to expect from reading the reviews as to sound quality...one person said there was no bass.  After a few days I can attest to a very adequate sound quality.  Plenty of volume or power.  Pairs easily.  Solid construction.  One improvement could be to offer a heavy duty cloth or nylon bag to carry it in for travel.
 Customer service to maker is awesome.  My original on had a bad on/off switch so contacted anker and they replaced it without hesitation.  Smooth and easy.<br/>The only thing I wish they would do is go back to their previous version. The older one you could control the volume and it wouldn’t simply adjust your phone volume. Now as it is Bluetooth synced...the phone volume gets tweaked when you turn up/down the speaker.
 I like Anker very much and have bought baby of their products. This one, however falls short. After 3 days of use, it no longer will charge. I hope to be contacted by the company, I will update as this progresses. Great response so far.
 This small speaker has BIG sound! It was so easy to connect to Alexa Echo and my phone. As soon as I turn the speaker on, Alexa connects. So easy and such good quality. The pic is the speaker on top of my Alexa!
 They claimed 24-hr battery life that's why I decided to purchase this Bluetooth speaker.  Yes, they're true to their promise.  This speaker has a long battery life which is awesome!  I only charged it once when I first got it.  After that I've been using it and I haven't charged it again.  This speaker exceed my expectation so I decided to write a review.  My overall rating for this product should be 5-star for long battery life, but I didn't like the ANKER name printed in-front so I'm giving it a 4-star.  Honestly, I wanted to get another one but the print in-front of the speaker stopped me.
 Can't go wrong with Amazon's Bestsellers! I relied upon that rating and was not disappointed. I've had friends that commented on the sound which made me feel good. May not be the most expensive, but dollar for dollar this speaker definitely puts out great sound and is worth the price.
 I purchased this item to replace an Oontz Angle speaker. The Oontz speaker was a quality product that I enjoyed tremendously, but it doesn't hold a candle to the Anker SpundCore.<br/><br/>For such a portable speaker (not much larger than a laptop power supply), the volume is impressive. I haven't had to turn it up more than about 60% of the way to maximum, and I live in a busy downtown area.  Even better, the sound is rich and well balanced. I've definitely paid a lot more for a lot less in the past.<br/><br/>That the battery life is literally triple that of most of its competitors certainly doesn't hurt.<br/><br/>This speaker has become my new favorite in a matter of days. You can't go wrong with the Anker SoundCore.
 I love this little speaker. It's my second one...my daughter took off with my first one. Pairs easily and sounds really good for such a small device. Yeah, some people will complain about the bass or the loudness, but c'mon, it wasn't designed or priced to be audiophile quality. I listen to mostly jazz on it and at medium volumes, it performs well. Even better, I got it on sale...
 Absolutely fantastic Bluetooth speaker for the price! Today I just ran into an issue were it will not turn on on a full charge. It only turns on being plugged in. However despite it being on and working the little sub inside got busted. The audio still sounds perfect but any bass sounds like a crackling noise. Upon discovering this I called Anker and without and issues they are sending me a new one within 3-5 days free of charge. I've purchased many different Anker products and love every one of them. The company is top of the line!
 Only thing holding this back is battery life. I also have an Aomais Bluetooth speaker that lasts significantly longer. But the Aomais doesn't look as slick as this one. Sounds good too. I have it at work to listen to tunes, while the Aomais stays home as my shower speaker
 I bought this speaker to make music from my alexa louder and this was perfect for it. Good sound and east to connect. I would definitely buy again.
 This speaker is a great value. I use it in my garage. I’ve never ran the charge out even after 3 hrs of continuous use at a moderate volume. Never used it for any other purpose than music so I can’t comment on other features.
 I have had this speaker for over a year now maybe even more. I use this speaker ALL the time and I rarely have to charge it! The battery life is so good and has remained the same since I got it. The sound quality is also good! I have also gotten the speaker a bit wet a couple of times and it was still okay. It has survived many drops, falls and hot/cold temperatures. Love this little thing so much it’s been through everything.
 I'm not an audiophile so this is definitely fine for me. I liked it so much I bought one for my brother who is an audiophile and he likes it as well.<br/><br/>Battery has a great amount of life in it and it is easy to set-up and use between devices. The iPad needs to have its BT turned on and off to connect but that is a problem with the ipad and not the speaker.<br/><br/>Fantastic product. I've had mine for 8 months or so.
 I LOVE Anker products (normally), this time JBL has them beat. I have ANKER cables, home chargers and car chargers. See my name to see what I mean with my JBL FLIP 4.
 A am very pleased with the sound quality and battery kife. It works as advertised. I own a JBL Flip 2 speaker. When i do a blind sound test i cannot hear a difference. I had to replace the JBL after 18 months beacuse the USB connection failed. I use this speaker daily and i could not be happier. The true test will be in a year from now to see if the battery life is still strong and if the USB connection still works.
 Awesome speaker. It has great battery life. It's never died on me using it a few hours each day and I charged it maybe once a week or week and and a half, mostly out of "sure why not, it's been a while" more so than it dying on me. The sound is pretty good for it's size. I've never had it be too quiet in situations I've used it in, whether outside or inside. The only think that it lacks to my knowledge is a way to skip a song using the speaker instead of my device. It only has play/pause, volume, bluetooth, and power buttons on top. Unless there is a secret non-intuitive way or combination to do it that I haven't figured out yet. I would recommend this product to anyone though!
 Had a problem with the volume control, so I called customer service and spoke to Genae, a very pleasant lady with an excellent phone presence.  Without any hesitation she sent me another Sound Core, as well as a return mailing label for the original .  I received the new device the following morning and had it up and working within 22 hours of my phone call.<br/>How can you beat that.  I knocked one point off because of the volume control malfunction ,  otherwise I love the product and highly recommend it.
 As usual, Anker makes a great product. The battery life on this thing is amazing! I'm so used to having to plug in my bluetooth speakers every hour, but not this one! It lasts forever.<br/>I recommend all Anker products. Their lightning and microUSB cables, and SoundBuds Curve bluetooth earbuds.
 I was really surprised by the quality of sound that came out of this little speaker. Sounds FANTABULOUS!! I am extremely happy with my purchase! If yo want something small that gets great sound buy this little piece of greatness!!
 Love this speaker!! Long battery life, great sound and volume. Very happy with this purchase.
 Very natural sound with bass and timbre greater than its size would indicate. Can connect either via BT or male-to-male cable. Long battery life, but whether it lasts 24 hours I don't know, haven't tried. Only complaint is that it seems to lose pairing with my phone once in awhile (hence four stars, not five), which is annoying, although I have always re-paired it easily. Delivery from Amazon was stellar as usual. I definitely would buy again.
 Took a few tries to understand installation after plugging the Anker SoundCore into a usb power source.  When you power up the Anker SoundCore, hold down the power button long enough to hear 3 ascending beep tones (unit is now ON).  On first attempt at pairing the speaker to your device (phone, tablet, etc.), press and release the bluetooth button on the speaker, then initiate a bluetooth scan on your device (phone, tablet, etc.). Select the Anker SoundCore entry in your device bluetooth scan results to connect speaker and device wirelessly. (Listen for two beeps indicating that the speaker paired successfully to your device. To save battery life when the speaker is not in use, hold down its power button long enough to hear the descending beep tones (unit is now OFF).
 I am not impressed with the the sound quality of this speaker.  But you know you get what you pay for. Cheap price extra cheap speaker. It does however connects very easily to Bluetooth device.
 Truly sounds great for the price.  Replacing an Oontz angle and I am very satisfied.  The Oontz always took a bit of fidgeting with EQ settings to get a sound I was only partly happy with. This sounds much better out of the box.  Obviously not a lot of low end, but midrange and highs are surprisingly good for something this size.
 We bring this everywhere with us! The beach, the backyard, park, or just cleaning around the house. Battery has never died on us, and will turn off on its own if not connected to any bluetooth. Easy to use and loud! Nice bass too.
 Great sounding speaker! Wasn't expecting much from a speaker less than $40, but this speaker goes above and beyond. It is super light in weight, so easy to just throw in a backpack or store in a gym bag. Also this speaker is extremely easy to setup, one push to turn on and one push to connect to your phone. I would much rather have a speaker like this that has great quality and at a low price; rather than the fancy ones that are $200+ and you're paying for the name. Definitely recommend for all people to have a speaker like this. Convenient. Low Price. Great Sound!
 This thing is excellent. I use it daily for dance offs with the kids, listening to podcasts, or music while I’m doing dishes or in the shower. The music sounds good, it can be loud enough to hear throughout my house (which is fairly small, but still), and it pairs quickly and easily to my phone. I bought this almost a year ago (11 months exactly) and today it started making a beeping noise I’d never heard before. Turns out, it needs to be charged. I’ve never, in 11 months, charged this thing since the day I bought it. Of course the downfall is that I have no idea where the charger is anymore, but I’m still so impressed! This is a great product!
 It worked really well for the first week.  Great sound considering its small size.  Unfortunately, it died after only a few uses approximately two weeks after purchase (won't connect to devices- troubleshooting hasn't fixed the problem).
 When i recieved this product  i wasnt expecting it to be as loud and clear as it is. I LOVE THIS SPEAKER!!!! I work in an assembly warehouse with a lot of noise and other radios and speakers  playing in the background all day. I have had several of my fellow employees ask me where i got this speaker and a few have even purchased for themselves.
 We have a bit of trouble getting this to swap between 2 iOS devices and have to forget and re-pair it often when we swap, but otherwise it's great and that might be an iOS problem, it's hard to say.<br/><br/>The battery life, sound quality, range and volume are all excellent.<br/><br/>Edit 6 months later: It still randomly unpairs and is a pain to repair.
 This speaker cost less than most of my supposedly high quality large speakers and I’ve yet to find anything with as good quality. It’s small and portable, and if you wakes in a room with this playing, you’d think you had a sizable speaker in the room. I worked at a summer camp and school program and used it every day full blast and I’ve only had to charge it like 3 times in 10 months. For 30 bucks you cannot beat it with anything else. Highly recommended!!!!!!
 When the speaker arrived I took one look at the size of the box and said to my daughter "No way! This will be going back." This speaker is small (6 1/2" x 2" x 2"), but the saying 'Don't judge a book by it's cover' definitely applies here. WOW! Great sound! I am actually thinking about ordering another one.
 Has many good qualities, such as a solid build quality and attractive minimalist design. However, when connected to bluetooth, the sound quality can be poor. I believe my expectations are realistic for such a small speaker, as I have used a number of small speakers in the past. In fact, the overall tonal quality and the bass capabilities are adequate, even good, for a speaker of this size and price. However, what is not acceptable is that the sound can degenerate to an uneven, wavy, muffled, under-water sound when linked by bluetooth. I am hoping that perhaps the Anker Team  is there such a thing?] can reach out to me and give me some help with this disappointing aspect of their product. Otherwise, I probably will have to return the cute little thing.
 One of the best purchases I've made! Great sound quality and very convenient. It's a treat to use as I'm sewing so I can listen to music. Looking forward to using audiobooks with it! Great battery life too! You'll love it and it's from a great company!
 I ordered this speaker because I don't have anything upstairs and my poor iPhone can only do so much. A blue tooth speaker has been on my radar for at least the last six months. I played with demos at all the big stores and I am not up for a 200$+ cost for a small speaker. I wanted something budget-wise but also a good performer. I not only met, but exceeded my expectations on this little gem. Not only did I score it on a flash deal, but I tested it immediately upon receiving it and totally melted. Wish I had bought at least two now. Well worth the investment! I knew I was possibly taking a risk with a less known brand, but felt it was going to be a good gamble based on price point and review feedback. I was right and this is one of the most shrewd investments of entertainment I have made. Great value. If you are looking for a great performer, budget friendly, and an excellent quality item then I would strongly recommend this product. I pray it lasts forever. Two thumbs up all the way!!
 -Signal distance seems to be lacking, sound cuts out on occasion or makes static etc.<br/>-Sounds great when it's not losing signal or occasionally tripping up.<br/>-As it is a single speaker, volume and quality will suffer in a big or noisy environment such as a restaurant kitchen.<br/>-Bring the party with you yoooooo.
 I was not pleased with the Anker Soundcore Bluetooth Speaker I purchased. I saw a Video online that stated that the item would be one of the best sounding speakers around. Now, I realize that in order to have a great speaker I Will have to shell out big bucks but this was inexpensive. However, it didn't sound all that great and although the sound was fairly clear it still wasn't really all that good. The Bass was terrible though. I don't need for my speakers to bounce but I do need at least mediocre sounding Bass .
 For the price, this is a pretty nice portable speaker. We brought it to the lake for our family BBQ recently and the sound quality was great, even outdoors.<br/><br/>It is very easy to use and has only a few simple buttons on it. Also, you can control the volume from an iPhone (not sure about other phones?) if that is the device you are listening from.
 This is one amazing little bluetooth speaker! It boasts great sound for its size. I love the fact that all of the controls are recessed under the housing, and that the speakers and subwoofer are protected behind a metal grille. I can throw this in my bag and not have to worry about it turning on accidentally or the speakers getting damaged during transport. The battery life is amazing. Three weeks and it's only at 50%! A steal for the price.
 This is an excellent loud speaker, and a great price.  Don't be deterred by only 6 watts, this speaker is quite loud for only being 6 watts, and provides great sound.<br/><br/>Job well done Anker, job well done.
 Update- Anker customer service saw my review and contacted me.  They sent me a replacement speaker and it is working well.  Great customer service.<br/><br/>It worked great for about 7 months then just suddenly stopped.  It was only used 1 or 2 times a week so I am not happy with it's short life.
 I admit failing to note the size of this speaker prior to ordering and was a bit let down by how "dinky" it is. However, I charged it up, played some music and was pretty happy with the sound volume and quality.
 really good inexpensive speaker.  Paired with Amazon Dot, provides good range for music and excellent clarity for news and podcasts. Very portable. Bluetooth is easy to use.  Good to use with iPhone and iPad, too.
 Bought this item primarily to link with a projector for teaching classes for up to 16 students.  It works very well for that.  We have also found out that it is a great speaker for the blue tooth devices and smart phones as well.  It does not play at the loudest levels that some people seem to enjoy but it plays loud enough for a room.  I have yet to run it for 24 hours off of the battery but it has worked just fine for multiple classes followed by hours of music and/or movies.
 LOVE LOVE LOVE this speaker! The sound quality is great, signal is strong, lightweight, and compact. This is a speaker you could easily throw in a backpack for camping, or a bag for the beach. You could use this for any speaker needs!
 Bought for mom.  She loves having it and it's facilitated more music-listening, but (1) controls are difficult to perceive with eye as icons are not in contrast color (2) also difficult to perceive with touch and (3) no indicator on the speaker telling you how depleted the battery is. The icon that appears on paired tablet is very tiny.
 I've been using this primarily in my kitchen and it's been absolutely great. The sound is clear and good quality, so far I've only charged it once. Not because it really needed it but because I'd been using it for awhile and didn't want it to die on me. It's easy to control the volume from my phone, and the bluetooth signal identifies itself as Anker SoundCore so it's super easy to pair with your device. The only problem I've had with it, really, is having re-pair each device if I want to switch devices, a feature I use rarely enough to remember the proper procedure but frequently enough to find it annoying. Otherwise it's a great speaker for it's price!
 Works great, louder and clearer sound than I expected. Battery seems to be long lasting I've had it a month and use it in the bathroom in the mornings and the deck in the evenings and haven't had to charge other than the initial charge when I received it.
 I am very pleased with the speakers I purchased recently. The sound is robust. I particularly like their low profile and overall attractiveness.  I use them connected via Bluetooth to my Echo Dot but am sure that I will also use them with other devices. I also purchased an Anker 2-port battery pack which will power both my Dot &amp; the speaker, making it all totally portable.
 Other than the fact that I need reading glasses to see the buttons on top, I haven't had much trouble connecting it to my phone to play music.  It charges fairly quickly and has retained its charge for as long as I have desired to play music through it.
 I bought this to use it for conf calls and listen to music . But its not a good product to be used with the mobile for conf calls as the Mic is not very good . also when its connected to the Speaker , cannot switch to VOIP apps as it does not work . Not happy wiht the purchase . Cheap price , less than good product .
 This has been great. I purchased it on a whim, and I'm very happy I did. I've had it for over a week and use it often. The audio quality is nicer than expected for a small Bluetooth device. I have no idea how long the battery lasts - I plug it in occasionally and the battery hasn't even gotten low yet. The "play" button on top doesn't seem to work with my laptop or cell phone, but I don't really care about that. There are too many factors and zero incentive for me to try to figure that out.
 I originally purchased this speaker to have a Bluetooth speaker in the bathroom while I shower. This product exceeded my expectations! It is very loud with a great sound quality! Definitely was not expecting the quality of this speaker to match that of an iHome! My tablet pairs seamlessly and is so easy to use. Have had zero issues of lag or loss of connection since buying this 2 months ago. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a small, compact, yet durable speaker. Perfect for anyone who wants to play music in a house or apartment. Very loud and great quality of sound!
 Update: one year since I bought it and no issues! Wroks beautifully and sound quality is pretty good for the price!<br/><br/>I use this speaker above my bed at night and I barely need to charge it which is nice. I charge it every couple of days and I never had it stop working. I love that you can carry it around, which is nice and the sound quality is pretty good!
 This is an absolute top notch unit for the price. First off charge this thing and then use it for a week without needing another power source! Seriously, the thing lasts forever. The reproduction of sound audio quality is very good even at maximum volume. Its stylish and the perfect size for just about anything. Well worth the price.
 Great sounding speaker for the price.  It has a very very long charge.  I use it at work and can make it through an entire week listening to it for 4-5 hours a day.  I like Anker products and this speaker definitely lives up to the Anker name.  I have recommended this to all my co-workers that are interested in a Bluetooth speaker.  The speaker and my phone connect quickly and seamlessly each time they connect.
 Overall this is another great product from Anker. Everything looks great from the packaging to the product finish, the speaker feels solid and the build quality is better than many portable speakers in the market being sold for over twice as much.<br/><br/>Given the size of the speaker I was not expecting much bass response, but I was pleasently surprised, bass and mids are clear and very loud for such a tiny speaker. The highs feel a bit muddy, I think there's room for improvement there...<br/><br/>If you're looking for an ultra portable Bluetooth speaker with decent sound quality that you can take anywhere at a great price this is the way to go.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Just 13 months after owning and not giving it considerable use, it has stopped working. No matter how long I charge it it will turn off when volume hits ~75% percent. I’m disappointed it has lasted so little. I really hope all other anker speakers I own last longer than this one.
 An absolute treat to use easy set up, short cut commands out the wazoo ( answer phone calls, send calls to voice mail, and more!) And it's a tough little guy, super long battery life, Great sound quality and bass for the price range. All in all I'm elated with my purchase of this lil man and I'd say if your looking for a cheap blu tooth speaker you can't go wrong with this one. My only complaint is the buttons on top are the same color as the box which can make it a pain to see at night. I hit them with a white paint pen, you could also use some glow in the dark paint. Other than that nothing to complain about.
 The speaker itself is nice. The battery life is also good. But I can’t be 4 ft away from the speaker without it cutting out completely. The sound quality is terrible. What’s the point of having it on Bluetooth if I can’t do something a few feet away without leaving my phone right next to the speaker? My advice- buy from a different seller.
 Does what it's supposed to do and does it very well.  I charged this up a few weeks ago and have been using it at work at a low volume off and on since and it's still going.  I'm not sure how many hours it's been on exactly, but it has lasted longer than I expected on a single charge.  Plus, I really love the color.
 Well, my wife LOVES it, I was pretty excited about getting this for her, I knew she wanted it, even if she didn't! Women right? Been with my wife for 30 years, she'd been using her IPhone 6+ to listen to her softer music while in our rather large backyard, and she doesn't hear that well anyway, so on my birthday I bought it for her, the next weekend all she did was gush on and on about how she just "love my new speaker, no you don't understand!" Lol, yes, yes I do.<br/>  I have Anker other things and they are always top shelve, bleeding edge quality as far as I am concerned. This little powerhouse is no different, I read a couple reviews and thought it was a little pricey, but you get what you pay for, it's solid solid solid, sounds bigger then it is.<br/>  Told my wife it'll prolly take a few hours to sound better, told her after and hour of easy levels, to push it hard, she did and now three weeks later, it's finally breaking in and sounds even better, need to get those surrounds broken in, and the speaker flex themselves need to stretch out to reproduce the sound.<br/>  So after about 4-6hrs of real pushing it'll sound even better and you won't be let down, battery last her all day too! Great Anker product.
 I LOVE this speaker. Nothing is anywhere close to the quality in at this price point. I've paid a lot more for speakers that aren't 1/2 as good. The battery is amazing!!! I got it in March and use it several hours per week, at the end of May I began to wonder if my teenagers were secretly charging it for me, like that could ever happen. Maybe there's plutonium in the battery, LOL. The other thing is the speaker, of course. Those other speakers I mentioned...didn't sound better thank my phone speaker &amp; they blew out if you wanted them to be any louder than your phone. This is definitely the best speaker at an affordable price out there!
 Very portable. Nice size &amp; weight. Great sound quality with bass. Lasts fir several hours, although have not ran until out of battery. Charges quickly. Great price &amp; fast delivery.
 I use this in my car with my phone via bluetooth. It works wonderfully! The sound is better than anything through the car's system and everyone says I sound clear &amp; not like I'm in a tunnel. I have several throughout the house for use with our echo dots but bought one specifically for use in the car with my phone. Great sound and great product. Battery ladsts a llong time too!
 Only had it for a few hours, so there is of course time for something to go wrong, but the sound is as awesome as described. I've been using a crappy older clock radio blue tooth speaker and this is light years better. Taking less than a minute to set up was an added bonus. I always love when something exceeds expectations. All the stars!
 It worked great, loved the sound, until it died after about a year. :-( I'm editing my review. After posting that my little speaker had died, Anker voluntarily contacted me and offered to send a new one! I'm changing my rating to reflect what I really though of the speaker. Thanks, Anker! Made my day!
 Very good sound for a speaker of this size and price. Feels heavy and is simple to use. I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it for anyone looking for an inexpensive blue tooth speaker.
 This was a surprise. Easy to set up and the sound is good. Great price and seems very sturdy. I think the battery life is good as I've only had to charge it once and that's been a while.
 Absolutely stunning sound from such a small speaker and the bluetooth pairs easily and works like a charm. The Anker beats other small speakers I've owned for sound quality and faithfully reproducing notes. Even classical music sounds nice on this little speaker. I've tested the bluetooth to a distance of about 20 feet, which meets my needs nicely for the room I plan to use it in.
 I bought this speaker to use in my office with my iPod touch. It was easy to set up and has good sound in my office setting. I like that it is compact and easy to stow away on my credenza when I'm not using it. I believe this little speaker is a good value for the price. My only criticism is that the charging cord is short.  It is no more than 2'. I just spent $7 to order a longer one.
 Amazing Sound! Much louder than my Beats Audio speakers on my HP Laptop. I could see using this for a small dance party in a living room. We used it at a youth dance camp with a group of about 16 kids outside - just for practicing a routine - it was just loud enough to do the job in that scenario. Great bass, I've heard no distortion so far at max volume. Great for dance practice or dancing in the living room. Worked great in the car too.
 Why pay more for fancy speakers when this one works so well? I opened it and immediately started playing music on it. The sound is crystal clear and it has a pretty decent range for bluetooth. I'm so glad I saved my money with this speaker!
 I bought this little speaker to use with my Kindles and my cell phone. It has great sound and quite a bit of volume. It is very easy to use, and synchs up with my device is quite easily. I highly recommend it. Anker makes a good product.
 What a cool little speaker! I am using it with my Ipad in an Art Center, quite a large area. Pandora was pretty small sounding until I wirelessly hooked this little speaker up. I am 65 and not techie at all so what a relief to hit the bluetooth button on settings and push the on buttom. WOW the music filled the space beautifully. I am very happy with my purchase!
 Received this speaker couple days ago. I'm now using it the whole week. This speaker doesn't disappoint me. It could be perfectly used in almost any environment: Office, house, party, car, beach, park. I'm not a music professional but I'm very delicate with the music devices I play, I don't like speakers that are noisy or that are not clear with the sound. Also something I love of this device is the battery autonomy, is not easy to find a speaker with good sound and good battery autonomy, the balance in this speaker is excellent.<br/><br/>I have some points regarding this:<br/><br/>- The speaker sound quality is awesome clear. When the musing needs bass, it will provide the correct bass compensation to the music.<br/>- Is easy to configure with any Bluetooth device<br/>- The music can be paused, started in the speaker and in your device.<br/>- The controls are easy to use, and with good durability.<br/>- The battery life last longer than you may think, I used it last night 6 hours without powering it off (I fell asleep).<br/>- The instructions included in the box are perfectly documented to help you get started and enjoy your music.<br/>- The weight of the device is perfect.<br/><br/>What could be better:<br/>- The Charging cable could be longer<br/>- More colors<br/>- IPx certification (Some people like me, take it to the beach)<br/><br/>After using it in different environment I point that when this speaker stop working I will buy the next generation, my experience was very good. Also I made a video with some aspect of the speaker: youtube.com/watch?v=NJkjZ1cJXyo<br/><br/>DISCLAIMER: I was provided with a free sample of this product. This doesn't affect my criteria and judgement of the product, my review is provided without being forced or being paid to give a positive review. I'm not also attached or related of any way to Anker. I'm just a happy customer.
 66ft? Probably! Bass, meh. . . buy a more expensive speaker, or, an actual sub?!<br/><br/>Almost 2 months later:<br/>I think this speaker has the new car rule, it'll become stable after 2000+ miles (12+ hrs). It sounds a little more clear and a little louder. Granted, its taken me almost 2 months to run down the battery.
 I love this unit, I can't believe I got this kind of quality for the price. The sound is clear and deep, the range is awesome, and it holds the charge for a very long time. I highly recommend it.
 I had this speaker for about a month and it was great. Wonderful sound, a long battery life, and was just what I needed for playing music when I work overnights in a dog kennel. However a month in the battery died and even though it's been charged it no longer can sync to any device. I've done all of the troubleshooting I can, but it seems like it's just done for.
 Seems like a nice little speaker.  I have had some success with Anker in the past so thought I would try the speaker to use on our deck.  I get it is designed to be portable and not attached to the charging cord but the small cord sent with the product is about useless unless you have a dedicated counter top you can set it up on and leave.. A 2-4 ft charging cable would make charging a lot more convenient. I didn't measure the size that came with it but it couldn't have been more than 6-12 inches.  Kinda disappointed in Anker who has nice charging cables.<br/><br/>It could have been an oversight on my part in the description but I have never received a shorter charging cord with anything else that needs charging.
 Pros:<br/>- sturdy, quality chassis<br/>- good sound quality for its price<br/>- pretty loud<br/>- battery lasts a good amount of time<br/>- option to switch between wifi or plug in (aux cable)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- doesn't come with aux cable. a competitor includes one<br/>- minus star for design. The design is just plain ugly and effortless plus the buttons should really be a different color because it's hard to differentiate black vs black. I mean it wouldn't mattered if it was designed for blind people, no offense.<br/>-wished it had a next and back button too<br/><br/>Overall it's probably the best buy for its quality at a low budget and I would recommend it.
 I've owned four Bluetooth (small speakers):  Photive CYREN, Oontz Angle, Zero-One Audio Duo and now the Anker SoundCore.  The Anker is the optimum in small speakers:  price point, quality build, no shrill audio announcing Bluetooth is on, and last but not least, sound quality.  Additionally, it is easy to pair with my iPhone.  Great engineering and production!
 The product is great and has a super sound quality.  The directions for use are certainly the worst part of my purchase.  When they say what button does what, like the "On" button, they neglect to say hold it down until the blue light comes on.  just pushing the button. or holding it for a second want do it.  I finally found a YouTube video that gave a clear picture of how the speaker works. Short of the usually poor directions I find in many foreign made products, it does work well, and the battery life is superb!
 Almost a year of daily use at max volume, and this speaker is still going strong with an amazing battery life and sound. I never expected this much volume with so little distortion out of such a small speaker at such a low price. This speaker has blown my mind and I recommend it to everyone who asks my opinion.
 This little guy is impressive. He can belt out some loud tunes without much distortion. He can hide in a backpack or purse while playing your favorite tunes from your phone. He can sit next to your computer and replace your lame computer speaker. What a  great product for the price!
 This thing is fine. However, I would not buy it again because there is a blue light on the front that is constantly flashing if it is not connected to bluetooth. Sometimes I use an aux cable to plug in a device and don't want to / am not able to use bluetooth. So annoying to have the bright, blue LED flashing over and over and over.
 I LOVE this speaker.  Small, loud, decent bass, always stays streaming with no interruptions or glitches, and it's so small that I can put it anywhere.  And the power charge lasts for many, many hours. Probably going to get a second one.
 Not an expert by any means. This speaker works well. I bought a separate case also and take it with me on all my vacations. I paired it with my Amazon Fire very easily and it works, it is load, and is easy to use, (for it's size). Very well made, and of obvious quality. I used on on the patio when on vacation and it lasted for hours. Recommended.
 This was the fourth one we bought, which tells you how well we like this little speaker. My husband has one at work, there’s one next to the bathtub, one in the family room...and this one is a gift for my grandson. Easy to use and sounds pretty decent, and price is crazy good.
 This is a great speaker for around the house or work.  Great battery life.  The sound is amazing even when turned up loud.  I bought this speaker for my motorcycle and it's not loud enough for that but I'm extremely happy with it anyway
 This is the best speaker! I swear it plays for days without recharging. I love the sound and use it all the time. Very durable and functional. I got the case that goes with it and it's super convenient to have all the cords in one place with the speaker.
 This speaker isn't quite what I had come to expect from the reviews. For some reason people seem to equate loud sound to good sound, and that's just not the case. This speaker is missing some bass and has somewhat aggressive highs. Turning on the "Bass Booster" EQ on my phone helped a bit to balance it out, but it's just not quite what I expected. I got it for $150 less than the one that I really want, but I just can't justify that for my needs so I can't complain too much.<br/><br/>***<br/>Update - Anker reached out to me and suggest that I may be happier with the Anker A3143 and they're right.  I'm much happier with it.  Highs still might be a bit sharp for my taste, but I'm MUCH happier with it.  Anker's customer service is really top notch.  The review above is unaltered from the original, but I did add a star after working with Anker to resolve my complaints.  Compared to other speakers in it's class I think it's fair to rate it a 4 or 4.5.  It just wasn't quite what I expected from the rave reviews.  I'd recommend the A3143 over this.
 I was skeptical with all the positive reviews, but went ahead and purchased this to see for myself. I've had this for about 5 months so far and I'm pretty sure it lasts longer than 24 hrs, at least for me. It was meant to be a temporary fix for my desktop PC until I got a bigger setup, so its got some use by now. Wasn't sure if it could live up to the claim and it surpassed it. The bass isn't as deep as id like it to be, but can't expect much for a portable speaker to be honest. Overall, Great product!
 This is a great speaker. I had a bose mini and didn't have the money to replace it. Decided to try this one and I was so impressed. Great sound quality and you can't beat the price.
 Did not work right out of the box. Has been charging for 24 hours straight and the red “charging” light does not turn off. The device does not power on at all. Was never able to make it work. Will contact amazon for a full refund. JUNK!
 It only sounds okay for soft music like jazz or slow songs. Anything more than that the voice sounds too amplified. Now I still need a good bluetooth speaker and I don't even know if I trust amazon reviews anymore.
 I've always had good luck with Anker products, and this is no exception. After a disappointing Prime Day purchase of a different BT speaker, I was so happy when I turned this one on. Great sound quality, excellent battery life, and easy to use onboard controls. Very easy to pair with my phone.
 Considering the flimsiness of nowadays electronic  products, this is amazingly well made item. Durable and quality are surprising.<br/>I can not even find a single flaw in it. And it is amazingly loud.
 Very clear sounding speaker especially the high end tones.  Bass is there but nothing too special for a small speaker.  What I'm extremely pleased with is the battery life.  I listen to it almost all day at work and it still goes a month before it needs charged.  Would recommend this if you're looking for a small speaker (not pocket sized) to fill the room you're in.
 this little thing drives me crazy. It is so awesome. Generally, this product is a bounce to the brand name. ANKER is what I'm planning to invest in. SO GREAT QUALITY. Very very clear. No sharp sounds that could create nervousness. I've tried several speakers. Spent hundreds. This thing is what I was looking for a long long time. Thanks, ANKER.
 I've been using the speaker with my Echo Dot for a month, and I am very pleased with it. It was easy to connect, and the sound quality is good. The only trouble I have is seeing the controls, especially if the lighting in the room isn't very bright. That really isn't a problem, though, since the Dot can adjust the volume.
 you honestly cannot expect anything more than this for the price. The sound quality and max volume along with the bluetooth connectivity and battery operatored wireless power.. It's super convenient for bringing with you to the beach or random adventures. I also listen to it in my apartment because its louder and clearer than my laptop speakers. Extremely satisfied with this purchase i highly recommend it !! :)
 The speaker connects with Bluetooth just fine, the play/pause/volume up/volume down buttons toggle their respective functions on the phone, but it won't actually play any sounds. Very useless without that function.<br/><br/>Update: Anker customer service got me a replacement that works flawlessly! :)
 This thing is awesome. No issues pairing or connecting. Sound is awesome, battery life is awesome. I bought this to replace a monster bluetooth speaker I bought five years ago for $50 (on sale!) and this Anker is way better. It's amazing how things can get significantly cheaper and better over time.
 I bought this as a present for my grandson who is not the easiest person in the world to please - takes it from his mother.  He absolutely loves it.  I can think of no higher praise for a $30 speaker.
 I have tried many types of Bluetooth speakers and this one really blew me away! The sound is full, vibrant and beautiful! The battery lasts all day long and will surprise you. Most speakers sound tinny and shrill, but this one really captures the rich bass and bold midtones without any distortion. I put this speaker at the top of a very long list of Bluetooth speakers.
 Nice little speaker that puts out a solid sound. I thought I needed a tower speaker but my husband ordered me this little speaker. I wasn’t expecting to like it, even planned on returning it before it arrived. But now I am very satisfied and might even order a second for my son’s bedroom.
 Anker products are amazing, and I'm a loyal customer--they've earned it. I give these speakers as gifts all the time. You can't beat them for the price. You'd be challenged to find a better-performing Bluetooth speaker for under $100.
 All is good, but bass and treble not that much cleat when hearing on highest volume.<br/>Also watch your music source since this affects dramatically on sound quality.<br/>In my case, tried with Spotify and personal mp3.
 what a great little speaker, all i gotta say is the battery on this guy is INSANE, i took it with me to play 18 holes yesterday turned it on was sad to see i only had 10% left on my battery! :(  (i have the app which shows you the battery % on my phone) i thought damn! im gonna run out of juice..,PLAYED THE ENTIRE 18 HOLES ON FULL BLAST AND STILL HAD SOME LETT...INCREDIBLE. sound is great for the price as well.
 Really great for the price and size. I was surprised. Easy to link to my phone and it was loud enough to drive the unwanted people out of my house. I wasn't even close to turning it up full blast.
 If you need a small speaker to play music in your kitchen, this is the one. Clear audio, smooth rubber texture, perfect price. Not going to replace your outside party speakers, but definitely better than anything in the $20-$50 price range (if not more).
 This is an amazing speaker - love it.  AND the price was excellent.  Very pleased with this purchase.<br/>I had no difficulty connecting a device but I'm somewhat saavy when it comes to electronics.  The buttons on top blend in very well with the background so it's easy to miss them.  The sound is great, the play time is great.
 First speaker that arrived was broken and distorting the sound, so I contacted Anker as they said to do in the quickstart guide and explained the problem to them.  It took a day or two but when I got a response they told me I got a lemon and just shipped me a new one.  I like Anker a lot now, and the speaker is capable of remarkable distances from the device.
 Remarkable quality, easy to set up. Puts out far more volume and bass than I expected. I should have guessed it was a solid build given the weight. No idea on battery life. Just got it
 Super easy to setup. The sound is great. Bass level is perfect for me but I'm not that into super, crazy, ear-popping bass anyway. Though I've never used any other Bluetooth speaker, I haven't been as impressed by the ones my friends have. I originally bought this to use instead of a sound machine at night, I haven't had to use it in this manner yet. But once I do, I'll update my review. The beeping sound it makes when connecting to Bluetooth is a little loud and that may bother me at night. However that's just me being super picky and totally understand that's technically not what this product is made to be used for. So overall it's been great so far. Side note: Anker isn't available in Australia and yet it was cheaper (or about the same, depending on the brand) to purchase this from Amazon rather than buy one of the "popular" speakers here.

Even the bass sounds amazing. If your a techie, you will appreciate that you will also be able to receive calls from your cell through the Bluetooth. Long lasting battery charge as well.
 The Bluetooth functionality stopped working after literally 10 hours of usage. It wouldn't pair with new devices or connect to already paired devices. I tried everything to reset the speaker but it just keeps blinking in pairing mode while no signal is broadcast for my phone to connect to.<br/>---<br/>Anker contacted me and send me a brand new speaker with very little work or hassle. The new speaker works perfectly. Great customer service and product. I understand that some devices slip thru quality control and it was good of them to rectify the issue quickly.
 This speaker is great, but the charging port is fkimsy and with minimal use, you can't get a cord to stay in . I've been l I moping along with positional chi a raging (plug just won't stay in) until today when even a properly oriented male end doesn't charge. I've contacted the manufacturers, as it says the product is warranty for 18 months. I will update with their communication.
 Good speaker for small spaces. It really keeps a charge. I have several small speaker like this one around the house and at work. This one is my fave based on depth of sound and the battery life. Anker makes great products . I'm never disappointed.
 I love this little guy. Portable enough to move from room to room with me, to bring the tunes outside for gardening, or to watch a movie on my laptop with decent sound. The battery lasts for weeks with hours of use most days.
 I purchased this for my dad for Fathers Day. He is 60 and loved listening to music. Not to brag or anything but out of all the kids gifts to him my gift made it onto a Facebook shout out (and he only ever posts articles) and said that his phone now plays music like a high quality stereo. The sound is crisp and clear and has a pretty good range for Bluetooth so you don't need to be right next to it. Really loud volume for such a small speaker. This was our third Anker purchase. They have wonderful customer service.
 I'm a believer in Anker speakers, this is the second one I've purchased. Both have been wonderful! Long battery life, good quality sound. Of all the portable speakers I've ever bought or used, these guys got it right. Excellent product.
 Husband has this at work and said it has been great.  It has great sound and plenty of volume although he doesn't turn it up loud in his office. We own both this speaker and the Oontz Angle and we like them both equally.  The Oontz angle is water resistant, however so we chose to keep it in our kitchen while this one went to the office.
 I love Anker products,  But not this one! Excellent fit and finish. But sounds worse than a few other cheapie BT speakers I own.  Good for audio books, but not music.<br/>UPDATE: Anker contacted ME concerning the above review with a very apoplectic and concerned Email. What a pleasant surprise, a company that IS concerned about customer satisfaction. Worked things out to my complete satisfaction. How wonderful ...
 This little sucker has a great sound output and the battery lasts quite a while. For such a small device it produces a rich and robust sound that will impress with it's clarity!
 I purchased one speaker and found the bluetooth, sound, and ease of use excellent.  The battery life is truly amazing.  Based on the great performance of that speaker, I bought a second.  Unfortunately, the bluetooth on the second speaker did not work.  Anker's support service instantly replied to my problem.  After following their instructions for repair, the bluetooth still did not work. As soon as I informed the service rep, they sent me a new replacement.  No questions asked and I received a replacement within a few days at no cost to me.  This is a company that stands behind their products -- a very good product and a very good response when problems occur.
 Freaking amazing! Great sound quality, gets really loud so I can hear it over the vent and sizzling of cooking in the kitchen or across the house. Great small and portable battery, and the battery life is AWESOME. I don't use it every day, but I use it often enough, charging it here and there, and I've never run out of battery life. Stop thinking about it. Get it.
 I use this bad boy while smoking supper and on the golf course. I have had zero issues with it so far and it’s taken a few falls. Battery lasts long enough for 18 holes no problem. Should it go out I’d buy another no question
 Works great! The sound is very good and the range is perfect! I've taken it into the bathroom when I shower and even with the door closed it still didn't lose the signal from my computer in the other room! It also works with my chromebook and android phone as well. For the price, it's really great!
 Very happy with the sound and bass quality of this speaker. I haven’t had it long enough to test battery life but so far I have listened for five hours straight with no problems. Nice small package with very large sound! Would definitely buy again.
 I LOVE IT. It's exactly what I needed for my home gym and for my family. It's loud, the Bluetooth connectivity is impressive. I must have went at least 60ft and it still was connected.  I am very impressed with this product and couldn't be happier. Anker's customer service is highly reputable as well, i have already received an email from them asking how I like the product, not many companies do that for you.
 This speaker was great until it broke after 2 months of light playing. I wouldn’t give it even one star, but am required to by Amazon in order to post a review.
 For the money this speaker is very good. Sound quality is not far away from Bose Bluetooth speakers costing much more.<br/><br/>I am reviewing the second speaker I received and this is a revised review upgraded from two to five stars. The first speaker I received sounded odd, in my opinion (muddy and muffled). Anker promptly sent this replacement speaker which I am satisfied with.
 Bought as a gift and she loves it. Takes it in the car or leaves on the counter when listening to music. Good sound quality. Would recommend to anyone and the price can’t be beat! Get it.
 Works like a charm! Super convenient, charges with a mini USB, stays charged for a while, and has really good sound. Louder than I thought it would be! The bluetooth connection is really easy, too, and once you've paired it, it pairs up effortlessly with the same device and turns off by itself when you disable the bluetooth on your device. The bluetooth range is pretty solid, too--I could walk out to the porch, leaving the speaker on the other side of the house, and the music still played.
 The speaker itself works very well it’s louder than my mini jam box and the quality of sound is much more clear, but there are issues with connecting to multiple devices. If I want to switch it from my phone to my iPad, I have to erase it from my phones memory (I can’t just switch off Bluetooth or disconnect) and the iPad memory, turn on Bluetooth before the speaker, then hold down the pairing button before it will connect to a different device. A little frustrating.<br/><br/>*UPDATED*<br/>I have added a star for the quality of customer service. Anker’s customer service team contacted me within 24 hours of my review wishing to apologize for the inconvenience of my connectivity issues with the soundcore and offered me a product of similar value for reparations. They have gone above and beyond in my expectations with customer service and have been prompt and responsive every time. I also just want to clarify that I think this speaker was a good purchase for the excellent sound quality and price, and I still prefer using it even though it takes me some time to switch it between devices. Now that I’ve had it for a couple months now and haven’t had to recharge yet because the battery life is so long!
 Sound quality not as good as Bose (to be expected), but overall great speaker. My refurbished version has held up for several years now. Good indoors and out. Nice sort of non-slip texture.
 Microphone broke after just two weeks and very light use (haven't even recharged it yet) but customer service was quick and promised a replacement (currently on the way). Sound is good if not crazy loud and I have had no problems with the connectivity or speaker itself.
 Wow! For such a little speaker combined with the very reasonable price, this speaker really gets the job done. Based off the reviews I read before I made the purchase I was already expecting a little bang for my buck. Anker did not disappoint. I am really impressed. While this is not the most top of the line speaker I have ever listened to...I wasn't trying to pay the price for top of the line either. The bass is great. I did get some static when I had the volume controls wide open but it wasn't nerve grinding bad. The battery life is fabulous and will hold up great for an entire day at the pool and then some. If your on the fence about purchasing this speaker, don't be. I believe you will be very happy and pleasantly surprised by the quality. Thank you Anker for putting out such an awesome product with such an affordable price.
 The battery on this lasts forever!! Sound is great was a little smaller than Inthiughtnit would be but that’s better in my opinion. It would be awesome if it had a magnet as I use it at work as a mechanic. It’s perfect for what I needed!
 I love this speaker! I have one blue and one red. The sound quality is excellent, with plenty of volume and bass. Great compact design, and the battery life is excellent. I also love that the speaker doesn’t automatically cut off when not in use, because I have it connected to my Echo Dot. Other speakers I have tried cut off after so many minutes of not having sound played through them, but this one doesn’t thankfully.
 Works good<br/>Built well<br/>Looks kinda cool<br/>Links to phone quick<br/>I left it outside for a week or so in the cold of Seattle winter still good<br/>Loud<br/>Battery last long long time<br/>I can’t remember the last time I charged it
 Before this, I wasn't able to find a reasonably priced portable bluetooth speaker that could play loudly.  This is exactly what I've been looking for.  The battery life is awesome!!!
 The Anker speaker worked great for two months. It just quit working. At first I could shake it a little and it would play but eventually it just stopped working. I remember the days when u bought something it would last. Disappointed. Now I have to jump through hoops to return the item. Probably just mark it up as a loss.<br/>PS: sent me a replacement!  Thank you for standing behind your product. Unlike Walmart!!!!!
 Excellent sound and superb customer service.  This is the second one I've bought.  Wireless bluetooth with very good range, so you can move your music around the house or yard easily.  Pairs nicely with Alexa devices.  Also excellent customer service.
 I like that I can leave it plugged in to charge and aux without the horrible whine. I like that it is put together well. I like that it has a low sound for on and off. I had tried a Billboard blutooth speaker and it was everything I hated, so was I pleasantly surprised when I got the anker.
 this thing is only $35. barely any bass, which is to be expected. mids and highs were ok. nothing great. probably better than most other speakers in this price range though. just don't expect this thing to sound like a jbl flip 3,4. honestly, the jbl flip 4 I purchased may just be the best $100 I've ever spent. amazing sound and its waterproof. but it is almost 3 times as much money.
 Update: hate this speaker. Attempting to reconnect via Bluetooth after another device was connected is a hassle. I have to forget the speaker exit Bluetooth setting then come back in wait for it to show up and then re connect. No other Bluetooth device has been this awkward.<br/><br/>Amazing battery life. Not much else. Good sound. Not a lot of bass though. A "feature" that I don't like is that it has no auto off. To make that worse, it will beep at you every 10? minutes to let you know it's looking to pair with a device until you manually turn it off. It's actually quite annoying. Re-pairing to my phone after my wife's phone was connected is an ordeal. Putting it in pairing mode doesn't just allow me to connect to it. I have to first Forget the device from my Bluetooth settings, then since the device doesn't show up in my iPhone's list of bluetooth devices in pairing mode, I have to turn off bluetooth, turn on bluetooth, wait for it to show up, then connect. Doing this every time we want to stream from a different device? Forget about it. Strangest Bluetooth experience I've ever had.
 Awesome tiny speaker. A little longer than my iPhone, but it's so loud. I don't even play it on full volume in my living room when cleaning. SO happy to find this!! Will recommend to my friends! Also, the sound is surprisingly great quality, much better than my waterproof shower speaker. Sounds clean, no raspy sound, and the bass is good.
 Very well built product looks great with its stylish design and feels very dense like i got my moneys worth not cheap and hollow like other Bluetooth speakers i have owned, the Bluetooth connectivity works from any room in my home and the sound is natural with deep bass and a good mid and hi pitch i listen to music with it and also stream movies on my tablet.PLUS i haven't had to constantly charge it after every use the battery is ridiculously lengthy...... you definitely get your moneys worth with this speaker !!!!!
 This speaker had great battery life, however the volume was not as loud as I had hoped. It was good for listening to the radio quietly in the office, but not loud enough that I could use it while I was cleaning the building which is what I had originally purchased it for.
 VERY GOOD SPEAKER THAT HAS NICE SOUND FOR ITS SIZE. IT IS SMALLER THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS IN THE PICTURE (I NEGLECTED TO LOOK AT THE SIZE DESCRIPTION), HOWEVER ITS SIZE MAKES IT VERY PORTABLE AND IT HAS A GREAT BATTERY LIFE (24HRS PER CHARGE) AND AGAIN, VERY GOOD SOUND.
 small size with big voice and the battery last really long!<br/><br/>Update on June 10<br/>The audio output plug is loosen after 3 months... bluetooth works fine though...<br/><br/>Update on June 20<br/>The customer service is superb. They reached out very soon when I got the above problem and a replacement speaker was mailed within a couple days! Thanks Anker! The new Anker speaker works fine so far :D
 Good sound and battery life, connects quickly, surprised at the amount of bass. Won't shake the table but sounds good. Buy w confidence.
 Out of the box, felt very sturdy and well made. I have been using a Vizio sound bar, 36 inch, in my bathroom while taking a shower because the speakers on the phone and most small Bluetooth speakers could not get over the sound of fans and water running. So I got this hoping it would do the trick without me have to lug in the Vizio. The sound and volume is amazing for such a small box. No it doesn't thump the pictures off the wall with bass, it's also not a 12inch subwoofer. It's a little larger than my hand. But it also doesn't have that pop bass that you hear when you know it's a speaker trying way to hard. The mids and highs are very nice. Battery life was also a concern, however I charged it out of the box and have used it for about an hour a day for the last two weeks and haven't charged it again. Great little speaker.
 Was pretty impressed with these speakers. Although you could kind of tell that it's a cheap speaker based on the sound quality, but it beats a lot of other low cost speakers. The bass sounded a bit muffed and it didn't have a clean sound, but overall, I'm happy with these.
 Excellent speaker for the price. Nice feet to the touch, feels sturdy enough and very surprise with the quality of the sound. Set up was as easy as it gets.  Controls on top are a little hard to see because they blend in with background, but not big deal. Wish charging wire was longer. Just what I was looking for, small enough to carry and very good sound.
 My husband and I purchased a Sony speaker  just like this for more than double the price, it said it would last on a full charge of 16 hours. It died after 3 hours. We need up buying this speaker, it literally last 24 hours of continuous playing. This is a great buy and it's only $30.
 This is a really nice little Bluetooth speaker. GREAT battery life and decent sound quality.<br/>Sound is a little bass heavy, it’s noticeable, but not the worst I’ve heard. Given the price you can’t expect Bose quality, but it’s good enough for the girls I go with.
 Let me start by saying that this speaker is a very portable size, meaning, fits inside bags, bicycle holders, etc. So you might think , it's small so the sound quality will be affected? Right and wrong. In question of quality of sound the only thing i could think as a minus was the Bass which was very flushed and weak but sincerely, what can you expect for such a small speaker at this pricetag. I personally love the mids and highs in this speaker.<br/><br/>As a person that loves riding my Bicycle outside this speaker does the job of keeping me jamming to some cool loud music without headphones. I personally love Anker. i have their Fast Charger and bigger phone battery for my Note 4
 This thing gets great battery life and has good sound range. Connects super easy and is lightweight and compact enough to take anywhere! It's not waterproof but I didn't get it take on the actual water with me so that doesn't bother me.
 Buyer beware. Had this product for several months. At first it was amazing , great sound quality that really fills the room . It charged fast and had good battery life as well. But out of the blue it decided to stop functioning properly . The device refuses to power on although the battery will still hold a charge . It's a great product if you get it on sale and plan on replacing it with something better soon .
 This is a good speaker.
 Listen, it's tough to rate bluetooth speakers.  I'm a huge Anker fan, love their quality and economical prices.  I'm also a self-proclaimed audiophile who listens to drum'n'bass, hip hop and house the majority of the time.  I got this item during a black friday sale I believe for almost half off.  It's not perfect, but I still think I got the deal of the century on it since I was just looking for something to play back tunes when the office is empty and/or when taking a shower (I'm not sure how resistent it is to the elements, ie. shower steam, but so far so good.)<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Unmatched battery life from a brand that has proven itself as a champ in mobile power solutions, Anker<br/>-Gets proper loud if you let it, kind of amazing how far it can carry<br/>-Directional (which can be good or bad), meaning it projects in a certain direction without spilling to far to the sides or back.  I like this since I like to listen to music in the kitchen without disturbing the wife watching tv in the living room<br/>-Again, the freakin battery life.  Went weeks without having to charge it.  It's a true 24 hours of playback!!!!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Sound quality is a 6/10.  It's not a Sonos or a Bose, I know that, and wasn't expecting reference quality sound from it.  But, with bass heavy music, low frequencies sort of duck the high frequencies when its pumping.  Sounds like a compressor cranked up to high, it pumps (in a bad way)<br/>-No frills design, bluetooth pairs to a single device.  Haven't tested to see if i can make calls on it (not sure if it has a mic anyway).  If this is all you need, which is basic audio playback, then skip this con.<br/>-Plugging the unit in to charge is an exacting process, and I find myself having to squint at the port to determine which orientation to use when inserting the cable.  Also doesn't work with all micro-usb cables, some of mine seem to come up short and just don't charge it.  Not a huge deal if you use the cable that comes with it, but I like to use the same micro-USB for all my other stuff and this one has been a pain.<br/><br/>Neutral:<br/>-Form factor.  It's a brick.  Looks great on a desk, I suppose, but is obtrusive and annoying to pack in my messenger bag.<br/>-Build quality.  Solid but light.  Would have liked a strap or carribeaner option for snapping it to my bag for hikes, picnics or the beach.  I think this thing was destined for office or home use only.  Beach sand and trail dirt, not so much.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd say it was a steal for the $20 or so bucks I got it for - but for the currently advertised $40, you might wanna do some further research on brands that have a better quality sound profile and better frequency response.  I bet this thing rocks for listening to podcasts on, but jungle/dnb mixes fall short in the bass replication department and can make the speaker sound pretty wonky.
 I was absolutely blown away with the quality of sound from this compact speaker! Our daughter and son-in-law who are significantly hearing impaired were astonished at the quality. I'm gonna buy MYSELF one or maybe two!<br/>Also quick service was a plus.
 I used this several times without any problems.  After a few weeks, I hadn't used or charged it and when I tried to charge it, it wouldn't stay in the right spot to connect. I haven't been able to use it since.  This is a waste of money.
 No bass. Tinny sound. For the price, fine. But the sound isn't great.  UPDATE: Following my original 2-star review, Anker was kind enough to send me the next level up with a "bass boost" feature. Certainly far better than the original product I purchased.
 This speaker has very good sound for it's size. It connected easily and controls are easy to use. I purchased this to use at work but its not loud enough to overcome the background noise. This speakers is very good for inside a home which is where I ended up using it.
 Cannot maintain its connection to my cell; phone lying on the desk 8" away. This is what I bought it for.<br/>Phone does not has issues with bluetooth in my car.<br/><br/>I liked it initially based on size and appearance, now I think it is useless.
 This little speaker is loud and has great bass!! I've tried other speaker brands before this one, but after listening to this I'm sold! It's the best speaker for the price hands down. THE overall sound quality is truly amazing.
 Absolutely love this little guy! Great sound, decent bass. Play around with its placement to get more robust sound, like putting it on the corner of a counter.  Battery life is also phenomenal. I listen to mine several hours every weekend, and I've never had to charge it. Would highly recommend.
 I found out my collage daughter wanted a Bluetooth speaker for Christmas, after i already bought her stuff already. Being a hen pecked father, i caved in. Wasn't looking to spend a lot. Amazon to the rescue and this great speaker. I don't know all the specifics, but she loves it a lot, and that is good enough for me.
 One of the best cost-benefit items I've ever bought. I unpacked this item, turned it on and kept using it intermittently for over 2 WEEKS, at least a couple hours/day, before I had to charge it for the first time. Connectivity, commands and volume are really good, sounds quality is not perfect, but doesn't disappoint. After all, it is still a $30 BT speaker, but it performs incredibly well. The long lasting battery really astonished me. 5 STARS.
 I have been quite pleased with this speaker. The electric is shot in my van, so I stream music through my phone. This speaker has decent bass to it, is loud and is clear. For this price point I would recommend this
 The product packaging is incredible.  Haven't had to deal with customer service yet but I almost believe then when they say that are hassle free. The price is on point for what you get,  long battery life,  lightweight,  but the little speakers are a little lacking. A bit of distortions with heavy bass and when cranked all the way up. Using it at work so it is perfect, no need to listen at full volume,  easy for storage and transportation and very little need to charge.
 Bought this for my husband to take with him to work.  It is compact so easy to tote around with all his other stuff (he works construction).  He really likes it and uses it a lot...both at work and at home.  Has good sound.  Highly recommend.
 This little Anker brand Bluetooth Speaker sat around since its purchase last fall.  Now that summer is hear we used it outside to listen to the iphone.  Connections are easy.  Sound is better than its small size would suggest.  My wife thought it a silly buy, not anymore.  She uses it outside all the time.
 I had high hopes for this but coming off of a Bose situation, I was disappointed in the quality of sound that comes from this.  I had hoped for better base and low tones but it's mostly treble and doesn't have the depth of sound I had hoped for.  For the price, it plays music and the battery lasts.  So, I give it that.  Just wish it had better sound quality.
 I received this speaker on July 6th and have yet to have to recharge it. The battery life is insane. Keep in mind that it has only been played while showering etc etc (usually an hour or so) and shut off afterwards but still to me that is amazing. This is not the loudest speaker you will find but the sound quality is decent even at max volume. For the money I could not happier. Stop reading this already and buy the damn speaker.
 I gave this speaker a bad review because it quit working and I barely used it.  I contacted their support team and they got right back to me with suggested troubleshooting.  The one thing I hadn't tried ended up being the solution.  I've always been impressed with the sound quality and battery life and now I'm impressed with Anker's customer support as well.
 Ok so I received this thing on Jun 19. I charged it. I started using it. I use it 3 to 4 hours a night to watch Netflix because I'm hard of hearing and I like the speaker to be near me. On the weekends i probably binge 6 to 7 hours. It's now July 21st and I still haven't had to charge this damn thing. To be honest it's slightly concerning. Is it haunted? Is it nuclear powered? Will it make me sterile? Will update if anything changes, explodes.
 I love this little thing. The sound is great, the battery life is phenomenal, and the range is excellent as well.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-The buttons can be hard to see. Literally black on black, just barely raised up shapes. What's that about? I might actually paint them white.<br/>-There is no next/previous buttons. If you double-click the play button it will jump to the next track but as far as I can tell there's no way to go back. There IS a dedicated Bluetooth button however, which is odd to commit a button to that functionality considering how rarely you would need actually use it<br/><br/>Pros: Everything else about this thing is awesome!
 Great little speaker - long range and loud ! I used it all day yesterday outside, Battery lasted for over 10 hours till I turned it off - then I charged it and it only took about 15 minutes to be back to full charge. I highly recommend this product !
 This thing is amazing, it keeps it's charge for about a month being used every morning getting ready for work and some evenings... it feels very durable, we have taken it on several trips, very convenient.  Sound quality is great, it's obviously not a studio monitor, but it has above average sound.
 I had my doubts but this little speaker is so clear and powerful.  The sound is full.  I was contemplating purchasing a new stereo for my car to listen to podcasts and the music I like from my phone.  That wasn't looking cheap so I decided to try this Bluetooth hookup. ...just saved myself a bunch of change and I get to take this worth me wherever I want.  Highly recommend this product!
 Initially ordering this speaker I was very excited. I just needed something to play some music when at lunch with friends on campus and thought this would be great! When I first opened the speaker I realized it has very nice build quality, it feels pretty great for something at this price but when I went to turn the speaker on it simply won’t work. It will charge but every time I try to turn the speaker on it will not power on. I had high hopes for this product and I was very let down.
 Very compact. Great battery life. Long range Bluetooth. Great sound for the size. I would definitely recommend buying one to anyone.<br/>Oh and it's a great price!
 This item popped up as a Daily Deal on another website. For $26.99, I couldn't resist although I wasn't expecting great sound. Well, I was wrong; the sound is amazing for such a small wireless speaker. I was planning to install wired speakers in my bedroom and bath ceilings, but not now. This little speaker is a great alternative. Close examination reveals really nice quality. Even the packaging is nice...a la Apple products.
 I love anker products because of their reliability. I bought this and it stopped charging and I was in shock. I wrote a review stating this and anker contacted me and immediately replaced it. Wow, great customer service and Im happy to have my anker speaker. Great volume and long lasting charge.
 I bought this brand because my daughter in law had one and recommended it. I love the sound quality and long battery life.  That is the reason. After three months it would no longer charge. Apparently a problem with the charging port develops on certain speakers. Since there is an 18 month warranty, the company tells me they will replace the speaker. It was easy to reach the company by phone.<br/>They have great customer service!
 UPDATE: After letting the battery completely drain and fully charging (again) the battery is now holding a charge. Haven't tallied the hours, but def more than 5 and still holding....<br/><br/>The sound and range are both pretty decent and it's portable enough but it does NOT have a 24hr playback battery life; it has MAYBE 5!.
 This was a Christmas gift for my son-in-law. I called a few days later and asked how he likes it. He LOVES IT! The sound is amazing, and it gets loud enough for him to work outside all over the yard and hear it clearly. He is especially impressed with the quality of the bass. Of all the speakers he has heard, he said this is by far the best. He is driving my daughter insane by listening to it indoors and LOUD! LOL<br/>I would recommend this speaker to anyone who may be trying to decide which one to buy but not spend major $$$. I am in the process of buying more. I don't normally review items but, I have to give this speaker 5 stars because we are so impressed by it.
 I bought one of these for my daughter a couple years ago by accident. It was the best surprise ever! It works so good my daughter uses it almost every day and the battery lasts months! So I just purchased another one for my niece being it was on her Christmas list to get this exact one!
 This speaker is great! It's small but the sound is great and the battery life is wonderful as well. If you are looking for a budget speaker that is easy to use and portable then I highly recommend giving Anker a try. I have other Anker products as well that I have been very happy with so when I was seeking out a bluetooth speaker and found this one I was sold. I have had this speaker for about two months and so far so good!
 Inexpensive for quality sound. Bluetooth connects quickly and the controls are easy to use and stylishly molded into the top of the speaker. I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a portable speaker to take with them.
 I like this a lot for it's worth! Goes pretty loud, nice clear sound, easy and simple button usage. Mic insert if you need it and an aux cord insert as well! Worth picking up if you are a little low on cash but still want a nice speaker to carry around. 5 stars, however I will warn you it is NOT waterproof.
 very compact,nice sound to it (not tinny) easy hookup. But you must charge it when it comes in. It says you have to buy a charger you do not. It takes a cell phone mini cord<br/>UPDATE- 2 years later and it still runs good and has great sound. i use on job-site and people actually ask me to turn it down. I also use with desktop computer to boost sound. best money i spent. Anker makes stuff to last.
 Wish I could rate this 5 stars but this speaker is very temperamental. when synced to my computers, Dell, (2) Apple MacBook Pro, and a Toshiba it is very crackly and seems to cut in and out in Bluetooth mode. Every now in then when it is synced to my iPhone it will do the same thing. But when it is working I like it. The sound great and the battery seems to last a long time. Overall I am happy with it just wish I didn't have to move all my music to my phone before I want to listen to it.
 My husband loves his anker speaker. It was delivered on time and packaged in perfect condition. The battery life lasts a long time. My husband takes it with him to golf with his buddies and has golfed 5 rounds without having to charge it. It produdes good quality sound. It's nice and compact and fits anywhere. It easily connects to your devices via Bluetooth. Overall very impressed with this speaker and would highly recommend.
 This little boom box is perfect great bass sound and really puts out enough volume to use in my exercise class. It is also compact I thought would be bigger based on reviews and videos. Best part is it goes into a sleep mode if nothing is playing without you touching it! Best investment ever... wish I could hook up two at the same time! Now I use all over the house especially in the kitchen when baking!
 My son purchased this item last year and recommended it as a Christmas gift. I was totally impressed that I received the item in one day . My father is going to love it. Thanks again!!!
 Very impressed with this speaker. I play a lot of dubstep and the bass is pretty good wuality. Not as loud as I’d like it to be but I really struggle with finding good portable speakers with good bass and this is the best I’ve found so far.
 I have ordered a replacement laptop battery from this company, and it was amazing (way better than the stock one). So when I was looking for a small music speaker, this one popped up at a great price. Very sturdy, easy to use, great sound, and syncs easily to my devices. Very happy with this speaker.
 The speaker has great volume and good bass. Really a pleasure to listen to music on.<br/><br/>BUT<br/><br/>It does not function well as a speaker phone which is what I bought it for. I hope this helps someone.<br/><br/>Also it was WAY smaller than I expected.. Not a problem just FYI
 This speaker is awesome. I’ll buy it again. Wish I was a tad bit louder. But for just a bed room or the beach. This is a pretty cool speaker. If you are thinking about a kids/toddler  room. This may be to loud  your kids will blast it. But if this is a parents room. Then definitely get it.
 I work in a kitchen and use this often while working. It has a good, clear sound and the battery has a long life. I've been using for a few months now, almost daily for three or four hours at a time, and the battery isn't even at half yet.
 A wonderful little speaker with great sound!  I use it in my bedroom so the volume is normally set at the 30-40% range and connect it to the charger about every 4 days for a couple hours even though I haven't seen any signs it "needs" to be recharged.  Pairing it to my iPod and Fire tablet was simple (though it can only be paired with one at a time).
 worked for a couple weeks and now will not connect to any other bluetooth device.
 Great battery life and sounds quality from a small package. Used on a trip for music in a cabin and worked wonderfully. Battery lasted through a full weekend of use with no issues.
 This is small size speaker with big sound. I replaced my wired portable speakers with this Bluetooth speaker, and I am happy with the result. This speaker has excellent sound from a long distance. This is the best speaker available without spending a fortune. This is my "go-to" speaker for all my Bluetooth Devices.  I may buy it again for gifts.
 Definitely, the best speaker you can find anywhere within this price range. Its loud, clear, and a good movement of air if you're close enough. My only flaw is that the 2nd one i bought isnt as loud as my first one.
 Great speaker. Can take it anywhere. Excellent product. Works great for ederly that can't put phones up to their ears. Hook onto phone. They can hear and the mic works great for people on the other end.
 I have had this speaker for the last 18 days. So far I really like it. The sound quality is perfectly fine. I bought it to enhance the sound I get from my iPad Air, and it has certainly done that. Does it reach 66 feet from the sound source? Yeah, it seems to, or at least pretty close. It did start to cut out when I took it down into my basement, but it had to go through some concrete. Does it last 24 hours? Hard to say, as I haven't timed it exactly. However, since I have had it 18 days and I use it at least 1 hour per day, and it hasn't needed recharging yet, it probably has gone OVER 24 hours. Now, I play it at a fairly low volume, so that may extend the battery life over playing it quite loud. But playing it anywhere near full volume drives me out of the room! Definitely worth the money.
 Greatest buy yet. I’m so picky when it comes to speakers and since I work in a warehouse a good reasonably priced speaker is hard to find. This has been perfect so far. Stayed charged for my 12+hour shift was easy for the crew to connect to by both cord and Bluetooth. Was able to be heard over the machines but wasn’t to loud as to not be able to hear eachother and so far durable as well. A must have for sure!!!
 I have only had it for a few days but so far am very pleased with it. Bluetooth connection was very easy, just took a matter of seconds. It is a little difficult to find the sweet spot on the on/off button, at least at first. But that is a very minor issue. Speakers that cost a lot more may have deeper bass or other attributes that a devoted audiophile would appreciate. However, this speaker does a great job for me and allows me to listen to music from my echo dot that sounds very good to my ears.
 Giving this 4 stars because speakers could be somewhat louder. Aside from that, they are great just as every other Anker product I own. I have Anker SoundBuds, dual USB port fast charge wall charger and battery pack. Battery lasts a long time and I can take just about anywhere. Easily fits in a back pack.
 You want a tiny speaker that lasts a long time and has a surprisingly good sound? Get this. I charge it once a month, and use it constantly in my home because it can fill the entire space! I bought it for a trip because reviews said it lasted long- and it does- but i ended up replacing a bigger home speaker because this thing is so nice for portability and sound quality! Friends have commented on the hardware quality a few times, too.
 I have not once been disappointed with products I've bought on Amazon made by Anker. Always very well made, high quality and work like they should. Unfortunately there's a lot of cheap knock off Chinese crap on Amazon but Anker has always been consistent. Keep up the great work! This little sound bar is great, crystal clear sound and surprisingly a lot of sound for such a small little box.
 I've had other speakers that worked well at first but ended up blowing after a month or so. This one is holding strong and the sound quality is excellent. Probably not quite as good as a Bose but it does the trick and I can hear everything very clearly in my work truck with a lot of background noise. The base is also very strong
 I needed the speaker to use out in the garage working on my car or under it.  it was perfect for those uses. I'm sure you can find better sounding speakers out there but for the price and with the battery life this speaker is great the sound does change depending on what you have the speaker on or against so you may have to play with the placement to get better sound
 I bought this to pair with my Amazon dot, and I'm glad I did. The sound is great; good highs and lows. It feels like it's solidly built, and I like the rubberized texture. The best part is the battery life. I left it on for a week and played music for 3-4 hours a day before it needed to be recharged.
 If you're buying this, I want to start off by warning you that it is a $30 speaker and not to expect too much out of it. That being said this speaker has good sound quality and has a decent max volume with little distortion. Having a smaller size, the speaker is easy to carry and great for activities like camping and trips to the beach! The bass is a little on the weak side but other than that I have no complaints and recommend this for anyone who wants a cheap and easily portable speaker.
 great sound! better than my Sound Bot. The fact that it automatically turns itself off if it's without a bt signal for a little while is awesome. My soundbot stays on no matter what and the battery is contantly dead. I'm to lazy to walk over and turn the switch when i done using it. With the anker i just disconnect and forget about it. and connecting again a few days later the battery is totally fine.
 Lots of Bluetooth speakers out there in this price point.  Own a Oontz curve and it's fine for the size but the sound is no where near as good as the anker speaker ( single speaker vs two speakers drivers, I know it will sound a lot different) Very good rich sound with enough bass to make most people happy. Use my my patio without any issues.  It's nice for a small room. Holds a charge well. I went with the Anker based on other peoples reviews and I'm very pleased. Only downfall is the it's not splash/water resistant.
 The instruction book is useless and the on line info. is the same.  Once you get it connected the range and sound are good.  Smaller than I expected but for my use that is a plus.<br/><br/>update// Sept 2017..  mine just died...lasted a little over a year.  not happy.,.,.,,new update...10/10...I received a new replacement today without requesting one..very pleased with the unexpected speaker.  Way to stand by your product.
 I love this speaker. It makes using an ipad to watch DirectTv a much better experience. It is also awesome for listening to Pandora. I can leave my ipad charging in the kitchen and carry my anker to the other end of the house and it still works great. It keeps a charge well too! I only need to  plug it in once a week...overnight, despite daily use.
 great price and decent sound for that price, can only store one connected profile at a time, so switching devices was a pain to go from 2 diff phones.  It will connect automatically to formerly connected device - I had to clear that connection in my iphone and reconnect alltogether for it to recognize.  Very good standby battery life
 A friend had one of these and I was so impressed by the sound for the size that I ordered one immediately. It took two tries to pair to my phone but so far so good. Case seems very sturdy and bass response for the size is good, if anything, amazing. For my intended purpose, it's perfect.
 What I love about this is how long the battery life is!!!  As a teacher, I want a product that isn't always dying like my old one used to. This was really inexpensive and the sound quality is pretty close to a very expensive one I used to have. So I totally recommend Anker!!  Love it!!!
 This speaker can combat with the volume of an expensive jbl speaker, and I was able to hear it just fine over the dish washer I work next to at the restaurant I work at. It keeps a charge for days when you're not using it at Max volume. I haven't had any problems with the Bluetooth or auxiliary connections, ans after two years of having it, I haven't noticed any audio quality decline.
 Received item quickly. You can't go wrong with this portable Bluetooth speaker!!  It sound great. Syncs up right away and the sound is great!  Would highly recommend!
 Just got it and listened to it once... pretty good sound! Happy with the price and clarity with some bass. I mean it's not a 12 inch subwoofer but it sounds good. (Coming from a guy who needs surround sound and subwoofers in the house/car)
 It’s 2019, why must I always be forgetting and adding the device back to my Bluetooth devices on my phone? This thing just HATES to stay connected. I’m on the edge of tossing it in the garbage and moving on with my life.
 I had originally wrote a one star review and shortly after I had recieved an email from Anker stating that they were sorry about my disatisfaction with the speaker and they actually sent me a new upgraded version to make me happy. Above and beyond . great speaker . great company .
 This speaker is the perfect size to take anywhere and delivers a nice, robust, pleasing sound. It has a row of buttons on the top of the unit for power, pairing with BT, volume, etc.<br/><br/>The speaker has a nice feel to it, almost feels like a very thin, rubberized coating. Not sure how or what this layer is, but it give the speaker a nice, non-slip surface for when carrying or transporting it.
 I got the speaker . speaker is very good sound is also good but when I got the speaker box was damaged
 I have known Anker for a while now, first for awesome batteries to recharge my phone.  Now they are into audio, using the awesome battery.  The sound is almost as good as Bose's, but at a lower price.  The battery last for 24 hours.  I also have the Anker 7908 speaker, and the SoundCore is better.  People at work can not believe such great sound from my phone, just by pairing with the new Anker SoundCore.  Get yours today!
 Very nice speaker for the price. You can feel the air pushed from the sub. I use it as my laptop speaker for music production.<br/>Pros:<br/>- I got it for less than forty dollars<br/>- Battery has long life, going on 12 hours as of writing.<br/>- It can go very loud for its size - good enough for a big room at a house party<br/>- Reaches lower frequencies than any other similar speaker I've owned (UE Boom, Mini Jambox)<br/>- Better sound clarity than the above speakers<br/>- Has a nice weight and feel to it.<br/>- Doesn't shake or rattle<br/>Cons:<br/>- Some distortion at very high volume<br/>- The start-up sound is kind of abrasive, low quality (hardly an issue)
 Loud, but not that loud.<br/>Descent range of sound. Bass could be better.<br/>Standard battery life.<br/>Worth your money.<br/><br/>Would buy again.
 I bought one for my sister, my boyfriend, and myself.  It's a great gift for basically anyone (without coming across too terribly generic).  Colors are good, looks high quality and sound is clear.  Doesn't get "the neighbors will hate us" loud, which I sometimes wish it did, but very rarely do I need that level of volume for my purposes.  Incredible deal for the quality and lifetime of the product.
 It is magnificent, It is worth every single cent of a penny. I use it for movies with my friends, awesome, for my everyday in Spotify, great.<br/><br/>In terms of sound, It is a warm sound, in my opinion, a little better response in the higher frequencies is the only thing that separates this product from the excellence.
 Awful product. Waste of money.
 Works well for in office speaker phone type operations as long as you pay attention to where the microphone is located. Sound quality and volume for playing music is limited. Battery life has been very good.
 High fidelity sound box. Very light and easy to carry. The battery is having a good duration by now.<br/><br/>I listen to various music genres, and they are good specialy in rock and hip hop. I tested other music and they are cool.<br/><br/>I think this Anker box is very good quality and for the price is a bargain. It worth the price.
 This was my first bluetooth speaker purchase.  Like most shoppers I went by ratings.  Speaker meets the reviews of other shoppers.  I didn't know what to expect, the high and mid ranges are excellent, while lower ranges are a bit lacking.  However, the speaker has great volume range and can get quite loud without sound quality degradation.<br/><br/>The design is nice and the battery life is excellent.  I give the speaker light use and I've only charged it once since I've purchased it.
 this product is perfect for my needs. I don't need something to play music or sounds at a blow my ears off loud setting but I do need something that has a very long battery life and this provides. Previous portable speakers I got were louder but the battery was only like 8 hrs and the rate I use it but with this one I have not killed the battery in a days use yet.
 Love it. Built quality is beyond expectation.  The battery last longer than 24 hrs. When disconnected your phone, it turns off to save power.
 Over all, I find Anker blue tooth products to be excellent. I have bought several Anker BT devices for my use and as gifts to family and I am pleased with the performance and value.
 Anker products are typically rock solid and this one is no different.  Don't walk into this purchase expecting to get the same sound you'd get for a $150+ speaker.  For the price/value, the sound is excellent / well balanced.  Anker customer service is absolutely top notch.  I purchased the small Anker cube speaker (A7908) about 2 years ago, still works via bluetooth but I use it primarily via an audio cable at the office and that connection recently started to fail.  After trading a few emails/suggestions to try, Anker provided a full refund of the purchase price with no hassle whatsoever, didn't even have to return the defective unit.  I used that money to get the Anker SoundCore...very satisfied.  Anker, your customer service ROCKS!
 I was a bit nervous about this product. Definitely felt like it fell in that "too good to be true" category, but it's everything I could have asked for in a speaker. Quality sound and loud enough to fill a cross fit gym (I use this to play music while I teach yoga). I would highly recommend it.
 considering the price, this is a nice speaker. It has clear quality and the volume control works through the phone preventing the issues that come with having multiple volume input options. Compared to other speaker's I have purchased in this price range, this is the best sound quality I have heard. It still does not compare to $100+ speakers.<br/><br/>It's also a nice size and battery lasts for a long time.<br/><br/>All in all, happy with this purchase, with the expectation that it's not the top of the line.
 Bought this for my daughter in early November and she has only charged it once since it arrived. The sound is great for the size and price. Very easy to use.
 It broke after one year. It's no longer able to connect to my phone or ipad. Disappointed.<br/><br/>Update: As it's covered by the anker 18 month warranty, Anker sent me a replacement unit. The soundcore 2 sounds even better than the first generation.
 great sound, can hook up to any device via Bluetooth or the Aux cable. Have not tested if it is really waterproof, but I don't want to find out the hard way it wasn't, so on land it shall stay. I am also planning on buying 2 more for family members who were jealous of mine... Did I mention how great it sounded ? It is also a considerable amount less money than the one made by JBL, has a longer range, sounds better, and even looks better.
 This speaker is incredible sounding. It took Alexa 30 seconds to find it and I can not believe the sound that comes out of this little box. I moved it 25 feet away and had no loss of connecroom what so ever.  I absolutely love it.
 It stopped pairing in two weeks. I liked the sound but had to return it. What pity! I dug my Jam blue speaker out and it still pairs perfectly. So I guess I will stick up with it..
 I keep this speaker in my office. It gives great sound quality with no distortion. The size and constructions and top quality. I get a lot of compliment on the color. I really like the sound and how much music I get to play before another charge is needed.<br/><br/>I got at an excellent price.
 Anker makes great products and this is another.  This is one of their cheaper speakers but it's still great.  Plenty of volume to fill a room or maybe a poolside.  Bluetooth is quick and easy.  Nice clicky buttons.  Great build quality and amazing portability.  This is a very small speaker that packs a huge punch.  I'd love to buy one of Anker's more expensive speakers, they must be really amazing.
 I think the sound on this thing is fantastic. The bluetooth pairs extremely quick, my kid has beat the hell out of it and there's not a scratch on it, and I like the design, sans-off center LED.<br/><br/>I'd buy another, just wish there was a waterproof version for my PWC.
 This is a perfect size and the sound was su uprising considering the price.  Thinking of buying several as gifts for others.  Great for on the deck or bathroom, no reason to vibrate the building or annoy the neighbors, plenty of spund right were you need/want it.
 I bought this speaker for my wife to use on her desk at the law firm she works at. I wanted her to have something that would have a good quality, full sound at lower volumes so she would be able to listen to her music and still answer phones and talk with clients/coworkers. This speaker is absolutely perfect for that.<br/><br/>My wife opened the speaker on Mother's Day and we tested it out at home. The sound quality really surprised me for how small the speaker is. Good sounding bass, and the high ends didn't sound tinny.
 I bought two Anker Soundcore Speakers while I was visiting the US two weeks ago. The reviews were amazing. At first, all went well. The sound came out clear and crisp, easily the best speakers I've owned.<br/>Yet, once I returned home (Israel), one of the speakers stopped connecting through bluetooth to several different devices. I tried turning it off and on. I tried turning my devices off as well, hoping to reboot the bluetooth and get the connection running again. Nothing helped.
 Great Product! Excellent sound! Sound is solid, great depth--even at high volume no distortion. Sound fills the room +.  As good as advertised! Thanks Anker!  ASIN:B016XTADG2 Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker with 24-Hour Playtime, 66-Foot Bluetooth Range &amp; Built-in Mic, Dual-Driver Portable Wireless Speaker with Low Harmonic Distortion and Superior Sound - Black--https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016XTADG2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3
 This little speaker packs a punch.  The sound quality is very good, but best of all, it pairs easily with many devices.  In the same day I have paired it with my phone, iPad, and Amazon Echo...each time it connected readily, such a plus!  Not only is the size good, the great red color is easy to spot in a cluttered area!  I have bought many Anker products...so far, none have disappointed.
 Wonderful speaker, really loud when needed. Brilliant quality and thundering bass for Hip-Hop songs. Perfect size, don’t really see how it could break unless you threw it in a bath tub. No complaints other than that the battery life is just a little short compared to other speakers of similar quality. However, for the price it’s the best speaker you could get!
 I liked the size and how it's small and compact which makes it easy to bring along when I go drinking with friends. Not big so it's not a pain to fit in bags or even your pocket. BUT for the size it's such an amazing quality sound. I bought 5 of the most popular portable speakers and this is by far the best and it was affordable. Great Size. Great Sound. Great Quality. Great Design. I AM THOROUGHLY SATISFIED 100%
 This is a great speaker for the price. It's loud enough for my needs and it has great bass tones. If your looking for something really loud this isn't the speaker for you. I love the battery life. I turn it on around 730 am and turn it off some nights around 9 pm and it doesn't show any signs of wearing down. One of my friends at work heard mine and bought one the next day.
 I don't really ever write reviews, but holy crap, this thing deserves it. I am by no means a speaker aficionado, and I only got this because it was on sale for $25, but I'm really glad I did. The amount of sound this thing puts out is comparable to some of the guitar amps I've seen. I placed it in my living room and about 75% volume and could hear it clearly in my bedroom 40 feet away with the door closed. My friends and I always struggle trying to find a speaker that we can bring to the beach that will consistently put out sound at a good volume, and when we do, there's always some sound loss after a while, but this speaker has fixed that problem as far as I can tell. Next beach trip I will putting this speaker though the motions to see how it holds up, but I have a feeling it'll exceed my expectations.
 Ten stars! This speaker is incredible. Great sound, easy to use, charged it on Christmas day and haven't had to recharge since! Use it 3 to 4 times per week during workouts, have even played it for several hours on Saturdays.....still going strong and it's almost July.
 This is a great speaker.  The sound is great.  I think that this speaker can compete with some of the bigger name speaker manufacturers.  It has a really rich sounds and just the right amount of base.  The battery last for a long time.  The size of the speaker is compact and light.<br/><br/>I carry this with me all the time.  I use it in my truck and at the office.  It has large control buttons and is easy to operate.
 I was surprise at how good these speakers sound. You can't beat them for the price. I highly recommend these speakers to anyone looking for something cheap but good quality sound.
 Microphone is so quiet, it's almost useless. Also, in a quiet room with no music playing, the speaker has a low hiss and pops a little every once in a while (probably some sort of power saving cycle). I guess it would be fine as long as you were only using it to play music. I wouldn't use it as computer speakers, or Alexa speakers though.
 I like this a lot - helps make the laptop hearable and has many other uses.  The only complaint I have is you can barely see the buttons and what their functions are on the top.  Black speaker with black button markers....maybe white or gray or something?
 The battery life is amazing on this. I have been moving and using this while I unpack to listen to music and it has been full battery still even after 7+ hours of continuous play. I am very impressed.<br/><br/>The sound is WONDERFUL. It's a tiny speaker so I did not expect just a loud volume coming from it. The quality of sound is just superb.
 I've owned this speaker for a little under a year, and I must say, I am very impressed with it. It's compact, it easily connects to my phone via bluetooth, and it has a lot of power.<br/><br/>This speaker packs a lot in such a compact size and can get surprisingly loud. I usually throw it in my bag and use it at work, at parties, or at home. The battery holds a very long charge--I think I've only charged it a dozen times since I've owned it!<br/><br/>If you're looking for an affordable bluetooth speaker, this is it.
 Great little speaker, I'd give it more 4.5 stars. After looking at about the 100 on here decided to go with this one after reading reviews. Definitely a great value. 5 stars it'd need a little better bass response. Slightly tinny with more bass heavy music, but for 1/4 the price of my dad's bose bluetooth it's only a half step behind. If you're looking for a good value and crazy battery life, this is it.
 This speaker was the perfect item to bring to the hospital while I was in labor. We played music 24/7 on this speaker and it provided me so much comfort. The battery life is amazing!
 This is the second one I bought. I bought this one for my daughter after she was always using mine and loving the long battery life and good sound.
 Love this unit, lasts a long time on the battery charge, sounds great, especially for its size, and can really belt out the tunes without distorting. There were a couple of little design/ergonomic issues that they seemed to address in the 2.0 version but I still love this little guy.
 Less than a year old and will no longer charge.<br/><br/>Too bad, was great while it lasted.<br/><br/>*** Update: They replaced the unit and were very helpful!<br/><br/>Am completely satisfied!
 I absolutely love this speaker it is the best speaker you can get for the money The battery lasts literally for 24 hours  It lasts 3 full 8 hour days at work.  And it contacts so quickly to Bluetooth it is awesome I'm barely have to hit the button and the phones connected to it. I recommend it to everyone I know that want a Bluetooth speaker
 Awesome product. The quality of the product is impressive. And for the price point at which the sound quality extremely satisfying. Battery life is more than satisfactory. Highly recommended.
 I have a 30-year-old car with no radio so I use this in the car and it sounds better than when I had a radio.  good battery life and very nice sound quality for the price range.
 I use it primarily as to replace a TV while exercising.  I use it with my tablet and Xfinity 'Stream' app to replace an older TV in my exercise room.
 I don’t think you can find something better than this product for what it does. Sound is great (not the best of the best). It has a mic. It has buttons to control the volume. It has a good design. It last long enough when used in Bluetooth. And it’s super affordable!
 Best sound speaker I have purchased yet plus it gets super loud better than most expensive ones for a better price I can be in my bathroom and can hear it still playing in the living room the sound is very clear as well
 Well, it's 23 USD, what more can you expect? Everything is working as expected. Sound quality is not superb, but fine for occasional music and movie watching via laptop or phone.
 Excellent bluetooth speaker, best I have ever owned. Bass and treble are smooth and consistent, vocal clarity is crisp and audible. The selling point for this speaker is the colossal battery! Its lasted me 10 hour work shifts with ease, charging is seldom needed! I swear by Anker for not only my charging needs but now audio.
 I use my speaker working outside in the garage and found that the bass and volume aren't quite where I would like but it still sounds good.<br/>Taking calls on the other hand is tougher and you need to have the speaker close to your mouth in order for the caller to hear you very well. It is probably better suited to inside use.
 Bought this as a second wireless speaker that I could leave at the office.  Decent sound but definately no "punching bass".  Probably worth the $29 Amazon deal of the day price but not any more....certainly not the $79 list price.  Sound is clear and bluetooth pairing with iPhone 5 was painless.  Bass is not as good as similarly sized and priced Creative Labs Muvo mini which I also own.
 Update: anker sent me a replacement speaker and it works great. They were quick to respond to the issue and helpful throughout the process. I appreciated their help and I'm glad to have this outstanding speaker at my disposal again.<br/><br/>Original: This speaker was great, but after about two months, it started not making sound. It still turns on, still connects via Bluetooth, but is mute. It doesn't make the turn on/turn off sounds or play anything from my devices that I try connecting to it. Every once in awhile, after I turn it on and off a hundred thousand times, it works, but I've given up and determined it is unusable. I didn't do anything to damage it, not sure what happened.
 I'm not sure why others are ranting about the bass on this thing. The bass is not that good at all. I bought it for use as a camping tent speaker. For the price it's OK.
 I love this speaker!! I own a Bose Soundlink Mini, but needed another speaker for another area of my house. I didn't want to spend another $200 for another Bose speaker, but wanted to get the best sound I could for the money. This speaker did not disappoint. Admittedly when I place them side by side the Anker doesn't quite have the clarity or rich low-end of the Bose. But for one fifth the price the sound is very satisfactory. And battery life… Wow! I've had the speaker for about a week, used it moderately, and haven't had to charge it yet. For me, it earns a full five stars for the value that you get.
 Sound quality is excellent. Clear tones, good connection via bluetooth and while I haven't tested the max volume, this speaker gets plenty loud for my purposes. The charging port is a little bit delicate, so we will see how that holds up, but overall, quality speaker and the red version is cute, to boot.
 I received the Anker SoundCore Bluetooth speaker in a very attractive blue and white box and the packaging looked and felt like the packaging for much higher end speaker.  The format is small, however it didn’t it feel cheap, had some weight and the rubberized feel was a pleasant surprise in my hands.<br/><br/>The speaker is a good price and the sound is what I expected for the size and small speaker format.  Extended or hyped bass was not expected and the speaker size and it had a good neutral sound.  I listen the Anker SoundCore Bluetooth speaker mostly on low to mid during the day or at night playing low soft music while in bed.<br/><br/>The only con would be the blue led is fine during the day and surprisingly bright in a dark room, however I took a piece of black gaffers tape and put it over the blue led and all is well.<br/><br/>I got the Anker SoundCore Bluetooth speaker as described on Amazon and very happy with my purchase and will recommend to friends and family.
 Got these speakers for my mother in law, who is 83. She had trouble hearing the TV, but not anymore! Even her son commented on the great sound coming from the speakers.
 Surprisingly good sound from such a small speaker. Works well with my bluetooth connections. The charge seems to hold well and works for a long time. Sure, you're not going to get window busting bass from such an item and the high end notes tend to be tinny and a tad clipped, but this was a great purchase. Well worth the money.
 Buy this little powerhouse of a Bluetooth speaker NOW!!  I played this next to my JBL charge ($150) and it more than held its own.  Love the 60+ foot range and the long charge held time.  Put it in a recessed window opening in a very large meeting room and WOW, sounds like a small studio monitor.  Recommend with ALL 5 stars.
 Honestly i wanted to love this speaker but two things do bother me. It really doesnt get that loud, i mean it gets up close to being loud enough but falls a little short. The one thing that kills me though...is that when its paired to my iphone, it kills my wifi speed. I can't listen to youtube songs with this issue. I go crazy repositioning my phone and the speaker. If my iphone isn't paired youtube loads videos almost instantly.
 I've owned this product for the past 6-7 months and my family and I loved it at first.<br/>Sadly enough around the first week of this month it started sounding distorted and just really spotty? It hasn't experienced any damage and it sucks to replace this before even a year of having it.<br/><br/>Update, 1/17<br/>I've been really busy but Anker has ben extremely helpful,providing the best customer service I've ever experienced. I've meant to update this for a while because they got back to me immediately. Turns out I had a faulty speaker (hey, it happens) and Anker was kind enough to talk me through it.<br/><br/>My daughter loves the speaker and still doesnt wanna let it go when its on. I'm pleased My husband chose this product and company, I fully recommend them.
 Great product. Got this for my husband because he listens to music on job sites and it's a nice small convenient speaker but its loud and sounds good and the battery last long!
 As someone who uses a Bluetooth speaker 5 days a week 9 hours a day I've gone thru quite a few . While my jbl flip is louder it only lasts a few hours at full volume while my new anker lasts all 9 hours and never lets me down.
 This speaker is easy to use and to pair with my cell phone. The sound quality is really good.
 Such a great product for the price.  My original unit's charging input became damaged through normal use.  I wrote to Anker to complain, and they sent a replacement unit promptly.  The second unit has been working awesome so far.
 I was looking for a decent bluetooth speaker that wouldn't break the bank but would sound great...which is a lot to ask.  This speaker checked all of those boxes.  It sounds great, is plenty loud and has better bass than what I was expecting.  The battery life is amazing and it charges again quickly.  I've used it inside, outside, in dry conditions and very humid conditions and it still sounds great.  I just recommended this to a friend at work and she is going to purchase it too (I brought it into work for her to listen to).  I'd recommend this speaker to anyone, especially if you aren't in love with the idea of spending a couple hundred dollars on a portable speaker!
 I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it! He previously used the Oontz Angle and this speaker blows it away! The sound quality is amazing, the bluetooth distance is awesome, and the battery life is crazy! We charged it on Christmas day and he has used it everyday since and it still hasn't died (today is 1/3)! Highly recommend!
 Absolutely love this speaker.  I have had several other brands and this is by for the best one. Nice high volume without distortion. It has pretty good bass sound for as small as it is. The battery life is off the chart. Ran it 3 separate times for several hours without charging and never died. Bluetooth pairing is seamless and painless. An excellent buy !
 For the price, this is an excellent little speaker.  It has beaten more expensive speakers in my work place and that makes me happy.<br/><br/>And, above all, it's a gorgeous color.  Okay, not really, but it is a great little speaker that does what it should.
 There’s a reason I buy Anker products. They preform and stand the test of time. Love this speaker. Sounds great and have had no Bluetooth issues!
 I've had this speaker for over 3 years and it's still kicking butt!  Not a boombox, but had enough volume for watching movies and listening to music on a computer or mp3 player.  Has great battery life (still!).  Is extremely compact!
 I bought this to play songs along with my acoustic guitar and it offers plenty of volume.  Very little distortion when you turn it up and it has a rich, clear tone.  Anker support was very responsive to a question that I had .  Only nitpick is that the buttons on top are hard to see and could use better tactile feel.  Overall a very impressive speaker at this price point.
 It's a nice speaker for the price. Bass is pretty weak, buttons on top are a pain in the ass, especially in the dark. I bought this for my bedroom to help me sleep, but the lowest volume setting is too loud.<br/>Sound like a negative review? Hardly. This thing costs less than $40, which makes it a nice value, and bass issue aside the sound quality is pretty decent. Finally, Anker customer support is amazing.
 Love the sound of this little speaker! It is amazing! The only downside is that I wish I could have them connect simultaneously with my Echo Dot, for the same music in several rooms. But that may be something the Echo Dot needs to offer. Not sure...
 Got it while it was on sale, great speaker, loud and clear. You have to push down on the buttons pretty hard though. Also, sometimes the "play" button works to pause, but sometimes it doesn't. Not perfect, but very sturdy, nice feel, nice look, and good sound.
 I've used this speaker now on several occasions.  Really happy with the sound quality and portability.  Battery life is very good - lasts a long time with continuous play.  Pairs easily with my iPhone 6.  Bought a protective case, which helps a lot, since this didn't include one.
 This little speaker is worth every penny I paid for it. I use it in my car when I’m driving because my truck I kind of loud and I absolutely love it. I have another speaker that I paid $75 for and this very similar to it and it cost 1/3 what the high end speaker cost. I would definitely recommend this to others for the cost. Well worth it.
 Solid little speaker with great battery life and sound quality, I was actually surprised with the quality of sound coming from this little box.  It was also well package and shipped safely.
 I returned this because it is not what I was looking for but mostly it made a constant clicking noise even with two different phones.<br/><br/>I had an issue but ankets to block customer service corrected it. I now how a fully functioning speaker I am very happy with the quality of it.
 I work in the underground mining field so if you want to listen to music you have got to bring it with you. This speaker has surpassed every expectation as far as sound quality, battery life, and portability goes.<br/>I've had it for two weeks now and use it all throughout my work day. I also haven't charged it because my phone tells me it's still at 90% battery life. That is 10 days of playing for 8 hours each day.
 The Anker Sound Core speaker is great for every day use. The sound is pretty even, not too much bass or treble and very clear. (Think Bose) For the size of the speaker, it puts out a lot of sound. The battery life is great as well.<br/><br/>Pros: Battery life, size, looks, clarity of sound, Bluetooth is strong, Aux 1/8 jack.<br/><br/>Cons: If you are a big bass fan, I would look elsewhere.
 The sound quality is great, but somehow every time I turn on the speaker, if my iPhone's bluetooth happens to be off and I turn it on it will not connect to the Anker. I have to remove it completely from my iPhone and add it in and pair the device from scratch. It happens all the time. Other than that, once it is connected the sound is great.
 It's not Bose surround sound but for a small portable thing the sound is pretty good. I use it while kayaking and while I'm in the shower. I highly recommend for outdoor stuff.
 I own a Beats Pill which I really like but I didn’t want to invest another $200 for an additional wireless speaker (just for my office).  Well, this little speaker is awesome…great sound and I saved $175!
 Got this bluetooth speaker for 30 here on amazon and I am very happy with that. The volume on this speaker belies its small size, it easily fills a room with sound. The sound quality on it is pretty good for the price. Doesn't get too muddy when you turn up the volume and the bass is respectable for a speaker this size and cost. The plastic is a nice soft touch plastic and feels great in the hand.<br/><br/>Pairing my nexus 6P to this was very straight forward and easy. Didn't even need the instructions, which are a little confusing to read due to having the translations thrown into the english directions.<br/><br/>Overall easy to recommend!
 I bought this as a Christmas gift, so I asked recipient/husband for his opinion.  He says he really likes it a lot, the bluetooth function works great and sounds good for its size.  (I can also attest to that, as a listener.)<br/><br/>We've always been pleased with Anker products, and this seems to be another winner.
 Anker speaker has great sturdy feel, great appearance, great sound for its size, plenty loud enough. We have used this speaker near the pool for several days and sounds great and is very clear. There has been no skipping or disconnect issues so far. I'm pleased with the purchase.
 Stopped working after a few months. Outside return window. It says 18 months warranty, but no info on how to submit a warranty claim. So basically I lost the money.<br/><br/>UPDATE 4/30/2018:<br/>AnkerDirect Customer Support contacted me directly and offered to replace my speaker at no charge.  Their customer service is great, and the new speaker hasn't had any issues.  I am happy to update that I would recommend this product because I can appreciate a company that stands behind their products, and if its wrong, they will make it right!
 Excellent product. Compact and sleek. Great sound. It was already charged when I got it. I turned it on, paired it with my device and got beautiful music immediately. When a call came in, it worked just like a speakerphone!<br/>One of my better purchases.
 Can't go wrong with this speaker for $40. I wanted to upgrade my old jawbone speaker without spending a lot.<br/>The battery claims of 24 hours might be right on. I've only charged it once in the three weeks I've owned it.<br/>The sound is very impressive for a small speaker. I listen to mainly rock music so the claims of limited bass don't bother me.<br/>The speaker also looks great and seems like it will hold up well. Overall great value for the cost.
 I love this speaker! I use it primarily short range in my house to listen to podcasts while I shower/clean/cook and it works perfectly. I've also used it while camping with my phone a little further away and it was a tiny bit glitchy, but still worked. For the price I highly recommend this speaker!
 Great sound! Obviously not a lot of base, but for the price it's fine. My only problem so far is that the 66ft Bluetooth range is b.s. if my phone is more than 10 feet away the sound starts to break up. That kind of sucks. My sister still likes it though. So I may give it to her and buy a better one.
 This Bluetooth speaker is a great value! It connects to Echo smoothly. It has lower and raise volume buttons that I can use by touch in a dark room. And it has a decent sound quality.
 I bought this along with a DOSS soundbox. It doesn't sound as good as the soundbox, but it's more compact. It also doesn't have the soundbox's annoying lights. Good product for the money. No problems pairing and it stays connected to the echo dot without dropping the connection.
 I LOVE my Anker speaker, it's size is perfect.  The sound is is that of a much larger speaker.  I played it all day yesterday and was still going strong when I turned it off.  This is my third purchase of a bluetooth speaker and it is my far the best!!  Only problem is remembering to charge it as I forget since it plays so long on one charge.
 Very loud and clear sound. It's a bit smaller than I thought it would be but it's very nice and loud for the size. Just make sure the bluetooth volume on your phone is all the way up.<br/><br/>Edit: I use this almost every day for a few hrs at a time. Have only had to charge it once since I got it. Long lasting charge. Comes fully charged to.
 holy crap this thing is amazing, the soudns is fantastic, bass is great mids are nice and crisp. its got great sound rangea nd huge volume. actually hooked it to my PC for gaming and sounds pretty great for that just messing around with it. the bluetooth worsk great and the battery although takes a bit to charge lasts a long time
 I charged this this one time fully when I took it out the box and haven't charged it sense. I use it for conference calling on day a week for about 4 hours each time, and so far it might just now be getting below 50% battery after at least four or five weeks.<br/>I've had no complaints about sound quality in terms of people on the other end. I usually stand up to six feet away from unit and I am heard perfectly. Voices are very clean coming thru the unit also.<br/>It's ok for playing music. Low end bass can't be heard but you prolly shouldn't expect that from this little thing anyway.
 Edit: i got a replacement speaker via complimentary warranty that functions just fine. B+ rating due to original issue. When i first received Anker Speaker it had a defect (volume suddenly stopped working) which surfaced by 3rd day after little to no prior use i couldn't believe it so i tried to fix several times  but nothing solved the problem. i received a replacement speaker (free of charge) shortly after sending my complaint. thanks for the speedy response time.
 Got it as present for daughter. Build quality is durable metal. Weight is substantial. Build quality, from what you can tell from the outside, is very good. Audible quality is better than expected. Bass exists without being over-hyped. Mids and Highs are balanced nicely. Perhaps a touch too much high mid, so can get a little bit shrill on certain genre's, but not annoyingly so.<br/><br/>Overall, having never heard of this brand before, I am impressed. If its longevity matches its other features, it will be a great product. I like it enough to buy a more expensive model for myself, expecting even more from what I deem as a very good product for the money. I would only hope that more expensive models actually up the quality, but this one is great.
 This is a straight forward little speaker that pairs quickly and functions well.  My only criticism is that it is a little heavy on bass.
 The first one had a faulty USB port but they reached out to me and replaced it ASAP. I love the ease of connection, the loudness, and the quality sound from such a small device is incredible. I have yet to run out of battery and I use it for hours every day. Worth the price for sure.
 Bought this as an inexpensive unit to be used in garage and outdoors. Works well and has very good sound. Only downside is it doesn't have a plug in plug for charging (it has to be plugged in to a USB port).
 I was very happy with the product for the first two months until I was no longer able to connect via Bluetooth ultimately deeming it useless.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Anker reached out to me less than 24 hrs of writing this review with troubleshooting recommendations or a replacement. Although I had already tried this, it worked and no replacement was necessary as of now. Glad to have it working again.
 Pros:<br/>Connection is easy<br/>Sound is clear and decent quality for compact size.<br/>Buttons on speaker allow for a lot of control.<br/>Compact size<br/>Battery lenght<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Not even close to 66ft. range.<br/>Button controls are finicky.<br/>Sound isn't as good as slightly larger bluetooth speakers I have.
 I was on the verge or returning this item because there would be a loud static sound - - almost like a loud boom, every time you turned it on, but oddly enough, only on the 1st day.  This happened on the very first day after being charged.  I immediately went back online, submitted a return form and had all the intentions of sending it back.  As luck would have it, I needed to use the speakers the next day for a work function.  I turned it on and no boom.  I used it again the next day - - no static or boom.  I've been using these speakers every day since then and have had no other issues.  Sound quality is pretty good for such a compact item.  Would have given it 5 stars had I not had those issues on day one.
 Very impressed by the sound and response of these compact speakers.  Very nice balanced sound.  Very intuitive to pair.  Very high-end feel and beautiful construction and feels like they would cost much more.  Love this product.  Another quality Anker item for my collection.
 Update (Jan 2017): It has been more than a month since I charged it and I have been using it as laptop sound extension, music player for at least two-three hours every day. On my iPad it still shows 70% battery. At this point I am just concerned if it is using a loophole in space-time to bend matter around it and harness its energy!<br/><br/>Original post: My choice was between JBL Flip 3 ($80+) and other Sony products under $100. What I realized from store demos is that a decent room filling sound can only be achieved with JBL Charge and up ($120+). The reason I bought it is because Flip 3 only has marginally better sound, not worth justifying more than double the price. If you want to upgrade from phone speakers, this is a good and major step-up. If you are looking for a stereo music system replacement, go for bigger ones.
 Use it to link iPhone or iPad. However, when switching between different devices the pairing doesn’t always work until I delete the speaker in my setting and have it detected again. Other than that sound quality is better than other speakers of that size or smaller.
 I was really nervous about ordering this as a gift for someone who is a musician. Being that the pricing is on the more affordable side, I didn't know if that would affect the quality of the speaker. After doing some research of chose this speaker because many reviews found it to be reliable and well worth it. I was not disappointed and neither was my giftee!  I may even order a couple more. Great for myself and awesome as a gift!
 So I bought this based on reviews, using iTunes on an iOs device, in all bought the Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz, Anker Soundcore, Anker Portable Bluetooth Speaker, and Klipsch Gig, to see which really had the best sound. Intend to keep the best of the 4.  I already own the Bose Soundlink Mini II, but looking for another to add to house. Received everything as expected, carefully opened each and started to get them all powered up. I rate them from best to worst, based on sound and ease of use. I listen to music 75% of my day, everything from Pop, Rock and EDM<br/><br/>1. Klipsch GIG- Decent design, excellent sound, easy power up and connections over bluetooth, don't care for the Knob on top, and the power switch being on the end of unit, also the charge port is there, so when charging the stand or belt seems in the way, but is manageable. Beats out the others as far as sound quality, provides great room filling sound, and when more than 10 feet away still sounds great.<br/><br/>2. Anker Soundcore- Excellent design, sharp looking, soft rubber coating, easy to power up, easily connects, nice soft buttons on top to control source. I have to say this is my favorite design of the 4, sound quality is great, but if the speaker is not facing you directly you can't hear everything. Would be great for an office, the sound is still 3 times better than both of the last units. Just don't care for the one directional sound. If on a budget would be a great speaker.<br/><br/>3. Anker Portable Bluetooth- Nice design, small square, don't like that sound directed straight up, powers up quick, connects quick, on/off switch instead of soft button like others, but easy to use. Sound definitely better than the OontZ, but not by much, to me sounds like my phone in a coke can.<br/><br/>4. OontZ Angle 3- decent design, super light, powers up quick and connects easily, but sound is poor, and empty, and cheap, compared to others
 Second Anker product. This is a great add in the garage. Fills it up and you can hear it outside. It could use a little more bass, but I’m not worried about that while working out.
 Awesome little speaker with lots of sound! Bought this for my teenage son and he loves it. It goes everywhere with him and puts out more sound than we thought possible! Great for traveling!
 I love this speaker. I use it as a wired speaker for my PC and a portable speaker on the go. I have had it for about six months now without any trouble. It is very loud and has good bass for music. If you need a good speaker but don’t want to spend a lot of money, this is the best option out of the many I have tried.
 The SoundCore 2 has some slightly better conveniences than this model (like not having to hold the power button down long to turn device on). For the sales price this model is good. Sound quality is still great.
 I like the speaker. I just think that the words and photos in the description made it sound like this item included an AUX cable, but it doesn't. So if you want to connect direct to Alexa without BT, buy a cord separately. And the charging cord ends in USB, so be prepared to use your plugs or computer.
 This takes a while to connect to Alexa  after I power on. Other devices connect almost instantly but this takes five seconds or so. The main reason I purchase this was for Alexa, other than that quality is decent
 These little speakers pack some serious punch. I can’t believe how loud they are! The range, though, is something that can be improved. I can’t walk from one end of my house to the other without it disconnecting.
 So far this battery is very good. Sound, range, simplicity of use, everything you can ask for in a wireless speaker. I was pleasantly surprised at how great it sounded! I bought a different speaker at Best Buy paid More for that one and I returned the Best Buy higher priced speaker.
 This bluetooth speaker has a very good battery life (lasted for around 18 hours worth of play time before I recharged it still had more juice to go) so it most likely does hold up to its battery life expectancies. It is very simple to connect to bluetooth and use. Overall very good compact bluetooth speaker!
 Works great plenty loud enough makes a great alarm clock as well I used this to amplify the loudness of my alarms on my phone works like a charm I used this for three day just listening to music and talking on the phone before it had to be recharged the first time.
 The sound on this is good but not really amazing. What is impressive is the battery life. I bought this for my nephew who uses it all the time and says he almost never charges it. I don't know what's so special about the battery inside this speaker, but I've never see one that lasts so long.
 Takes forever to charge , sound not that great ! Honestly I thought was buying the newer version the soundgard 2 . But after this not sure it would have been any better!!!
 Really small but easy to maneuver through pairing with Bluetooth (autopairs so no convoluted process of pairing and unpairing). Not too loud sound, but considering it's price and size it gets the job done.
 Sound is decent, not great. USB port broke after it's initial charge... now I have to press the cable in a 10th of a millimeter (no further!) after it makes contact for it to start charging.<br/><br/>Update: Shortly after this review, AnkerDirect Customer Service contacted me about the issue and offered to send out a replacement and I'm happy to report the replacement speaker has now survived multiple charges and received a lot more usage. After I was able to spend more time with the product I became impressed by the connection strength (even in heavy traffic areas) and the extremely low latency.<br/><br/>The real highlight here though is the excellent customer support.
 So it might now be the loudest speaker in the world but for its size its pretty impressive. Also, I moved out of my apartment eight months ago (which was the last time I remember charging it) and I haven't charged it since. The battery life is incredible. All in all, I'd order it again.
 The speaker is perfect.  It is a good size to take almost anywhere (too big to ride in my bike jersey pocket, hahaha).  Perfect for the office, the yoga studio or wherever you may find yourself needing some music.  Set up and connection super easy.  Good sound quality.
 I changed my review. I bought this in January. Now there is a crackle in the speaker that simply does not go away. I have two of these and it is true for both. It also does not matter whether you are playing through bluetooth or the aux cable. The speaker crackles and pops in both cases. Do not waste your money. It should work without crackling.
 Amazing sound quality! I placed it in a centrally located position in my house &amp; I car hear it throughout!! Great product!! Looking forward to being able to use it outside on my patio when winter is over!!<br/>Thank you!!
 Slick, elegant and works perfectly. No, it doesn't "bring the sound of a full orchestra" into my bedroom, but it is a musical small speaker system at an amazing price. When combined with an Amazon Dot it provides sound and Internet capabilities for &lt;$80: literally unimaginable a few years ago!<br/>A small flaw: I very much wish there were a way to defeat the flashing blue light that shows it's on. Still, highly recommended.
 For background music in a small to medium size room,  or for your personal space - I love this little box.  Only one problem, it's hard to see the control buttons on top, since they are like a raised braille.  Since I use mine in low light, like when I'm going to sleep, I painted mine with model airplane paint.
 This is the second Anker bluetooth speaker that I have purchased.  I love the first one and I love this one.  I bought this one to use in my sewing room.  It wasn't even fully charged and I plugged it in to charge and synced it to my IPad and I was in no time, listening to Pride and Prejudice.  The sound is great, operation couldn't be easier.  Don't question this speaker if you need a good bluetooth speaker for a craft room, library, bedroom or wherever.
 This is a great speaker, size and price wise. I use it with my MAC for watching videos and movies it's great.  It has a very good range so you don't have to have it right next to you and it has long life battery which makes it even better.
 I have always been pleased with every purchase I have made of Anker products and this little speaker carries on that experience.  The product is sturdy and seems well made.  Considering the size of the speaker the sound quality is more than satisfactory as is the volume range. It was easily paired with other electronics and overall we are extremely satisfied. So much so that we plan on buying a couple more!
 This ia a great little speaker with an awesome price point. I use it at work everyday and have had no problems so far. I like how it turns off by itself after being inactive for a bit. My old one didn't do this so the battery was always running out if i forgot to shut it off. I like the outer material, feels like suede! And the bluy color is awesome. Oh and the sound is great, too!
 Good little speaker for the kitchen or beach. Battery last for days. Sound is not a Bose product the price is not either!  The only issues is connecting to my iPhone 6.  The Bluetooth connection needs to be reset (forget device) and reconnected each time.  My friend has a Sansung Note 8 and does not have the same issue. Search for a discount code before checking out.
 As usual the Anker company produces. I don't know how to do it. Don't let the price fully Ortiz are quality speakers. The sound is awesome and the battery just seems to go forever. Highly recommend it. When I told people the price they don't believe me
 My second Anker potable speaker, last one is 4-5 years old and still cranking. I bought the new one for upgraded sound, which it delivered.<br/>Used it all day in line for a concert and while working on a job, battery life is good so far. Great for the price!
 I'm super happy with this speaker.  The sound is fantastic and the product is sturdy and well made.  This is a amazing speaker for this price.
 Tried 3 different speakers for my dads tablet and using Skype.<br/>Altec Lansing CO2<br/>Altec Lansing mini CO2<br/>Philips<br/><br/>This speaker doesn't shutdown after 5 minutes (dad has a hard time finding the buttons) and it holds the volume level you last set.<br/>The volume was greater and no distortion and max level.<br/>Haven't tested the 24 hour battery but it lasted 12 hours no problem.<br/><br/>The microphone on this as a hands free phone is outstanding and people aid I was crystal clear<br/><br/>Recommenced.
 I gave this 5 stars for the battery. There is no bluetooth speaker with anywhere near the battery life of this Anker speaker. I use it at night on the nightstand to listen to podcasts and other talk shows. I always fall asleep without shutting it off and it is always still playing the next morning. I have done this 5 times since I got it and it is still on it's FIRST charge. It has exceeded the 24 hours by a lot (probably because of the low volume). My last speaker would not have even made it through the first night. Sound is just OK, but good for it's size. If long battery life is what you need, there is no better choice.
 Excellent crisp sound that surprised me tho the bass isn’t super deep or powerful but it still has some. Definitely worth the money!
 This speaker completely died about a month after use. But other than that, it was a great product!
 Better than expected. Only issue is it will not pair to my second phone. Having trouble unpairing the first device. Great sound and battery life though!
 Having a rechargable and very portable speaker comes in handy for camping or working outside in the yard. This speaker has a good battery life and the speaker sound quality is great. I have no problem hearing it outside or when I'm cleaning the house and moving between rooms. Overall I would recommend.
 I love this speaker. Sounds like a speaker much larger than it is. Its even appropriate for my large living room. All the sounds of a song are preserved and it has amazing bass. I love how you can listen to any genre on it seamlessly; I think that's the best part.
 Purchased to amplify music streamed from phone while outdoors. Works great. Easy setup process (just pair with Bluetooth device).  Music does not distort at full volume. Low range could be stronger, but this is acceptable given the speaker's size and price. Great value for the price.
 We own several and really enjoy them. Just as important, they stand behind their products. We had an issue with one unit and they replaced it with no questions.
 When I first opened the box I was disappointed. I said to myself "how can this have good sound, it seems small" I WAS WRONG. When I powered it up and paired it with my Iphone I was pleasantly surprised. I use it for podcast listening mostly but it also has nice sound for music. I'm planning on purchasing additional units. A nice feel, well priced and sounds great.Quality product.
 Awesome little speaker that I use with my phone.  Does it beat my stereo at home?  Heck No!  but for what it is...it's outstanding.  The sound is very good and worth the price by FAR.  I did hear the JBL speaker at best buy and that one was slightly better but 90 bucks.  For the money this one was close enough.  Great Purchase I'm thrilled
 Its smaller, and there by not as loud, as i thought it would be. It puts out a decent amount of sound and suits my needs well.
 This is a great little speaker. Puts out good quality. Cant go too far from it or the music skips but we havent had any issues with that too much.
 Spend the extra 20 dollars and buy something with larger speakers.<br/>This one does the job just fine for a medium sized room 12' x 10'<br/><br/>The one I did was to buy a large salad serving plate and put this in it. It amplified the sound a little bit.
 The product itself is a wonderful device. Full-bodied sound, overall a great speaker and a great price. Ease of use is also an excellent perk. However, the way the product shipped has me somewhat worried. The product shipped in a standard cardboard box, which was fine. My issue is the packing materials, or lack there of. There was literally nothing inside the box holding the product in place. During shipping, the product was free to bounce, roll, and strike all sides of the larger box it was put in. The product seems sturdy enough to withstand the shipping process, and is in complete working order. But, I would have loved for it to have been shipped more responsibly. Thus, the 4-star review.
 Bought two of these for my teenage boys. Sound is great and clear. They've been using it for about months now. So far, so good! Holds charge well, and picks up signal well.
 This has made listening to music in the kitchen while cooking much better.  It gets plenty loud.  Sound is not super high quality but drastic improvement over listening to Pandora on my tablet.  Would recommend.  It syncs easily.
 I bought this speaker roughly a month ago, and it works fantastic! I was looking for a speaker that was small and lightweight where I could listen to at home, at a friends house, after school, and family get togethers. And this is the perfect speaker for it! The battery life on this speaker is impeccable and gives great sound as well as bass for its size. It is easy to use and is very durable (I have dropped it several times and nothing happens). I definitely recommend!
 Excellent! Lightweight, nice looking, and volume has a very loud capacity. Perfect also for presentations, travel, office, home, and etc.<br/>The case fits perfectly!
 Excellent for use poolside (in a dry area of course). Great sound quality and battery life. Can be difficult to connect via Bluetooth sometimes, but would purchase again should our current one bite the dust.
 Very good Bluetooth speaker. I would buy it again. Only thing that is annoying is that when my wife has her phone hooked to it, I have to "forget" this device in Bluetooth settings and re-add to take over as the user. It is probably more of an issue with Bluetooth than this device though.
 Excellent sound. I use it in my bedroom and master bath where there isn’t a good outlet for Alexa. Only dislike are the push buttons on top.
 Had this speaker one day short of a month went to return it on the 30th day and was denied a way to return it.money given away.  Don't recommend this product.
 Way more then I expected.  I use it everyday for audiobooks, probably 3-5 hours every day.  I charge it maybe once a month.  It's super loud.  We use it for music also in the back yard and it's plenty loud enough.  The only thing is with music it could use more bass.  I highly recommend this speaker.  You won't be disappointed.  I don't usually do reviews, but I bought this in April and I still love it every day when I turn it on.  I am amazed how long I can go before I have to charge it.<br/><br/>I researched for a good month for something portable and to listen to my books with, I could not be happier.
 I like the size and the sound quality of this speaker. If I were to have one complaint, it would be that there is an obnoxious beep when you reach the maximum sound level. I understand the purpose of notifying the user that they have reached the maximum level but I think a more subtle sound cue would be nice.
 Originally had a JBL for 5x the price.  This speaker is smaller,  lighter,  and sounds just about as good for a MUCH lower price point.  Good sound and bass  and love being able to listen to my 3000+ songs
 Really love this unit. Great sound, very easy to connect. Bought in blue with case for husband and liked it so much bought a second one for a relative. Perfect size for indoor and for patio.
 This is a really great speaker and high quality, but I would expect nothing less from Anker.  I always feel like they produce high quality electronics including computer batteries.  I do wish it would get just a little louder so I could hear it all over the house, but it is a fairly inexpensive speaker so I am perfectly happy with it.
 Good for the price. Sound quality is good, sturdy material. No skip forward option on device, poor Bluetooth range and it didn’t come with a charger box, only a very short charging cord. Luckily i have a ton of charging boxes laying around. Seems to be a quality product as long as your not looking for range.
 For the cost and size this is a good buy, but don't expect any realistic bass. I use it mostly to listen to talks on Youtube and voice is reproduced nicely so does the job. But having heard the Bass on the Bose which is a similar size, I can see why it costs more! But again, for the cost it is good enough.
 I got mine last week snd I loved it - until it stopped playing and the would not power on again. Thought the battery had gone dead, but recharged it overnight and it refuses to power on.
 Purchased this for my husband in his workshop - the equipment was too loud for him to hear his phone that he uses to play the Sirrius radio.  This works great.  EASY to set up, great sound quality and volume.  He is very happy, and I'm happy I didn't have to spend a fortune to achieve the desired result!
 I like the sound and design. Truly. My biggest complaint is it cuts out way too much. I have it paired to a Dot. It goes silent way too much in the middle of songs. It's a shame as it sounds wonderful for it's size when it works.<br/><br/>Edit. I tried pairing it with my S7 Edge and no problems. I now think there's a problem with the Amazon Dot i have. Will up product to a 4 star. Bass still a little weak, but can't have it all I guess.
 It has great sounding quality and long battery life which I really love. Though, it's a bit inconvenient to find and hold down the buttons because of the design. Also, not quite as loud as I expected (then again it's a relatively small and inexpensive speaker) and could not hear at all during a pool party. But if you're in a room it works well. The range for using your phone isn't quite great and if you just happen to put your phone in another room is starts to intefere with the speaker but that's okay with me because I keep my phone close to the speaker.
 It was great when I first got it! And I agree w all the positive reviews. But after less than 2 months the sound started to get spotty until it just cut out so much it drove me crazy :(  this happened no matter where I placed it or how charged up it was. I'm so disappointed because I like it sooo much. Maybe I got a lemon. I'm returning it this week.
 Purchased this Anker to replace an older Bluetooth speaker. Initial impression was good as the unit seem robust but the USB connection could use improvement. Speaker had a loud midrange sound but really lacks any lowrange base.<br/><br/>As for sound clarity it’s ok. Not bad but not great. The unit serves its purpose but nothing about it stands out.
 This is the 2nd Anker speaker I have purchased.  I have the Anker Classic (love it) and purchased this SoundCore model for my grandson.  He uses it almost every day and the sound rivals that of a more expensive speaker.  It's built tough, too, as he takes it everywhere.  In my opinion, for the money, this is a great little speaker.
 These speakers are resilient, sturdy, and sleek with an understated design. It can easily fill a moderately sized living room with the boom-pop of Isaiah Rashad to the quiet whispers of Sufjan Stevens. The charger cable shares the matte aesthetic. You really can't go wrong with Anker products; the average stars/reviews do not lie!
 Never had heard of Anker.  All I can say is WOW!  The quality of the sound this little guy makes is nothing short of spectacular.  Golly, even the packaging impressed the heck out of me.  Connected easily to my Kindle and off I went into my back yard while the Kindle stayed in the house.  My neighbor thought I'd installed outdoor speakers........  Highly recommend this product!
 Anker has quickly become my go to brand for compact electronics. After having such wonderful experiences with my Powerport USB Hub and Powercore portable charger, I looked to Anker first for a new bluetooth speaker and they did not disappoint. The sound quality is perfect for a product of this nature. It's easily portable, though I haven't even had a reason to move it since I can traverse my apartment with my phone in my pocket and never lose connectivity! Not to mention it seamlessly syncs between my phone, tablet, and laptop with no issues.
 Bought as a gift for my daughter to replace broken ihome, she says it’s way superior, far better sound quality and for fraction of price. Bought the red to match her decor. I’m sold on Anker, purchased small shower Bluetooth and it performs better than my Jambox, highly recommend
 I LOVE this little speaker.  It has great sound in a little package for a minimal price.  The excellent quality of the sound was actually surprising to me.  It was very easy to set up and pair with my iPhone.
 Has great bass, great range, great battery life and a great sound. Take it with you to the office, or while you're on the go! This is the best little Bluetooth speaker I've ever seen and I've had it for about a few weeks and haven't had to charge it yet. I already have five friends buying it since they saw me with it!<br/>Update 6/20 Anker sent me a replacement and made sure to constantly check in with all warranty questions when I contacted them about an issue with the speaker-still would recommend them 100%
 I was a little disappointed when I first saw this speaker. After using it at work for a week now I am actually impressed.<br/> I use it at work with my iPhone. It has yet to require a recharge or loose connection.  It sounds pretty good considering i work in a large garage area. It puts out some pretty good volume too.
 Awesome speaker. I have no complaints at all. It connects to anything I need it to, and it will play for days of normal use without a recharge.<br/><br/>It isn't the loudest, but it's adequate. If I could change one thing it would be that. Just a touch more volume would be nice.
 I've always used Anker products, no matter what I buy I'm never disappointed<br/><br/>The sound is amazing for a budget speaker, it looks great and feels good on the hand, this is a Christmas present for the little sister that is deeply into music, she will be happy.<br/><br/>Even the unboxing was pleasant. (I needed to test it)
 Little size but BIG sound! We had a Creative D200 and this speaker blows that out of the water. It’s already winning because it’s rechargable so no more outlet hunting to use it and it has a surprisingly large amount of low end. Would buy again!
 Really awesome product! I did just a little research because I needed a small speaker with bluetooth, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money for a crappy little speaker. So glad I found reviews and recommendations on this one!! It is such an amazing speaker for the price. Haven't had it long enough to test the battery life or source distance claims, but I'm optimistic about those given the other reviews. Such incredible sound. I'm not sure I've ever had a speaker of any type that sounded this good. I don't normally write reviews good or bad, but this product really exceeded all expectations! Did I mention the amazing sound quality? Did I mention the excellent price? Oh yeah, I did :-) . It's probably going to be my go-to gift item for the foreseeable future as well.
 Gave this to our grandson for Christmas and he loves it. I heard it and it has good sound. I paired it up with an Amazon Basics Travel Bag and it fits in perfect along with the charger, cables, etc I have many products made by Anker and in my opinion this is just another Great product that Anker make. Not the top of the line but good enough for basic music, pod casts, etc.
 Hands down, this is the best sounding compact Bluetooth speaker I own, in fact, I like it so much I ordered another!<br/>This thing is powerful, well built and very user friendly.<br/>I discovered today the thing is actually stereo although separation is minimal but you can detect the spacialness of stereo when listening at close range. Just order it, you will not be disappointed !!
 Great Value, Pretty Descent Sound<br/>i have a bose soundcolor too and this one is easier to get connected via bluetooth Battery last a lot.
 Honestly reviews aren't my thing, but I want to say that for the price it certainly can't be beat. I use this to listen to music in the shower, cleaning my apartment, etc. I know the battery life says 24 hours but that has to be lowballing it because I've maybe charged it four times total since I bought it, and that was 360 days ago. It won't be mind-blowing in terms of audio quality - you won't hear things you've never heard before in songs - but I have no complaints, no static, no inability to correctly reproduce all sounds, etc. I'm writing this because I'm buying one right now to send to my parents so they have one for when I visit.
 Connects easily to my TV using a TROUND wireless transmitter. Sound is incredible! packaging was excellent and shipping was super fast.
 Decided to take a chance and buy after reading the reviews. Really easy to use. iPhone 7 plus doesn't have a headphone jack and I like to play audiobooks for my 8th graders so I was trying to figure out a solution. This speakers gets plenty loud enough to fill a classroom and then some. Sound is great and the perfect fix to not having and audio jack in the newer phones.
 So far I have had no problems with this speaker. I like to ride my mountain bike and find earbuds annoying so I play my music out of my backpack with this sometimes. It's much louder then most budget speakers, but when you turn up the volume it doesn't lose sound quality as much as other speakers. This thing has also survived a few drops already so I'd say it will last a while.
 This little guy really pumps out the sound.  Speakers in my old truck are messed up, and I don't want to spend money and timer replacing them.  Even with the windows down, this little guy cranks out enough sound to hear my tunes going down the road in my diesel truck.
 Love this little speaker.  Nice when sitting outside and want some music. It remembers the last device connected to.  On previous connected devices I've had to "forget" the device and then reconnect.  Quick fix one I figured out I had to do it. Good volume level and nice sound.  Not sure how long the battery goes for since I charge it after a coupe uses.  I bought this at listed price!
 Review update:  After writing the negative review, an Anker representative contacted me by e-mail and offered to replace my defective  speaker. The new speaker is working well so far. At least the upper level customer service representatives try to make the customers happy.<br/><br/>The power cable lasted exactly 2 weeks past the warranty then the connection between the speaker and the power cable did not work. The company would not do anything to help. I guess I will need to buy a new speaker - but NOT AN ANKER!
 For the price I paid (it was on a lightning deal I think) It's a great product. The sound quality can't be compared to higher range products but the features compensate the audio quality for people that look for a decent speaker with great battery life.<br/>I bought two as a present for friends (which are not audiophiles) and they both love it.
 Love this.  A great speaker for the price.  I enjoy the mobility and think the sound is great.  It is clear even at high volumes.  I am sure there are more expensive ones that can get even louder, but for my indoor and backyard use, this is great.  The only issue I might have is that it is hard to see the buttons at night since it is black on black.  No biggie.
 It's not perfect.  Can't get my phone too far away or have too many walls between us but for the price it is great.  Battery is very good and quality is surprising for the price.
 this thing is a beast! however, that beeping sound it makes when it connects/disconnects/reaches the max volume NEEDS to stop!! or at least be half the volume. it's so loud!!
 I use this speaker daily with no complaints. Perfect speaker for numerous occasions. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a reasonable priced bluetooth speaker. Great quality and super long lasting charge.
 Hard to beat this speaker for the money! It really sounds great and is easy to use.  I have a friend who has a speaker that cost a lot more, and doesn't sound nearly as good, nor does the battery last as long.
 This works very well with quality sound and good volume; I was impressed that when I adjust the volume on it, I could see the volume control on my tablet change.
 I was expecting this to have a better sound profile with better volume and bass response.  I usually love Anker products, but this one did not meet my expectations.
 What's IN this thing?  What makes it sound so good? Full and rich. How can it pump out that much sound? Go on, crank it up! How can the battery last so long? All day and all of the night. How can it even feel good to the touch? So small and light! How can it be so perfect in every way???
 I am very impressed with the little speaker.  Feels solid and seems to be high quality.  The sound is very impressive for a non- Bose speaker this size.  I plan on picking up another.
 I was looking for a portable Bluetooth speaker with great bass and deep sound at an affordable price. This fit the bill. I was shocked at how amazing it sounds! I would have paid a lot more for this speaker because it is pretty badass! It's easy to pair, and not to mention the battery life is ridiculous! I haven't had to charge it yet and I use it all the time!!haha  I read in a previous review that the guy went camping for four days and they listen to the speaker the entire time. It finally died on the last day, but that's how long it lasted! Amazing. I give this speaker a 10/10! LOVE it!
 I own three of these. Cheap enough to have in three places in the house. Anker stuff is VERY good stuff at a very good price.
 Worked wonderfully for months -- however, it now plays with tons of crackle and pops. I use this speaker with a projector to watch movies, and the constant crackling definitely kills the movie experience. I have to turn it on and off, reconnect bluetooth, etc to have decent quality before it snaps back to crackling in a few minutes. I've tried replacing the speaker, connecting it to an aux cord, nothing really works. Gonna get a new speaker -- maybe JBL this time.
 This was a mediocre speaker with a great battery life. Sound wasn’t particularly good, but it did the trick. But after 20 months of semi-regular use, it’s now dead. Won’t turn on, but it acknowledges that it’s charging.<br/><br/>You get what you pay for I guess.
 Really great speaker system here.  I needed something that I can travel to when I want to listen to some music or do work on, and I need some good ambience for my listening habits.  This speaker does the trick with a really long charge and I think it's awesome considering my mini clip from JBL crapped out.  Would recommend.
 Sound quality is good and charge last for the whole day. Connects automatically to your last used device once you turn on the speaker and turns off within 10 minutes after it has lost the connection. Rubber case helps to hold the speaker into place without sliding.
 It really really has everything, sound quality, portable and durable battery, you can save a lot money buying this model instead of a bosse
 Has a great sound last a long time before you have to charge it and I can go from room to room with my speaker great product
 Less than 5 months of very little use of the device the bluetooth does not reconize at all even after fully charging it and rescanning, plugging into the auxillary port still functions but the whole "wireless" feature of this speaker is lost. Not worth the price and suggest looking at other brands than this.
 Compact and well-made. The sound (including bass) is powerful and clear, not overwhelming. A very nice little unit. You will be pleased with the sound and the value.  Set up was simple. The instruction booklet is very minimal, but I really did not even need it.<br/><br/>Only negative I can think of is that the controls are black-on-black raised symbols and are hard to see.  It is not a problem in good light, and once I get comfortable with the buttons, it won't be an issue
 I love Anker products.  Out of the dozens of different devices and cables I have I have only had one that didn't work so well. They promptly gave me a refund.  That said this speaker is really nice.  Has great sound for the size and works like a charm.  I love it!
 Nice battery life. Impressive sound. Seems durable. I really like this speaker... I bought it for my roommate and now I need one for myself.
 CANT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS SPEAKER!  The sound is clear and the battery lasts forever. I use it when I'm showering/getting ready and at night as a sound machine. Doesn't get SUPER loud but it works more than well enough for everyday tasks.
 I don't usually write reviews but I love this speaker. I can't believe the sound that comes out of this tiny box. I've only had it a week so I can't say how long the battery lasts but I've been using in nonstop and it hasn't needed charging yet.<br/>My son has the Bose speaker and this sounds just as good at a fraction of the price.
 Nice compact size and design.. decent sound not the best but can't complain for the money. I recommend and would buy again.
 Began using it regularly in mid-June ... by mid-September it was no longer recharging. I did not leave it plugged in all the time, as some reviewers have mentioned as a possible cause of re-charge failure.<br/>Great sound; Terrible battery. Maybe this is why the price has come down so much since I bought it.
 I love this little speaker!  I also have a Bose colorlink speaker which does have better base than this Anker speaker BUT the battery on this Anker speaker more than makes up for that; I would say it's just as loud as the Bose and clearer.  I have had this speaker for almost 6 months now and I'm not exagerating when I say that I have charged it twice!  I have people over for dinner parties and go to the beach for 5 hrs at a time and somehow it never drains?  I don't quite understand it but it's amazing, and highly recommended!
 I'm a professional musician, and this was recommended to me by another musician. I bought this as a gift, but the whole family uses it. It has a satisfying weight to it, very clear sound quality, and better bass than my cheaper Oontz. Everything about its smooth curves, to its flush buttons, to its blue-and-white packaging is very aesthetic. For serious listening, I use studio monitors, but for everything else, there's the Anker.
 Good sound.  I had my doubts being how inexpensive it was.  But the sound is clear and for its small size it is loud!  Easy to pair with my iPhone too.
 Unfortunately! After light use Bluetooth, mysteriously stopped working! Only owned for two days! Very disappointed in this purchase!
 Crystal clear even when cranked to the max! Not really much bass but it's still legit. 5 stars because the battery life doesn't lie, it goes on forever and charges quick!
 I really loved this speaker!  Unfortunately after about a year the charger jack quit working.  You can kind of wedge it in there for awhile but it finally died today.<br/>UPDATE:  Anker sent me a new one for no charge.  Works great!  Thanks!
 Good stuff. Sound is clear. Sometimes has a litte delay when connected a diferent device that last connected. It needs to "forget" the speaker and finding again. Is a little problem but it  happens. I have iPhone, iPad and laptops and no have major problems connecting these devices. I recommend this speaker with no doubt.
 This speaker sound looks great and sounds better. I love to use it when I go to the breach with my friends and It lasts all day. One of my friends has a Bose speaker and mine sounds pritty similar but its a lot cheaper. Love it
 These little speakers are AMAZING. My coworker bought one about a year ago and started bringing it into the office. I loved it so much, he bought me one for Christmas. I didn't have to charge that baby for four months and that's after binge watching all 6 of the Game of Thrones seasons. My dad overheard me using it, so he tried it out and loved it too. Guess who got one for Father's day?
 I steered towards the Anker SoundCore because of other Anker products I've purchased on Amazon. The reviews from Gizmodo named this as one of the best speakers under $100. For the price, it really delivers a roomful of sound. I was worried that the bass might not resonate, but it does a good job coming from such a small footprint. The sound has a good dynamic range, not tinny like cheap speakers. The range is excellent. I can keep my phone on the patio and the kids can move the speaker around in the yard while they play or jump on the trampoline. The battery charges moderately fast and lasts 20+ hours on a single charge. I would not hesitate to recommend the SoundCore to someone.
 My hearing was damaged in the Marine Corps so I can't speak to the fidelity, but being able to take it to any location is just down right handy and it sounds great to me.  Coupled with Jetaudio on my iPhone I can listen to hours of music without having to lift a finger but once.
 Sounded pretty good for the reasonable price, but returned it within 2 weeks because the Bluetooth signal kept dropping out, at a range of as little as foot or two. Afterwards, the company contacted me and apologized for problem and asked if I wanted another for my problems at no charge? I accepted and it works fine. Great customer service!
 Excellent portability!  I easily fit this into my backpack for work and it doesn't take up much room.  I was pleasantly surprised on how loud it sounds...no, it's not going to give you the bass heard on a bigger speaker but it provides enough bass.  For the price, you really can't beat it!
 The sound quality was really good for the price, and despite it's small size, it does put out good volume, though in a busy and noisy environment, it will still be drowned out, great for camping and the office though.
 The battery life on this thing is amazing. The size is really good as well. It's a great little speaker for a good price.
 Wanted to try a little bluetooth speaker that was easy to carry and sounded decent after I had an expensive Bluetooth speaker break. Used this product for about a week so far and sound is good. In my opinion clear music and gets quite loud without distortion. Not much bass but I'm alright with that. Works perfect for what I used it for. Haven't tried to see if it will last actually 24hrs but the continuous hours I've used it no problems. Happy with the purchase.
 The speaker performs well. I use it for integrating audio excerpts with lessons when teaching. I also use it as a speaker for phone conversations and conference calls with great quality on both ends. I also use it for playing music and podcasts, and am very satisfied with the quality.
 Great sound for the size! Anker is becoming a large brand and I typically enjoy their products, this being no exception. The charge on this seems to last for a while, even at high volume. I'm not sure about the durability on this, but it has some weight to it and seems to be rugged.
 It was good until it stopped working ..It only worked just a little more than a month. I couldn't charged batter nor bluetooth completely stopped  sending signal on this speaker.. After my speaker stopped working,  I contacted Anker company which is more than a month whether I could replace or repair this speaker.. But I got no answer from them..  This is my last speaker I will ever buy it from this company.. Totally, I am very disappointed..
 Excellent sound quality for a small portable. Decent bass, very good speakers. Price point is perfect, a real bargain. Very nice workmanship. I'm all thumbs and slightly brain-dead with new equipment: The manual could give a more friendly, detailed walkthrough.  The company can contact me. I'm a good technical writer :) ]
 I used this in my classroom to play powerpoint presentations and music and it's loud and crisp enough for a large room full of tween-agers.  Very long battery life, I only have to charge about once a week.<br/>I'm glad I didn't go with my gut and spent more money on something that would have been expensive but not better.
 I bought this on Black Friday for 26.99. Let me break it down real simple. Does it sound great, nope it's no Bose Mini. However it does sound pretty good. I was worried about battery life but I've been using it in and off for about a week and I still have over 50% battery. At 27 bucks cannot go wrong with this. At 42, I'd have to think a bit more.
 I really love this speaker and its battery life, but my god, the buttons are impossible to push. When trying to turn it on I have to press hard enough that it hurts my finger and it seems to need to be pressed for at least a full minute to register that it is being pressed. Stay away if you have weakness in your hands (as I do) or arthritis. Also, it is a fingerprint magnet.
 We bought this for a party in our back yard.  Shockingly decent sound out of this.  Gets louder than I dare play it in my neighborhood, and the sound is deep and satisfying.  The battery lasted all night for our party, too.  No problems at all with this.
 Great bluetooth speaker; easy to pair with Amazon Dot  New review on 8/2/2018  Had a problem with the speaker, not charging.  I contacted Anker consumer service.  After some questions, back and forth, I received a new speaker.  Charged the first time, and paired with my IPAD.  Great Customer service.
 It's a value for $35. I use it often and am happy with it. I have another speaker that cost much more, but this is great as a 2nd speaker.<br/>Pros<br/>Sounds great for the $$$.<br/>decent volume<br/>easy to use<br/>long battery life<br/>Great customer service. My first unit would work properly out of the box. I emailed CS and had a return label sent and a replacement on its way. it took 2 days to get a new unit that works. perfect, no hassle.<br/>Good packaging and instructions.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>The range is no where near 66ft as advertised. You have to keep your phone /computer close or try not to have walls in between.<br/><br/>It's a good little speaker for the price. Buy one if your thinking about it.
 I can't believe how much this gets super loud! Thinking this speaker would sound Average. Totally blew out of the water I love it &amp; I've only it had close to 7+ hours now. It charges for a while But I'm going to test it how long it goes for.<br/><br/>But hands down Best Bluetooth speaker I've ever owed and trust me I've owned a lot of speakers.
 This is a nice little Bluetooth speaker. I charged it and then proceeded to listen to an audio book for 9 hours without having to recharge it. The sound clarity was great. It is a great price for a portable speaker that links to your phone and music library through Bluetooth.
 I use this as work speaker. I work in a loud environment. This speaker doesn't beat the work sound but you can clearly hear your music. At home and personal use its plenty loud for a pool party and such
 I am very familiar with the Bose Soundlink Speaker, but I found excellent reviews on the Anker Soundcore Bluetooth Speaker and decide to try it out. This is an amazing speaker for its size. My son has the Bose and this sounds just as good as his more expensive speaker. I am very happy with the Anker.
 I couldn't be more satisfied with this speaker. I've been in the market for a while looking for a good portable bluetooth speaker. This speaker has outperformed in literally every category. It is definitely very loud, portable, high quality audio and the battery life is just absolutely amazing. I have been trying to run down the battery since I received it, and I still haven't done so and that's with it being connected to either my phone or laptop for several hours continuously in the evening while I study or do homework. It has been going for about a week now with no low battery indicator or anything, yet.
 Its a great little speaker. If you're tired of listening to your more than likely horrible phone speakers then this is a great item to pick up. It pairs easily, sounds pretty good, and gets pretty loud. I honestly have no complaints.
 Good sound for the price, and it travels surprisingly far. Great for a work/room speaker. Low end bass sounds is a bit compressed, but all other ranges sound good. May need to buy another after the SO heard it and now it migrates to different rooms.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Good sound<br/>Good range<br/>Price tag<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Limited pairing range<br/>Mediocre low end<br/>Doesn't come with a power supply
 So far this thing has been great. I bought this to replace a $200 Beats Pill that was just horrible (build quality of the Beats pill was just trash). The sound is terrific. If there were things I could change, it would be the ability to turn off bluetooth on it and the large logo on the front. I use it for a portable projector setup, so having bluetooth is not necessary, as I am directly plugging it to the projector. But that is just me, other than that, it's the best $25 I've spent on a speaker.
 I've never owned a Bluetooth speaker and did some research before purchasing this one.  The sound is great for the price, in my opinion. I'm not a really technical person, but I was able to get it to sync with my tablet very easily, and love playing my music this way.  Would definitely recommend to others.
 Anker products are legit. Their modeling strategy is like apple, gracefully packaged products that look nice and just work really good! The difference between them and Apple is, they don't charge an arm and a leg!<br/><br/>This speaker works really well. I listen to music often, at a fairly loud level, and my laptop speakers blew. I got this Bluetooth speaker as a replacement and man, it puts out sound! The battery lasts forever too. I have used it for like 3 days on and off before I decided to recharge it, and it was still playing tunes when I put it to the charger :)<br/><br/>Solid product, definitely recommend, 5/5 stars.<br/><br/>You will wan get a 3.5mm audio cable too if you want to play it with non-Bluetooth sources.
 Anker's speaker seems to have been designed to directly compete with Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II.  Do a search on Amazon with this ASIN:  B00WK47VEW.  I've critically listened to both devices.  I'm really impressed that Anker has put Bose to shame for their ridiculous price.  It's astounding how alike these two high-quality devices sound over a full range of music types and volume.<br/><br/>Pairing with the device was easy, and the connection has remained rock-solid for hours and hours.<br/><br/>Anker has created a personal speaker that can fill a small room with quality sound, that's for sure.  There are no boomy/rumbling lows or thin/grating highs. What a delightful surprise.<br/><br/>Also, Amazon's Alexa Dot sounds mighty sweet when paired to this speaker.  It would really be great if Anker and Amazon could work out a bundle price for the pair.
 What  fabulous sound!<br/><br/>Connected to a tinny tablet with "upgraded" sound while listening to live David Crosby live.  I was BLOWN AWAY!<br/><br/>The volume can be set lower than the other Bluetooth speaker I have, so this one is appropriate for my work cubicle.
 This is such an inexpensive yet powerful little speaker. As you can see it is pretty small and light yet rocks quality sound. A small investments to make my morning getting ready ritual more fun.
 Sound quality is ok. I'm not a fan of the loud "beep" it makes when I try turning up the volume and it's at it's highest setting already. I realize this is a cue to let you know that it won't get any louder, but the sound is really jarring. We use this speaker to play white noise for our baby and the beep has made me afraid to adjust the volume at all.
 The Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker is an excellent product.  Upon arrival, I fully charged the speaker.  Once charged and turned on, it connected immediately to the Bluetooth device in my laptop computer.  The speaker has an excellent sound quality, an excellent range, and is simple to operate.  I can highly recommend the Anker Speaker.
 This speaker is amazing. I intitially got it as small speaker to connect to my Bluetooth turntable. However I was unable to get them to pair up, so I have been using it paired with my phone and the volume is incredible and so is the bass. Everything is just right. It is well made, nothing cheap about it and I would buy this product again!
 We love this little speaker as it's so easy to set up with any blue tooth capable device. We always take it camping, but the quality is good enough for doing chores around the house!
 It's as good as is advertised.  Of course, it is inexpensive, but I enjoy classical music and find this little gem will do until I can afford a $300.00 Kef bluetooth speaker or two.  I bought the blue one because  the controls are easier to see than they would be on the black speaker and it is smart looking as well feeling solid in the hand.  I don't expect deep bass for this price but recently enjoyed a favorite violin piece and found the high notes clear and mid range adequate.
 Got this for my wife, who listens to music and podcasts when she is working in the kitchen. Blue tooth set up was flawless. I would guess the sound quality might not be up to audiophile standards, but for the average listener--and considering the favorable price--sound quality will be more than . Great value.
 I will say, for the price this is more than worth it, after reading multiple reviews on cheaper bluetooth speakers, I purchased a Sony SRSX2 for $70 and it didn't sound as good side by side as my $30 Nakamichi speaker. So I returned it and was just going to buy another Nakamichi but read reviews on this and figured id try it since it was in the same price range.  I got the speaker today and after listening to it for about 20 minutes and was surprised about how great it sounded, is easily sounded louder and better than both the other speakers, not a real deep bass that you would get with a Bose speaker but the sound is more than worth the money.
 Great product and great sound. We use this for streaming music from an android phone. Bluetooth works very well. The unit is smaller than I expected and I was concerned the sound would not be the best. I was very surprised.
 Hooked up easily. Quick easy sync to Iphone 6. Sound is ok. Not like a Bose but for what I need in my shop just fine since I am usually listening to podcast on NPR. I know........I am a nerd.
 Decent battery life - I get a bout a weeks worth of use from it at work.<br/><br/>Easy to charge, good sound quality. I like this little guy.<br/><br/>Only time I've had a problem with it was when I tried to play a binaural beat through it, which I was mostly expecting but what I did hear sounded great.
 Worked great. But after one year, it no longer charges. It’s completely dead. I’ve tried several power cords to no avail.
 Convenient size, very pleasing in appearance.  Quality is good, but could be a bit louder.  Instructions are clear and the item is very easy to use.  I bought one to see how it worked, then bought 3 more for other rooms of the house.  Even bought one to use while we are camping.  I would recommend.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of what I felt was a volume issue.
 This speak exceeded my expectations by far! You know how when you have your music playing on your phone it's like too much noise in one spot that it hurts your ears? Well this speaker makes music sound like a surround sound tv. It's great. I definitely recommend it and it can get really loud! Im amazed
 We bought this speaker in red. It is very small and compact. Sound quality is great considering the size. Highs are great - crisp and clear, mids are good, and lows/bass could be better. However, it is better than expected for its size. I would recommend if you can get this for under $50. My husband uses it in the garage. As far as the 66 ft Bluetooth range, we absolutely did NOT get that range. At most, we got maybe 15, but that might just be due to the location of our house and deck. We look forward to taking it with us on vacation.  Again, we still recommend.
 I love this speaker! It's lightweight, yet powerful. The depth from the speakers is awesome, and it's extremely user-friendly. I would recommend this to anyone who's looking for a good Bluetooth speaker with sound range, without hurting your pockets.
 I’m no audiophile, but this speaker sounds good enough for the price. I was surprised by how heavy and well constructed it feels.
 I have a hard time rating anything 5 stars but I’ve absolutely loved this speaker. The sound is great for a speaker this size, the Bluetooth connection is quick and the battery life is amazing. I play this from anywhere between and hour to four hours at a time and I only need to charge every two or three weeks. One of the best buys I’ve made on Amazon. Great product!
 After reading several reviews, I decided to purchase this speaker to pair with my Echo dot. It has nice fidelity for the price and has good response over the frequency spectrum. It was easy to pair with my Echo dot and has worked flawlessly so far.  If you like booming bass, this is not your speaker. Overall, great sound for the price.
 Rugged-feeling with a surprising heft for its diminutive size. But the shocking thing is how fantastic it sounds. A surprisingly rich bass fills out the sound until the very highest volume. At that point, both highs and lows get muddy and choppy-sounding—but you're unlikely to even approach that since this sucker is LOUD. I've been skeptical of Anker because after never hearing of them before I'm now seeing their name suspiciously often...but I get it now. This is the real deal.
 Wow! A great product! Great sound, and it plays two devices at once! Once the Bluetooth is fully charged it will last, and last! I only wish it was possible to view the remaining battery amount. How about it Anker?
 As the title of this review notes, this is the best Anker Bluetooth Speaker I have heard.<br/><br/>I own one of these and have gifted a couple more. I also own (at least for the moment) the SoundCore Sport XL, and gifted an Anker Premium which I got to hear for a few hours.<br/><br/>This speaker sounds clean, and relative to what it is, very detailed with accurate bass response. No it's not going to compete with studio monitors, or an audiophile speaker rig. It's a small bluetooth speaker. Where it wins is that at volumes appropriate to its size and available power, it sounds fantastic. At louder volume it only gets slightly shouty, and still sounds darn good considering how small it is and how little power it's using.<br/><br/>The SoundCore Sport XL should sound better, as it does retain pretty good balance between Highs, Mids, and Lows. The problem with the Sport XL, however, is that it has an active compression algorithm running that both lowers overall volume and compresses dynamics when a track builds. It then raises the volume and turns off compression when the track's dynamics shrink again. Think of a song opening with a vocal and soft guitar. The SoundCore Sport XL starts playing, and it sounds great, but then other instruments come in. Maybe a bass guitar and drums, you know, normal music stuff...wham the compression kicks in, the volume drops, the vocal chokes, the bass sounds distant...quiet. For the louder part of the track it stays this way, maybe you turn up the volume a little to compensate...but then you get to a part where track isn't as dynamic anymore. Suddenly the volume goes way up and the singer is shouting at you instead of singing. Perhaps there's a passage where there is a vocal and a bass producing instrument. That's where it really falls apart. You get a warble as the compression activates and deactivates quickly. Nope, this is not a good speaker. It could be, but it's not. A speaker should at least play back its version of the truth. This thing (Anker SoundCore Sport XL) can't make up its mind what that is, so it fluctuates and warbles as it tries to figure out how loud it can play or can't. The SoundCore (regular) may not be as big sounding, but it's consistent and clear. No fluctuations, no warble, just its version of the truth. A version that actually holds up pretty well given its size and available power.<br/><br/>The Premium does sound pretty good and definitely produces a bigger sound, but I prefer the SoundCore for one simple reason. While I love bass, I don't want the bass to overly color the sound. For me, the Premium emphasizes upper bass to a point where all sounds it makes are colored by the bass boost. If you aren't concerned about accuracy, then this speaker sounds big and fun, and would probably be the one to get if you're also primarily using it at home. For me though, I prefer the tonal balance of the SoundCore. If Anker wanted to make a perfect bluetooth speaker for me, it would make a version of the SoundCore that was the size of the Premium with similar power to the Premium, while focusing on a big but even sound and no compression. It also needs water resistance. It probably also needs to be priced at $59-79. They could go to $99, but then you have stuff like the Riva S as competition.<br/><br/>Back to the SoundCore. It sounds great, and for what it is in price/size/battery life/ease of use, it represents an incredible value. If it offered water resistance, it would be the only bluetooth speaker I'd need. I have larger speaker systems available at home and work for more serious listening, but use a bluetooth speaker for quick access while I dress in the morning, a smaller sound when I go to sleep at night, and for listening to podcasts.
 This is my second speaker, had to purchase another one and picked the exact same one. Does a great job for what I wanted. Be cautious when plugging in to charge, contact may get bent when connecting.
 This speaker lives up to all expectations. The sound is just amazing...im spreding the word and  I know what to get for a gift for a music lover like me🌝
 I can say that this speaker is great! Its really loud and the battery last a while! You dont have to worry about charging it often, it’ll last you days without having to charge! I would highly recommend it!
 Great sound quality for the price and the battery lasts seemingly forever. Purchase the anker quick charge port and you’re set!
 bluetooth range is very less, also the volume is very low. it's better to buy the cheaper one they have more sound than Anker soundcore. I took this to India and I was so upset but it does not have loud volume and one of my friend bought the cheap speaker for 250 rs ($4.5) and its so good n loud volume. it does have Pendrive slot and sd card slot. don't like this speaker at all,wastage of money. i wish i can return it. but its in India now.
 Sounds very good, i love it.  Only problem is the directions that come with the speaker are not too clear on how to connect to your phone.  Had to go to website and there it gave more clear and step by step directions.
 Was a little hesitant about a speaker small. I went through the reviews and figured I’d give it a try. Pleasantly surprising. Nice clear music.  Wonderful in a small room. I’ll try more anger stuff.
 Absolutely loved it until it stopped turning on after a few months of light use.  If I could return it I'd gladly give the brand another try but guess I'll try a different. Manufacturer.  Updating My product review to 5 star simply based on customer service.  Been a long time since a company turned around and shipped a replacement unit so quickly.  This was not an expensive device and to see their customer service treat their customers so well is a welcome surprise.  Would definitely buy from this company again.
 This little speaker has some big sound and is easy to use. Plan to get a couple more. Holds a charge for quite awhile, I use it every day. Distance is good too.
 As other reviewers have said, there are plenty of other (better) blu tooth speakers out there, like the Bose and JBL but you are gonna pay more money than its worth. . . I just needed something to prop in my truck for tunes till i get a new head unit and something you can bring outside with you while working on a vehicle and not have to worry about it getting broken. The sound is more than good enough and loud.  Definitely recommend this item. Battery life is fantastic. Only reason i dont give it 5 stars is because they added all the main buttons on the device, but they did Not add the "next and back" track button, which means you still have to keep your music player close just to hit next song.
 would not keep bluetooth connection , sent one back did not work got replacement . That did not work got money back.
 We just got this delivered today and so far, we love it!  We were surprised how tiny it is, but the sound is great, very crisp and clear.  We bought this for our new Amazon Echo Dot and set-up was simple.  The directions that come with the speaker are in tiny print and a little hard to read, but set-up is pretty self-explanatory and the Dot helped us along!  Very nice product for the money.
 I got it for 25 bucks and I'm thoughly happy, the sound floor is a little higher than I would like, and to be honest it's definitely smaller than I imagined, but that's actually a plus given that the sound is great and it gets really frigging loud for its size
 I would recommend paying a little extra to upgrade to their bigger model. I little one is fine, but their bigger model (about 30% bigger) has a better base and kick to it. I like the sound of the larger speaker having bought this one first. I contacted Anker and they let me upgrade to the larger model.
 Wow, I'm very happy with this little speaker. I was looking for a quality speaker, but my budget was a little tight. So i found this incredible product for just 26.99, not expecting somethig special. For my surprise, the sound was amazing for the price, and it feels like a more expensive product. You can't go wrong with these.
 Great sound / only drawback is buttons on top of unit are rubberized &amp; part of overall covering of device surface. No printed markings that say power, volume , Bluetooth pairing. Have to feel for the function markings that are the only slightly raised on the embedded buttons to use. To use the controls you must push hard to activate - somewhat awkward. Should have at least used a color on the thinly raised tactile buttons. Strongly recommend and would buy another. Buy the matching carrying case - speaker is great to take traveling.
 This is an awesome set of speakers. Bluetooth connections are easy to make, the unit has a long battery life, and it is compact. Most importantly, they project very good sound and can easily fill a room. Not a single complaint.
 Only one speaker seems to be working<br/>DO NOT BUY
 I purchased the Anker SoundCore on Cyber Monday 2016.  It arrived today and set up as soon as I paired it with the Surface Pro 4 bluetooth.  I needed to turn it off and on again and it loaded up like a champ.  Rich deep bass and nice highs.  We have a Bose SoundWave at home and this loads up more easily.  Both on the computer and the iPhone 5s.  Included charging cable works nicely.<br/><br/>Speaker shuts off after 10 minutes of no activity to help with battery drain.  Claims 24 hours of playing on one charge.  I will work on that in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>Highly recommend considering Anker and the SoundCore for a quality bluetooth speaker.
 Great sound for the price. Good for general use on the go. Easy to connect. Hard to see controls because they are same color as cover.
 Arrived in good order.  Have used it for a few months now.  It has pretty good sound quality for the price and size and is super convenient to bring along.  Pairs easily and seems to have good Bluetooth range.  Very happy with product and seller!
 This speaker is a absolute monster when it comes to battery time! I use it on and off throughout the day at jobsites and such and the bluetooth picks right up instantly to my iphone. The range is pretty great too. But I mean it when I say the battery is a monster. I always forget to recharge it at the end of the day and it just keeps going for like a week.
 We've been consistently surprised by the quality of this little unassuming speaker. We bought it for some background music out on our patio, and now it is our go-to pretty much any time we're in the mood for some tunes. The sound is clear and precise and always amazes me not only that it is coming from this little box, but also that its coming from one direction (it seems to fill the room and I swear you can hear the different instruments individually as if they were playing live in front of you). I've never owned anything made by Anker before, but after buying this little speaker based on all the previous reviews and the seemingly droves of loyal customers, I'm sold.
 It's quite good, and it sounds good. The battery lasts forever (It lasts way longer than the 24 hours it claims).<br/><br/>My biggest issue is that using 2 phones with it is a pain, since you need to go disable it on the first phone before you can attach it to the second. That's true for basically every bluetooth device, though.
 Just connected &amp; came on really loud. Turned volume down but now no volume.  Can anyone assist before I return?  In case I'm missing something.
 Nice speaker for the money. The sound is good for your personal space or room. Holds a charge pretty good starting out. Good alternative from bluettith headphones.
 Charging port broken
 I just received this Bluetooth speaker and it’s amazing. It arrived fully charged. It synced in a second and the sound quality is wonderful! I will definitely be recommending this product to others!
 The speakers in laptop went out and I am too lazy to open up the laptop and replace them. This speaker is small easy to carry, has good sound and a very very long battery life and finally the buttons are easy to use for those of us with fat fingers. Every thing I was looking for.
 I was initially pleased right out of the box, but within just a few days problems have cropped up. The blue indicator light ceased to function, and the connectivity is spotty. The range seems to be far less than the 66 feet advertised. I live in an 1100 sq. foot home, and the speaker doesn't connect from the center of the house to a bedroom at the end of the hall.
 I originally bought this to be a replacement for my Sharkk Bluetooth Boombox.  It didn't do the job.  The sound is sufficiently loud, and there is decent sound quality, but the sound produced just isn't quite as good as the Sharkk was.  I like Anker's products.  I own MANY.  This one isn't a bust, but I am more likely to give it as a gift than to use it myself.  I ended up buying another Sharkk product and it still wasn't as good as the item I am trying to replace, but it was a lot closer than this one was.<br/><br/>Weight it not bad, controls are user-friendly, etc.  It's a good speaker.  I would love it, if I hadn't heard better sound from a competitor.  The only reason I didn't buy another Sharkk Bluetooth Boombox is because the battery died after around 18 months, and it only carried a 1 year warranty.  It only saw light use, and the battery still died, so I was looking for an alternative.  This product missed the mark, though.
 Love Amazon Prime.  Ordered and received the product the next day.  The sound is very good and loud. Small enough for easy travel. Can't beat $25.99 either.
 This little guy can put out some good sounds with great clarity at high volume. One charge lasts longer than I need during my overnight fishing!! Great product!!
 When I'm in my home office I use it for 4 - 6 hours a day for calls.  It has performed far better than similar speakers at the same price point.  I'm especially impressed with the battery life.  My only complaint is that the microphone seems a little weak relative to the performance of the rest of the unit.
 I love this speaker, it is loud, I use it every day and battery last more than 1 week. Easy to manage controls. Great quality
 I LOVE this speaker. I use it daily and maybe charg it every 2 weeks. The sound is BETTER than my big (not the dot) Amazon Alexa.
 Great sound with decent depth.<br/>I'm no audiophile but it has decent bass and doesn't sound tinny.<br/>Great value!
 Good sound and battery life, BUT, charging port smoked up and melted. DANGEROUS....
 I bought the speaker for a present. The person receiving it was not happy. I have a Canz 808. They like to borrow it. They would rather borrow my Cans then use the Anker. 😟 . I offered them my Canz. I now own an Anker 🤔
 I am 82 years old, and hard of hearing.  This low-priced speaker gets good ratings, but is too shrill for me.<br/>Attached via bluetooth easily to my Alcatel OneTouch, but can't be found by my Samsung Note4.<br/><br/>My wife likes it.
 Bought this for my 85 year old father who wanted a portable speaker for use inside and outside his home. Device is simple to use and automatically pairs with his iPad. He is thrilled with the sound quality and battery life. Thankfully there is no reason for him to call me with technical questions as the speaker just plain works.
 Works extremely well for the price. Very loud but if you are looking for more bass you should invest in a more expensive speaker.
 Amazing deal from this speaker. The size and sound quality are definitely not what I expected. I am extremely happy with this purchase and what's even better is that I got it for 67% off!
 I really had high hopes for this speaker. I own a few other Bluetooth speakers but the battery life was what made the decision for me. I have only had it for a couple of months &amp; one of the speakers have blown. I don’t listen to any bass heavy music &amp; am very disappointed that this thing lasted 2 months. I went to the website and the warranty doesn’t appear to be any help to me.
 I have been using this speaker for a few weeks now.  The sound is great!  I use the speaker in my office at work.  I have the volume set on the lowest setting and am able to hear it without issue.  I did try out higher settings and the sound was great.  The process to connect via BlueTooth to my iPhone was very easy.  I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a compact and portable wireless speaker - especially for the price!
 I wasn't expecting this to be so small and I was a little disappointed.  That is until I got it synced with my smart phone and played some music through it. Don't  let the size discourage you. This is one powerhouse of a wireless speaker! To say I'm impressed is an understatement.  If you're considering purchasing this speaker, go for it! I guarantee you won't be disappointed. As the saying goes: Good things come in small packages. No joke!
 Wow!  A lot of great sound in a small package.  Connects via my phone's bluetooth just as it should.  Seems to have very good range.  We bought one for one of our sons for Christmas.  He liked his so I got one.  Considering it is less than $40 and has a very full, rich sound with lots of volume behind it - no regrets.
 The sound is crisp and great. Worked flawlessly for the first 30 days. Speaker will not connect when right next to the phone to connect. Speaker blinks blue like it's trying to connect. Do not buy this product.
 This thing is tiny, which I love! Great sound and it gets pretty loud for it's size. The mic works really well too. Everyone I've asked says they can hear me very clearly on the other end.
 Buy this speaker! No joke best battery life for a blue tooth speaker I've ever seen. This speaker is a glitch in the matrix. That's how unbelievable this battery is. I'll use it for 6 hours a day, 5 days a week for 2 weeks before I need to charge this thing! Definitely the best purchase I have ever made on Amazon!!!
 This thing will fill a room!<br/>For 25.00 I don't think this can be beat.<br/>Range is pretty good, audio is great and it gets pretty damn loud.<br/>You won't regret this purchase.
 I knew buying from Anker was a great choice. Sound quality for a smaller sized speaker is fantastic. Even at full volume! I used it with both my Samsung S5 and my iPod Touch and both were amazing sound. I loved the mic on the side for phone calls. It picked up my voice better than my phone's mic! I love the battery life and sound quality. I've tried it with just about every genre of music and never was I disappointed. I would buy these again anf give as a great gift. Especially for an incoming college student. This speaker is great for the dorm and super easy to use.
 I can carry it anywhere as long as I have it fully charged. I don't know yet if the Bluetooth go for a whole 24 hours yet. I will test it to see. Other than that it sounds great. It's not the loudest i'Ve heard in that size, but it is loud enough for me. Thanks, it's really a nice Bluetooth.
 Bought it for the wife.
 Bought it so i could listen to music at work. even with ear plugs in its vary loud can hear it from atleast 40feet away , im vary impressed with the battery life last me quite a long time even at highest volume level couldn't be happier seems vary well built will buy another if this one ever has an issue!
 This speaker worked for about 2 weeks and then stopped. I should have read the reviews before I bought it.
 For the price, this speaker is totally worth it. Actually keep it in my bathroom so I can stream music from my iPhone when showering. And the size makes it ideal to travel with when music is a must. Anker makes great products.
 This is probably one of the best Bluetooth speakers I have used the soundCisco very crisp and clear no distortion or anything it's not to bassy but it's just a Bluetooth speaker so it's not a deal breaker would I say it's worth a hundred dollars no but thirty five was a steal I  got my speaker Monday and have been using it non stop haven't charged it once and it's now Thursday I've left it on Pandora every night and it's still playing when I wake up
 I love my naked sound core!!! It’s connected to my Alexa and my iPhone and Mac, it’s a great buy! I recommend it to everyone
 Another great product from Anker; good sound for the size, great aesthetics, excellent volume, rubberized all around for good grip. Pairs well with a variety of products. Only negative is the unnecessarily brief and confusing instruction sheet but then it's just a soundbar, not much to it really.
 I wanted a small, easy to use speaker with a good sound quality. This does perfectly. No complaints at all. The anomaly I've noticed is that it plays more more smoothly from my iphone than from my laptop or ipad. But the difference is minor. Glad I bought it.
 reliable and hi quality, have 3 of these. recommend.
 Wow this thing packs a punch, great sturdy quality like all other anker products.  I've bought other anker products and theyhave always been amazing quality.  I recommend anker products to anyone<br/><br/>Update 3/3/17.<br/>I got this on Jan 5th 2017, charged it and used it a few times a week for about 5 weeks. But for the last 3 weeks Mon-Fri I have been using it 6hrs a day and somehow I'm still on my first charge. No joke. Does this thing have some sort of futuristic power capacitor?!!<br/>Best buy of 2017. I'll Update when it dies....if it ever does<br/><br/>Update 3/8/17<br/>Battery finally died, after another 15+hrs of Bluetooth play time. I have had it at a lower volume, maybe on 6-7 out of 15. I love this speaker
 Great sound and construction, communicates with everything that has Bluetooth, you can upload the local volume or from your phone or your PC or anything with the bluetooth option of course.
 Super easy Bluetooth  sync with my LG android phone. Perfect size and great sound.Great choice for older guys like me who may be more interested in simplicity and ease of uss.
 A nice, portable speaker. Great sound, unfortunately the USB power cable would not stay connected not long after purchase. UPDATE! Within 24 hours of my review, I was contacted by Anker Customer Service who apologized for the inconvenience and offered to replace the speaker at no charge. I am very impressed with Anker, rarely have I encountered better customer service. Thank you!
 Sound is Great, Easy to link to BlueTooth. Charging is easy &amp; holds the charge. I bought the storage case too.This is an Excellent Product to store your Speaker. Recommend both products
 I use this just about everyday in an Ambulance. It holds a charge for a really long time. It's pretty loud, even when I'm in a noisy ambulance, I can hear just fine.  Superb audio quality from a superb company!
 This has been great for me and connects easily. My only complaint is that it has poor connection when the phone is in another room. I only live in a small 2 bedroom apartment but the sound starts cracking in an adjacent room.
 The thing looks and feels great.  The finish is soft-touch and it feels very high quality.  Looks great sitting on the shelf.  Button integration is great.<br/><br/>When I had an issue, Anker contacted me, and they made it right.  Definitely willing to trust Anker again.
 Personally, I own two of these and use them daily. I have also given this as a gift and the recipient has been overly enthusiastic!! The sound quality is fantastic and the 24 hour battery life is truly remarkable. I purchased a hard case for it as well so we take it almost everywhere we go.
 Bought this for our Echo Dot. Works very well. Setup was easy and the sound is much better than the Echo's own speaker. We own several Anker items such as wall and portable chargers and a hard drive case. I am impressed by the quality built of their products. The Dot has no trouble connecting to the speaker.
 It took me a while to decided on going with this or another speaker and in the end I'm very happy with the purchase. What I was concerned about and used as criteria for a speaker was that it have to have clear sound, enough bass to round out the music, and enough volume for hot tubing, BBQing, and camping. Not only did this hit all the marks but we ended up taking it to Europe where the battery lasted through two pool parties, a few hours of Netflix, and a few more hours of BBQing back at home before it had to be recharge. It also is very intuitive to pair up to our 2 iPhones and iPad. The best part is for the price we got to spend our money on other purchases.
 An absolutely great sounding speaker it has little bit of weight to it but the sound is better than a Bose
 This speaker is easily the best deal I have gotten on Amazon. The sound quality is very very good and the volume it can reach for such a small speaker is great. But what sets this speaker apart in my opinion is the battery life. It is extremely long. I use this speaker everyday for a while and I charge it every few weeks it is fantastic. Great speaker for the price and for a price even high than that honestly.
 Another great product from Anker! This is a perfect size to take it anywhere and enjoy your music. The speaker is small but it makes up for it in its sound. You wont get skull crushing bass but sound is good enough to enjoy any types of music. II use mine at the office but its perfect for a dorm or to take to the beach as the battery lasts for days. I have owned mine since August and I have only charged it 4-5 times.
 Not quite a Bose - but great value for the money !  Not quite the bass response I've heard in the comparable Bose unit, but for about $100 less, I'll settle for this little gem !
 Powerful and compact. Puts out great sound.  Love the bluetooth.  I just wish that the  touch control symbols on the top had more contrast in color to be able to see them  more easily.
 Best purchase decision ever. Easily connects to my phone, battery lasts days, recharges quickly, and the sound quality is fantastic! I'm really picky about speakers, but this exceeded all my expectations.
 the best sound of the three i purchased.. battery life seems, so far, to be good.. small form factor and embossed controls on top which take a positive action to invoke while other BT speakers have those stupid touch controls that will do strange things when you pick the speaker up to move it..
 The sound is fabulous; my  husband loves it!
 Loud...finally! I have several Bluetooth speakers but this one takes the cake in volume. Also the battery lasts forever!
 Great buy!  Does the job!  Got it for our Echo Dot and learning that you can take outside within the range. Also, you can load it up and use in your car.  Sound is great.  Enjoying the Music App benefit sounds. Yes!!! great buy!!!
 Got this on a "flash-sale" for 30 bucks. Listed for $80. I own a smaller "Oontz" speaker, which sounds great, but doesn't have the bass-punch that this one has. Long-lasting battery. They claim 24 hours, and I've probably used it close to that without re-charging. Works wirelessly from your device via Blue Tooth. Great portable speaker!
 Have had this for about two months now, yet to charge it after initial charging. It has some awesome sound, loud and clear. I have gone through 2 speakers in a similar price range in 2 years, both broke from constant charging and poor manufacturing. It is perfect for what I bought it for, which is just listening to music in my room. Only thing I dislike about it is when you get near or at full volume, the warning noise is quite shrill. Overall awesome speaker, very solid construction, better than any other speaker I have purchased near this price.
 Im in love with this little speaker! Ive purchased a few of these in the past this one is the best to date. The long battery life and smooth sound are more than worth this awesome price!
 It quit connecting to my phone.  Didn't last very long.  I loved it as long as it was working, but one day it disconnected and I could not get it to reconnect.  Got it in February, quit in Mid April.
 Bought it as a gift for my 15 yr old son. He was playing music from his phone in a matter of seconds and it sounds pretty good for the size...actually plays louder than I expected  but that just means he is enjoying it!
 Very pleasantly surprised. Great sound for such a small package. Volume louder than I expected, doesn't distort when turned up, bass is there. I don't know how long it can go on a charge exactly, but it seems to be many hours. For the price, it's exceptional.
 Adam was awesome.  I thought I had a dud speaker because I had no lights at all. So I called customer support. And Adam explained that I had to hold the on/off switch down for about three seconds. I had been simply pressing it quickly.  Anyway, he then held my hand through Bluetooth pairing. Simplest thing ever. And the reason i think Adam is awesome, is because he did not make me feel like an idiot through these problems. (My kids would never let me hear the end of it! LOL)
 First impression since we just got this product is that it was easy to connect and brings great sound for great price. I then bought a second for my daughter so we could have "dance parties" with the grandkids!
 Good size, has solid not cheap feel, good battery life, good volume level, nice sound.  Would definitely recommend.
 Very good product. Feels sturdy and good sound quality. Powerful enough for a basement. Looooong battery life.<br/>Only minor issue: Sometimes does not recognize the blue tooth connection with iphone. Simply "forget" the device and reconnect--&gt; Costs less than 15 seconds. Otherwise really awesome product. Very happy with the purchase.
 Love this because music is my passion. Needed something to give my iPhone a boost. Love my music love this super music boosting device!
 I've had this speaker for 2 years and after multiple falls it finally broke. I have to say that it is the best speaker I have ever had. The sound quality is great. It is pretty loud and portable. Vet durable against falls. I will be ordering another one
 this has no power at all. no bass, no loudness. but it will do the work in your bedroom to watch movies... dont even try to take it outdoor to listen to music with friends... 66 foot is a lie. it more like a 20 foot. and it just loos connection
 I bought two of these speakers, one for myself and one for my daughter.  We are both very happy with it.  It's a great size with great sound.  You can have your device quite a distance from the speaker and it still works.  I've used this is the backyard during a BBQ and in my art studio while working and it sounds great in both places.
 Our family has purchased 4 of these over the course of 18 months.  Out of the last two we purchased, one start "crackling" lightly when just sitting idle (paired and unpaired).  Obviously, we couldn't send it back to Amazon so I reached out to Anker who promptly sent me a replacement with absolutely no argument.  Not only are we happy with the product but the company is good to.
 No matter the volume, this little speaker keeps it clear sounding performance intact. Bass is lacking once distance is increased but it is loud enough to be used comfortably.
 I have had this for a year and a half and it sounds awesome! It beats a bigger Better that I thought would be better, but it isn't. The Anker blowed it away! I love my tiny Anker!
 Haven't used it long enough to really test and appreciate the battery life, so the verdict on that important factor is still out.  Otherwise, flawless.  The sound quality is excellent without distortion, even at maximum volume.  Bluetooth setup is a snap with all of my families phones and devices.  Really impressed by the Anker customer service.  Haven't needed it, but they advertise and endorse the support so much, I feel like they are begging me to call and would certainty be helpful if I need them.
 When buying the Anker Sound Core Bluetooth Speaker you may think as I did just how well could this little device work. Pretty darn well as I was surprised to hear. I set the source in one room and carried the speaker around the house and was surprised how far away I could move with the speaker with out sound degradation.
 The battery ever dies. knee is the best at battery lasting power. I am freaked out over this! Get one and you will see.
 The second time I purchased one of these I dealt with the same issue. The first one never successfully paired with my phone or anyone else’s, and the second one stopped pairing up after about three weeks of use. So it’s entirely useless to me and now I can’t even return it anymore and I’m just over it. This thing sucks.
 Great sound out of this little speaker. Battery life is fantastic. The only issue is that I find the range is a bit less than the 66 ft advertised. This is especially true if your phone is in your pocket. Minor complaint for an otherwise excellent speaker.
 Connecting the speaker to the echo dot via bluetooth took a matter of seconds.  I'm pleased with the audio output of the speaker.  It seems to stay connected all the time unless I unplug the echo.  But, even if I did, it reconnects with a voice command to the echo dot.
 Good for softer listening. Really good for talk radio anda listening not heavy with bass. That's the one thing I really miss from my last speaker that finally died is this one does not have much bass.<br/>I was surprised how well it works as a speaker phone
 Bought this to keep around the apartment and play music every now and then and have been absolutely blown away by the battery life. It still shows as almost full and I haven't charged since I first bought it almost four months ago.<br/>:^)
 The speaker has a great sound!! The only downside is the controls are almost impossible to read.  Had to apply paint to the controls in order read them
 Great sound.  Great price.  Easy to pair with galavy 7s edge. Has external port that allows you to connect older devices that don't have blue tooth capability like my Gen 5 ipod. Recently bought a 2nd one!
 Great little Bluetooth speaker! This thing puts out a surprising clean and loud sound for its size, but like any smaller speaker it starts to get a little fuzzy at the highest volume. I use this while traveling and have had no issues with connectivity or battery life.
 Compact, decent bass, easy to understand icons to control it and bluetooth is pretty easy to figure out. We use this with our Amazon Echo to help boost the sound and it's nice we can move the speaker outside when we are out to bring the music closer to us.
 I’ve had this speaker for 3 months and I listen to it at least in the morning while I get ready, if not more throughout the day. I have still yet to charge it! 3 MONTHS of use and have yet to do a single charge! This speaker is amazing! The sound is great and it’s nice and portable if I want to take it anywhere else. GREAT speaker for an even better price!
 I absolutely LOVE this little speaker! Sound quality is fantastic, sounds rich and full. I use it every single day and I've only charged it twice, and I have yet to see it completely die. Awesome battery life. Overall super impressed with this Bluetooth speaker!
 WOW... the first day when I got this bluetooth I can't wait to try it.I remember that I got it on 22th and now it is 29th.I use it almost everyday at home.and the battery has already lasted 7 days and now still working great.I have to say it does surprise me a lot on it.<br/><br/>Besides the bass of the speaker is also fantastic comparing to my other bluetooth speaker.Every thing is easy and simple.The bluetooth connection is also simple,and when you use it next time just only open the bluetooth of the cellphone then AUTO connected.<br/><br/>And finally I do love this red color as it matches my red iphone 7 plus.I have to give 5 STAR review.thanks!
 I have been using this speaker for about 6 months, and i have not needed to charge this speaker almost at all. Once i charge this speaker once for about 2 hours, it can last for a couple of days before it needs another charge. The sound quality is great for its price, although weaker than the other soundcores in Ankers catolog. Definetly a great pick if you travel a lot and can't charge often.
 I wanted a speaker to play my YouTube list from my phone. I read many reviews of many speakers and decided on this one because of the reviews and the price. I love it. It's small and has a nice sound quality. I've only charged it once and I've had it for almost 6 months.
 Love this! I am not good with electronics and even I could figure it out without instructions. We take it everywhere. We bought the Anker 3.5mm premium auxillary cable to go with it for an ipod.
 I bought this because I have had a couple Anker products in the past (USB cables) and was happy with them.<br/><br/>The speaker is smaller than I expected (I've had 3-4 other speakers and they were all about the same size). I was a little disappointed because of the size, but after using it for the firsr time, I am glad I bought it. This was the most inexpensive speaker I have, so I didn't have high hopes, but this speaker easily sounds as good as the 60+ dollar bluetooth speakers.<br/><br/>The speaker feels solid and well built, no rattles and it doesn't feel hollow at all. The sound quality is great for such a small speaker. I am actually very impressed with how it handles lower frequncies. Most bt speakers distort and rattle when they try to play lows, but the Anker speaker doesn't. It obviously doesn't thump like a  10" subwoofer, but it does quite well.<br/><br/>The range on the speaker is great. I can go anywhere in my house with my GS6 and it doesn't drop.<br/><br/>The only change I would make to the product is to be able to turn off the voice prompts. It makes the speaker "dummyproof," but I wouldn't mind having a quiet tone or something.
 This is a great product.  It connected to my echo dot immediately with absolutely no problem. I have had it for three weeks and have only charged it the one time right after I received it. The company sent me an email assuring me if I had any problem they were there to help!
 Amazing. Exactly what I knew it would be because I’ve heard anker speakers before. So so so happy because I’ve needed one and it’s so so loud! Make me literally so happy when I started playing in. I will use it at work everyday. Love it thanks guys!
 Just got product in last half hour. Plugged in and paired easily. Playing lullaby music for my grand daughter now. Only complaint is with delivery, it was left on porch of my downstairs neighbor yet the notification I received said it was "handed to a resident".
 This is a fantastic little BIG SOUND speaker!  Don't let the size fool you.  I was skeptical at first because I had used small Bluetooth systems before and they were ideal for small areas, but this little guy does what it is advertised to do.  The powerful sound at a great price!  Don't hesitate to buy this one!
 I bought this for work and love it! The sound is great, it’s light and it holds a charge well!<br/><br/>I have a BOSE speaker as well and I’m constantly charging it and it’s heavy to take on the go! I prefer my ANKER over my BOSE!
 The sound and overall quality isn't mind-blowing, but it's exactly what you'd expect at this price point.<br/><br/>Now, the battery life is exceptional. We've had this speaker for over 2 months and it's on the original charge with 70% battery left. We only use it for maybe 8 hours week, but it still creeps out that we haven't had to charge it yet.
 Anything Anker is top quality!  This speaker is no exception.  I am NEVER disappointed with Anker products, and after trying dozens of different speakers, cables, etc, I now pretty much only buy their products.
 Sounds quality is great. Very easy to connect Bluetooth. Battery life is very strong. Small and compact is size. Only knock is finger prints tend to stay on device, but that could just be my oily fingers (cleans off easily). I honestly don't think you will find a better product for the price. Anker delivers on its products
 After almost 2 years I'm happy to report the speaker has withstood significant abuse and still sounds great. It's been dropped to a tile floor from a height of 8 feet more than once, it's gotten wet and it barely shows any cosmetic damage, not to mention it still performs well and the battery still holds strong for days.
 I originally been looking to buy this speaker for myself but bought it for my friend since it was her birthday and I already have tons of bluetooth speakers. The speaker is indeed very loud for its size and last a long time without charge. If you're looking for a speaker to bring to small gatherings or just need it for yourself, I would definitely recommend it. I was surprised that the speaker is small to what I expected but like I said it performs really well. I will be buying it soon since my other speakers buttons are messed up. Anker is a must have brand for people looking for any accessory in general for their smartphones.
 Love the sound! No static. I thought it would be a light box but not. It has substance. Music comes clear and easy. I am soooo happy I bought it!
 Brought in August  - tried to use today  - it's not working.  I used it last a week ago. It has not been dropped and it has not fallen. I had been extremely pleased with this speaker up till now

Its sound quality superb &amp; Battery life also good. Decent bass quality. But not high volume sound...overall performance is good..Thanks.<br/><br/>Seller feedback : Aramex - Very fast delivery. But poor packing... God grace my device reached my hand safely... Thanks Amazon &amp; Aramex.
 Quick summary at the bottom.<br/><br/>So right off the bat, this thing sounds fantastic. I've been using this thing in tandem with the Amazon echo Dot and this thing SINGS. The signal strength is fairly strong even with walls and whatnot in the way. Battery life is great in this thing as well. I'll leave it on at night to wake me up through the echo Dot's alarm system and leave it on for when I get home and want some music to relax. I charge it about every other day.<br/><br/>TL;DR It sounds great, it carries a signal, and it lasts pretty long on a charge.
 Before purchasing this speaker, I had a Bose Soundlink Color. This outperforms that for a FRACTION of the cost. It won't disappoint and 24 hour battery life is not a joke. I never charge this thing. Just do yourself a favor and buy one already or maybe more than one. Anker is the best and I always recommend everything I've ever bought.
 Anker got in touch with me and was able to ammend the situation. I am thoroughly impressed with their customer service as well as their other products
 I absolutely love this speaker, i bring it to work, to the beach, and honestly i carry it around in my backpack everywhere i go. The sound quality is superb, the size is perfect, and the battery life is fantastic. 10/10
 Shipping was excellent arrived on time!<br/>Speaker is amazing great sound big bass!<br/>Double and battery life is unbelievable, bought this for work and it literally 2-4 days without a charge. Definitely would by this again!!
 Excellent performance for price! It's not a $200 Bose, but if you're not willing to dish out the money, this is an excellent alternative. Room-filling sound, good sound quality, battery lasts a very long time, and connects easily and quickly via bluetooth to my phone.<br/>Construction feels solid and high-quality.
 Didn't work right<br/>Ordered the Soundcore 2.<br/>Wow sounds so much better.
 This is a great speaker. I brought it to work and used if for the office christmas party. everyone was amazed at the sound quality.
 Good speaker, good price, sounds all right and decently loud.  When turned up the sound gets pretty flat and lacks heavily in bass, but at the same time this is a $25.49 speaker not an $80 JBL.
 I was not sure what to expect from this bluetooth speaker as other speakers I have tried were either too expensive or disappointing in their quality.<br/><br/>The first thing you notice after opening it is the texture of the case.  It has a soft rubberized feel and that makes for a good grip when you are carrying it.  The Bluetooth connected easily and without hassle.  When playing at appropriate volumes (probably up to 80% of max) you get great sound.  In my house I didn't get as long of range as I would have liked from the Bluetooth connectivity.<br/><br/>What surprised me the most was how good the speakerphone works through it.  I didn't even realize this was a feature when I purchased the speaker as this was not the reason I got the speaker, but when I put it in my wife's care (which has a loud aftermarket exhaust) and called her while  driving we were both impressed with the clarity of the speaker on my end and the clarity of the microphone as heard from her end.<br/><br/>Battery life is beyond excellent.  I haven't tested the 24 hours of playback but I easily have used it close to 18 hours without needed to charge it.<br/><br/>I liked the speaker so much I bought one for my mom
 Bought this for my golf cart and couldn't be more pleased. Great sound with amazing clarity.  Buddies are impressed with the sound and the price.  Using it in my office with my PC, on the back porch, and garage.....just right!<br/>Thank you Anker for a great product and a fair price.
 I think the most important thing is to realize what you're buying, and that is a forty dollar pair of speakers. The sound is not wonderful, but it's adequate for the mission of being a portable stereo speaker set. The battery life is good as well. I like the build quality and feel of the non-slip housing. Over all, it meets but does not exceed expectations.
 awful it doesn't listen at high volume. It is weak. Don't recommend.
 Can't really think of anything bad to say about the speaker. The base is a little strong for me and I would prefer to have the raised letter controls on the top outlined in a color so they could be read, but that is the worst I can say. I like it and it works well!
 The Anker SoundCore is a quality built speaker with good sound and battery life. I received my speaker last week and have used it almost everyday hooked up to my phone and my computer. The reason that I rate the SoundCore so high is due to the quality for the price of the speaker. Amazon and Anker offer good deals on Anker products giving customers a quality sounding product for a very low cost. This speaker is not at the quality of a Bose product but it is a fraction of the cost. I am using this speaker while I travel since it is very portable but will be purchasing the 20W version for my home as my permanent sound system.
 I'm extremely impressed with the sound quality of this small speaker at such a reasonable cost.  I'm an Esthetician and they only provided a CD player that's works poorly and I have to hit the repeat button all day long and by end of the day I want to scream.  I would definitely recommend this product
 I love this portable speaker. It has really great sound quality, it's light, small, and packs a mean punch! I trust Anker so the battery should last as they have advertised. All their other products are amazing as well such as their wireless headphones, portable charger, and mac book laptop replacement battery! This speaker is a must have for it's value!
 This is a great value. Very good sound, easily fills my office with sound.  Bluetooth works as expected.  Great battery life.
 Before I had so much issues with bluetooth speakers but this one was the best. It has a long battery and good sound quality. Very good.
 Great little speaker I keep in the garage and it's plenty loud.  Great little speaker for the price.
 Great little speaker!  Hooks up quickly to any device with blue tooth and has great sound quality.  It can get good sound generated but not meant for a party or a larger crowd.  However, I have used it while streaming videos and the sound quality is great.  It is also good outside and does a nice job of providing a nice sound.  I like that the size is only about the length of my hand so it can fit out of the way.  The battery lasts a long time as well.
 Neatly packaged in a compact little box, came with charging cable, speaker, and a quick little guide. Simple to use and connect. Very portable. Sound is totally worth the money. Not the best speaker in the world exactly, but for what it's worth, it's really good. Only one thing, though, mine makes a very quiet sound when it's not playing anything, like a slight thump, static sound such as when you first plug in an aux cord and you hear that little "kick" sound... It does that but it's really soft and it goes away when you actually play music but other than that, great speaker and would totally recommend! :)
 This little speaker is well worth the money. I work in a food distribution warehouse and I mostly work on the perishable side. It's a loud work environment with all the fans and cooling system. It even gets down to -20 in the freezer. I place this speaker on my lift and use it all day on full blast and the battery never goes dead! We work anywhere from 10-14 hours a day and the speaker hasn't let me down once. I'm very impressed!!
 I'm still waiting for the Candid Camera crew to come jumping out of hiding. That's how unbelievable the sound coming out of this thing is.<br/><br/>The only other time I was this blown away by the performance of a piece of sound equipment was when I first heard one of those BOSE clock radios. ANKER killed it with this one, absolutely mind blowing. Every one I've played it for is ordering one, even my less than tech savvy 78yo dad and three of his friends. LOOK NO FURTHER, YOU HAVE ARRIVED!
 After 13 months of working all right, it failed to connect.  Blue light just keeps on blinking.  I believe in getting your money's worth, but a year only? That's kinda lame.  I'll have to consider other brands.
 Didn't even last 3 months before the aux jack stopped working. The bluetooth still works great, but that doesn't help when I'm trying to use it with my kindle. Now when I plug the cable in, the connection feels loose, and there's no sound. Which is unfortunate because the sound quality is great. But for something to break within 3 months... I can't give it a good rating.
 This thing feels like a million bucks, very good construction and great size.  I've taken it on a beach bonfire and it was a hit. The sound quality is pretty good, very good for the price.  If you're on the fence about it just do it.  Anker is a super brand on amazon IMHO and this is a product that helped to confirm that for me.
 Great sound, much better than other Bluetooth speakers I have in the same price range. Customer service was fast and very accommodating. I felt as though Belinda truly cared about my concerns as we agreed on a "win, win" solution. Humans are much more pleasant to deal with than machines. Looking forward to buy another product from this company.
 I have purchased many other speakers like this from Sony, Jambox, and Cowin and I like this one the best. It pairs very easy, the controls being on top are simple to connect, battery life seems great.
 Wow. I wasn't expecting much from this fairly cheap little speaker, but it delivers much more than I anticipated--or even really needed. I highly recommend it.
 The best sounding Bluetooth speaker I have heard.  Full and clear sound.  It also does not have any delay for audio playback when connected to my Fire Stick.  (It is really annoying when the sound does not line up with the video)
 Amazing sound. Can get very loud and the battery lasts forever. I have it zip tied on my power rack in my garage and only have it playing music for about an hour to an hour and a half, 6 days a week. I have only changed it twice since I got it. The 24hr playtime seems to be true.
 I had a bluetooth speaker in my kitchen for about 6 months and it broke.  I was so upset, so I did some research and found this speaker.  I love it, the sound is amazing and my phone can be in a different room and it still works great.  The sound doesn't break up or get choppy.  The battery life is awesome!
 Great speaker. Powerful enough for most scenarios and rugged enough to pack. Definitely a quality performer. You may get a better speaker at a greater expense, but not a better value. Anker's Customer Service is also top-notch. I had an issue ( working conditions can be brutal on my gear)<br/>which they resolved immediately and nearly effortlessly. Could not be more satisfied.
 Could be a bit louder, and the on/off selector could be easier to operate, but as a whole it works fine and is a very good deal for the money. I'm keeping it, using it, and not looking to replace or augment it.<br/><br/>I've generally been very satisfied with Anker products and service, and this is no exception.
 This little speaker is the best Bluetooth speaker I have found.  The sound is great (and loud!) and the bass is amazing.  It holds a charge for a long time, too.  I love it!!
 Sound quality is great! It's pretty loud for how small it is. Connection was really easy n the speaker is super portable! Would highly recommend this for everyday use :)
 Great speaker for the money, for any money! Very ruggedly-built, which is perfect since I wanted this as something I could put on my workbench, outside while I'm working, etc. I hauled it around the yard the other day on my tractor and worked flawlessly. It's loud and clear and doesn't distort. Very good speaker!
 Really nice sound. I have tested out a lot of different bluetooth speakers at stores with displays like Best Buy, Walmart and Kohls, and this speaker outperforms others that are priced higher. Bass is adequate and not distorted. Bass improves when on a surface that helps reverberate the lows. Range is great. Battery life is great. All in all I am very impressed and satisfied with my purchase.
 Just received and so far it's working great.  Really nice sound. Don't waste your money on a more expensive speaker.  I had the JBL speaker for less than 6 mo before it stopped charging. The Anker has comparable sound for way less $$.
 Good speaker very portable. The speaker has good sound quality. Gets very VERY loud when needed. Feels durable and is made of good solid materials. Would buy again.
 This bluetooth speaker shocked me by the loud volume it is capable of making for such a small sized speaker, very clear sound of music, great battery life and durability definitely recommend it
 Decent sound for the size. Worked well for Christmas music while cruising the campgrounds in the golf cart
 Wow a friend recommended this speaker for me and before I have been shopping for some expensive speakers that were not good but this one keep me going like crazy and I love the battery life..<br/>The battery last me 2 weeks and has great sounds..<br/>Mehnnnn I love this speaker..
 WOW!!  You can't go wrong with this little dynomo!!  Just get it!!  For the $$$ it's well worth it!!
 Great speaker! It is pretty loud and seems to work better with the speaker facing up. There is only a speaker on one side of the device. The bluetooth component works well and you can be in a different connecting room and still get quality sound. For a 30 dollar speaker, it is pretty solid.
 Very happy with our new patio speaker. Finally have found one that I can actually hear. Maybe too loud for the neighbors (oopsy)! Works great and super easy to Bluetooth which is a must.
 Bought 3 of these in red and black colors for my sons and hubby. It is so easy to connect to iphone using bluetooth and the sound quality is amazing. Everyone loved it. The price is so reasonable as well!
 Thought that this speaker would have bass, but it didn't. Sounds like a transistor radio.<br/>Which is not good from (Amazon) you all.
 A couple of days in I am more than surprised with this tiny speaker.  I have bought a few other speakers, some smaller and some larger but I paid accordingly.  I'll keep this review short and to the point.  This tiny speaker is very loud, seconds to easily connect and the battery hasn't died on me yet.  I will update this review if anything changes.
 Everything is perfect.<br/>Beautiful<br/>Easy and Fast pairing.<br/>Good sound.
 As others described, it is surprisingly loud and clear for its size. Its low frequency response is excellent for a mini-speaker but clearly its weak point. For someone who listens to a lot of podcasts or music that doesn't thump much, it's perfect, and it's an exceptionally good value.
 These sound great (though, they're not quite Bose quality, but close), the battery lasts quite awhile, and the range is very good.  I was going to rate it a 4, but couldn't think of a reason to not rate it a 5.  Great speaker for the price.
 Don't use enough. Could be louder but you get what you pay for. Use to play golf and its good because on the golf course you want to hear it, but you don't want the whole course to hear it. For my purpose, it is perfect
 For the Price.... it’s amazing.... sound is great for playing music in the background while cooking in the kitchen (which is what I do)  I bought a 2nd as well...
 Better than I expected for the price. This speaker pairs well with an echo dot and has rather big sound for small rooms. I recommend it.
 I have a few lower priced Bluetooth speakers, by far this one is the best.<br/>I can move anywhere in my 1800sq. ft house without it cutting out.<br/>Also I can hear it through out the house.<br/>Just buy it, you will love it!
 Sounds great and it will play all day. I use this with my S5 and works amazing.  I do not know how something this small sounds so great.
 This speaker gets a two-channel sound, turns it into one-channel and sends it out for two speakers. It is fine on middle tones and low, with a few bass. However, as soon as song's tone goes up, or more basses appears, the speaker starts chocking and difract the sound. Doesn't worth its money, and it's better to pay more to get better or find a batter offer.
 I am really impressed with this little speaker. When I opened package I was surprised at how small it is and I thought "this little thing won't sound very good" but boy was I wrong! Great quality sound, plenty of bang for your buck. Well worth the money
 Super long charge life! Pleasantly surprised. Love that I can take it anywhere and not worry about it working. Shuts itself off if it's not being used.
 Great speaker, if not looking for heavy bass and have limited budget this is absolutely a great purchase. Mid and high are clear, bass is not overwhelming. But the sound stage range is limited if compare to high end speakers. But hey, you get what you paid for.<br/>First experience with this speaker when turn on. You probably be surprise how they pack such a punch with speaker so small. It probably on par with ue boom 2, of cause this doesn't resist water like boom 2. But if just going for the sound quality, you probably should get this and save some money for something else.
 Perfect as bathroom shower radio!  Not in shower, but fills room with great sound from the shelf by the sinks.  Love it!
 It worked approximately 1 hour before the sound stopped working. I fully charged it prior to use. The blue light was on but no sound I was quite disappointed since I have ANKER products that work fine. I suppose I got a defective one but they may need to improve their inspection of this product before its packaged for sale.
 very surprised by how well this little speaker performs. Battery and charging is outstanding. I would change the volume/power etc buttons on top, they should be colored to easily see when handling speaker.  Would definitely buy again for speaker in this price class.
 Decent sound quality and long run time. Excellent quality for the price. Comes with a charge cord, but no plug. Not an issue, but a heads up for buyers.
 Love this portable speaker powered by our Echo Dot. My husband listens to his favorite radio station online since we can’t get reception here.
 This is a nice little speaker. Gets very loud. Has a nice battery life. Well worth the money
 This thing is small, portable, and most importantly loud (which is good). Bought this as a gift, and they love it. Only thing I'll say is that you might have to pair your device all over again if you don't use it frequently enough, which is pretty inconvenient. That takes it down a star.
 My bluetooth only worked for a few weeks and ever since, I have had to use an aux chord. I have tried everything and nothing will reset the bluetooth capability. Also now the blinking blue light never stops. Super disappointed when I paid more for this and could have just listened to all of the reviews for Amazon's best selling - $20 dollar bluebooth speakers
 I purchased this for an outdoor house warming party. Great price and did a great job of providing background music for my guests. I find my self using it when I am outside working on the house. Very pleased with this purchase
 Powerful sound out of this little thing. Anker has time and time again lived up to their name by providing high quality electronic.
 Received this amazing speaker on July 16th. Charged it and started using on July 17th and haven't had to charge again yet. I sit on my porch every night and lay out by the pool every weekend and it is still going strong without re charging, $36 and 18 month warranty can't beat it! Everybody I've showed it to has loved this speaker and says they want one!
 Update:<br/>Anker replaced my device and the new one works great. It's a very sleek design. I don't listen to music with it, so I'm not sure about the bass. But the sound is great with watching YouTube, etc. It's very portable, so it doesn't take up much room. Overall, I'm very happy with it.<br/><br/>Previous Review: The drivers cannot be installed properly, and there are no drivers available to be downloaded and manually installed ( ...]). I tried to make do by using an auxiliary cord to play through the speakers, but it ends up just sounding muffled and tinny. I have other aux. speakers that work just fine, so it's not my computer.
 This little speaker really rocks! It as blue tooth and connects well with a tablet. I find it to be a gem
 I bought this speaker may of 2018 and a few weeks ago it stopped working. It turnt on but no sound. I reached out to ankers customer service and boy let me tell you they made it such a hassle free situation I'll be receiving my new speaker in the mail within a week i give this company 5 out of 5 stars for the simple fact that they are good to the customer
 Bought this as a gift for my Son's Birthday.  He loved it.  it works great and sounds great too.
 Right after the speaker was delivered I tried testing it out but couldn't even turn it up all the way before my neighbor came over to complain about the volume. Bluetooth pairing was super simple and the sound quality is great. I've only owned it for a little over a week but I use it everyday for at least a couple hours and I've only had to charge it once. All around a great little speaker.
 Bricked after two charges. Was amazing when working, but... Doesn't matter if the product won't last.
 Good little speaker at the 25 dollar price point.  It sounds as good as the JBL GO which is around the same price.  The Anker might actually have a little more bass.  I'm happy with the purchase.
 Great small speaker. Good sound for the size of the speaker. Did not like the large ANKER displayed on front.
 So far its seems to be GREAT. Battery life and auto turn off  features are VERY useful.  The only caution I have is that I have purchased<br/>other brands of blue tooth  speakers, only to have early life (less that one year)  battery failure.
 The Bluetooth stopped working. Tried multiple other devices. But audio in still works so still a perfect for for my Alexa
 Hubby got me this for Christmas. Omg. An amazing gift. Great sound. AMAZINGG battery life! I got this on Christmas, and I’m goin into 2018 without having to charge it and I’ve listened to it ALOT since the day I opened and charged it. I can’t believe how long it’s lasted. Yay! Thanks!
 This does the job and has great battery life. for it's size it is a nice speaker. easy to use and very portable
 Fun color and nice sound.  Has mic also if you want to use it for a speaker phone.  Nice size for me.  sounds tons better than my phone. easy to connect via Bluetooth.
 This is a great little speaker.  For the size, the sound quality is excellent.  I have been listening to music using this speaker now for three weeks and have yet to have to recharge it after charging the day I received it.  I got it on sale during the black Friday deals and for the price, love it.
 Nice little speaker. Good sound quality for such a small unit. I use it as a computer speaker at work and its a nice small unit. Would recommend.
 I am really enjoying my new purchase. The sound is great. The only suggestion I have for Anker is to find a way to make the control buttons easier to see since they are black on black. I highly recommend this  Bluetooth speaker!
 Great sound from such a small speaker.  Paired immediately with my wife's iphone.  For it's size and price, this speaker can't be beat.  You will not be disappointed.  Along with Anker's solid warranty and reputation, you have solid peace of mind.
 Wow.  Big sound out of this speaker.  I have another bluetooth speaker (Soul) and the sound that comes out of this Anker is beyond superior to the Soul.
 I've been using this speaker for six months now. Right out the box, it was simple to set up, but from there it's been a mediocre experience and is now basically a failure. The sound quality was a bit off right out the box, but I thought it was the quality of what I was streaming to it - mostly podcasts, so I put it on poor sound production rather than the speaker. But now, after six months of streaming tons of different media, it's clear that the speaker itself is sub-standard. I never expected perfect sound out of $25 speaker, but when it's noticeably scratchy and shrill no matter what the volume is, it defeats the purpose of using a speaker to begin with. I am really disappointed in this product and would not recommend it.
 Great sound for such a small speaker!! Our family has really been enjoying it. We had a rare incident where the charging port went bad. I called Anker customer service and they sent me a brand new replacement speaker. Excellent!!
 Small  nicely designed and efficient  I really like it<br/>Maybe not the one to do a big party but to lisen music is just perfect<br/>I don't like the BIG white ADD !!!! on it as you want to show is a ANKER ... I will paint over in black<br/>Élégance came " small "
 I purchased this for my daughter's birthday party.  I ordered two different speakers. We opened this one first. We are super happy with how easy it was to set up.  The sound is amazing and it can be loud.  We did not open the other speaker we bought.
 This product is not bad all departments for the price you spend on it. The sound is pretty good it is difficult to hear some softer songs, the battery life is excellent it lasts almost all my workday. If your looking for an affordable speaker and dont want something to big either I would recommend this one
 Been using this for over a year in the shop. Sounds great, easy to sync up and the battery has lasted me well over 24 hours in most occasions.
 I really enjoy the sound and convenience of this speaker. The battery life is great and although it's not super high quality sound, it's perfect for listening to audiobooks in the car!
 Great for the office good sound and holds battery well. Obviously it isn’t a bose, but for the cost its well worth the buy.
 I bought this as a gift for a family member.  She is very pleased with it.  Syncing with a bluetooth transmitter connected to her TV was simple.  The sound quality is the best I have heard from such a small speaker, very clear sound, even at high volume, with surprisingly good bass.<br/>I do think Anker's instruction sheet should be expanded from the minimal wording and illustrations that are provided.  It wasn't a big deal for me, but some people like instructions spelled out in detail.
 This Bluetooth speaker sounds great. Connets quickly. Turns off it phone leaves area without shutting it down. Very impressed with the quality and sound.
 I primarily use these with the Aux cable connected to my laptop or to my tablet, but I have dabbled with the Bluetooth connection -- and was impressed. I've not always had great success with Bluetooth speakers or headphones — in fact, I returned an Anker speaker because of poor sound — but this one has been great.
 I love this little guy! I listen to music every morning while getting ready for work -- maybe for 30 minutes a day.. I leave it on all of the time and the battery lasts a week! The sound is great and the size is perfect. Just might buy a few more!
 I worked nights in a warehouse. Could never hear media over heating and cooling system. This thing works wonderfully.  I can hear music now. It’s great.
 This thing lasts for an unbelievable amount of time. I use it at work, 8 hours a day at MAXIMUM VOLUME and its going on 4 days strong without a charge. The sound quality is good. There are better speakers with better sound out there, but absolutely not at this price point Just buy it!
 Bought it basically to drag around to the beach, when traveling, on bike rides, and such. Honestly its better as an indoor speaker though.<br/>Pros:<br/>- Battery Life is excellent, like exceptional<br/>- Sound quality is good. Clear and balanced at all but the highest volume setting (using iphone)<br/>- Light and portable<br/>Cons:<br/>- Directional sound, cant hear very well if behind or to the side of it<br/>- Overall volume is not amazing, need to be quiet or close to it.
 I love this little speaker. It sounds pretty good for it's size. You can carry it around. It stays charged for quite a while but it does NOT come with a charging cable. I have been looking for something to fit that charges the Anker but have no idea what to pick. Anyone know what will work as a charger?
 The long rectangular speaker feels smooth and nice. The battery life is surprisingly long and also louder than what I’ve expected. 11/10
 This little speaker is great. Its loud. We use it in the bathroom mostly but have also taken it camping and to the beach.
 got these for Christmas, 1 for my son. his work truck has no bluetooth and this is working great with his cell phone while driving and talking to customers, both he and his customers say it works and sounds  great... and bought 1 for my grandson to play his songs from his iphone and he uses it to play music while practicing basketball...both are very pleased so far with these Anker speakers...thinking of getting one for myself to use instead of a sound bar with my tv....great product!
 Love the speakers good for small apartments  and the beach. Durable and can be tossed around. Nice grip with the non slip material. Sleek design. The charger port got pushed into the device and there isn't good contact anymore. Charging cable barely sits in the port and charges on and off.
 The Anker Soundcore<br/>Is a remarkable device. For its size the sound is deep, crisp, and we'll balanced. For it's price it's unbeatable. Anyone rating less than 5 is comparing much more expensive devices. And even then, it imo outperforms other competitively priced bluetooth devices
 YOU CAN NOT ASK FOR MORE FROM A 20 DOLLAR RANGE SPEAKER...IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE MY OLD 120 DOLLARS ONE...
 I’m very pleased that I purchased this. It’s small and portable, solid construction, easily pairs with my phone, and emits great clear sound!
 Loved it at the beginning, great sound and size. After about 3 weeks, there's a buzzing in the background whenever it's on, even when the volume is very low. And now it will not turn on without being plugged in, which negates the reason for buying a portable speaker lol. Maybe I just got a lemon, but I'm disappointed. Missed the return window by about a week.
 Great price. Great sound quality. So easy to connect the Bluetooth. I have two of them. The charge lasts for 13 hours. This speaker looks good and is easy to travel with.
 This speaker is great. It connects easily and consistently to my iPhone 7. It sounds good. It's perfect for work. Of course it doesn't sound as good as my Bose, but it's close enough for the price. Definitely a good value. I would definitely repurchase.
 I absolutely love this speaker!!  The sound is powerful and clear and I can connect with my music anywhere I go in my house.  Definitely a great product!!  I'd buy it again!!
 First one was given to an aunt after she saw it at my house during the holidays. "It'll be perfect for my kitchen," she said. So this is my 2nd SoundCore. Great little speaker for around the house, on long car trips (have an older car no fancy in-car Bluetooth), etc.
 I bought this for my desk at work.  It is perfect for that.  It sounds great when I have to keep the volume low &amp; sounds even better when I can turn it up.  Well worth the money.  I have not gone wrong with Anker yet.  Very happy with every Anker product purchased.
 My wife is using it and she says she loves it. The only issue she has had is that 'the pause key on the unit doesn't work with her phone but it does work with her tablet." The start key works with both and the range is excellent as is the sound and the battery life.
 Very happy with speaker. Small yet loud and CLEAR! I will be buying more for the family.
 I wanted TWS and this speaker from ZoeeTree was monoral and could not be wired for True Wireless Stereo.
 Its connects to my Nexus 6 phone really easily and sounds great. Base could be better, but its what I expect from a mini portable speaker. The battery life is great. I use it daily and only charge it once a week, but it has never ran out of batteries.
 Edit: Since purchasing this product I have been in contact the Anker directly. I could not have asked for better or quicker service in fixing my issue with this product. Although, I still might not recommend this exact speaker. I could definitely recommend purchasing from the Anker company as a whole.<br/>I brought this for my classroom because the school provided cd player is less than ideal. The sound quality of these speakers is terrible. Everything sounds like its is muffled. Additionally the speakers do not seem to get very loud. I believe if I compared them my laptop volume; the laptop would probably win for maximum output. I really wanted these to work. I'm a teacher I spent my money of them. However, I don't know if they are even usable.<br/>Honestly, I am often a big fan of Anker. Their batteries have extended the life of a few of my phones. This is just not a product I can recommend.
 Great sound, room filling in fact, at a fabulous price.  We purchased extras, for gifts.
 Long battery life and great sound quality. This has a pretty long bluetooth range too, so I can walk across the house and not worry about my music disconnecting.
 good bass and balanced sound,  use when i ride my recumbant bike to hear music on my trips
 LOUD perfect bluetooth speaker. Exactly what i was looking for and I went through a lot of them. Sound quality is great, it is remarkably loud.
 When it works it works great, but out of nowhere it has lost the ability to play the music from my phone.  I have tried turning it on and off and having my phone forget the bluetooth profile but it still won't work.  It does connect to my phone it just won't sound the music.  I was able to connect it to a different device and it played music without an issue<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Anker-SoundCore-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-24-Hour-Playtime-66-Foot-Bluetooth-Range-Built-in-Mic-Dual-Driver-Portable-Wireless-Speaker-with-Low-Harmonic-Distortion-and-Superior-Sound-Blue/dp/B016Y9HKJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker with 24-Hour Playtime, 66-Foot Bluetooth Range &amp; Built-in Mic, Dual-Driver Portable Wireless Speaker with Low Harmonic Distortion and Superior Sound - Blue</a>
 Small - big sound. Easily meets the description in the Amazon page.  Would order again for a gift.<br/><br/>I also ordered the case for 1 bucks. Not sure I will use it, but it fits perfectly and would protect the speaker if needed.
 Should have read more of the reviews; the sound definitely lacks bass. I don't play music that has a lot of bass, and I'm not an audiophile, but the sound just lacks depth. It's a decent speaker and the battery life is good. I'll keep it to use with Alexa, but I'll purchase one that costs a little more so I can get better sound for most of my music needs.
 I bought this speaker a little over a month ago, and I love it. The main reason I gave it 5 stars is the AMAZING battery life. The day I received the speaker, I charged it fully. I have not charged it since to see how long till it dies, and it still hasn't gave out! I use the speaker about 5 times a week and have the volume pretty loud, using Bluetooth, and I have not had to charge it since I first bought it. The sound quality is great for a speaker this size, with above average bass. It won't make the windows shake, but it is audible enough to fill a decent sized bedroom. The only downside is the soft top and sides are fingerprint magnets that are hard to get rid of. I would most definitely buy this speaker again.
 I'm a big fan. Sounds solid and very solid build. I have had a few Anker products now because they are made so well and they have lived up to my expectations and more. I am concerned about what will happen when the battery runs out and won't take a charge. Can I change it? If not, I have just bought something that will end up in a landfill far too soon. That's my only concern.
 This has been a great speaker for the money. Yes you can buy much louder and better speakers but you have to pay for that premium. I use these at work and at home now. Awesome battery life and great sound. I bought another for my parents.
 Awesome little speaker. Solidly built, and decent sound for the size. Haven't fully tested the battery life, but with the weight being mostly battery, I would suspect it to meet the stated run time. Could use a little more bass, but compared to other speakers in this price range, it's a solid performer.
 I like the battery life of this speaker and easy to use and still has a mic which I also like. I only wish the aux port was an output as well as an input.
 I’m posting a 3 star review due to the sound quality. The bass is pretty well non existent.  The mids and highs are clear as it could be though.
 Got this when it was one of "Today's Deals"... seriously an impressive little speaker!  I already spent 6x the price that i paid for this (Bose) and I prefer using this one.  Anker is not as heavy, and battery life is far better.  I will admit that Bose sound quality may exceed this one, but if used in a small room or space this does just fine.
 Great sound and volume range. AMAZING battery life! I was convinced to get this speaker over others because of the boasted battery life and it has lived up to the promises. I use it for pandora one and podcasts for the most part and it's been great for both. Love!
 love this speaker , outstanding battery time! I charge it on weekend then use 50 hours at work at 3/4 power and it still has power left. can't beat it for the price, fast bluetooth hookup to iphone and stays in contact to 66 feet. you won't regret buying this one.
 While the sound quality is not as good as I had hoped it's about as good as you expect for a bluetooth device. That said, the main reason that I'm giving this product 5 stars is because of its STELLAR battery power. I charged it the day that it arrived and didn't need to charge it again until today. Seeing as that was 3 weeks ago, I'd say I got 120 hours give or take out of one charge. Definitely worth the money if you ask me.
 it doesnt stay charged as long as I wished it would but a great deal fo rthe price.. good sound
 The speaker is quality!  Indoors or outdoors, the sound is phenomenal.  No tinny scratch sound when turned all the way up.  Also, the battery life is great(going to do a test to see how long it will last at full volume)  I highly recommend this speaker for recreation, work or anything really.
 Good buy for my needs. Learned that you need to disable other Bluetooth users if switching between devices. Nice addition or option to speaker embedded in device.
 I have owned a number of these small units in the past.<br/>This one has a tiny sound distorted at anything more than low level volume.<br/>No bass. It offers nothing worthy.<br/>If it wasnt such a headache, I would send it back.<br/>Look further before buying this unit.
 Great little speaker. Sufficiently loud, easy to pair, and clear sounding for my needs. I haven't tried using it for phone calls but for under $25 I don't see how you can go wrong if you need something for a room, for travel, or to pair with an echo dot.
 My car is ancient and the tape player broke, so I needed a Bluetooth speaker to listen to podcasts on my commute. Enter the Anker SoundCore etc. etc. I had purchased the PowerCore 20100 external battery (two, in fact) and loved it, so I thought I'd give the speaker a shot. Solid design, materials, build, good sound and affordable.<br/><br/>One quibble: This is my second one. I lost the first one. So I ordered another. The day after the second arrived, the first one reappeared. I am uncertain if Anker did this. Could be magic. Not sure. But no matter. I use both speakers so it's a win.
 LOVE this speaker. I shopped around trying to find the loudest speaker with the best battery life for the lowest price, and this one exceeded expectations. It's loud enough for outdoor use and the battery lasts days of normal use. I even left it out in the rain, and it's completely fine.
 Had the “cube” version so I decided to buy this one when it was an Amazon daily deal. Products are affordable and built to last. I hope this company continues to make great, affordable products. Don’t change guys.
 This is my second purchase of this product.  I flip houses and took the first one with me on the jobsite all the time.  A charge will last more than 10 hours and the sound is awesome.  I saw others that were rated slightly better but cost significantly more.  I highly recommend this product.
 Bought this a loooong time ago, and it’s still just as great as the day I got it!  Love it!
 Awesome speaker!! Anker is a legit sound company! I have wireless headphones too that are amazing
 This speaker is smaller than I thought, but no less clear or powerful in sound.  Very easy to use and pairs immediately, no issue.  The Anker branding on the front is much less noticeable than it appears in photos which I very much appreciate.  I don't like to see branding on my products. Appealing clean style.<br/>The customer service at this company deserves 5 stars.  I would gladly purchase from this company again &amp; again. Solid experience.
 Unfortunately, this speaker stopped working after only 3 months!  I have tried to find a way to contact the seller, but that option is not available.<br/><br/>Update:  Seller replaced the speaker, and so far, so good!  Great customer service!
 Overall the speaker is great just lacks base but I did notice when I was playing my music off pandora sounded kind of statically... Speaker could be burst... It's an okay speaker for the most part
 I bought two of these for work.  One for my office and one for out in the living space for residents to listen to.  These have been great! The sound is good and clear.  I honestly would buy this over my Bose color speaker I have at home! And the price is way cheaper!
 Had this for 3 months now. I use it to listen to when I am away from the bedroom. It pairs perfectly with my phone. The quality is the best you will find for this price. The sounds is way above average. I probly use it for 20 minutes a day, sometimes longer and the charge is amazing. You can find better sounding speakers, but at this price range I highly doubt if you can anything better. A great value.
 We love to use this while working in the yard. The bluetooth reception is decent and the sound is great for the price!
 I have owned several bluetooth speakers and have listened to many others. This is the best bang for the buck speaker I have found. The sound quality is good or better than most. The only speakers that have better sound costs way more than this one. Most bluetooth speakers only have a 33 foot range. They claim this one has a 66 foot range, and that is about what I get. My neighbor has a speaker he paid over $200 for, and was shocked when he found out I paid 35.
 This is the best money I have spent on Amazon. My brother has the expensive competitor that is a coupe hundred dollars that rhymes with "those" and it is equal in quality in my opinion. Technology has come a long way. Buy it you will love it.
 When these work they are very good. As they age, though, they will not hold a charge and bluetooth will not work.
 This speaker is amazing, the sound quality and battery life is awesome. I work in a kitchen and we use large steamers to cook items on our menus, they are loud as hell, but this little speaker managed to drown out the noise of the steamers. Best speaker ever.
 The sounds and size of this Bluetooth speaker is excellent however I've had consistent issues with pairing the device to my iPhone 7.  Each morning I am required to make multiple attempts at engaging the speaker while my phone states the speaker is either turned off or out of range, which neither is the case.  I will return this speaker because it is too much effort to get the product to work correctly.
 Worked fine for about a month or two, now will not connect to any device.  I deleted the device from my iphone, readded.  Worked great, but would not work again without deleting and readding.  Total POS.
 This speaker has one of the best run times, I hardly ever have to charge it.. EVER.. They are not lying when they brag about the 24 hour run time.. Also i did run into some issues with the speaker which Anker promptly and fanatically responded to and fixed.. It feels good not to have to make a case in order to get support or use the warranty.. THEY STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS.
 bass is ordinary, medium frequency is good, but don't have good sound stage , voice diapason too tight<br/><br/>update 12/21：got upgrade version SoundCore 2, a really good speaker, feel sturdy. sound stage becomes better, expecting more bass, But excellent for the price
 my first review of this product was a 1 star. Simply because my speaker had stopped working after having it for 2 months. Anker reaches out to me and replaced my speaker at no cost to me. They have excellent customer service. I couldn’t be happier to have a replacement speaker because before my original one stopped working I loved the speaker. I highly recommend. It is a great buy for the price.
 The battery life on this is amazing compared to another brand we purchased in 2017. Sound is great too.
 Most amazing speaker ever. It has a crisp, clearer audio than my surround sound in the car. Even my phone's speaker can not compare to it. Thanks for making this product. Love the long battery life and definitely buying again.
 After four months the bluetooth feature would not longer connect to anything. It did not last very long.
 These things are the best.  I have two and connecting to them from any Bluetooth device is easy.  Sound is quite good.  Used for outside and inside when different people want to hear different music.  Taken to the beach and even in the car.  Highly recommended.  I have never run out of power to run these.
 For the price, you can't go wrong with this bluetooth speaker.  Use it for the beach and on my tablet to watch videos with sound.
 The sound quality is average it's clearly no Bose or anything like that but for $35 it's well worth the value. Where this speaker wins me over is it's battery life, I honestly have no idea how the battery last as long as it does. I bought this speaker back in September of 2016 and I have only charged the speaker twice and I use it almost daily. I don't really rate products on Amazon that often unless I truly believe in them but this speaker gets a 5/5 for me because of its incredible battery life it's ease of use and overall quality for $35
 Great Battery Life. Sound is descent. Maybe needs a little more Bass. Still...its a Great Buy.
 The sound volume of this little thing is hard to believe. It's really loud for its size and price, and the sound quality isn't bad. I think the bass of the Dknight Magicbox II is better, but Anker wins in overall sound quality, volume and play time without charging.
 This product offers great value for the price. It has excellent range,  long battery life, a rich sound, and is still compact and lightweight enough to carry around. I'm a fan of a product that meets its quality specs- and so far so good with this one.
 Absolutely awesome sound from this little speaker. I use it mainly to stream music from my ECHO Dot (another amazing device). The sound quality, range, and battery strength of the Anker SoundCore amazes me and everyone who hears it. I do not understand how Anker can market this product at the low price they charge but thank you Anker, and thank you to all the Amazon five star reviewers who led me to this speaker. I've listened to and considered buying similar BlueTooth speakers in the $200 price range. I can not hear the difference. A great buy for a great product. Highly recommend.
 It’s an okay speaker. The problem is that it doesn’t really get quiet. I have a small office and don’t want blaring music. The quietest setting is still kinda loud.
 I love Anker products. I already have a portable charger that has been working great. Thumbs up for this product as well, works without issues, I am not so picky about my speakers, but I can tell the sound quality is great. My laptop is not so great with sound so now I can finally enjoy my shows online.
 Great quality for its size.  Doesn't have great bass, but you're not going to get it from this size speaker.  Bluetooth works well compared to my other speakers.
 I'm happy overall with this speaker, the sound and battery life is great. The only complaint I have is that the finish is matte, which looks really nice but attracts fingerprints like a magnet and can be hard to clean off.
 These little thing is amazing..! I tried it the moment I received it. Then I showed it to my hubby. And I said “can u believe these little speaker makes that sound”... and he was impressed...Fast delivery too..
 This speaker seems to hit everything I wanted. Loud, long battery life, it gives a signal when the battery is getting low by beeping. I wish it would have a manual power switch though, I dislike pressing the power button for 1 or 2 seconds as sometimes I find I am pushing too soft. Not going to take away a star though I imagine the push button just means one less thing that could break and render the speaker unusable.
 Speaker is great for its budget price. The Bluetooth on the first one I purchased stopped working about 5 months after I bought it. I contacted Anker and they immediately sent out a replacement speaker. Their customer service is exceptional.
 Used for 2 weeks so far.  Bought this for music while I played golf.  Speaker absolutely rocks.  Plays plenty .loud to hear from cart to green, bass is good enough.  Smaller than I thought and it has fallen out of cart a couple of times, but still keeps rocking.  Bluetooth works fine with iPhone 5.  Impressed so far!
 Great little speaker and excellent customer service. My speaker died after about 6 months, possibly from being in the Florida sun too much. Called customer service and a new one was shipped to me, which I received a couple days later on a Sunday even. I didn't have to return the old speaker either. I'll be purchasing a second one soon.
 Good sound fair amount of bass, putting in inside a bucket or trash container does increase sound and bass and direction as I use it mainly at a sometimes loud manufacturing plant
 It's just compact enough to move around with when I'm working around the house, and the rubberized coating gives it a solid grip.
 Love this thing. Seriously awesome battery life. Great sound, very durable, and super compact. It's cheap enough that I'm not afraid to throw it around and take it everywhere. Only thing that would make it better is if it were water proof and had audio controls beyond play/pause.
 I used to have a Bose Soundlink Mini which is about $200. The Sound quality is comparable, and the major difference in audio quality is this speaker lacks slightly in the lower range or bass frequency relative to the Bose. But overall this speaker is the best bang for your buck you can get, and is solid.
 BUY THIS!!! Seriously you cannot beat the quality for the price. I paid $24.99 for this, Walmart was selling for 69.97 at the time. This replaces a Beats Pill and sounds better and has far better range.
 I love my new Anker SoundCore Bluetooth speaker.  The sound is amazing.  You get a really big sound from a small compact speaker and the setup and connection to the device was easy.  I would recommend this item to anyone wanting a mobile speaker that is lightweight and versatile.
 Handy unit to have for my work area because I can move it to any of 3 locations without losing my music. The sound quality isn't as good as would have hoped, but given the price it's about what you should expect.
 Pretty good device, not too annoyingly loud.<br/>Update. I spoke too soon...<br/>Unit stopped functioning suddenly. I don't even use it everyday, maybe once a week
 Held off on buying one until I actually needed it. Needed it, bought it and it is amazing for such a small speaker. Recommended all over and 4 people in my office also bought them and have raved about it.
 Disappointed based on glowing reviews. But it performes as one would expect at this price point. Nothing special. Clarity is a little better than I expected.
 I don’t know if we got a defective one or what but the range is not 66ft it works as long as the phone is right next to it but walk away even a little and the sound cuts out.
 Sound quality is awesome. Quickly connects with iphone and etc. But I did have some issues while connecting it to my laptop. I couldn't find any info online about how to make it work so I basically clicked on everything I saw on the screen that says "speakers, stereo, Anker... etc" If I have to do it again, I'd probably fail because it was so random. Took me half an hour to do it.
 This speaker is very small and acceptable maybe for an office desk or something. It is completely inadequate for a whole room and not really ideal for use with Echo Dot if what you are looking for is quality media sound. Get something better. LOTS of distortion and crackle at higher volumes. Sound is very muddy and indistinct.
 I love this Bluetooth speaker. The sound quality is immaculate and just as it implies, it stays charged for 24hrs!!!!!!!  I bought one from a local retailer and it didn't no where compare to this product. Needless to say ,I have returned the other speaker and simply utilize my newly acquired Anker Bluetooth speaker!!! Thank you for not false advertising. I highly recommend others to purchase this item if you are in search of a Bluetooth speaker. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.
 This speaker is amazing!  $35, sounds great, battery lasts a LONG time.  It is kind of heavy, but I like that, it feels durable.  Sounds way better than cheap plastic speakers that go for $25-$25.
 Had for months. Use almost every day. Charged twice; incredible. Sound is good and connection easy. Left by mistake under rain, still works great. Six stars.<br/><br/>Second Anker thing I have, the other being a battery, both great.
 Great LOUD sound right out of the box. We'll be using this inside &amp; out. It might be a little light on bass, but for $19 it's a no brainer good buy.
 Out of the box on Christmas day and it was Rock On....great sound and, in a fairly large room, almost sounds like our surround sound system without engaging all the hardware that that entails. Much easier to lug to the beach than a 15 lb BT party box. Good battery life and fairly quick charge.
 Purchased this based off of other reviews.  I am happy I took the time to read.  Great price.  Easy to sync with my iPhone.  Sounds great.  Definately worth the purchase.
 This is the best speaker I've found bought one for my mom and I bought a jbl wish I would have gone with this one. Also bought one for my neighbors teen granddaughter and she loves it
 My wife decided this would be the perfect gift for our son at Christmas.  I'm sure he had a hand in the selection, though.  It works well, is Bluetooth and keeps him happy.  Win-win.
 This is a great little speaker. I purchased it for my 76 year old mum so she could listen to her amazon playlist. I was given one as a gift and it has traveled the world with me! FANTASTIC!
 I honestly wasn't expecting much when I purchased this bluetooth speaker considering I have a high-end audio sound system BUT it's pretty loud and the bass is really good too with no distortion !<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Anker-SoundCore-Dual-Driver-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-24-Hour-Playtime-66-Foot-Bluetooth-Range-with-Low-Harmonic-Distortion-and-Superior-Sound-Black/dp/B016XTADG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Anker SoundCore Dual-Driver Bluetooth Speaker with 24-Hour Playtime, 66-Foot Bluetooth Range, with Low Harmonic Distortion and Superior Sound - Black</a><br/>I use it whenever I shower or use my laptop because my laptop speakers aren't that great. 5 star product !!
 I'm not an audiophile, but it sounds good to me. I think Bose and other high end speakers probably sound better, but this is great for the money. Maybe a little distortion at high volumes, but not bad. Great battery life.  Connects easily via bluetooth or aux jack.  For the cost, this is definitely 5 stars.
 This Anker speaker has nice sound quality and a decent bluetooth range. It is a great deal if you can get it on sale! It appears durable, and the matte black is very sleek. Battery life is great; I have only charged it once in the past 3 weeks with nearly daily use.
 Love this speaker, we have several of them.  Sounds is great from a portable speaker and it lasts a long time in between charges.  You will love it and the price is great!
 This little speaker is the bomb!  It took a few tries to link it with my Ipad, probably my signal strength, but now it works great.  I can watch movies in the kitchen, listen to Amazon Music while I am working, hear the news streaming when I am cooking...the range away from my device is great.
 sometimes spotty connection from only 5 feet away gets worse and further away with multiple devices but its great for using on a desk.
 I bought one for work and loved it.  So I bought a second one for use at home and used it a handful of times and it was fine for the first several uses but now it won't connect to anything. Very disappointed.
 this is my primary speaker at work, battery lasts forever, but when its low it can charge while it plays
 Battery life on this speaker is great. Has good sound but could be better on the bass.
 ANKER IS AMAZING. for the price you'd be dumb not to buy one. The sound is great, the volume is also amazing for being how small and compact it is. its just all around perfect
 It is an excellent Bluetooth speaker, I gave it 5* because everything was fine for this price!<br/>Great sound and bass.. but I wish if it was a little louder.
 Bought this to replace another brand of blue tooth speaker I received as a gift; and which inexplicably stopped working after only a few uses. This speaker has very good sound and is perfect for my office. The product received was as advertised. It was delivered within the time promised. I am very happy with this purchase.
 Great sound.  Very well engineered.  Runs for DAYS on a charge.  I use it with my Pixel 2 phone.  took about 20 seconds to pair up and my phone finds it everytime I turn it on.  Never had a bluetooth issue with it.
 For the price it's a good buy , its loud and battery last about 3hrs at full volume I would buy again if something happened to it .
 Yes the sound is clear and yes the Bluetooth works from afar but what good is that if you can't hear it.  Nit even ten feet away I was dating this isn't loud enough and that is in an closed room. You would never be able to hear this outside.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled,  spend the little bit extra and get the jbl flip, it's definitely worth it and you won't be disappointed.
 I barely used this speaker and all of a sudden it simply stopped connecting to my devices.  Very disappointed.
 I bought this speaker on black Friday and today is 2/17. I kid you not, I have NEVER had to charge this speaker once- it's unbelievable. I am so glad I picked this over the JGL. Today I thought I had lost it, not thinking- I threw this speaker in my Yeti before leaving for a trip thinking the cooler was empty.<br/>This speaker sat fully submerged in melted ice for TWO DAYS and still works like a charm! Definitely buy!
 I was surprised by the sound of this speaker, I would buy this again for sure!
 Love the clean form factor that allows you to place it on any of its 6 sides. The sound quality is very good for the price point and size of the unit. Not too much bass but is good enough for jamming by yourself at home or small workshop. For those home dance parties, this unit will kill your party before any sweats drop down anyone's balls.
 Music on these speakers sounds awesome. I even hooked it up to my tv when I was cooking in the kitchen so I could hear it. I've also hooked this speaker up to my Alexa. Very satisfied for the price!
 This is a great bluetooth speaker. Anker has once again impressed me with their product. It last a long time on a single charge, sound is great and is so easy to carry around in my work bag. I would definitely recommend this product.
 I've had this speaker for a while now. I love it! I don't charge it often lol. I'll listen for an hour or so and turn off. If I have people over, it'll be on for a few hours. I believe it can go for a full 24 hours. It sounds good and easy to connect.
 Pros<br/>- Unbeatable price<br/>- Lasts very long<br/>- Ultra high quality<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- Volume intensity could be better<br/>- Some buttons need to be pressed for a long time
 pretty happy with this overall. It works exactly as it should. Good audio quality, lots of volume if needed, easy to connect and use and MAN, does the battery ever last on this thing. I', definitely getting the rated 24 hours and then some
 I've had this speaker for nearly a month, and I listen to it every day in the bathroom when I'm getting ready. I haven't needed to charge it yet. I'm starting to think it runs on magic.
 Such an awesome speaker for the price. I literally went 2 weeks without charging it, using it about 5-6 hours a day. The sound quality is excellent and can really bump for such a small speaker. Feels nice to hold and looks sharp as well. You can even take phone calls on it since it has a microphone to speak in to. Big ups to Micah from the ROSS BOLEN PODCAST for the recommendation. Gang gang gang
 Speaker sounds great. When I got this thing it came fully charged and it ran forever before it ran down.<br/>Giving 4 stars because the buttons are covered with plastic material that you hafta hold down firmly. .. hard when you have arthritic hands.
 I purchased this speaker as a Black Friday deal, and was somewhat skeptical at the quality because of the price when I ordered it.  My skepticism was unfounded, because the sound quality of the Anker SoundCore speaker rivals the Bose Bluetooth speaker!  Great overall quality and easy to pair and use.  Definitely a great buy!
 A little disappointed on this. Sound is not as good as the mini. Sound is not as full as the mini, though it is more powerful.<br/>I keep,it though.
 I am so happy with this speaker. It has performed phenomenally with great sound and unbelievable battery life. When there was an issue with the battery not charging, I contacted customer service, they quickly and professionally figured out the problem and solved the issue for me. I have several anker products and all of them have exceeded my expectations, especially at their price points.
 Sound quality is great. The speaker is actually way smaller than I expected (not a downside but shocking rather). I bought this after owning an iPhone with mediocre quality. Very please with my purchase as the speaker is great!
 All I can say is WOW ! I was shocked at the sound that came out of this little speaker. For the money it is well worth it.
 This speaker did surprise me. The sound is great and even has decent base. For a small speaker it gets the job done.  really do not think you can get an equal sounding speaker for the same price. Very satisfied!
 The best speaker for the money! Holds charge for a very long time at full volume. 12hrs easy. I will buy again. Kids love it. Also great for use as speaker phone.
 I have used several different brands and styles of Bluetooth speakers over the last few years, and the Anker SoundCore is by far the best. The sound quality is equal to (and maybe better than) my Bose Mini Soundlink, and the connection is fast and flawless. Most importantly, this speaker does not make loud annoying noises when turning on/off and when the Bluetooth connects, like some others do. I am planning to buy a second for another location, and would recommend this to anyone considering a portable Bluetooth speaker.
 Friggin awesome!  Great sound. Perfect for working in my garage. Does great in small rooms. I have a screen projector for me and my gf to watch movies while in bed, this speaker is excellent for it. Can't wait to bring it to the outdoor basketball courts in the summer.
 Sometimes it is cumbersome to establish the connection to the bluetooth. I don't think the bluetooth holds the  charge very  well. The sound is not that great.  It's just ok.
 I have been searching high and low for the bluetooth speaker that would best suit my needs.  I fully understand in the price range there is only so much you can hope for.  But the performance of this speaker for me got worse after about a week of playing it.  I play music in my apartment with the emphasis on vocals and then do play the occasional uptempo bass heavy music.  At first the audio seemed acceptable.  The speaker was honestly even better in my eyes due to the battery life.  I charged it 100 % before its first use and like I said it sounded fine - I loved that it got loud - but it did seem to loose clarity and there was some distortion with the mids and highs.  Vocals definitely suffered.  But I thought I had found the speaker I would stick with until a week of owning it.  Suddenly the battery life was under 10 hours with playing music at mid level and after a full charge.  And the sound distortion with the audio seemed to get worse.  I was very disappointed and looked at it as a bad investment and returned the speaker to Amazon.  Not sure whether I got a faulty unit or not but wasn't willing to give another unit a try.  Had this one performed all along as it did out of the box I would have indeed kept it.  After I returned it Anker reached out asking why.  I told them exactly what I have written here and they pretty much messaged me back telling me how thoroughly they test all their products before selling.  At the end they did admit it sounded like I got a faulty unit.  In my research I have found better bluetooth speakers that perform far superior and still have long battery life in this price range.  Perhaps if you are just looking for a speaker to get loud you will be happy but looking for vocal clarity my unit failed over a short period of time.
 Solid little speaker.  Connected easy and had decent sound for the price.  Would prefer a little louder capability but again, this is price related.  I did have one that stopped playing after about 40 days.  Anker was haggle free and quickly sent a replacement.
 I have this Bluetooth speaker paired with a Galaxy Tab A, the sound quality is very good. This speaker is a vast improvement over a very inexpensive speaker I was previously using. The battery life is great, and easy to recharge. The speaker is still compact in size, and fits well in smaller spaces. The only thing that I have to complain is that the size of the charging cable could be improved, but that isn't too major of a problem for me to reduce my love of the product.
 I've been using the Anker SoundCore daily for the past five months. I continue to be surprised by how good this tiny little speaker is.<br/><br/>Sound Quality: Better than expected, especially considering that this thing fits in the palm of your hand! Obviously it's not going to sound like a full size stereo system, but it sounds MUCH better than most other portable speakers of the same size, and it even sounds better than some portable speakers that are larger than the SoundCore.<br/><br/>One can obtain even better sound by experimenting with position/placement of the speaker. Try moving it around. Try aiming it in different directions or raising/lowering the height of it.<br/><br/>I've used the SoundCore at home, in the bathroom, in the car, and outdoors. It works well in all of those scenarios.<br/><br/>Battery Life: WAY better than expected! I've been using this speaker for a minimum of 20 minutes a day, and sometimes up to two hours a day, for the past five months. I've only recharged it twice — and the battery wasn't totally run down when I recharged it. The battery life is simply amazing.<br/><br/>Overall Quality: Excellent. It feels very solid and well made. The rubberized surface makes it very easy to grip and handle.<br/><br/>I tested the speaker with four Bluetooth devices: an iPhone 5S running iOS 8; an iPod Touch running iOS 9; an iPhone 7 running iOS 10; and a five year old MacBook Pro. The SoundCore worked with all of them without any issues.<br/><br/>My only very minor complaint is that I wish it had a reverse button (to go back to the previous song). You can press the play button twice to skip ahead to the next song, but there's no way to go back to the previous song. I also wish that the buttons were a little bit easier to press. Other than those two minor issues, I think this is a truly great Bluetooth speaker for anyone who needs something very small but also wants very good sound and incredible battery life. I'll probably buy another one!<br/><br/>UPDATE, November 2018: I've now had this speaker for almost two years and it still performs just as well as the day I bought it. Battery life is unbelievable.
 I love this freagin thing. I work on rooftop HVAC equipment. Have this thing blasting all day. Ankers quality is unmatched in my book. Great material. Great sound. Easy to use and the range is awesome. Gets up to about 26ft of range before it starts to cut out.
 Don't let this brand fool you. The Sound out of Anker Soundcore is incredible. It competes with the big boys out there. I HIGHLY recommend this product and seller for the Super fast delivery.
 Good quality of the materials<br/>The sound is good so far, but not the best... Specially with the bass, they are poor!!!<br/>Some body open the box during the shipping, i received it with the amazon "tape" cutted.
 Works as advertised. Says may hold charge up to 24 hours, I've only pushed that to about 14 hours.<br/><br/>I have had occasions in which I have had static or sound cuts out. Not sure why.<br/><br/>Can pump out a lot of volume, didn't really notice any distortion.<br/><br/>Overall, I am pleased with this speaker.
 Awesome gift for my grandma!!! It has a great sound and connects easy thru Bluetooth.
 Overall, it is great.  It can't be a full-fledged stereo and I knew that going in.  It is better than the phone and is very good for impromptu get-togethers with a fair connect-distance.  Totally satisfied with the battery life too.  Worth the buy.
 I love this company!  We bought the SoundCore 17 months ago, and it worked great but lately was having issues.  The company's warranty department was fantastic and a replacement is on the way!
 it says its battery plays for 24 hours. i'm pretty sure they're being modest. i've had mine for almost two weeks now, and play it non-stop from morning till night playing music and videos during and in between work, and it still hasn't reached low battery.. this is without a doubt the best speaker i've ever owned, not only is the battery still using its initial charge, the sound is one of the best qualities i've ever heard. my only regret is not having bought it earlier.
 Can't get it to work. Very low cost but 'buttons' etc hard to see and manage. Thank you
 I got this speaker because it was on sale.  I had been wanting a bluetooth speaker for a long time.  The sound on this is great.  Gets really loud if you want.  It's easy to carry around.  I love taking it to my backyard while I do yard work or relax out there in the evenings.  HIghly recommend.
 Easy set up, sound seems really good for a budget speaker, feels and looks solid and well made
 This item arrives neatly packed. It looks nice. The sound quality at low volume is good, but if you set the volume at max you get a lot of distortion. Not listening to anything heavy. Possibly defective out of the box?
 this speaker rocks I love it beautiful sound fills the room I've had lots of other speaker the last 3 were good but never loud enough this one is clear and great bass sound.
 Very happy with Anker products in general, they have great sound quality at very reasonable and affordable prices. This item is small and sleek, the design of this suits my needs and space.
 Sounded great for the price. Worked for less than 2 months before it stopped taking a charge. Return window has already passed, I will try a different brand for its replacement.<br/><br/>Update, after posting this review Anker responded and delivered a replacement to me within one week. So, props for responsive and effective follow through. As I stated, this speaker sounds great. If the replacement dies I will update this review again, in the meantime I am happy.
 weak bluetooth connection<br/>Update: Anker contacted me and sent me a new one! Man it is surprisingly loud! Bluetooth connection is way better now! Use it every time I work on my car or at the gym!
 It doesn't have the bass I'd hoped. I like Anker products and was surprised.
 For the price of this I love it I use it for my massage music and bought one for my kids
 I bought this item in August upon the recommendation of my son. It was so reasonably priced, I didn't expect what I received. The quality of the sound is superior and the size is ideal. I was surprised how such a relatively small unit could be so loud.  I have used it with my phone and computer. I just bought my second one last week. A friend of mine asked me to buy him one for Christmas after he borrowed mine.
 What the price this unit is excellent. I’d like to have more bass than this offers best I trade that for the clear sound and easy connectivity.
 Honestly just a good all-around little speaker. Super easy to pack up and take when traveling. At home, it gets daily use in my bedroom and is perfect for what I wanted. Anker continues to reliably push great products at affordable prices.
 I recently received the Anker SoundCore  speaker and am delighted with it so far. The sound produced by this small box is very good. I like that it is small enough to take along anywhere yet is powerful enough to fill a room.
 Great speaker. Great sound.  Feels sturdy. Works well and easy to use. Use it all the time in the garage. Awesome speaker.
 I did not like this speaker. But a second better one was sent to me. This is a good company.  With good products.
 I cannot recommend this product enough!! I’ve had it for a year and a half and have only  charged it 3 time! I use it for at least an 1-3 hours every day! The sound quality is great and it’s superr durable!
 absolutely love this speaker. have had it for 5-6 months now and never had a problem. the battery goes all day and we play it every time we go in the back yard. our back yard is a good size and this speaker sounds good no matter where we are in the yard
 very good , purchased for my daughter and still haven't destroyed yet, battery is pretty good to, sound quality is there but no super but does the job
 For a small device this produces a great sound. Good bass and good battery life. Worth the price.
 For the cost and size, this is a great little speaker.  Perfect for my office at low volume but can also fill my living room.  Wont replace my 7.1 surround system but great for a nice little portable speaker.
 Love this thing. It sounds great for the size. Not a lot of bass. But if you're looking for a speaker just to listen to casually to then this is a good choice. I use it just around the house and while i am working. A great buy!!
 Pretty awesome for the price. Got it for my mom for her birthday since she plays audio books on her iPad and wanders around the house doing chores. She loves it and it works from about 60 feet through walls! Amazing!
 Great sound and the battery really does last forever! Its small enough so I can fit it in a medium-large purse easy. I usually like to listen to audible books when I'm working, so it's on for majority of my work day and I only charge it a couple times a week.
 Good sound, super battery life, easy to use, looks good<br/><br/>BUT<br/><br/>There is distortion and ringing which I don't like. Doesn't only happen on full volume either and I broke it in properly.
 The product that I received had horrible sound quality. I purchased another speaker at a similar price that had much better sound quality. I believe there are better buys out there.
 For the money-hard to beat. my phone has a whimpy speaker, and this helped me better hear conversation, but:<br/>the person i am calling has problems hearing me like my voice is muffled or i am in a tunnel. anker support and google searches acknowledge this issue.
 I like  speaker, and it has great sound quality and battery life, but the Bluetooth range is closer to about 10 feet (I've only tested this with my phone, an old beat up galaxy s4, so it could be an issue with my phones Bluetooth) and if anything moves between the speaker and my phone ie. someone walks between them, the signal is lost for a second or two. I will try the speaker with a newer phone and see if the range and signal get any better.
 I have been using anker chargers and just love them so i figured id trythe speaker.i wasn't disappointed in the least .  The price was great and sounds fantastic from a small unit i plan on buying another for each of my kids
 Waaaay better than I thought it would be. Great speaker great price. I went back and bought 1 as a gift.
 I just love this little blue tooth speaker!  I purchased this for my husband to use on our upcoming trip to Mexico and I think it's just the perfect size to bring to the beach.  This speaker is pretty small but it packs a big punch.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.
 Our little blue Anker soundcore Bluetooth speaker is performing well. No complaints
 I have now had two of these and both have had Bluetooth issues.  The first lasted about 5 months and then stopped connecting.  The device will show up to pair but just errors out.  Anker sent me a replacement and that device lasted about a month before having the same issue.  Would recommend looking else ware for a Bluetooth speaker.
 While I was skeptical about a brand I hadn't tried before, I was pleasantly surprised by how awesome this little speaker sounds! I drive public transit for a living and some of the buses I drive don't have radios/cd players/aux ports...I can't live without my music. So I purchased a Bose Soundlink Mini. ($129.00) As always the Bose sound was on point, but the battery life is what disappointed me. (4 hours max.) On a 10 hour shift, this was not working for me. So I went shopping again and literally stumbled upon Anker. There were a ton of good reviews so I figured why not try it out! After all, it was only $34.99!!!!! What do I have to lose? I was still skeptical when I opened the box to find this tiny little blue speaker. I chose blue because, let's face it, it is the most awesome color in the whole universe!! Anyway, it was super simple to turn on and pair with my phone. The shocker was how good it sounded! I really cannot tell the difference between the Bose speaker and Anker! The battery life is the best part, 24 hours!!! Although the distance is not 66 feet like advertised, it does go farther than many other bluetooth devices I have!  So, to sum up, I LOVE LOVE LOVE my new little speaker and have recommended it to approximately 50+ people so far!! Thank you Anker for producing this mighty little speaker!!!!
 This works awesome in my garage. Also works elsewhere. Sounds great and has been rained on many times but still going strong!
 Sounds great and was everything I expected when I purchased it. The battery life is unbelievable. I run the speaker about 10 - 12 hours each day as I complete work for college. I always keep it on very low volume and it usually lasts for 2 weeks of use even while connected by Bluetooth. I'm sure if I played it more loudly it wouldn't last nearly as long, but for low volume playback the battery life could not get any better. I have tested it at maximum volume and it gets very loud with just minimal distortion at the highest volumes.
 I appreciate amazing service.  My speaker developed issue after a month and raised a complaint. It didn't take not more than 2 days for them to give me a replacement. This is working perfectly.IDeserves 5 out of 5.  Thanks Anker.<br/><br/>======================================================================================================<br/><br/>It was good on arrival and working perfectly as expected. But it started developing distortion after a month and it got worst after 2 month. Now distortion is unbearable and i stopped using it. Now return period is also over. This is a big let down from Anker.
 Awesome battery life, bluetooth connection is in seconds and no issues , sound quality is good but not wow, but worth the money spent. keep up the good work Anker team.I will buy Anker products again.
 Brilliant product. Works great with Amazon Echo, Amazon Dot, and iPhone 7+. Bluetooth support is great and easy to pair. Also the hardwire headphone jack allows me to hook this up to devices that don't have bluetooth support. Durable and sounds great.
 The sound is perfect from this thing. Albeit it's the first gen speaker, but it still is amazing for 30 bucks. I've never had any faults with any Anker products and if this ever dies I'll be getting the SoundCore 2.0.
 Good volume and great battery life.  Good for 8-12 hours between charges.
 This is great. I love it. I paid only $25 for it and it does play very good quality sounds for what it is worth. I am also happy with how long it is lasting too without a recharge
 .Works great on Bluetooth and direct via 3.5 mm cable.<br/><br/>Very helpful for my moderate hearing loss, good voice intelligibility.<br/><br/>Looks and feels good; purchased partly be cause of experience with Anker charging products.
 I bought one of these for my mom for Mother's Day. I liked it well enough I bought four more to give as Christmas presents (but I ended up keeping one for myself). They don't sound as good as other Bluetooth speakers, but you can't beat them for the value. I feel like my Jawbone Jambox has slightly better sound, but this Anker product gets much louder. While I struggle to hear the Jambox in the kitchen while cooking or washing dishes, I can hear the SoundCore no problem. The sound does distort at max volumes, but it doesn't seem to be a problem when listening to spoken words, such as podcasts or audiobooks.
 Great speaker,  very proud like I wanted it to be. I did however want a little more bass to be in it. Still a great speaker if your looking for one that is inexpensive.
 I purchased this speaker because I had insufficient sound coming out of my iPad when I was watching the World Series on the go. This speaker made it so much more enjoyable that those sitting around me weren't asking for a score update every 30 seconds!!!
 Received it the next day. No problem with the bluetooth pairing. Love the size &amp; sound! Good job!
 Unit looks and sounds great but so far after its fully charged and only using it for wake up alarm 5x's a week it doesn't hold a charge very well. After fully charged it drains to dead in about 2 days while literally barely using it. Will be returning or exchanging soon.<br/><br/>Rating changed after receiving replacement speaker that works great. As advertised
 Awesome, powerful little speaker. So compact! Surprised how good the sound quality is.
 All in all nice little speaker. Battery life is great. Sound quality is decent
 I bought this as a last minute replacement for my previous speaker. I love it!<br/>The sound quality, battery life, and range are all great. My only caveat is I thought I was getting a weather proof speaker. An error on my part. But I am very happy with this speaker. A fantastic product for an exceptional price!
 The sound quality/price is good especially at mid to upper midlevel volumes.  At higher volumes, bass can distort depending on type of music.  Size is ideal for shlepping around.
 This thing really puts out some good sound and the range for Bluetooth is incredible. Bought the case that matches it and it’s held up great.
 After some initial difficulty with pairing this with my phone, it has been rock solid. It is small enough to throw in a day pack to take with me on the go and is loud enough to fill a room with sound. I have always been pleased with Anker products and this one was no exception.
 First Review:  Didn't last more than a couple weeks.  Don't waste your money.<br/><br/>Updated Review: Let me start with customer support.  I didn't even expect customer support for a speaker I paid $35 for (I think it's $49 now).  I wrote the one sentence review above and went on with my life.<br/><br/>Anker proactively contacted me.  They went on to replace the speaker.  I can't express how shocked I am.  It never even occurred to me to contact them and ask for a replacement.  When I spend $500 or so for electronics (mostly from Apple or Bose type companies), I expect them to stand behind them.  Not so for a $35 bluetooth speaker.  But I was wrong, and Anker cares enough to monitor their Amazon reviews and to work to make things right.  Shocking!  I will put Anker on my "companies I trust" list.<br/><br/>As for "how does it sound" - I put it in the "nice" category.  It's a small speaker so you won't get "thumping base".  And frankly, I think that's what happened with my daughter with the first speaker.  She "blew" the speakers probably by playing base heavy music at full blast volume.  I can blast Hamilton full blast...but put on Tech 9's "Beast" and you'll hear distortion in the base sound.  Back off the volume a bit and it sounds great.  But that song just BEGS to be played on full blast.<br/><br/>Mind you, this is a SMALL speaker...a touch longer than my iPhone 7+ is tall.  The smallness is great for portability.  My daughter is going to go forward with a different speaker that's a bit bigger and is louder with better base (it also cost 50% more).  I'm now in possession of this speaker which will be great to travel with and listen to movies and music in the hotel room.<br/><br/>It can get louder than I find comfortable (when on the desk next to me)...just not top loudness and big baseness at the same time.  It's not really a "party with my friends and fill the entire back yard with sound" speaker.  You'd need a larger more expensive speaker.  A dad at his desk/hotel-room or a kid listening to music in their dorm room....it's nice at a nice price.<br/><br/>More importantly for me, I've now found a maker of electronics at reasonable prices that I can trust with my business....without paying Apple and Bose Prices.<br/><br/>Update 2:  I like this speaker so much, I bought another for my mother.
 I'm using this instead of my TV speakers.  I also piggyback my IPad on this device.
 one of the most useful things ive ever bought! convenient, portable, durable. excellent sound quality and long battery life. the built in mic isnt great but i dont use it. if youre looking for good speakers for a reasonable price this is it
 Works exactly as advertised.  Distance is great, just a little tricky getting the charger cord to connect.  Overall it is a great buy.
 I've only had this for a little while.  It compares very well for more expensive speakers paired with a projector for conference room use.  It does well with my iPod for music as well.  In the conference room, it's a great combination of loud, clear, and great battery.  For music, the fidelity isn't spot on, and the low end is pretty shallow.  I'm picky about my music.  It's an enjoyable general purpose speaker and is pretty loud for it's size.  Have I mentioned the battery life yet???  By comparison to others in its size/price range, it's the clear winner.  If I were going for audiophile quality, I'd look elsewhere...and expect to pay LOTS more.
 Good sound quality for the price range.  What we like best is the size and convenience of taking it anywhere.  Battery life is great!
 Sounds pretty good....bluetooth connectivity is real good. Nice heavy duty speaker with fair sound quality.
 Very good sound from such a small speaker. Goes any where. Great price. Would buy again.
 Great purchase and super durable.  My only concern was it doesn't get really quiet.
 Great bass and long battery.. lonnngg battery. I've use it every morning and afternoon and its been over a week since I last charged it.
 Easy setup. Good build quality. Decent sound for the price. Loudness is adequate for small room. Hard to find a better bluetooth speaker at this price.
 works as expected, not great sound but good enough to amplify my cell phone music when I am in a noisy environment
 I love this thing! Sometimes it takes a little longer to connect but if that happens just select “forget device” and the reconnect. It’s sounds amazing and it easily portable. I use it as a sound system for my TV!
 After a few uses the speaker would not turn on. I just get a red light which I assume means it’s not longer charging. When hold the power button down nothing happens. Not pleased as I felt I did my research before choosing Anker.
 Excellent speaker! Got this on a "deal of the day" promotion and I'm super stoked so far. Promises of a 24 he battery life and it can get super loud! Looking forward to taking this dude to the beach with me for some good jams!
 I really did my homework before ordering this and I admit I'm pretty impressed. The speaker is pretty loud. Small but mighty. The base could be a little better but definitely not bad for the price.
 Sounds good and easy to use. Good battery life. Let’s see how long it lasts.
 Just received my Anker Soundcore.  Setup was easy and Bluetooth connection to both my Samsung galaxy and iPad were effortless.  Sound quality is pretty good considering what I paid for this.  Plenty loud and the frequency response is adequate to enjoy listening to it.  Louder and better bass than a Jam speaker I purchased a while ago for essentially the same price.  I'm very happy with it.  This is the third Anker product I have purchased and every one has been of high quality and great value.
 Great sound, can turn up loud and still clear! Love this! Also can be used with an aux cord! Lv it!
 Good sound quality for an inexpensive wireless speaker.  I'm not tech savvy but the set up was fairly simple.  I'm using it mainly for my Echo Dot.  I can even take it outside to use on my deck while enjoying the outdoors.
 Amazing speaker!! I've just been introduced to Anker, by their chargers, which are awesome. So I decided to take the plunge for a speaker, since I was in need of one and I'm so HAPPY I did! This little guy gets LOUD. Base is decent. I'm very happy with this purchase!
 This unit worked for approximately 60 days and then was no longer able to accept a charge. While it was working, it did not have anywhere near the Bluetooth range it claimed to have.  Pick another product!
 Haven't been able to connect to my OnePlus 3T via wifi , but I haven't worked very much on that.  Connects perfectly to my Kindle, and the sound is great. I had a Jawbone Jambox for years, and this Anker sounds better--deeper bass for sure.  I don't know the physics of how bass can come from such little speaker elements, but it's perfect in the kitchen.
 Gave this as a gift to someone, they loved it, it was loud and clear.
 idk about you but im all about dat bass! yall gotta get yourself one!
 I like all of the above. For me, they could have made the controls easier to read. They are all black on black.
 This speaker is awesome for $25.  Battery life is ridiculously good ....I use it at work on 10 shifts  connected to my walkie talkie and I am going on 2 weeks on first charge.....
 not enough volume, i have a 20 dollar one that is twice as loud. same size.
 I generally love Anker products, but this speaker was good not great. The speakers don't fill the room with sound like a multi-directional unit would. Decent sound quality.
 I purchased two of these -- one for myself and one for my sister -- to go with my Echo Dot.  Both of us are pleased with how relatively easy it was to connect the two and with the ability to easily move this speaker around the house to the music from the Echo goes with us.  It is relatively inexpensive.  It doesn't have the sound quality of a Bose, perhaps, but I didn't pay the cost of a Bose either.<br/><br/>EZ
 This is probably the best present I bought for Christmas this year. The setup was simple and easy. We were listening to beautiful music right away. The sound quality is unbelievable. It's small size is deceiving. It produces quality sound equal to a much larger unit. We actually quit listening to carols on the Bose this year and enjoyed the rich sound of the Anker.
 Great little speaker, loud, clear and crisp sound with an outstanding manufacturer warranty. Speaker wouldn't charge after 10 months and Anker sent us a new one.  Can't do better than that!
 So I tried out the Fugoo for $90 the Oontz for $30 and this for $30.  What I found was this:<br/>For the best highs and midrange the Oontz is probably your speaker.  It also has long battery life.  However no bass to note of  whatsoever.<br/><br/>The Fugoo at $90 sounded the best overall.  Good bass for a unit as small as this (Not what the Bose has, but remember the price point).  It lasted forever on one charge, but was extremely disappointing in volume level.  I tested this and the Anker together while landscaping and you had to be within about 30 feet to enjoy the sound.  And if you were at 30 feet it still wasn't loud.<br/><br/>Than Anker has good sound great battery life and the best price.  It has more bass than the Oontz but slightly less than the Fugoo.  However it had plenty more volume than the Fugoo.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great portable outdoor weather proof speaker to keep on hand when you want to listen to music and don't have access to a $150+ audiophile type speaker.  (I keep mine in the car for when friends have cookouts and forget to bring or charge speakers.)<br/><br/>Definitely 5 out of 5 stars given the price.
 The battery life in this thing is absolutely incredible. I have it connected to my TV to hear it clearly without turning the volume way up, and I have only had to charge it twice in 3 months. Once when I first received it, and once about a month ago.
 This speaker is perfect for my needs. The volume &amp; sound are more than adequate, and I can move it around with me as I work in different areas of the house without it interfering with what other members of the household are doing. 24 hour playtime!
 Not as loud as I expected and the Bluetooth connectivity is a real issue.  You have to disconnect any device connected to it before you can connect to the speaker.  This is the first speaker I have ever had this problem with.  I might be sending this back.  I do give it 5 stars for the exceptional battery life.
 This speaker is a tiny powerhouse. I got it last night and had it conceded to my tablet within minutes. I am absolutely thrilled with the volume and range. It is much smaller than I expected but that is not reflected in its performance. I had been using a wired speaker set for the last two years and it has been a tangled nightmare. I am free from that hastle and can actually use my new speaker anywhere. I highly recommend this device for your everyday needs.
 awesome battery. i don't know about all this "Breathtaking stereo sound with deep bass" i mean it's just a small BT speaker. it sounds fine though. the battery last so long that you'll forget the last time you charged it.
 I was surprise by this speaker when i started using it. oh man is it loud, it makes the JBL speaker look like cheap quality speaker because of how loud it is. Also love the fact you can also use it to talk through it with its built in microphone. I would seriously recommend this product.
 Excellent sound. Travels great. Holds a charge for quite a long time! Rubbery feel makes it nice for active travel, no slip grip. Fits in a golf cart cup holder too ;)
 This is a fantastic product for the price of $22.42 that I paid. It is a solid, sturdy speaker with a really good sound. No one is going to confuse this speaker with Bose Soundlink, but it doesn't cost $300 either.
 Me encanta, fácil de usar y compatible con todos los equipos , de buen tamaños y capacidad de volumen superior. 100% recomendado
 I really like the Anker speaker.  It has high quality output and lots of volume.  It fits in my pocket and isn't too cumbersome.  I take it everywhere and my friends love it.  I highly recommend it.  Thanks.
 Bought this speaker for my granddaughter and she really loves it. My son has used it a few times and was impressed with the sound quality and clarity.
 it fine speaker for low volume.<br/>in high volume its not the best
 Much better sound than I anticipated. I would like to find a Kindle program that would allow auto shut-off at night when going to sleep.
 Works great. Had to get contact anker and they shipped me a new one due to connection was faulty.  They stand by their products.  Thxs Anker
 If you are looking for a lower cost Bluetooth speaker, I highly recommend this product!  Of course there are much better sounding speakers out there for $100 up, but IMHO you won't find better for under $50.
 Incredible sound for such a small speaker.  I am a physical education and just used it in my classes this week for the first time.  The sound is heard over a gym full of students.  For the money, I couldn't be happier with this purchase.
 It worked for a couple of months then no bluetooth ability
 Amazing value. Sound quality is great. Bass is 3 out of 5, but what it does for bass is quality. Well built, will take mild abuse. Not waterproof, very little water resistance.
 Great Sound in a small package! We linked this to our Echo dot. Now we have great sound throughout our very family room. Love this product!!
 Fair for the price but not very loud, no base at all. Battery life isn’t 24 hours but it will last a good amount of time. This product broke afte about an year an a half, the sound started fading and now I can’t hear clearly. It is still in good shape but internally it’s broken.
 My boyfriend loves this bluetooth speaker! Sometimes if you've got two phones connected to it (switching during the tailgate/pregame), it doesn't work- so you've gotta unsync and then re-sync , turn it on/off , and play with it a little to get it going. Other than that, it's a steal for the price. Doesn't get TOO loud, but it'll do.
 Not the loudest or best bass but fits well in a small space. Very, very good for the price.
 Worth it. Try and see. Sounds great
 Great sound, long lasting battery. I bought the blue one for my daughter but I got myself a black anker soundcore speaker almost a year ago and  use it almost daily and I can’t complain. It’s been great. I would definitely buy another for myself or as a gift
 You can't beat the cost or the sound quality.  It is ~20 less on Amazon vs. other retailers.  Tiny device has excellent sound quality that surprises everyone.  Friend commented that it sounds nearly as good as his $150 unit.
 I was looking for a high quality bluetooth speaker without paying as much as we did for our Bose. After reading reviews, I went with Anker SoundCore and am not disappointed! Crisp sound and easy to navigate. Very pleased with this purchase.
 Well after two years it has been a very good speaker but the usb for charging it given me trouble and I  have to fiddle with it to get it in the right spot to charge. It's the only weak spot on the speaker. Hope this helps.
 When I bought this speaker, I was concerned that the sound wasn't going to be as loud or as good a quality as my headphones, but I was wrong. The pairing between the phone ans the speaker is very quick. The maximum volume of it is loud enough to shake the room. And the quality of the sound is just amazing. I cannot recommend this speaker more. If you are on a budget and wish to buy a Bluetooth speaker, buy these.
 Best speaker ever. I love this thing. The sound quality is terrific. We use it for our outdoor movie theater and it makes for a great listening experience. Would recommend highly to others!
 Sound quality is GREAT and life spa is even greater! The longest I’ve played his without needing to charge is 2 hours straight!
 This is a great bluetooth speaker.  Loud.  Good quality sound.  Compact.  No complaints.
 Sound is really pretty darn good for such a small speaker and the great price can't be beat. I love that it is portable and small enough to toss into my backpack. Love the ease of use for set up and speaker blue color is cool.<br/>thanks for a neat product!
 This is the third Bluetooth speaker I've purchased trying to find one that is loud, clear, and connects easily to different devices. None of the others lasted or performed like this one does. The sound is clear, bass isn't muddy, and it has great volume. We are truly impressed. We are going to purchase the smaller Anker SoundCore cube for our daughter's dorm room. Will be looking into their other products as well.
 ...otoh, not crazy range of sound. But she def likes it a lot and cares very much about music quality.
 Great sound for the size/price. Definitely recommend. I use when traveling, or in the garage, etc. Sound is loud enough to fill the garage.<br/><br/>Works as a speakerphone as well. Works better as a speakerphone than the builtin speakerphone of the iPhone. Callers can hear you much better.
 Love this lil' speaker. The battery time actually is around 24 hours and everyone's comments about the bass being distorted is semi-true... but this is a great speaker for the money. My only gripe is that you cant change the track from the speaker like others, but no biggie.
 This is a great buy for the price. I bought it for my home office and for our patio when we have people over. It gets much louder than I expected and has really great sound quality. The bluetooth connected with no problem and it sounds great. I'm sure you could get something even better for twice the price, but for $38 I doubt you could find something better than this.
 A great bluetooth speaker to use with Echo Dot (or any other bluetooth enabled device you have music on). The depth of sound is impressive.
 Great product. I’ve never been disappointed with a Anker product.
 I love this speaker. The quality sound is awesome &amp; so easy to use.
 Love the sound and the size is perfect. I used it for a party in my back yard and it was great.
 The speaker works great.  I had one minor problem with it, so I contacted Anker directly and they replaced it immediately.  Awesome customer service and a great speaker.  I definitely would recommend it.
 I can’t get this speaker to pair with my Bluetooth adapter. This is the third set of Anker speakers and Bluetooth transmitters I have purchased to use with my TVs. The first two sets paired up right away. Not sure what the problem is with this one?
 This speaker is pretty good, especially for the low low price of $30. The highs and kids are clear and the bass is punchy. However, if you are like me and like EDM or any really "bassy" music, it isn't all that great.<br/><br/>The bass aside, the speaker is pretty great: it's loud (without distortion), it has great wireless range, and the battery hasn't been charged in days.
 I don't leave many review, but I am super impressed with this product. Sounds much bigger than it is and the long battery life lets it be a portable Bluetooth speaker much more often that my previous speakers which were often tether to the wall charging.
 It's alright. I wish I could adjust the EQ - the bass is a little too high. If I switch between my computer and phone, I have to "forget this device" every single time, relocate it and connect. Annoying.
 Battery life in this thing is incredible.  Left it one for 3 days for 8 hours each day with the volume around half way loud. Checked the battery life on my iPad and it said that the Anker still had 60% of battery life.. pretty awesome
 The package arrived on time. The speaker was easy to pair with my iPhone. Controls are extremely simple. The sound output is very good. Very good product at a reasonable price.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Anker-SoundCore-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-24-Hour-Playtime-66-Feet-Bluetooth-Range-Built-in-Mic-Dual-Driver-Portable-Wireless-Speaker-with-Low-Harmonic-Distortion-and-Superior-Sound-Blue/dp/B016Y9HKJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker with 24-Hour Playtime, 66-Feet Bluetooth Range &amp; Built-in Mic, Dual-Driver Portable Wireless Speaker with Low Harmonic Distortion and Superior Sound - Blue</a>
 Good sound quality for such a small speaker. I take one star off because of the power button - it is difficult to turn it on.
 This little speaker is heavy for its size. It is loud! It blew me away! You have to get one 🎉
 Looks great and you definitely can't beat the sound quality for the price. I have a wireless, much more expensive JBL speaker too and when I use them both together I honestly can't tell the difference. Great speaker!
 I bought this speaker almost a year and a half ago. 1 year, 5 months, 21 days ago. It has had a freakishly long battery life. I have used it AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK EACH NIGHT FOR 20 MINUTES and I just today recharged it for the first time. That’s easily 75 hours of battery life. Insane.
 Purchased this for my brother for Christmas and was very impressed with sound quality. Very clean and crisp with a good amount of bass for a speaker this size. I've had nothing but good experiences with Anker products. I would highly recommend if you're looking for a compact speaker that gets decently loud without distortion.
 Purchased this after reading reviews about the sound quality being good. It isn't. Had an inexpensive speaker before this and it wasn't so bad. The sound is slightly garbled. I would have used this product about 3 times since I purchased and was irritated every time my playlist began to play. Returning it.
 Have had for quite a few months.  I listen daily (2 to 3 hours) at a loud to medium loud volume, and the battery lasts almost a full month on a full battery charge before needing recharge.  Auto shut-off feature helps.  No issues with linking or relinking bluetooth.
 The first unit I received was defective (battery wouldn't charge) but Anker sent a new replacement unit immediately. This unit works perfectly. Very satisfied with the product and the excellent service. Sound quality is excellent.
 I liked the size and sound,but.. it cuts off the music a lot! When it’s playing music through Bluetooth? Over all I gave it a two star! (Update!!) Anker contacted me and said they will send me a new one at no cost!! They didn’t even ask for the defective item back!! Now that’s what I call service!! Changed it to a five star!!
 This is such a handy product. I love being able to listen to my music louder than off my phone and still have the same portability as a phone. It's easy to connect/use. I purchased one for myself and one for my parents as a gift - even they were able to figure out how to use it and toggle between their two phones to connect and play their own music libraries - and they aren't super tech savvy. I'd highly recommend this if you're looking for something small, portable and of high-quality.
 Connecting to my echo dot was simple with the Alexa app. Now I just keep this speaker plugged in and works great for music in the room and shower.
 Built ok. But doesn’t sound as nice as other one I bought nd lost
 The sound is a bit small
 Giving 5 stars because I am happy about the product. Price quality rate is great. Battery is impressive. Sound is clear. Can not wait for playing it loud outdoors. It certainly made my experience of listening to music in my room better than from my laptop. It connects super easy to all apple devices.<br/><br/>BUT, I have the impression that it feels better at high volume, rather than at low. There is certainly distortion, and if buying for "room/indoor consumption" I would recommend spending something more for a better sound quality.
 What a fun gadget! I was impressed with the sound quality and clean simplicity right off the bat. Setup and operation are dead simple. I bought it for background music on our deck and it's perfect for that. Can't believe the long battery life.
 very good value for $$$<br/>own 2 other speakers. these better
 First off....I DIDN'T get this for free to review it. I BOUGHT it like the rest of the world. I rarely post reviews but this speaker is awesome. I use it at work to listen to music while I'm working. I charged it fully when I first opened it and listening to music for about 4 hours a day, this speaker lasted over 2 weeks without once charging it! It probably could have lasted longer I just decided to charge it for the heck of it. The speaker sounds great for its size and gets not only loud but very clear as well. Like I said I don't really review things but felt it was necessary  consider the price, performance, build quality. Hopefully it helps someone make a decision about it, like some of the other reviews have helped me.
 Amazon and Anker got in touch with me after posting my initial review.<br/>Both provided customer service exceeding my expectations.<br/>Anker then went beyond that, getting all the feedback I could provide, in the end I was completely satisfied with a different Anker product, the Anker Ultra Portable A7910, which better suited my needs for articulation and intelligibility in audio books and spoken word program.
 Very good sound, long battery life, and an excellent value. I look to Anker for electronics and accessories. Not disappointed
 This little speaker has very big sound and lasts a long time.  I feel like I use it all the time and charge it once a month or so.  Holds an excellent connection.  Just excellent!
 The buttons on the top are awful in pressing, I barely do it unless changing the volume. If you make another version, please improve the buttons.
 Great sound for a cheap price.  I'm not going to be playing any house or "drop the bass" type music on a speaker like this, but it sounds good and I consider it a good value.
 I was very happy with the volume and clarity of the music.  The battery lasts as long as advertised.  I'd buy it again if I needed another and have recommended that others get them and they love them too.
 I like this speaker very much. I have an Anker product so making this decision was easy. It has great sound at max level although the max beep is annoying. Plus the buttons are outlined so you can use this blindly
 Awesome Bluetooth Speaker with fair price. The first glance that I saw the product I afraid that it is too small and can't delivery the sound as I expect. I have 2 separate room and thinking about buying wifi speaker (DLNA) in order to make a synchronize music in each room. However I use 1 DLNA speaker and this speaker instead. The music for Bluetooth is 1 sec delay compare with DLNA speaker but it work well for separate room. This speaker is awesome, the only thing that I concern is how long will it last.
 Bought this for a graduation 🎁 gift<br/>My friend’s Son loved it.  It works great and puts out great sound
 Looks great. Perfect size. Sounds great. The bass is good. I need more bass. So, I returned it.<br/>I think it’ll work for most people. For me I needed a stronger base hit.
 I use this for my workouts and when models need music during photoshoots.
 By far one of the best speakers I have ever purchased for it's price. This little speaker is amazing. The audio quality is what you would expect for the price, but the durability and battery far exceed my expectations. I have dropped this speaker, left in the car during the summer, left it in the car during the winter, dropped it down a flight of stairs, and buried it under books and it still works fine. The battery last an eternity. I have gone weeks without ever charging this speaker and using it frequently and it still hasn't died. Can't recommend enough.
 One day past the warranty and it crapped out. Guess I'll suck it up and go with the Bose one.
 I love this speaker, charge lasts forever and it’s got a great sound
 Good sound and battery life; very good for this price point. I got them for my wife but I ended up using it as much as her. Works great around the house.
 Great audio quality and very loud. Bluetooth needs to be in the same room as the speaker and even then breaks up a little unless they’re less than 5 feet apart
 Nothing to dislike. Bought this after reading positive reviews. Compact, very loud for it's size, battery life is FANTASTIC!  I recommend this speaker.
 As described, good quality. BUT, the headphone jack (whatever) quit working VERY shortly after I got it. THE THING SOUNDS GREAT!
 I've purchased two of these now. Great sound (nothing fancy but then it's not expensive either) and durable materials. We take these everywhere and don't worry about damage, it's so easy to clean and use.
 The battery on this thing seems to last forever. I didn't count exactly how long I've gone between charges, but I use it while cooking and cleaning mostly and I've only charged it twice since I first got it 2 months ago. I wasn't happy with the range at first, but I feel like after a few uses that wasn't an issue at all. Not sure what was up with the initial spottiness.
 I love it, I am giving it 5 star cause of the cost and the quality it provides you...its a great product
 Big clear sound in a tiny little box. This speaker delivers clear crisp sound for a small price. A friend recommended this speaker to me and I would recommend it to anyone.
 Wish it was louder but it works great overall. I use it in my car since my speakers went out and it gets the job done. i wish it came with a remote tho so it would be easier to change music from a distance.
 Good device; Falls short of 5 stars, due to the somewhat cumbersome process of switching from the active/connected Bluetooth device to another previously paired device. Essentially you'll need to tap the pair button the speaker (disables current playback), and manually select connect on your second previously paired device.
 Sounds great, Battery lasts a very long time. I use it almost every day. And only charge it every couple months. It was a great price too.
 This little jewel of a wireless speaker was a great purchase. I am very pleased with its performance. The sound is clear, the controls are easy to use, and it's just the right size to carry around if you'd like. It paired effortlessly with my iPhone and with my MacBook Pro. I researched other speakers that cost lots more, but this one works perfectly me for my needs and I highly recommend it.
 just a little more bass. love the battery life.<br/>Update: I had a problem with the auxiliary jack in my bluetooth  speaker. with one phone call a replacement was sent out. The speaker arrived in  two days. I shipped the old speaker back (prepaid postage). Best service EVER. I have another room that is kind of quiet I think I'll buy the A3143 for the extra bass i want. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Anker-Premium-Stereo-Bluetooth-4-0-Speaker-A3143-20W-Output-from-Dual-10W-Drivers-with-Two-Passive-Subwoofers-Portable-Wireless-Speaker-for-iPhone-iPad-Nexus-and-More-Black/dp/B0107WH8Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Anker Premium Stereo Bluetooth 4.0 Speaker (A3143), 20W Output from Dual 10W Drivers, with Two Passive Subwoofers, Portable Wireless Speaker for iPhone, iPad, Nexus, and More - Black</a>
 Although this speaker is small in size, the sound is huge, crisp and clear. Very surprised at the high volume it produces. It’s rugged and has a very long battery life. Highly recommended
 Wow!!  This is a little DYNAMO of a speaker.  Connects easily to everything.  Fantastic sound for a speaker no bigger than a stick of butter.<br/>Will buy another soon for a gift.  Great quality manufacturing, great quality sound, great price. Recommend highly*******
 Pretty good speaker! Got it for my girlfriend. Wish it had more low end like my Sony XB20 but that's a $70 speaker so I guess you can't get it all for this low price.
 Started to have static sounds maybe after 2 months of use.<br/><br/>Update: Anker Contacted me and seems to be replacing it. Hopefully this one works and stays working. A+ Customer Service!
 I've owned three of these.  One of those stopped powering on for some unknown reason, but Anker was really quick to replace it under warranty.  The sound quality is better than I had expected for the price.  It really is a great versatile speaker.  I highly recommend it.
 Louder than expected for its size. It does not have a heavy bass, but it it recognizable. It's battery life is phenominal. I have not used it for 24 hours straight, but I have no doubt that it would last that long. Being that it is equipped with Bluetooth 4.0 the range is roughly 33 feet.
 This has filled a spot in my music playing setup that I have been trying to fill for a long time. This is a very well built speaker, great battery life, great volume, &amp; some pretty good bass response for the size of speakers that it has. For the price this is a great speaker. It's nice how portable it is. So easy to listen to music in the kitchen. Set it out on the deck &amp; it fills the outdoors.  Throw it in your backpack &amp; it's great at the gym.
 Sound quality very good considering the size of the device. Battery life also very good. Bluetooth setup was quick and the connection reliable. The only improvement I would suggest is to make the various tactile buttons on the top of the device (on/off, connect, +/- volume) more visible.They are practically impossible to discern though they are large enough. A useful feature would be to make them luminous in some way so they could even be seen and used with room lights dimmed or off.
 If your laptop has tinny speakers like mine and has bluetooth, you need a simple solution, a bluetooth speaker.  I started checking out the bluetooth speakers on Amazon and I was leaning towards the Anker, DKnight, Cambridge Soundworks, and JBL.  There are so many of these types of speakers it's hard to figure out which to pick.  I narrowed it down to the first three since the JBL cost three times as much.  I'm sure it's a fine speaker, but the others get great reviews as well.  I am curious about how the others sound, but I settled on the Anker because of the 24 hour of playtime, the extreme range 66ft (even though I sit mine next to my laptop, and the reviews concerning the sound quality.  I figured for $35 it was worth a shot.<br/><br/>I feel like I got this one right.  To me, this speaker sounds fantastic.  I listen to a lot of talk radio and voices sound natural, rich and full. There's no vibration at loud volume levels.  All you have to do is hold the power button until the blue light comes on, and pair it with your device.  I didn't read the instructions if it came with any, It couldn't be easier.  Wireless, great sound, super simple to operate, rugged, and inexpensive.  What's not to like?  This is the best purchase I have made in over a year.  I absolutely love this thing.<br/><br/>Update 10/13/16:  I've been using the speaker for awhile.  It still works fine, but there are a few things that would make it better.  The micro USB charging port on mine does not hold the connector very well.  I think the rubberized plastic gets in the way.  When I attach it with a regular phone micro USB adapter from a phone it comes loose easily, disconnects, and stops charging.  So it looks like it's attached, but it's not.  Speaking of charging, the small red led on the side is helpful to let you know it's charging, but if you leave the device plugged in eventually the red light shuts off.  That's good, but even after using the device for several hours while plugged in the red charging light does not come back on.  So is it still fully charged while connected to my laptop even though I've been using it for several hours?  Who knows, the red light isn't on so I can't tell.  The blue bluetooth connected LED on the front has become distracting to me.  I put a piece of black electrical tape over it and that fixed it, but it would be nice if you could turn it off or if it were put in on the backside of device so that you could see that you are connected, but the light wasn't in your face while using it.  The tone to indicate maximum volume is extremely loud and frankly I wish they didn't have one.  I usually have it set at max volume, but wow that tone is loud.  Lastly, the branding on the front grille is a little gaudy.  They could have made a small badge or painted logo in the corner and it would have been more attractive.  A lot of these manufacturers are doing this and I'm not a fan of this practice.  All in all, it is a good speaker for the money, but it's not perfect.
 This speaker sounds great and is unbeatable for the price. Also has an aux in so you can use it in combination with the Echo Dot. It doesn't have the ability to tinker with bass or treble, but sounds really good straight out of the box. Great for the backyard, carrying from room to room while cleaning, kitchen, etc...
 Amazing sound and very well made.I bought mine due to seeing and listening to a friends Sound core.
 Packed with sound in a tiny, portable speaker! I absolutely love the sound and the bluetooth capability!  I can use it virtually anywhere!
 Best bluetooth speaker,great design,sound quality it's amazing and battery life it's beyond expectations.Pairs really easy with any bluetooth device,windows phone,android tablet and mac book.
 Little boy but great sound. What i see as a con is that  for Windows 7 it needs drivers to operate which are not provided or even found yet. I wanted to use ir for my laptop also but i still cant, only tested with Android devices. On win7 i need to wire it (and it doesn't provide the cable either)
 Nice sound for a low price. I have tried it on YouTube, music all kinds, audible I love this thing. It dosn't replace a stereo but does do a great job for what it is.
 I bought this for a camping trip .. battery lasted  all weekend,  24/7 . Sound is good quality even  outdoors  in the woods. Very small and compact.  Bass is reasonable for the size .
 I love it!!  I listen to it at work as I am detailing houses. The sound is great. The price is great! The battery life is great too.
 I've had this for less than a year and it's dead - won't recharge, won't turn on even when plugged in. Very disappointed.
 Seems well made, sound is far better than many more expensive speakers, very clean and clear.  Battery life is excellent.
 This company never fails to deliver great quality.  High end packaging, great quality products. Sleek design for affordable price points.  Lifetime customer A+++++
 Wow! Anker is the best! What a nice little speaker. Battery lasts like a champ!
 The first speaker I had died after a year, but Anker then bent over backwards when they saw my review and gave me a brand-new speaker, which has continued to work perfectly. My family has a 2nd speaker of this same type as well, and it has worked perfectly. I am very impressed with the service that they seller offered and also by the speaker itself. Thank you!
 Love it! It's my shop stereo. Sound is pretty decent. Not epic but its small. The battery lasts forever it seems and its very durable.
 Loud.<br/>Sturdy.<br/>Connects easily to Bluetooth.<br/><br/>Perfect as a music tool for the kiddos, I don't usually use it for anything else.
 Battery life is awesome and nice and clear sound to it . Thanks for a great product anker. I can literally go a few days on medium sound without recharging this speaker.
 This battery never dies. I've had it for about 8 months and charged it 3 times. Not even kidding. It's puzzling. I play it loud and 5 hours a day sometimes. This is a great substitute for the Bose if you like to travel/take it to the beach without worrying about breaking it or getting water/sand in it.
 Love this thing!!  So dependable and great sound!!!!!!<br/>New review: 10 stars to this company.  Not only will you get a great product but their customer service support is beyond anything you could imagine.  ORDER FROM ANKER, they are AMAZING!
 Good speaker for the price a just bought my second one<br/>Still working good.<br/>I have 2 jbl cost 3 times more and lasted 6 months
 This thing is amazing.  Very small but has tremendous sound quality.  All you need is this and your phone for great music anywhere.
 Solid, obviously high quality.  Only complaint is that buttons on top hard to see, should have been contrasting color.  Great fix for horrible speaker in older iPad.  Not as good sound as SO's Bose, but 1/5 the price therefore price vs. performance equation is outstanding.
 After spending too much time researching a speaker that will be used for background noise in my home. This little speaker is great and has a good volume level. My first reaction was holy crap this thing is small. If you are looking for deep bass don't get this, it is good for its size. For my uses it is perfect.
 The size is perfect and the volume for the size is impressive.  I work in a business that has me on the road for 10 hours a day and the radio is monotonous and non existent in many of the areas I deliver to. The promise was 24 hours of continuous play. I've played this bad boy  for a total combined time of about 26 hours and I could've gone longer if I needed to. Well done!<br/>Also, speedy delivery!
 sounds seems pretty clear.  buttons are a b* to press though, that is super annoying.  the battery last for-freaking-ever, i've had this for like a month and use every few days for a few hours at a time and it hasn't died yet!
 Good sounding small Bluetooth speaker. Great for smaller bedrooms or spaces. Battery life is pretty good.
 This speaker is the best on I have had so far! The first one went bad about a month after I purchased it. They replaced it right away without any hassle!!! I will recommend this product to the rest of my friends and family.
 Sound and rage are great but controls are sometimes difficult to work.
 I bought it because I saw that it was really cheap and it was advertised that it was a steal. Dude. Buy like 4 of them. They’re that good.
 This is a great speaker. Great sound, sturdy design, easy to use.<br/><br/>The battery life is phenomenal. I got it in January, charged it once, and it hadn't given me the out of battery until today, 2 months later. I didn't even know what the out of battery sound was until 2 months later guys. Wild.<br/><br/>Very clear, loud sound. It can a bedroom with nearly uncomfortable amplitudes.<br/><br/>Everyone asks me where they can get one.<br/><br/>If you're not sure which speaker to get, choose this one. It's an amazing deal.
 This bad boy packs a lot ! Battery life is much better than most speakers,rubber is very nice to the touch,finally a decent speaker.
 I've only had to charge the battery once so far in about 2-3 weeks, and I listen to it at least for an hour a day. Sounds good. Not much bass though. Well built speaker. Good value.
 This speaker has great sound volume, works great with all kind of phones I tried with. The only problem I think it has is the speaker sometimes doesn't turn off at first time I try pushing the button. I gladly recommend it. Very satisfied.
 All of the sudden, this speaker simply does not work despite many problem-solving attempts.  I guess, for the price, 15 months is pretty good and I should just order another speaker (?)  I am not sure what the life expectancy of a speaker like this is supposed to be.
 great quality speaker.  It sounds really good for such a small speaker.  I gave it as a gift for Christmas but, tested it thoroughly before giving it.
 Not that loud. But, easy to use, and has great battery. I would recommend this to friends and family, if they are cheap like me.. . It gets the job done. You'll be dancing with yourself, just don't expect anyone to notice the sound being great.
 Not a deep bass but does do a good job for what you pay for
 Okay sounds,  one note wonder,  needs better high fidelity and bass. Battery is so so.
 I love this speaker! It made a great gift for my husband!
 Good little speaker with great sound and lasting battery.
 This is perfect.  Sounds good and has a good bass sound to it.  It seems very sturdy and should last for many years.  I have now bought three of these for other family members.  This speaker is better than the Oontz.
 The sound is absolutely incredible. Clear highs and lows.
 Great sound in a small device.  I use it nearby every morning while working out to avoid waking others in the house by turning up the TV speakers.
 I was surprised by the sound quality and workmanship of this speaker....can't go wrong for the price...great value.
 Battery life is excellent, 24 hours is accurate if not an understatement. The sound is great and compares to the more expensive brands at 1/3rd the cost. I enjoy the rubberized finish as it provides grip and looks nice. The durability has been on par, I have dropped it a few times and have had it in light rain without issues. Connectivity is what I expect with Bluetooth, it works well in open areas but can struggle between walls. Overall, I am hooked on the Anker brand and have and will continue to buy their products
 Bought this last July and liked it--more for the price and size than the sound quality.  But it  stopped working a few weeks ago. I've tried everything to get it going again. Seems like this is a common problem with this unit.
 Small yet pretty loud, durable design, insane battery life, I brought this out of the box to a BBQ and it lasted the entire rest of the day on half a charge in 90 degree weather. And as a plus it comes with one of Anker's famous micro-USB cables as the charger :)<br/><br/>Edit: After 2.5 years with these I am happy to say I've had no problems whatsover, battery life is still supurb, no scratches or dings, works perfectly like I just got it
 I got the speaker and tried to charge it in order to turn it on. I don't know what's going on,  but I couldn't get the darn thing to turn on. I can't tell whether the thing just won't hold a charge or if the power button is broken. I'm pretty upset because I bought a case for this too. I should have read the other reviews warning about defective products.
 Purchased due to all the great reviews. I am really enjoying it. I have it connected to my echo dot. I just tote that speaker everywhere I go in my apartment jamming out to music.
 My Jawbone died recently and I was looking for a replacement.  I use a BT speaker quite a lot on my deck.  New house is pre-wired so won't use it out there.  I think this unit is even better than my Jawbone.  Miss the young lady telling me she is "on and ready to go".<br/><br/>Battery lasts much longer than Jawbone.
 good little unit for the price I guess.. could be louder...
 I love this little speaker. I use it when listening to music or podcasts while working and we also take it on vacation with us to the beach or pool. It's a nice small size and the battery life is amazingly long. It's also easy to sync with any of our phones or Alexa. It's by far my favorite and worth every penny.
 This is a great speaker with excellent sound, and like the small compact side.  Worked right out of the box with no issues.  I use it with my Amazon Echo Dot and the sound quality is very good and is the perfect size. I recommend this speaker
 Nice big sound from a lil speaker.will definitely buy agian
 Superb speaker that is perfect in every way!! We tried it with music, commentaries, loud, soft, and range ..... This speaker has very good sound quality. Battery charge is long lasting, its also light on weight without compromising workmanship !!!
 These speakers are great.  The sound is awesome and they are well made.  Extremely easy to set up.  I like to place mine on the bathroom shelf so I can listen to music when I shower.
 I thought I would save a buck by purchasing this over getting a second Sony speaker for my new echo dot.  Had I know there would be a huge difference in sound quality I would have just sprung for the second Sony...
 I LOVE this speaker. I haven't had it that long, but I have subjected it to several abuses and it's held up great so far. To test the sound, I played a variety of music - African, folk, jazz, classical, alternative rock, R&amp;B - and all of it sounded great, even at a high volume. The speaker tends to be a little bass heavy, but it doesn't distort the overall sound of the music. The range is very good and it connects to my iPhone (6s plus) and iPad just fine. Overall, it's a great speaker.
 Sound is great for small to medium rooms, though not quite as good as my Bose SoundLink Mini, but it's a lot cheaper and sounds better than my other BT speaker, an OMaker 4.
 Great sound, especially for the price. Excellent portability, the charged battery lasts a long time. It is also mildly water resistant, has gotten a bit wet and works great in our high humidity area.
 So far I would say this thing is incredible for its price. I paid $38 and it is well worth it. Long Bluetooth range and it is very loud. Smaller than I thought which is a plus.  Easiest Bluetooth connection I've used in this kind of speaker - add this device to familiar devices and it connects almost instantly
 Great speaker for the price. The speaker itself if loud enough for most uses, though it isn't as loud as bose it'll do. The whole build feels quite durable and the speaker was easy to use.
 Bought this first then a Hussar and found the Hussar better
 Nice speaker. Not the best bass, but perfect for my use
 It's awesome!!!<br/>The black color has a nice stylish look.<br/>The speaker arrived on time and was package well.
 Its alot smaller than the pictures.....<br/>  "That's what."<br/>  -She
 Exactly what I expected, just a great portable speaker!
 Really a good product... I have to be careful taking it camping because it's not water proof or shock resistant which is a minor annoyance. The battery life on this thing is everything they claim it to be. I've had the thing for over 2 weeks now and I've only charged it once. (It's been on a camping trip and gets used almost daily since then.) I wrapped it in rubber bands to offer some protection... it hasn't hurt the sound quality (which is definitely acceptable considering the size and cost for the unit). All in all it is a nice little speaker for a great value. Anker did not disappoint! 100% would buy this speaker again.
 For the money, this is a great buy! Quality is better than I’d expected at this price point. May buy another one.
 This is a wonderful speaker.  It lasts a long time on a charge and it sounds great.  And even when you forget and leave it outside for 4 weeks and it gets rainew on and pooped on by birds it still woeks and sound like new.
 This is the best blue tooth speaker I've ever bought and I've bought four. It has 24 hrs of charge and it jams.
 Let me add my vote of praise for this device!  I had absolutely NO PROBLM with set-up and this is my first Blue-Tooth accessory.  Perhaps because I read and followed directions.  Performance  per dollar is phenomenal.  Range tested at least 50 feet.
 Unless you are a sound fanatic this will do the job just fine.
 I'm a huge fan of ANKER portable chargers so I decided to give this Bluetooth speaker a try.  I have played music continuously for two 8hr work days, the battery life is second to none.  However the speaker sound quality diminishes greatly at max volume.  I would not recommend using the speaker in a noisy place.  At moderate volume the speaker sounds crystal clear.  Also, this is not a bass-heavy speaker but is more balanced.  I gave the speaker 5 stars because it does exactly what it claims and it works perfectly for my needs.
 This speaker is awesome! Puts off a pretty decent amount of sound, battery life lasts FOREVER, and it’s very durable and came in really nice packaging! I know I won’t need to buy another speaker for a long time! I’ve had this one for almost a year now and I use it very regularly
 Excellent sound.  Bluetooth eliminates wires between the sound source and the speaker(s).  The small size greatly makes travel with the speaker easy.  I highly recommend this product!
 Amazing speaker, exactly what I wanted. Compact and good quality audio.<br/>The battery though... either the battery reading sent to my phone doesn't work or Anker have discovered infinite energy and are holding out on giving it to the rest of the world.<br/>Battery life is INSANE.
 Anker continues to impress. It's not quite comparable to the Bose, but based on price/quality it's the winner hands down. Great battery life, decent sound, great bluetooth range. Especially pleased I purchased during the Gold Box discount :)
 Big sound for this little guy.  Batteries last for a long time on one charge and has clean and quality sound.  Portable amd easily storred.  Highly recommend.
 I am in love with the Anker brand. Everything I have ever purchased from them has been wonderful in build quality, performance, and design. This speaker is no exception.<br/><br/>I had been looking at several bluetooth speakers in hopes of getting one for my wife for Christmas. After demoing many brands and many models, I decided to get the JBL Flip 3. It seemed to have the best sound quality to decent price ratio. Not as good as the Bose Soundlink Mini II, but it was half the price at the time.<br/><br/>Then I decided to check Amazon to see if there were any other brand that came up that I might have missed. How pleased I was to see the Anker name pop up in my searches. I decided to order one and see how it held up.<br/><br/>Given the 5-star review, you can see that it held up VERY well. It doesn't have the aural quality of a Bose or Ultimate Ears, but I think it's probably on par with the JBL Flip speakers. But the real kicker is that it's only $39.99 as of Jan 3, 2016!!!<br/><br/>That is unbeatable quality for the price. I'm definitely going to buy more of these!
 Battery life is amazing. Clean sound. Great built. When you consider all of those vs. the price.. its a really good product.
 Works perfectly<br/>Great sound<br/>Unbelievable price<br/>Use with iPhone 7<br/>Linked flawlessly<br/>Don't know what else could be important
 I have only had my speaker for a week or so but am very pleased. As advertised, it was extremely easy to set up ( and I am usually technically challenged in these areas) It came packaged very nicely and is easy to use.  I am not a huge music buff so I can not really speak to the sound quality. It sounds great to me. So far, I am very pleased with my purchase and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great speaker at very reasonable price.
 I love this speaker! The battery life is AMAZING, Sound is EXCELLENT but songs with more bass sound slightly off if that makes sense. Definitely worth the purchase 👌🏽
 I use this in my small 1-chair studio salon. Everyone is so surprised when they realize the music is coming from that tiny red thing on top of the cabinets. Really great sound from a little speaker.
 Pretty nice speaker for the price. it's not as loud as my Bose Soundlink, but it was also a third of the price... so...
 I bought this because it was on sale, and I've been looking for a good, cheap speaker - it did not disappoint. The sound is fantastic for its size and price. Will definitely buy again when I need it!
 A good speaker that my daughter uses all the time. Sturdy, decent sound quality, small so it does not clutter her desk space.
 The value of theses is great, happy with my purchase, highly recommended
 SUPER long battery life! They weren’t exaggerating about it. Given the price I didn’t expect much from the sound quality but it’s  not bad.
 I find that it needs to be charged quite a bit, but it works well and is easy to charge.
 Connected the speaker via bluetooth for one minute, played a song to test out the sound then dead. Its still connected but theres no sound. I tried disconnecting and reconnecting but still no sound. Now it won't power off, I tried pressing and holding the power button but still see the blue light on. Im returning this junk. No wonder its 20$
 I own about a dozen Anker products.  They all outperform their price, in many ways.  I was just in Switzerland where I used my soundcore everyday for 2wks of short 1-2 listening sessions.  When I got back, I went to Rifle, CO for a climbing weekend without remembering to charge it.  Played it through a campfire session Friday night.  Left it out (not recommended) and it got a touch of frost on it in the morning.  Played it through a campfire session Saturday night to ease our day of pulling hard.  They promote it for 24hrs.  This thing easily earned it's stripes and still holding loud/amazing sound quality.
 I thought I couldn't go wrong with all of the great reviews and the (half off) price of $35.  It does have a quality feel to it.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed as soon as I played the first tune.  I heard a lot of static, the base was off, and the music sounded tinny.  I played many genres all with the same results. I went with JBL Flip 3 and am much happier with the sound quality.
 Love it. Sounds great. Gets pretty loud. Recommend it!
 Bluetooth this thing with your Alexa you can take it out when your cooking with the grill plug your iPod in it have all your music anywhere and a perfect volume thank you Anker
 Very small, very clear sound, once you charge it the battery seems to last forever and you have to go to a different continent to loose contact.<br/>I love it. not the Jambox that I own but excellent for its size.
 I have used many bluetooth speakers (previous one being Cambridge's) and I must say that Cambridge leads...<br/><br/>Although the built and quality of this speakers are just WOW!
 Good little speaker. Sound is good. Good for Alexa music
 Liked it very much once I got help with the service area (who were very good, by the way).  I couldn't figure out how to turn it on as I didn't receive any instructions.
 Just what I was looking for. Good sound. Very easy to connect and use. Feels like very good quality. Yes, it could be louder. But for my purposes (personal listening) it's good.
 Its pretty small. But the audio is clear and crisp. Not too loud, can definitely hold a conversation while its at msx volume at a party by speaking loudly.
 Love this speaker, good battery life, volume, and size.
 Great speaker. Well worth the money. Works seamlessly with Bluetooth on our Amazon Echo Dot and Apple iPhones. Great service from Anker when contacted about a defect in the charging connection. Sent a replacement Soundcore immediately at no cost.
 The battery lifespan is longggggg , really long. I love it ! Except the beeping noisy that it does every 5 min and when I get a notification it’s annoying but over all the sound quality is perfect !
 Good sound.  Comes with just a usb cord and no power adapter.  I used my iPhone charger power adapter and it took about 4hrs to charge.  Otherwise connected fine and sound was good.
 Sound quality is great for this price range but the battery power is crazy. I’ve had it for about 5 months now and only charged it twice, while I use it daily!
 Great buy for the price, delivered usps in 2 days. It’s not a Bose but works well enough, clear enough to enjoy your music. If your looking for deep bass this isn’t the one you want but like I said I’m happy with it for the price.
 This speaker is perfect for us.  It sounds great and I love how portable it is, I can carry it in my bag easily.  I would love to be able to adjust the bass and treble, but it's an inexpensive option with really good sound.
 Works really well and the sound is great. However, it takes some time to pair to each device.
 Great little speaker played 5 days of 18 holes of golf and was still going on 1 charge. The sound quality is good for what I paid but I would not compare it to my Bose but that's fine I bought it for the battery life and price so I won't complain if it gets lost or broken.
 Does the trick for what I need it for. Would recommend and would purchase again
 For this price, I'm blown away by the quality!!!! My kids and I use this for hours at the pool and I barely have to charge it once a week. It's loud and clear and would recommend to anyone!
 great sound for the money....can now take my echo dot to room or patio for music.
 These speakers have a very great sound at a good volume range. I'm really impressed with this product!
 Fingerprints will appear after some use. Very long battery life, use it almost everyday and I haven't charged it yet. Fits in a backpack or purse without taking up much room. Great for the price.
 I have bought 3 already: one for me and two as presents. I am just amazed of how long the battery last. I gave it as a present to my mom about 6 months ago (she doesn’t use it as often as I do) and it hasn’t required charging yet!!!<br/><br/>Volume and sound quality are pretty good as well
 Lasted 11 months. But worked great so can't complain too much
 This little speaker puts out great sound! i am impressed. It is built solid to take some abuse and has a rubber coating on the outside. I accidentally dropped it already and it didnt effect it at all. Very solid, very nice unit overall. I love it
 This has been a great little bluetooth speaker and I like it so much I bought a second one to carry with me on trips.
 Sound is far better than other speakers I've used at this price point and the battery life is quite amazing for the size. The sound is quite balanced and i listen to podcast all the time on it and they are very clear. Been really enjoying this guy.
 I bought it because I bought an old camper to party in. The speaker worked great it’s not crazy loud but for a smaller camper it was good. The speaker held up aginsed being thrown around and getting stuff spilled on it by a bunch of intoxicated 21year olds. The reason it’s only 4 stars is because I ended up trying to remove some cabinets with a rather big “firework” and when the firework went off it distroyed the speaker...and the camper as well so overall I’m happy with the speaker. R.I.P trap camp
 A really decent speaker for the price.  Works almost as well as an over $100 similar speaker I have. If you are not an audiophile who expects perfect sound, this speaker will work well.
 Great sound quality! So easy to use, didn't even need the instructions. Love it
 Great battery life and sound for a not too expensive speaker.  I connected it to my Echo Dot and use it for an alarm, news, weather, etc... each day.
 Im convinced that it is a pretty good buy at $36. Sound quality is obviously not in par with a $100+ product but it does way more than I expected. Anker's 18 month warranty along with the best customer service makes my buying super easy. Bought two of these!
 Owned it now for over a year. Move my rating UP from 4 stars to 5 * * * * * !<br/>Sound quality is still great. NOT tinny &amp; much better than I was expecting. Battery Life is phenomenal!!! I used them continuously, over 20 hours at a time, on a single charge. I am extremely happy with this purchase!<br/>Not waterproof but other than that I am<br/>VERY HAPPY!!!
 Excellent speaker for casual listening, lovely sound, good (not great) bass, very clean with little to no distortion as it gets louder on mids and highs. It also looks great and very user friendly, gets quite loud.
 Bought for my vacation to play on the beach. The sound quality is awesome. It's the perfect size. Connectivity is easy. Volume is great. The buttons are all easy to use (play button is also skip). Worked out perfectly and I'm sure I'll use it again 😆
 This speaker was a great buy for me. I wanted an extra speaker but something newer than the skullcandy landmine i had. This one fir the bill and so far is loud enough for whay i need
 I would have given this speaker 5 stars, but the Bluetooth stopped working after 6 months...cannot connect to any device😞<br/>I would like to update my review with 5 stars due to AMAZING customer service that replaced this speaker immediately! This is how you keep customers coming back!
 I've bought two of these.  I like them.  The second one was bought for conference calls in a small office.  Works great.
 Got this for my husband who wanted one four times as expensive. He loves it! Charge lasts long and the sound is great.
 Son loves it! This is his first Bluetooth speaker and he's loving it. Great sound quality. Especially for the price in my opinion.
 Have been looing a long time for a the right wireless speaker.  I can honestly say this speaker is "the" best speaker I have had.  I am very hesitant when it comes to speakers with sound quality, with this speaker it has great quality sound, even at the highest volume level.  GREAT BUY!!!
 This speaker is perfect for what I needed it to do! Very clear, crisp sound. Loud, too. I carry it from room to room in my apartment and the music never skips (due to walls between it and my Echo Dot). I can't wait to try it outside this summer.
 To be honest I did expect more. The sound is not super clear. Bass and tremble somehow merge. But I think for the price this is a great product.
 Love this bluetooth speaker! The color, the quality of sound, the sustainable volume level and the simplicity! All of it!
 This is just great. Battery lasts forever. Pairs and connects every time. Sounds great.
 Music sounds great!  It projects sound primarily to the front. Very directional. If you are looking for more boom surround sound, this isn’t it.
 great and good and functional product for chrismax, office and pc gamming desks
 Really good sound and battery life. Perfect size for travel.
 Great sound for the price. Even better battery life. Anker makes great products, it's a name you can trust. Solid construction nice rubber coating. Good bluetooth range. I like how it automatically shuts off if its looses connection after several minutes. I use mine at work and don't always shut it off when I step away from my work station. I charge this twice a week at most, ridiculous battery life.
 I am very proud of the speaker and I wish I had another one just like it
 I love your products. So bought this bluetooh speaker for an anniversary gift for someone that has everything.  I just received a call stating their gratitude for the gift and that they recently purchased another brand bluetooh speaker that just stopped working. Thanks again.
 This is the best small speaker that I have heard, especially for the price.  It has very good sound quality and holds its charge for 24 hours, depending upon the volume.  It was easy to set up and pair with my i-pad and echo dot.  A real value.
 My husband bought this for me because I'm hard of hearing.  It has made a world of difference for me, allowing me to actually hear dialog on TV shows.
 The sound that comes out of this thing is amazing. It has a smooth quality to it and doesn't sound tinny at all. I was actually shocked to hear how loud this thing good go. Perfect companion to an Echo Dot if you have one. Only two small complaints: If you use the wired 3.5mm audio connection instead of Bluetooth, the blue LED light never stops flashing looking for a connection. Also when I had this in my bedroom, directly above my garage, I actually can't operate the wireless garage door openers due to Bluetooth interference. This goes away if I move it to any other room.
 Started out sounding great. After 1 month now I get a lot of static. Very disappointed
 This speaker is an incredible value - very sturdy, great sound, connects to Echo Dot, and best of all....we used this nearly daily for 3 months and the battery never died! We were shocked. Highly recommend making this purchase!
 This is the best invention in a long time. I play SiriusXM on my phone and the sound fills my house. I only plug it in once a week to recharge.
 Loud speakers, with excellent clear sound, with no distortion, great for talk radio and podcasts, and i really enjoyed it for playing music while cleaning up around the house.
 This is a great speaker, however I did have an issue and the battery in it died. I contacted Anker support and they replaced to speaker within 10 days. They support team is awesome.
 This little speaker is very loud and very clear. Only issue is the speaker does not have base.
 Completely blown away. Fit and finish looks great, super high quality. Awesome sound with good depth and the buttons are very nice as well. I can't believe the price on this thing, it easily stacks up against speakers 5x it's price.
 I got this for Christmas for my husband and he loves it! Unfortunately he let it swim in a bucket of water so doesn't work anymore. However he takes it with him everywhere he goes doing HVAC and it's great!
 Check this little speaker out. It has great sound and the battery lasts forever. I bought this to use at work. I work in a noisy warehouse and this little thing is loud enough for me to hear it over the equipment. On one charge i was able to use it for 40 hours before it needed recharged.
 This sounds great! If it holds up I’ll buy more for myself as welll as tell all my friends. I purchased 3 for less than 1 of another brand which kept shorting out. Thank you for a superior product!
 Super happy with my Anker speaker! Loud sound for a small speaker, easy working Bluetooth, easy to enable, and good price can’t go wrong with that price. I have a lot of Anker products and they’ve never let me down!
 Great sounds!  Easy to connect and battery lasted my 3 days of camping trip (didn't use it the whole time)
 Needed a small bluetooth speaker and got just what I wanted.<br/>Worked perfectly right out of the box. Haven't run out of battery yet.<br/>So I guess the advertised time is right.<br/>Would recommend this to someone that wants a small portable bluetooth speaker.
 Purchased as a gift the recipient loves it and uses it constantly
 Currently working with their customer service due to a faulty speaker, they are prompt and very service minded. Great customer service!
 I own several Anker products. Some of them good, some of them are not. This one happens to be very good. I like the sound and the range.
 The battery life on this thing is insane, it had a charge right out of the box and I charged it the first day. It's now been a month of daily use and the battery is still full (you can see the battery percentage on your phone). The sound is also pretty big for such small speakers.

 The sound is great and I can bring it into any room I want. It is easy to set up and the on top buttons are very easy to find.
 Dude I love this thing. It never runs out of battery. Great sound for a casual listener like me. That's not to say it's in any way lower quality sound, though.<br/><br/>Very very well worth the money.
 I use this everyday. Its loud and works great.
 Very happy with this purchase.  Unit looks nice, sound quality is better than i expected, and battery life is great.  Great portable unit for the price
 I just received it today and my wife liked it so much that I had to give it to her... im ordering another one right now, best speaker I have ever owned, loud and crisp sound... I had it for about.. 3 songs lol.... anker is the best.
 This is the one you want. It has a nice sound and plays loud enough to hear on my bike rides (without my headphones SMILE)!
 Works perfectly. Love it and very easy to connect to Bluetooth
 Got this speaker for work( I work in a pepsi warehouse.. Excellent speaker with great quality sound. For the price, you can't beat it.. my shift starts at 5pm and I had the speaker running from 5 pm until 430 am(minus my hour break) on full blast and she still was running strong. Get this speaker.. don't waste your time contemplating over this or other speakers.. just buy it.
 Good sound for the size. Easy to use and set up
 I loved this speaker the first year we used it, then suddenly it stopped charging. I thought maybe it was the charger but it charges other compatible devices. It’s a shame because it has really great sound quality and long battery life. I’ll focus on the good times we had and move on.
 Got this for outdoor use.  Pairing is easy as is other operation.
 It’s so small yet sounds great!  It’s well made, the sound is awesome, got it on sale, arrived quickly and it stays charged for quite some time too.
 it is smaller that I expected AND delivers more sound then I expected so really it is a win-win. I cannot complain about this company at all, every product from them as always been top notch. I am not being coerced by free goods or services, this is just my honest review.
 This little speaker really puts out some sound. I take mine to work where I use it 2 to 3 hours a day.I charge it twice a week and it has never died on me. I also have the JBL clip that I paid more for that can't keep up with my Anker.
 Very easy setup, long lasting battery, pretty loud and sounds good.
 This is a great speaker. I can go days with it charged and use it anywhere. It is a very good product and easy to love for the price.
 Great sound quality.  I cannot say how long the battery life is; I bought this a few months ago, use it regularly, and I still haven't had need to plug it in to recharge.
 I really like this unit. The battery life is outstanding.. The bluetooth implementation is 1st class and the sound is pretty punchy for a device of this size. Great Anker product!
 It is small yet packs quite a punch when it comes to soul d quality. Great speaker!!
 Excellent speaker. I have a similar Bose for my living room, but it is much more expensive and I wanted something cheaper for when I am cooking in the kitchen. Sounds fabulous, even at louder volume, and it is not heavy at all.<br/>I gave it 4 stars only because it doesn't come with electricity charging plug, only USB charging plug.
 Loved the clarity of the vocals its like the artist you are listening to is right there truly wonderful only wished it had some more bass but other than that its an incredible speaker that anyone would love and for the price you cant beat it
 I've tried lots of these portable speakers. The Jawbone and Bose are the only ones that I've heard that sound better. They are also almost three times the price. And they don't sound the times better! For the money I don't think there is a better portable speaker.
 Sent it back. Sound was terrible.
 Hands down the best speaker for the price! Sounds great and the battery life is outstanding. I play white noise throughout the night and I only need to charge it once a week!
 The speaker itself feels very well built and sounds good. Where this system shines is with their customer support.  I had a pairing issue and I can't stress how hard they worked to take care of this.  When the issue couldn't be resolved they sent me a return label and as soon as this was scanned into their system a new one was on the way.  Very easy and relaxed.  They even followed up on the performance of the new system.  Great great great support model.
 Love this speaker for casual use. I can walk around my apartment with my phone in my pocket, listening to music and I can totally forget it's playing 3 rooms and walls away. I can jam in the shower and the great thing is the battery actually lasts as long as it says. My only two concerns is it doesn't pack much boom (bass) but the size and battery life should indicate that anyway. Also, when using the AUX, the speaker still tries to connect Bluetooth and may be wasting battery, but that's a great question for the manufacturer. Would recommend to a friend! Also check out the Unbox Therapy video on it on YouTube. That's how I heard about it.
 The sound quality is not good since it is muffled with distortion. I will keep it to use as a hand free device since the people I call say that I'm clear but they sound is muffled on my end.
 Impressive quality and sound for the Price, its amazing and it has a long lasting battery charge. great for traveling and chilling at home!!
 I love this speaker, but it is very frustrating how long and how hard you have to hold the power button down to get it to turn on.  Everything else is great, but it's enough of an annoyance that I am considering replacing it.  Don't know if they are all this way or if I've got a defective one.  Unfortunate feature!
 First let me thank those of you who shared opinions on this amazing little PowerHouse. I received super fast, and it was packaged very nicely. I charged it to full charge right after opening the box. I have not charged it since, that was 4 days ago. I dont know what the JBL sounds like and will never need to know. This speaker is super easy to connect and to use. The sound coming out of this unit is simply amazing to me.I Highly recommend to anyone who is considering buying.
 This is a wonderful design and good value: compact, reliable, impressive sound quality for something this small and unobtrusive. The only design feature that I'm a bit mixed about is the nearly hidden arrangement of the manual controls: off/on, play, volume adjustment, bluetooth activation. (I have no connection with the company other than being a happy customer.)
 This Bluetooth speaker is inexpensive, but carries a large and impressive sound. It is the perfect size for a bedroom or deck party. The bass technology adds depth to the sound unheard of in other speakers in its class.
 It works. No issues paring. Gets loud fior its size. Used it for a pool party. My only thing is the quality. I'm not sure if its my phone (s7), but the bass seemed lacking. But like I said, it might be my phone.
 Incredible tone and volume for a 12 watt speaker system. It's perfect for the garage, work and gym. It's a great value, worth every dollar no doubt.
 I love this speaker! Originally I purchased it for an echo dot however, it has so many more uses. The battery life is awesome. The volume is surprisingly loud. When connected to my dot, the alarm will wake up the most exhausted sleeper. I can't praise this product enough.
 It can actually get quite loud, but it do lose quality at high levels. I bring it to work and in the past month I've charged it maybe 4 times. I work in a kitchen so I really appreciate the rubber exterior it has. It prevents it from sliding around and I can easily clean it if I get it a little dirty.<br/>I also didn't realize it has a mic so you can answer calls while it is on. Have yet to test this feature out.<br/>I definitely recommend this product to people who are looking for a good affordable portable speaker.
 This speaker was so inexpensive that I figured it wouldn’t  sound very good, but it is great! What a nice surprise!!
 Awesome little speaker. Works great. Well constructed. Sounds great. I have been using it with the echo dot. Works perfect. Great portable speaker. Will fill a small to medium sized room with sound while not making neighbors angry.
 If you read some of the other reviews that compare this to the Bose Soundlink Mini, you will be pretty disappointed. It isn't a bad speaker for the money, and perfectly suitable to be paired with an Amazon Dot, but it simply does not deliver any amount of bass. I would go as far as saying that I cannot detect a difference between this one and the <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Anker-Classic-Portable-Wireless-Bluetooth-Speaker-Powerful-Sound-with-Enhanced-Bass-20-Hour-Battery-Life-and-Built-in-Mic-works-with-iPhone-iPad-Nexus-Laptops-and-More-Black/dp/B00GZC35YK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Anker Classic Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker, Powerful Sound with Enhanced Bass, 20 Hour Battery Life, and Built-in Mic, works with iPhone, iPad,Nexus, Laptops and More (Black)</a> I bought  few years ago. Admittedly, for some reason, the Classic is more expensive than the SoundCore right now, which doesn't make much sense either. Both give you an acceptable sound quality if you don't expect bass. Buy whichever is cheaper at the time.
 Having just received the Sound core, I can only speak to the quality and sound. In a word...WOW!
 I love the sound and it connects easily every time. The only issue I have is that I believe there is no way to back up a song and I have a hard time getting the song skip to work. I would buy again for sound quality and connectivity, for the $27 I spent.
 Love it. Long battery life, great sound, easy set up. It looks like version 2 is even better for slightly more, but if you're just looking to get a speaker where there isn't one, this is the best bang for the buck out there.
 Awesome bluetooth speaker for the price. I have mine for the restroom use and I can hear very clear even when the shower is running. Anker is always a good brand that I do not hesitate to buy. A brand you can trust.
 Great sound and built well.  Bluetooth communication distance is about 30 feet through walls.  Customer service is excellent and directed me to a Soundcore Mini which has an SD Card option so the bluetooth communication is not an issue.  The Soundcore Mini has very good sound for such a small package.
 It delivers as promised, nothing more. I have clear phone calls and the sound quality is adequate at this price range. Awesome portability and battery life.
 Great little speaker with amazing sound!!!! Get yourself one. Well worth the $$
 Quite impressed with this speaker. Great sound in a little package. Unlike a few others I have had it does not distort at full volume. Crystal clarity.
 Better than I had expected. This rugged enclosure puts out a huge sound and has amazing battery life. Pairs up two rooms away.  One of my best Amazon buys.
 Using it daily. Great speaker. The accent here is not on the bass but on clearer sound
 I received this as a gift for Christmas. It took just a few minutes to set up and sync to bluetooth.<br/>What a joy it is to listen to music via my Amazon Echo Dot. I highly recommend it, the sound<br/>is incredible !
 Returned because the sound was very low-- it only gets as loud as the volune on my phone and doesn't have a separate control.  Going for the JBL a bit more expensive but I can control the volume more and has slightly more bass.
 I love this speaker. I've owned a lot of little Bluetooth speakers that sound good, but don't hold a charge very long.<br/>I've charged this once and have used this for over a month without having to charge again. It's amazing<br/>Very easy to use
 the reviews for this speak are what sold me on it but the speaker sounded better than I thought it would. good amount of bass too for its size.
 I was not at all satisfied with my speaker. It seemed as though it were used and the speakers didn’t work well. Although the battery life was up to par, that seemed to be the only thing that was.
 Great sound.  Use it daily.  I am not sure if it is an Apple issue but, I have to delete it from my Bluetooth list on my device every time I use it and re-pair it. Every time.  Annoying although it only takes a couple of seconds.
 Great sound for such a small speaker. The bass will not blow you away or anything but the overall sound is quite good.
 Never disappointed with anything from Anker. This Bluetooth speaker. Is really need. It's loud and last a good long time on a charge.
 Arrived promptly in excellent condition as described and packaged well. Works great. We use it all of the time. I use this out in my shop so it is exposed to lots of dust and temp changes. I have not had any problems with it. Sometimes I wish it could go a bit louder, but for the cost, this is an excellent product.
 Bought as a gift. Can't comment on battery life, but it was very easy to setup, good volume and feels very well made. Definitely makes my original jambox which cost more than twice this seem weak. I might have to get one of these for myself now.
 Excellent quality. I love this speaker. Works very well. Great sound. I can easily bring it from room to room if needed. Very easy to setup and use.
 Stopped working after about a week
 I like it.  I use it in my bathroom while taking my shower.  It is loud enough to hear over the sound of the water.  The bluetooth signal works very well with my Sony Walkman mp3 player.  Easy to start each night and being able to hold my mp3 player away from the speaker for convenience is nice - no wires.
 I purchased this Anchor SoundCore Bluetooth speaker a few weeks ago here on Amazon March 10th 2017 to be exact. I wanted to fully test it out before I posted a review. Trust me when I tell you this Bluetooth speaker is incredible and worth every penny. I purchased it in the Black Version and I absolutely love it. The battery life is unbelievable. I never actually ran the battery down completely, after many hours I would just recharge it to keep it full. The sound is full and Rich and does not to distort at all even at the highest volume. I have quite a few Bluetooth speakers including two BOSE and I enjoy this one as much as any of them. You will not be disappointed at all if you decide to buy one I promise you.
 Excellent sound quality considering the price, I have used speakers that cost more with much lower quality sound output. I use it in my room and take it with me when I go somewhere. Only thing that bothers me is the surface of the speaker. It is really smooth but feels like it can dirty easily
 This speaker is amazing ! It is loud with great bass, it is everything I ever wanted in a bluetooth speaker and more ... and not to bad on the price, "if you have the means, I highly recommend it."
 Great speaker. Very easy to set up. Nice clear sound. Recently used at a party room was big held about 100 people and was asked to turn down the music as it was a bit too loud. Good range was able to walk all over with phone and never lost connection. Nice weight and construction.
 This little thing bumps. I hardly ever charge it: maybe once every two to three weeks. Only downside is the aux feedback when you leave it plugged in to charge. It’s annoying but it’s still usable.
 Not top of the line Bluetooth speaker, but sounds much, much better than playing music from your cell phone. You should be pleased.
 Great product I am very happy with my purchased. The sound is very clear and loud with a nice bass. The thing that impress me the most is the battery life omg!!!! I have been using this speaker everyday like 2-4 hrs from June 10  Up until today thats 14 days going strong without charge. I would definitely  recommend anyone to buy this product.
 Amazingly good sound for such a small speaker. Holds a charge really well. Only way it could have received 5 stars would be if the bass was a little stronger. Overall this is a steal for the price.
 Bluetooth connection is strong. Even sounds good at full volume, But it does lack slightly on the low end... for me.<br/> Edit*<br/>Changed to 5 stars because the lack of bass is not the devices fault, and what sound is there, it's clean sound...
 Sounds bigger than it looks. Haven't really had a chance to use it yet.
 Very easy to use, very good sound, very good quality finish. The battery lasts a very long time between charges. I've recommended this to my friends and I would buy it again.
 Have been playing Classical, Choral and Blues on it - sounds great.  Feels good too, a nice heft.  Matches my Sony SRSX33.  Plays all over my home for a long time.<br/><br/>Downside: no AC adapter and minuscule Owner's Manual.
 Great speakers with great battery life and amazing powerful sound for it's size and price.
 After a while of playback the speaker is pretty good for its price point. Just if your looking for higher more balanced quality sound go buy a JBL.
 I  have problems  hearing but not with this.  I had to purchase 2  before this this little speaker and it really puts out the sound.  wonderful and at one time  it was 3 rooms away and I could still hear it.  the other 2 went back to Amazon !!!!
 Can use any usb micro to charge it, for the price, sounds great, nice and loud. Can't beat it for $20. Plus you can get an extended warranty for like .099 cents! Great deal :)
 Works very well has great sound. Great quality speaker for a great price. Would definitely buy again. Battery last through the night.
 My boyfriend likes to use it while he is working on his car. It's very loud and clear. We have used it at the beach and in the shower and it still sounds awesome in all surroundings. Very pleased.
 This thing is awesome and I can attest to the 24 hour battery life. I use this for a few hours every day and can easily go 2 weeks without the battery dying.  I am highly impressed with Anker and all of their products.
 Good clear sound. Not sure the battery lasts quite as long as advertised.
 I really like this speaker, it is very portable and the battery life is great. I already have another speaker that sounds better, but it is bigger and the battery life is half of the Anker. For day to day use the Anker is my go to speaker.
 Anker is always the best brand.  As soon you charge it will go for over a month without charging.  Proud to tell you friend - go and order.
 Good sound quality.  It's is a lot louder than I expected it to be, and it's very easy to use. I don't like that it just has a USB cable and I have to provide my own IPod charging adapter to charge it.
 I enjoy this device. Small, descent sound, Easy to charge and holds a charge for a week or two with constant use.
 I was looking for a new speaker because my previous one stopped working... This one caught my attention because the reviews were great and plus I'm not too much of a fan of charging certain things too often so the battery life wowed me... This speaker did come a couple days late, but it was definitely worth the wait .... For the size of this thing it can get really loud and the speaker I had had really strong bass but this one has very settle bass but it's more on the viby side... I love this speaker and when this one stops working I will definitely buy another one. Thanks Anker
 Great sound, easy to connect and it reconnects automatically once it is connected to a device.  Very happy with this and in my opinion it sounds as good, perhaps even a little better than the BOSE product.
 sound is loud enough to hear it clear when you drive even with the window down
 Easy to use - great battery life - pretty good sound for such a small speaker!  What else could you want??  Definitely worth the money.
 Such a good punch for such a compact size. Very reliable bluetooth connection (although I mainly use with my Chromecast audio)
 Love it! Great sound. Super easy to pair. Great quality. A little heavier than anticipated for taking on a trip (which is the reason I bought it), but this puppy's going with me! LOVE.
 Very nice speaker, long battery life, great sound but an issue in being able to connect to USB cable charger.  Charging port on speaker is a bit recessed which means some cables do not easily attach.
 Absolutely, without a doubt the best speaker in its class. If you are playing it in a room by yourself for back round music it is sometimes to loud even on the lowest volume. I carry it around with me as i move from room to room; let it play all night long on<br/>my nightstand. The play time is so good it just keeps going,&amp; going,&amp; going. I have it connected to a blue tooth transmitter that's<br/>connected to a SiriusXM radio. ABSOLUTELY the best--- top notch speaker around.
 I charged this speaker once and use it almost daily for about 2-3 hours on and off, it has been about 2months and i have not had to charge it yet.<br/>Great solid speaker- works phenomenal.
 Sound is amazing!! Cant believe how loud it gets with no distortion
 Total BS…  Out of the box to the charger and Rightaway problems syncing then wouldn't even power up…  that said, was able to stream to the speaker twice and the sound was decent…  I got a bad egg…
 I got this for my office warehouse. Connection it’s easy it’s sounds great only thing is I wish the battery life was a little longer but I could keep it plugged in anyway if I need to
 Good sound quality easy to pair and battery life is great
 Has some connectivity issues but sounds good. Wrote a bad review previously because I thought it was dead, the Bluetooth stopped working one day.. Customer support was very helpful to let me know to turn off the device, then power it in and hold down the BT button for a while to reset the Bluetooth. Great speaker for the money and actually the battery is better than advertised. I can listen to music for 3 days at work because I listen at low volume. When I did think it was broken I left it on all weekend to find it finally flashing red Monday morning, so standby time is amazing.
 Good sound on this, easy to use and durable (we've dropped it several times).
 Fantastic value and sound! I bought this speaker for travel and my work on the road. Just used it in a training situation for the first time--it was great. Easy to connect to various devices, long (very long) battery life. Great sound. I did just go and buy a snug travel case for it (available on Amazon--and cheap!), so this is the perfect solution. Looks nice, too--and I loved having it in the hotel room as well!
 Quite happy with the speaker.  The battery life is very long.  Agree with other reviewers about the strong bass and would like the ability to adjust the tone.  Podcasts with human voice are easy to listen to and we used it with a phone as a radio to receive Christmas music.  Bluetooth works, but has cut out sometimes with a distance of only 10 feet leaving me with no sound until I fiddled with the set-up again.  This is so much less expensive than some other well-known brands, that I am satisfied with the sound as it is.
 Paired this with my Echo Dot for use on my deck and kitchen. Great sound and pairs nicely with the Dot. Very happy with the purchase and feel like we can easily move this around as needed.
 Pretty good audio quality. Seems well built and have been using for a little over an hour with no issues. Will update if anything changes. So far very happy and satisfied with the product
 A great speaker for a great price.  I purchased two, one for my wife and one for me.  We use them to play taps from our iPhones when performing POW/MIA ceremonies as well as to p-lay music.
 This little thing kicks ass! Battery life is exceptional! Range described is a bit generous. I find that 16-20ft (depending on the situation) is about all the further your device can be from the speaker. Sound quality is really good for this price point. I'd by again in a second!
 We use outside in our back yard, no issues....
 Great sound and easy to set up to bluetooth.
 This product is a great deal. It small and durable. It has good sound and a decent kick. The best part about this product is the battery life last FOREVER! I maybe charge this once a month. Great Buy.
 While the volume is good for the size, when it's max out you can hear the static noise, just like the cheap earbuds. Sound quality is definitely not very good, even for the price. I was expecting better from the reviews.
 This is my second Anker SoundCore purchase. The quality of the sound is amazing. It is very easy to use staright out of the box. Pairs easily and quickly to my iphone. Battery life is exceptional. DID purchase again 😁
 I just wanted a decent speaker to listen to music while I work around the house. This one has a great sound and volume for its tiny size. Easy to use. would highly recommend
 This blue tooth speaker is fantastic! It is a lot of speaker in a little package. I use it at home, around the pool, and in my office. The sound it delivers is as good as my JBL blue tooth speaker. This speaker is a real bargain that I would highly recommend to anyone who wants clear sound, easy hook-up, great volume and device control right from your device.
 So far so good. I saw my Aunt listening to her boleros using her phone speakers while cooking and decided to upgrade her to this low cost/high ratings speaker and to my surprise it sounds better than I was expecting- to make the long story short, my Aunt is very happy with this gift. :)
 Its ok. Works well enough, sound is good. Don't know about the 66 ft range though. Cuts in and out.<br/>Might be a line of sight thing. Guess it doesn't go through walls too well.
 Great sound--Great battery life (very surprised)
 I've had mine for a year and five months and have yet to be dissapointed. Great sound quality, battery life and dependability
 Great speaker for the money. We have used it out by the pool quite a few times already and the sound is great. The battery life is amazing. Have not had to recharge it yet.
 Impressive sounding speaker for its size.  Use with tablet and Bluetooth picks up signal clearly and quickly.  No distortion from Bluetooth use.  Perfect item when room has no music and you want there to be some.  Sound is clear and even gives out a fair amount of base.
 Best choice ever. Life of the party. Great price too.
 Love, love, love this little speaker.  For such a small speaker, it has a surprisingly rich and dynamic sound.  It sits on my desk at work and sounds so nice.<br/><br/>Also, the battery life is even better than I expected, I play it most of the day and have to recharge it every two days.<br/><br/>If you want to fill a small room with sound, this is the speaker for you.
 Awesome sound!  Almost too good.  I use this at work and have to wrap it in a towel to muffle the sound because on the lowest setting, it is still impressively loud.  It will be great when I take it on camping trips!
 This is my go-to speaker!!! Came nicely packaged with a charger as well. It plays loud and for the price, its amazing!! Sometimes it doesn't connect to bluetooth right away, but i can be on a different floor in my house and it still works!! love it!!
 I've had this speaker for quite some time now (Over a year) and it's still flawless. The sound is phenomenal for what you pay and the charge lasts really long and the sound is amazing. Got this as a cheaper alternative to the bose soundlink and i have been more than impressed. Only drawback is the loud beep it does when you turn your device volume to the max
 Just got it, won’t even charge...so my review is THIS THING SUCKS and I will pay a little more and get one that actually works. This is going back today.
 Surprisingly good sound for the money. Good quality build (nice and heavy).
 We purchased this for outside pool use.  First time setup was a snap even without instructions.  We charged it up previously in the day and ran it all night.  Never a skip in the music.  Very happy.
 The speaker can only connect to one device any. For example if I'm playing a video on my computer then want to listen to a podcast on my phone you have to turn the computer bluetooth off, then put the speaker in pairing mode and repair you phone. Same process if you want to use the computer instead of your phone. PAINFUL!
 Great speaker. My first one crackled.... the company replaced it with no problems.
 Works as advertised sync’s great with devices. Sound is very good
 Sounds great, looks great, feels great. Seriously high quality looking product, the texture of the finish is fantastic.
 Hello so I bought this speaker January 15 and it was a very good speaker loved it but all of a sudden it just stopped connecting to phone it cracked up and just disconnected and I am very disappointed I’m sure it’s been over a month now and I can’t have a refound😤
 Great sound quality ! ! !  Just as good as the expensive ones.
 A good enough little speaker. That is, good enough for $30 which is what I bought it for on sale. I wouldn't pay more though. It has a good sound but still feels limited and lacking depth. Again, it's fine. So long as you don't pay full price.
 My first bluetooth speaker, it works great. No hassles connecting, good battery life, good sound for its size. My laptop is useful for watching movies again.
 Replaces a JVC unit and this is simpler to use, and smaller.
 First Bluetooth speakers that I've bought. I would buy them again. Great for indoors. I wouldn't reccomend them for a loud/big party though: example college or New Years. I don't think it would be loud enough. But for a small group they work great.
 Cool and compact, delivering nice sound quality for the size and price. To think, I was considering one of the small Bose products at almost 4x the cost. Some devices quickly and automatically pair with the Anker Core speaker, while my Surface Pro 2 has to be re-set each time. Other than that small inconvenience, very happy with my red speaker!
 Sounds great. Love the Bluetooth range. Super happy with it. Have read some bad reviews but I haven’t had any problems. Gets pretty loud for such a small speaker and has pretty decent sound.
 Really great little speaker. Was thinking about  biting the bullet and splurge for a big name speaker. So pleased I bought this Anker. Stays charged unreal and really sounds great. Go for it.. you won't be sorry.
 My iPad's new sound system.  The sound is awesome, Bluetooth works flawless and the price is great in comparison to like products.  I've taken it at least 40 feet from the iPad in a different room and it worked good.
 Turned me on to the Anker brand. Sound quality is somewhat poor, but good enough for what it is.
 The speaker is sturdy and very well made.  It sounds amazing and we are very happy with the purchase.  I saw the great reviews and purchased it based on the reviews,  but it exceeded our expectations by a lot. Definitely a great buy!!  Probably going to get another on for my little boys room!!
 A great sound and a very affordable price.  I love the small, compact size.
 Bought it to use around the apartment.  Mostly use it in the bathroom while i get ready for work in the morning.  Good sound quality and great battery life.  Connects easily to my Samsung S7 phone.  It won't shake the room with it's base, but it's enough for my needs.
 This is the third Anker device I purchase and I cannot recommend this brand highly enough. So far, everything I got from them is top notch. In this case, this small speaker sounds louder than you would think, the sound quality is fairly well balanced and the battery lasts a really long time.
 Great sound for a little speaker! I use this all day at work and the battery lasts several days.
 I purchased this gift for a friends birthday present. Right under a month from the date I bought it she let me know it stopped working. The light stayed on and would not turn off but it would not do anything. It happened while she was charging it. I was able to get a refund, so I'm not too upset but just inconvenienced.
 Great speaker Tony but it will give you big sound and very long battery life.
 Great product. Sounds great accidentally ran it over and it still works lol wouldn't recommend doing that but I will recommend this product.
 The sound quality is very nice, and carries through my small home. The battery also seems to last quite awhile, before needing recharging.
 HUGE battery life!!! And loud with great sound. Put in my bathroom during shower, not in the shower but on the shelf and it's working great.
 A bluetooth speaker with very good sound and great range.  There is a nice balance between bass and treble which gives clear crisp sounds without overwhelming bass tones.  I really like this product and look forward to using it for years to come.
 Another solid product from Anker, I guess the sound could be slightly better but that's me clutching at straws to suggest an improvement, build quality is excellent, sound is very good and battery life is great. Highly recommended.
 Nice, clean packaging! This is my first portable bluetooth speaker and am very happy with the sound. I wasn't expecting a small device like this to have incredible bass, but it still sounds nice and full as opposed to sounding hollow (tested with Childish Gambino's "3005"). Purchased the black model and I am happy with its low-key design.
 No issues,no problems.Charge lasts long.I turn on,and iPad instantly finds,and connects. Would buy again.
 This is a neat little speaker which has a great sound!!  The battery is awesome!!  It holds the charge as advertised!!  Quality.
 I like it. The battery seems to last forever.
 Worked for one day. I returned it.
 Anker is the best in portable power so I gave this a try! Amazing!!!! I've been using it at work now for the last 3 nights, I keep it low-half way up and so far its latest 30hrs! Sound quality is great, no distortion at full volume! Best portable speaker you can buy for under $100!
 I bought as a graduation present for my roommate. He loves every bit of it! The bass on it is nice and the battery life on it is nothing short of amazing! It feels durable and has the options to connect it wireless and via a wire depending on what you have. Anker really delivered on this product.
 Bought as a gift for my wife, as she would just try to blast her phone speakers as loud as possible with little success.  It's quite tiny, but for it's size it puts out amazing sound!  She in the past used a Bose dock for her old iPod, which had wonderful sound, so she was a bit skeptical about this tiny speaker by the company who makes all the chargers I buy for our phones.  What a pleasant surprise!  Very loud, VERY clear and full sound!  She's a happy camper!
 Defiantly worth the money. Sound output is great for the size. I love this lil speaker. Twice as loud as the previous one I owned.
 Great speaker. Sounds good though wishbtheblow end was little better but quality is great. Love the long battery life. Don't have to charge that often.
 Loud enough to use outside when working. Great battery life last all day no problem
 HOLY CRAP! Surprising sound out of a small form factor. I am partially deaf, and to be amazed by sound quality and the power of the speakers are such a great feeling. LITERALLY GRINNING!
 This small bluetooth speaker has incredible sound-- very clear even at high volume, and great bass.  I highly recommend it!
 Checked many reviews for bluetooth speakers and I totally agree with the reviews saying that Anker Soundcore is the best affordable bluetooth speaker around.  No problem with bluetooth link with my Samsung TV, my ipad, my iphone 6S, my daughter's LG G4.  The bass is excellent for its size with highs that are ok. (can't win'em all)  The best thing about it is the length the battery lasts.  It says 24hours, and I probably will not test it for that long, but I don't worry about battery life with this speaker.  Highly recommended!!!
 I love this little speaker. Great sound. Had a problem with my unit. Contacted customer service. They got back to me super fast. Offered suggestions for fix and or refund. No hassle just great service. The suggested fix worked. Very happy customer. Thanks Anker!
 This thing rocks and sounds great
 I would no recommend buying this speaker.<br/>The newest version has many improvements that really just make this version obsolete.<br/>My loves:<br/>Battery life is unparalleled in comparison with other speakers. I usually was able to run it on one charge for 3 days straight on my 12 hour shifts and still had juice.<br/><br/>My gripes:<br/>The sound lacked base, volume. In closed spaces it did its job but I've had other speakers that filled the areas better. The base was almost nonexistent which just gives you a fuller listening experience.<br/>Also, it's not water/dust proof. I'm deployed in a desert environment which is a must for me. The newest version is and that is just another selling point when you want to take it into the shower with you or if it rains.<br/>It does have rubber protection in its casing that helps with the heavy handling.<br/><br/>Overall range is good. But the newer version has about a 50-70 foot range with solid connection.<br/><br/>This is a good speaker but if you're going to buy this you might as well get the newer version. You won't regret spending the extra bucks.
 Pretty decent sound for the price. Great to take traveling I have taken it a few places and it's perfect size and light weight and holds a long charge.
 Works like a charm.  A lot of great sound out of such a little box.  I like that it has volume control on the speaker.  Another brand I bought lacked this feature.  All in all, a very good speaker at a reasonable price.
 Unbelievable sound! Love this little speaker!
 This little thing is pretty loud. It is also very clear I listen to my Podcasts on it and music no problems.
 I loved this speaker, it had good volume and seemed to be well made.  Unfortunately, the WIFI last exactly 2 months, so of course it’s now useless.  Don’t waste your money.
 What else can i say that others haven't, great sound - bought to work with the Echo Dot - and is fantastic for that (and streaming from Spotify)
 I really like the quality and the look of the speaker and the sound was good but had zero bass so this speaker just wasn’t for me it was worth a try though
 Works well, For being a bit Bigger it doesnt have that punch your looking for, However.. It is VERY durable, so if your a mechanic or you work outdoor's, It cant hurt to have this lil buddy. 4 stars if the pairing were easier, and 5 if the sound matched the size.
 This little powerhouse is awesome.  I turned it on (did not have to add batteries) and it synced with my iPhone.  I was playing tunes in about a minute.  Nice sound (it's not Bose... but it didn't set me back like Bose would have either.)  Great product!!
 Easy to charge and pair. Sounds great in kitchen while cooking, having dinner. I bought the black and am still careful to pick it up by the edges so I don't get smudges on the rubberized surface.
 Easy to use.. its just the right size for the van.  Would purchase again
 Depends on what you"re looking for but for us it didn't put out sound had hoped it would, I already own a Lepow Modre bluetooth speaker, and I have to say that one is cheaper and sound better, very disappointing
 I love it better than the one I got from sprint
 These were my second pair of Anker speakers. I had the small bluetooth speakers before. Those broke after I had the volume on too high, so I brushed it aside as user error. These speakers however lasted for awhile, with plenty of volume. All of a sudden a few days ago, the volume can no longer go beyond a whisper when connected to bluetooth. However, when you plug them into a headphone jack, they work fine.<br/><br/>Update (10/12/16): Anker replaced my speakers within days of them breaking. They are now working great.
 Nice. Sound is clearly and loud. But bass is not so. That is understood soundcore system. 220v phone charger also can be use. Actually for 110v. Easy to use . Happy about this.
 Haven't pushed the battery life so I can't comment on it but the speaker is amazing and the sound is great 4 of 5 stars on sound because it is not as bassy as others, but man is this a great product!
 Great little speaker. Bought it for my husband to use while in the shop and the sound it produces is clear and plenty loud enough.
 Great sound, small package, unbelievable battery life.<br/><br/>Yet another awesome product from Anker. There's a reason this has been voted as the favorite bluetooth speaker on several sites, and at ~$25-30, it is a STEAL.
 preety dang good sound for the price and size...fickly on maintaining a Bluetooth connect though.
 Loved the build quality and aesthetic, however, when playing songs I noticed that whenever strong bass came on the speaker would pull back on treble and midrange sounds and it would distort the music. A little disappointed to be honest, after reading stellar reviews. Sound also does not sound as full as I would like.
 So I’ve been meaning to review this item for awhile.  I couldn’t be happier with it. Sounds great. Not awesome but for the price what do you expect. What’s amazing is that over the course of the last few months I’ve only charged it 2-3 times. Battery life is superb!  Range is also great. I highly recommend this product
 Love this speaker!!  Easy set up and easy to use.  Sound is great too!!
 I had previously bought a Billboard Bluetooth Wireless Speaker With Enhanced Bass, TF Card and USB Flash Drive Slots.  It was awful in terms of the user interface.  I bought this model, and was pleased not only with its superior user interface, but it has much better sound.
 I never take the time to post ratings on products I receive but I HAD to on this one! Best Bluetooth speaker I've ever come across. It a sleek, cool look. It's extremely durable and I take it everywhere with me. The sound is AMAZING! It's easy to use and stays charged FOR SO LONG. I would HIGHLY recommend this by. Such a good price for an amazing product!
 The sound quality is good. It looks good and is the size I wanted. Seems very sturdy.
 It's a great speaker, easy set up, easy to use, but I bought it for the office so I honestly wish it would go a little lower than it does so now I have to figure out how to use it at work...
 Works well. This is my first Bluetooth speaker. It adds a nice ambiance to dinner as Jazz is playing in the background.
 The reason I gave this product 3 stars is because it lasted only 3 months before not working anymore. Dont be fooled by the size because the sound was loud and clear, not muffled full of base. Anker gave me a full refund for this speaker which was great. I really liked this speaker and would love to order another one, but unsure if that will last only 3 months as well.
 I use this around the house at time.  It produces nice sound and is easy to use.  connects well to bluetooth
 I wanted something compact, attractive, it packs a punch, along with a good clear sound. I'm a team Apple user so connecting to any of my devices via Wi-Fi is just a breeze. This little sucker can go for quite some time. Most recently I had it on continuously for about 8 hours. For the money I highly recommend it!
 When I first opened it was surprised by how small it was compared to others I’ve had but let me tell you don’t let the size fool you it has really great sound and is quite loud for its size and the Battery life on it is Amazing!! I can use it all it all day at work (about a 8-11 hr day) and not charge it and it still has juice for the next day to. I’m Glad I bought this in the end!
 Works great. Sounds really good. Battery life is still to be determined but has been good so far. I bought this to listen to music while in the shower and for the price it can't be beaten.
 Have only had it 2 days and been using it to play the sound from movies on my phone and play music. I also tested out the microphone and everything works great. I am now charging it but I can tell you that from 10% power I listened to it non stop for over 2 hours before I got home and decided to plug it in. Great speaker would definitely buy another
 I use this in my classroom. I have a rather large room and it is loud enough for people in the back to hear. I like playing music and movies on this while I clean up my room.
 Very good for its price, is able to fill a single-court gymnasium with sound. Amazing battery life - I charge it every now and then and never had this run out of battery on me. Great for outdoors use as well; I don't think you can find much a better speaker for this price!
 Best Bluetooth speaker I’ve had. Use it about 20-30 mins a night and the battery lasted over a year. I’m not exaggerating.  Get this speaker. It’s reslly good.
 I am not an audiophile but this speaker far exceeds what I was expecting. The speaker that is built in to my internet radio does not have anywhere near the sound quality of this speaker.  It's main use is in our bedroom but I am able to move it into the bathroom to listen to while in the shower. I expect to take it with me when I travel for use in hotel rooms. This works perfectly for what I purchased it for.
 Great affordable Bluetooth speaker. I really like Anker and the products they offer. This was nice to have at the beach, great sound on a windy day. Wish I didn't have purchase a case to go along with it.
 I had some technical issues with the unit that I ordered. However AnkerDirect was very prompt to send a replacement unit. Overall, very good experience with customer service.
 For the price I paid for this it is exactly what I expected.  It works great and once charged plays for hours.  It syncs with every device I've tried so far and has good sound quality.
 Great value. Great for travel.
 My husband and I love this speaker. The sound is excellant and the Bluetooth distance is awesome.
 I use this speaker to listen to music, usually at fairly low volumes, in my office. Considering the size and price it sounds great. It will NOT replace a "real" speaker system, but I'm pretty happy with it. It sounds best when placed on a shelf right up against a wall. I've tried out three different similarly sized and priced speakers and this is by far the best.
 Great speaker with long battery life.
 Good quality speaker. I think I would have liked actual buttons instead of just having the markings on the case . Makes it a bit harder to turn on and adjust
 I've bought a ton of things off Amazon over the years.  From video games, to books, to medical needs, etc.  This Anker SoundCore Bluetooth speaker may be the best thing I've purchased.  Especially, when you look at the relatively low-cost ($40).  The speaker is very portable.  I use it when I go to sleep at night.  I use it when I take a shower in the bathroom.  I bring it with me into the kitchen when I cook dinner or do the dishes.  I've even taken it on car trips because my CD deck doesn't have Bluetooth itself or the ability to plug my phone in and play songs off my phone.<br/><br/>It is extremely easy to carry around and place in different parts of the house and the range seems to be pretty solid.  It also can get quite loud and it definitely plays all my music much better than my iPhone does.<br/><br/>I rate this device so highly because of its high quality and that I get a ton of use out of it.  It also holds a battery charge for an extremely long time.  Sometimes I go more than a week without having to charge the battery.<br/><br/>I HIGHLY recommend this Anker SoundCore Dual-Driver Bluetooth Speaker for ANY person looking to buy a portable Bluetooth speaker.  Unless you're insanely rich.  Save yourself the money from more expensive units by Bose or others.  And buy this device from Anker instead!
 I drive a semi-truck and listen to podcasts while driving. I pair my phone and I am able to increase or decrease the volume without unlocking my phone right from the speaker. Semi-trucks are loud when you are going down the road and this speaker works great. I liked it so much I bought one for my daughter to use for listening to music when she is cleaning the house. She loves hers too.
 I have used a few Bluetooth speakers in various price ranges and quality. This is so far the best. Does not go off as long as phone is connected via Bluetooth. Crystal clear sound and strong bass.
 Great sound.  it was easy to set up but  it lost it's connectivity and that was hard to reconnect.  Directions would be better if they were  all in English on one side.  Overall, I do like it and would recommend it to anyone who might be interested...
 Anker Everything You Want to Know -<br/>1- UNBOXING -- The speaker does not comes with unnecessary packaging.  Pretty much just what it takes to protect it.  It comes with an instruction sheet and a small box with a charging cable.  Make sure you do not throw the little box away by accident!  It comes with sufficient charge to listen right out of the box.<br/>2- APPEARANCE -- Anker continues the current trend toward minimalism.  All controls are subdued and you have your standard +/- and play buttons.  Weight is surprisingly hefty for its size and feels that you have purchased a solid product.  Standard 3D rectangular form.  Has a blue light to indicate power and pairing.<br/>3 - FEATURES --  Has an auxilliary port to connect with a cable to a source.<br/>4.- SOUND --  This little guy rocks!  I was very surprised.  I could feel the forced air coming out of the front grill.  This is not going to fill an outdoor location with sound but a small place like a dorm room definitely yes.  The bass is decent and provides good highs and mids.  Again, the sound is surprising and you feel the power as you carry it in your hand.<br/>5. - VALUE --- AMAZING value!  Best speaker at the price level; no doubt.<br/><br/>BUY IT!  BUY IT!!!  This makes a perfect gift for anyone.  It is a solid performer and a great value.
 Easy to use. I live being able to stream my favorite music while my phone is still inside.
 The battery has still never died, I charge it once or twice (if using heavily) per week.  Super reliable.  Thing also gets loud as hell for its size too.  Could stand to have more bass, but I don't expect anyone to alter the laws of physics.
 Surprisingly good sound for how cheap it is. This is the initial review taking it out and trying it. Easily pairs with my phone and is loud enough to cover a lot of ground. Considering hooking it to the Echo Dot for more volume when it's not being used by myself or the kids.<br/>Blares Pantera with ease. Good enough for me.
 Bout this for my mother for her birthday so she could listen to her music at work and she loves it
 This is a great speaker. I use it for my Echo Dot, it paired easily. The speaker itself is solid and had great sound. I would recommend this product if you're looking for a speaker.
 Love this thing! Sounds amazing and is load! If you are looking for a nice lift weight portable speaker this is for you. I would buy again.
 All treble but great longevity. The battery will outlast us all at the pool. Volume is good. 4 would have given a 5 if range of sound was better. Worth the price and would recommend and purchase again
 I decided to buy this for my gf she said she wanted a small blue tooth speaker, and boy am I glad I did this is a fantastic little speaker it's almost as loud and clear as my larger one that I paid 125 bucks for!
 For the money this is a great speaker. Not much else to say.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>-sound quality is great. I haven't had any issues or breakage<br/>-build quality is great.<br/>-the customer service is A+.<br/>-connecting to bluetooth is simple and straight forward<br/>-the controls are intuitive<br/>-it's cheap<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>-the surface is an oil magnet. Don't expect it to stay pristine or clean<br/>-that's...that's about it.<br/><br/>That's about it. I chose Anker because of their customer service. The service rep was very cool about it.
 Read the many reviews of the this little blaster before ordering it.  I must say that this speaker is every bit as powerful as the Bose speakers I was researching.  It stacks up in every sound category with the exception of the real low end bass, but it performs so well that I'll take that hit when I'm paying about $100 less for this gem.
 I love rich, full sound with bass. This was not it, but I did not expect to get great sound for the price. It served the purpose well for using it to travel and play in hotel room and on the beach. Held a charge very well. Does not take long to charge. Would recommend.
 For the price. Anker is still beast. Great wireless speaker. Crank it to 11... Sound quality takes a hit. Still.. for the price it's amazing.

 Sounds great, works great, super easy connect, nice run time on charge, and very good volume. Would buy again in a heart beat.
 Easy to install.  It follows me to every room in the office.  Excellent Customer Service^^
 I purchased 2 of the same glad to have one black &amp; 1 blue.  Really good sound.  Replaced my am/fm radio.<br/>The power connection can be tricky to attach then it drops off to easily.
 Would not stay charged for more than an hour and then wouldn't charge at all
 I once went a whole week without charging this thing. It has a great sound and super convient to have. Best speaker for the price !
 So I bought this for my birthday as a small gift for myself. At my company we use Anker batteries and they are top notch, so I assumed the speak would be as well. This has turned out to be the best bluetooth speaker I have had in a long time. I was using a UE BOOM and just was having so many issues out of the battery on it. Hopefully this Anker SoundCore will hold up to my usage for battery.<br/><br/>Thanks Anker Team
 My first anker sound got a problem with its blue tooth. The seller replaced it immediately without incurring extra costs. Their customer care responds so fast and provides the best customer care. The new product works perfectly well. I would 100% recommend this product to others.
 After three weeks stop hooking up the Bluetooth 💁🏻‍♂️
 This was easy to connect and the perfect size too. The sound quality is better than I expected.
 Small stereo with a big punch in sound!!!
 Love this thing only thing that could do better was getting that blue light in the front of the speaker looks kind of weird but sound quality and battery life is amazing sometimes i forget to charge it just because it lasts me like 3 days or so without charging it
 You can't really beat this for the price. Yes, they're better speakers out there, but for the price, this is the best. Sound quality is great and the battery life is awesome. Would recommend.
 Small and works ok.  Doesn't have the sound of my SoundLink, but it's a lot cheaper too.  If you want really great sound pay more money, but if you just need to get a speaker to put in the bathroom while you take a shower this will do.
 Love this speaker! Bought one for home use, and one for my nursery school class. I can play any music I need for my class, and the sound is great! The price is great too!
 Sounds great. Of course I wish it had a bit more bass but its a quality speaker. Loud and clear. Design is cool and compact. I bought one for my niece and she said she loves it. Links right up to the phone no problem.
 WORKS GREAT!!....GREAT SOUND....GREAT PRICE.....GREAT BATTERY STORAGE CAPACITY....VERY HAPPY WITH...WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS BEFORE I BOUGHT 2 (ONE DEFECTIVE) JBL FLIPS!!!
 I love this speaker. Not a bad price for a speaker that is sleek, obsolete, and produces good sound. It feels like excellent quality and sounds like it, too.
 Bought this product over similar ones because of the great reviews that it had. Happy to say that the reviews were spot on. This product is great. The sound quality is great, the volume is great for its size, and I have never had any problems with Bluetooth connection or battery life. LOVE IT
 The sound is super muddy and muffled. Not a fan. The Jawbone Jambox sounds way superior to this because the highs are more clear and the bass doesn't sound mumbly.
 Great sound quality, charges well on any charger I've used and just lasts a super long time.  Forthe price the best portable speaker I've ever tried.
 It's an OK unit. If you are not a sound kind of sore or audio file. But decent for background. Do not expect a lot of quality in sound reproduction.
 I bought this when it was a lightening deal and I'm so glad I did! It's small, great for traveling, good range, the sound is awesome! My husband loves it too! We use it multiple times a week. And let's be honest, it's perfect for kitchen dance parties!
 I purchased these speakers for listening to music from my phone and computer. Price is very reasonable for the money. Sound is good and using your eq to adjust sound is the best way to get the most from these speakers. The quality can be seen and felt as soon as you open the box to remove the speakers. Keep in mind the price point is good as is the sound.
 Beat it around. Great quality and great sound
 BEST IN ITS PRICE RANGE, SIMPLE AS THAT.
 I used this speaker for a few weeks and it worked great. I tried it today and there is no sound coming out. Everything was paired and the volume would go up and down just fine, just no sound. I unpaired/forgot the device in hopes this would take care of it and it didn't.
 This little speaker works well for the size.  I use it with the Echo Dot on my 3 season porch and deck.
 I bought this for my houseikeeper so that she could move her music around with her. She loves it. I had initially gotten her another unit that was simply worthless. This one works great, and sounds fantastic for it's size and price. Both her and I are pleased.
 I love it! The only thing that I don't like is the design of the buttons, I often end up hitting the wrong one when I can't see them in the dark or in general, other than that, the sound is great but probably not on the level of the higher quality name brands such as Bose.
 Good speaker for news and an echo dot, doesn't compete, as advertised, with higher end devices, Bluetooth distance is much less than claimed.  Good battery life and simple to operate.  My main complaint is a lack of bass and warmth.
 This speaker delivers great sound and great quality!
 Our speaker fell off our tractor and got run over within an hour of being charged the first time. It was still playing music while being pushed into the dirt! We were very impressed.
 The sound isn't as loud as other speakers I've purchased, but the buttons feel nice. It connects, and is portable and does it's job.  Good purchase for the money, just wish it was a bit louder.
 Stopped working after 3 months I don’t know why
 I bought this for my son and I have to say it is the best little speaker for the money! This little guy has tons of bass and sounds awesome!
 Better than expected. My granddaughter hasn't been able to destroy it after several months.
 Great little speaker. Good dound, long charge life, easy to use.
 This anker is SO loud. My home is about 1,200squft and I can hear though the whole house. So happy I bought this. I hardly ever need to charge it for as much as I use it
 The size is perfect and it is easily  portable.  The sound is great! My girlfriend loved it and is ordering one for herself.  After getting it fully charge it connects easily to your device.  One suggestion is, it would be nice if the controls (volume, turn-on/off, etc.) were lite or more visible. All the controls blend with the color of the Anker device which makes it difficult to see.  Changing that would be a nice improvement to the device which has outstanding performance.
 Nice quality,easy as pie to install
 This speaker is excellent. You can feel the quality as soon as you take it out of the packaging. The battery life is awesome and it is loud enough for indoor and outdoor use. Well made and well packaged. I will only use Anker speakers from now on.
 AMAZING!!!  The sound from this little box is unbelievable.  I was sick and tired of listening to Pandora on my cell phone, when I'm on the patio. Now I can enjoy it!!
 Beautiful and small, this speaker is powerful and clear and worked out the box! It was easy to pair with laptop and phone. It is small enough to bring on travel. I highly recommend.
 This Anker connects great and sounds fine. The little Anker they sell is a bust.. The Cube.. but I recommend this one.
 Extremely Happy with my purchase, good quality sound, well made product and 1/5 of the price for similar product from Bose. Thank you ANKER.
 I love the mobility and sound so much I bought a second one for my dad. Unfortunately there is a problem with the charging port so I can’t recharge it. I wish I realized this before it was too late to return.
 Does exactly what it is supposed to do.
 This is a great speaker for the size &amp; price, easy to use, easy to pair and the sound is a good quality. The battery charge holds for many hours as well.
 So far I am very impressed with this product. It has good range, crisp and clear sound, buttons are easy to use, charges quickly, easy to pair with Bluetooth, and can play very loud without distortion. Highly recommend it, especially for the price.
 The speaker works very well and sound is crisp.  Bass is not as strong as hopped, but for a bedroom speaker it works fine. Anker has always created great products, and this speaker keeps the tradition alive.
 Love, love, love!  This little speaker has quality sound and the battery just keeps going.  I would highly recommend.
 Quality sound, sturdy design &amp; very good batter life. Great Bluetooth sound device. Know that the higher you increase sound, faster battery will drain. Very impressed &amp; satisfied.
 Purchased this on amazon day.  I Loved the size and style.<br/>Unfortunately, It only worked for the 1st use.  It won’t charge even though I’ve Tried multiple chargers and cables.
 Bought this is listen to poolside &amp; in bathroom getting ready each day. I wanted something louder than my phone. This is GREAT! Definitely highly recommend. &amp; you can't beat the price!
 I haven’t had a single issue with this unit. Great for a cheap speaker. It has been under water twice in my kayak flipped upside down kept playing under water. Never missed a beat. It’s been going strong for 2 years. About to buy another for my house at the rig
 So good so far. I really love it!
 Sometimes when I'm on a call, the audio gets really garbled and I have to turn it off/on to get rid of it.  It's mostly fine for conference calls
 anker SoundCore Bluetooth speaker arrived ontime.  Connected speaker using 3.5mm aux cable to Win10 Dell Inspiron sound output after  charging for one hour. Turned the Anker on then played music and it worked.  Decent sound too.  will setup wireless  later.  would recommend it.
 I'm happy with this speaker. Just bought it recently. The loudest it can go is quite loud. I'm hard of hearing so my hearing isn't as good as normal people and even I have turn it down. It's amazing! Love it. 5 stars. Just one problem: that light is not right in the center so it irks my OCD. XD
 Very good sound from a small, inexpensive speaker.
 Sound is awesome, but that constant static/humming/buzzing sound  in the background is annoying (during playing a song/nothing being played)!<br/><br/>Bluetooth is still trying to connect with it :/<br/><br/>Haven't been able to connect to Bluetooth, so don't know how it'd sounds. Aux-In connection is too damn tight!
 I got this speaker for my dad for his job.  He says he likes it, but that he wishes the sound was a bit better.  Overall, its a good speaker for the price!
 I was quite impressed I've had this speaker for about a year now no problems and I'm not sure about yours but mine will play about 36 hours before I need to recharge
 Great sound, compact size for easy travel. connects easily. i am very please with this speaker.
 Awesome product. Great sound. Great price.
 That stupidly loud high pitch noise that goes off everytime you go on max volume is a terrible idea and is very annoying. I know it's an easy fix, but putting a loud high end noise as your peak volume indicator is a dumb idea<br/><br/>The speaker itself is great tho, just that beep is way too obnoxious
 Great little speaker at a phenomenal price. I have only charged it once, and it has been working for weeks. Very impressed with the battery life and sounds quality. I use it in my kitchen when I am cooking and love it.
 Always connects and stays connected.  Sounds great for the size and better than a more expensive speaker it replaces.
 Great speaker and price!
 This is a gem of a speaker.  It's a beautiful little design.  I had an issue with the bluetooth, but called the company, they answered the phone, and assisted me with the issue.  It is that kind of company that supports it's products that I much prefer doing business with.
 Man for the price this speaker packs a punch.  Great sound long lasting very portable.  It’s fantaz in the bathroom or on the deck or the desk.
 I have 3 Bluetooth speakers. I needed something small for a bedroom and this speaker is so much better than I expected! It provides rich full sound and can handle being cranked up without distortion. I love it.
 The best Speaker I've EVER had, it's amazing the charge lasts forever and the sound quality is amazing, I'm in love with this speaker it sounds like surround sound WITH how loud it can get with static or crackling, I luvvvvvv it it's the BEST speaker EVER
 The two most important features of this product are 1) Excellent sound quality- it sounds quite uniform over the entire frequency range, both the bass and the treble are quite well balanced 2) Remarkable range- it works anywhere in a decent sized house with the speaker kept in the living room and the source kept anywhere.
 Stopped working after 1.5 months
 This is a great bluetooth speaker. This is the second Anker we have bought.
 Battery lasts a while.  The sound quality is far better than phone/laptop speakers, but isn't groundbreaking.  I bought it mainly to use at work when I wanted to have some music on in the background.  It looks pretty sleek too.
 Been holding off on buying a Bluetooth speaker for a long time... I didn't want to pay 100 bucks to get something that didn't sound like a tin can ... This was on a good deal with great reviews so I bought it... Great sound no distortion at Max volume plenty loud for it's compact size... Very happy I made this purchase
 Good little unit, purchased for a family member.  I have jbl flip that I love, but would have been happy with this also.  Decent Sound, easy Pair.
 Incredible speaker for the price. I bring it everywhere with me. Looks great in blue, too.
 Buy this! It works well has a long lasting battery and is extremely convenient!  Love it!
 Great speaker! Happy with it
 By far the best small Bluetooth speaker I've ever owned. Has big big sound in a small package. Even at max volume, the sound is just as clear as when it's in a softer volume. Bluetooth connection is awesome. Once in a while I will hear a stutter, but I'm pretty sure this is my phone's fault. Very happy with Anker!
 Exactly what I was looking for.
 Had for a couple years now. Love this thing.
 This is a really awesome portable speaker. Easy to use, loud and clear. On blast I can hear this speaker from two floors above. No distortion whatsoever. Battery life- incredible. Perfect for the shower-people who like to listen to music in there. Perfect for anyone who needs some more sound.
 It serves the purpose of a decent quality speaker better than my laptop and my phone and the battery lasts longer as well. The Bluetooth range seems to be pretty good as well. I only noticed a minor issue where I had to press and hold the power button little hard to switch on the speaker.<br/><br/>Overall pretty satisfied and would recommend to others.
 Great little speaker, very impressive output
 Have two of these! First one has worked flawlessly, second one lost audio after the first few minutes use. Got into contact with Anker and they sent me a new one free of charge. Awesome and trustworthy company, and I’ve never had an issue with any other of their products (all my charging cables and my portable battery) I love this speaker!
 It's a cute little thing. Nestles right in among all the other "black boxes" in the entertainment rack. Functions admirably as the "voice of Alexa", most especially by being "always on". Sound quality is quite adequate.
 Sound quality is clear and crisp for its size. Critically, I give it a 7/10 or 8/10 audio quality overall. SoundCore 2 sounds better, but has a shorter battery life.
 Pairs easily with both my and my husbands Macbooks, and our iPhones. Easy to switch pairing and easy to charge.<br/><br/>Great sound.
 I couldn’t be happier with this. The sound is great gets loud for the size and I’ve literally listen a few hours a day for a week now and the battery level is still showing full from the first charge!!
 Great size and great sound. I found the control buttons awkward a not easy to use, but definitely worth the money.
 This speaker is great. The Bluetooth reception works really well and the speaker itself puts out a good sound. I haven't noticed any bass distortion and it doesn't vibrate around when it's turned all the way up like some other speakers.
 For the price this speaker is absolutely amazing, clear, loud and VERY surprising. Lacking slightly in bass however fornwhat you pay this speaker is absolutely fantastic and outshines my UI mini by a long shot ($80 paid for that one and doesn't even sound as good!). I use this speaker to pair with my Echo Dot and it's absolutely amazing. Highly suggest this and will definitely be buying more Anker products in the future.
 Speaker seems to work fine and the sound quality is nice for a small speaker but it’s not new. Speaker wasn’t wrapped and didn’t include any instructions. I have no problem buying used stuff but I don’t expect to pay new prices.
 This thing is just so solid. The battery lasts forever and has solid sound. You have to keep your phone relatively close to it but it's really a non issue. Probably the best thing I've ever purchased on Amazon for it's price. Definitely recommend
 Great sound. Good battery life. Little pricey-
 Not as loud and crisp as $100-200 portable Bluetooths, but it is definitely leading the pact within its budget range. Pretty spectacular sound quality given its price.
 Sound quality is great for the price paid.  Never owned a Bose or any of the other expensive brands so I have nothing to compare it against.  Bass isn't heavy enough but still good for this device.  Would recommend.
 Enjoy the speaker, but thought I had changed from red which was originally marked to black, but received the red.  Since the outside casing has nothing to do with sound only the looks, I kept it.
 Great speaker, spectacular company! My son loves this speaker. He uses it all day, all night. It connects to his phone and Alexa easily, sounds great, and is very convenient. However, the charging port got loose and a wire broke inside (very likely user error and frequent use.) I called just see if we could get it fixed and they are sending out a new speaker, no questions asked. Wonderful costumer service from a terrific company. I will definitely purchase this brand again! Thank you, Anker!!
 Love this little speaker super easy to use and set up.... Sounds good
 I really enjoy this speaker because of the battery life. As soon as I saw "24 hour" battery life I knew I had to have it. It's super portable. I keep it in my backpack in the side pocket where water bottles typically go and carry it around to listen to music. I love Anker products. The only reason I give this product 4 stars is because it isn't extremely loud. However, it's plenty loud enough to be used while swiming with a couple friends or whil listening to music / talk radio while cleaning the house. Good buy.
 Came the next day after ordering and was exactly as described. I use it for car use and can hear it pretty good on the lowest volume. I only wish that it had a previous/next button so I can go back or skip a song but other than that it's worth the 20 bucks.
 It’s a great speaker for the price. Has a great sound and is easy to use. The only thing I wish is that it was louder. I like my music loud and it just doesn’t put out the sound. That’s why it got 4 stars
 I honestly didn't think that this would produce so much sound and it actually sound good, but it did and it sounded AMAZING!!! Definitely a great purchase.
 Simple little speaker works well for listening to music and for making conference calls. Simple. Easy to use. Exactly why I love Anker products.
 Got it cheap because it's a cheap speaker. Decent sound for a bathroom or small room
 This battery lasts FOREVER. Is it loud...its loud enough. Are you going to annoy the neighbors with it? Nope, but you can bike with it, bring it to the beach, shower, around the house, your bedroom, basement, pregaming. Not loud enough for tailgates.
 It kind of has a fading but I just barely got it brand new. Its better than all the speakers I bought in the past. The Bass is better and its perfect
 This speaker maybe small but it packs a punch. I was impressed with the amount of bass I could actually hear. The speaker is meant for small venues/rooms. Love the smooth mate finish on the speaker.
 Man love this speaker structure has a little weight to it and it's very loud sound quality seems great at this time I definitely love this product thank you
 I can't say how this will hold up over time but for $29.99 I don't care!  I bought this to replace a nearly $200 speaker and if I need to replace it every year, it will have still saved me money for the amount of time I've owned and now had to replace the more expensive brand.
 I love this speaker it feels really soft and durable very sleek the quality of the sound is amazing so clear even at a high level perfet fod anyone who wants a good quality speaker i will definitely order another one and tell others about it
 Nice, easy grip surface and shape.  Long lived battery charge.  Range not as much as described, closer to 15 feet with my pad and android phone.  Nice sound range.  Probably not for broadcasting in larger spaces.  Its all i need tho, to place nearby when reading, cooking, or working on projects.  This is my first bluetooth speaker but i have seen several others with higher prices and lower quality.  I consider this a lucky buy.
 Powerful sound. solid buy. I'm happy with my purchase. i would recommend it.
 This speaker can play louder than what you expect from its small size. It is easy to charge it up and pair with the phone. The red color looks quite nice too.
 For the money. It can't be beat. Love it
 Works as advertised and meets expectations. We'll balanced presentation. Not tipped up toward top end as might be expected. A good product. Battery life seems good. Have used on two road trips. Quite pleased. Recommended.
 Sound great and reasonable priced. Love it
 The battery life really blows all other portable speakers away.  Sound quality is good, nothing spectacular.  I have headphones for when I want excellent sound.
 My husband love it will purchase again
 Tested with tablet, not bad. Will see this summer when I use it on the patio.<br/>Smaller than I expected
 Great little speaker which can't be beat for the price.  Use it with my Amazon Dot and haven't looked back since.  Highly recommended.
 This was a gift for my grandson and it was a hit.  I cannot provide detailed information about it operation but he has not complained so I believe that he is happy with the gift.
 Great sound. Battery lasts for a very long time. Use it in our gym for about an hour a day and holds a charge for almost 30 days.
 Sounds good for its size. Battery seems to last a long time.
 This never dies, period.  It connects quickly and warns you with a blinking light and low beeps when low on battery.  Which is almost never. The sound quality is great. For the size and price I couldn't ask for anything else from a speaker.
 Love this little speaker!  excellent range from sending device, plenty loud enough for house or barn or truck.  Excllent battery life.
 I loved it so much but not nearly a year the volume become so low
 great lil speaker,with awesome battery life! Only reason I gave 4stars instead of 5 is, i wish it was louder.
 This speaker is amazing. I use it 1 or 2 hours a day during the week and 6 to 8 hours on the weekends and I've only charged it one time (today, December 31st) since receiving it November 10th. Sounds great too! Could not be happier with this little Bluetooth speaker! Another great product from Anker!
 Great for music off IPhone.
 I bought this based on reviews.  Unfortunately the battery only lasts 2 hours, if that.  It is also not as loud as I expected.  It's ok for what I need it for, but for parties, I would invest in a better speaker.
 Very good, but, we wanted it more for phone calling/phone conversations... BIG BASE... Better for Music...
 Great little portable Bluetooth speaker. Sounds great for its size and price point, much much better than my phone of tablet and the battery life is very good as well. Makes a perfect traveling companion!
 Excellent battery life and easy to use.  I bought this for my husband for a Christmas gift and wish I had bought two of them (when they were on sale) so I could have one for myself.
 Love it great volume
 I have gone through a ton of crappy bluetooth speakers and you get what you pay for, and I'm finally very happy with this one.
 No complaints about sound quality, as of yet.Charger port became DEFECTIVE after 5 weeks. No matter what charger cable I use, they all slide out. All the cables work fine with the other products I own. Have to keep reinserting the charger cable. It has reached the point where I have to hold the cable to the portal in order to get any charge, which is ridiculous! I should  have read some of the other reviews. This problem appears to be chronic, and quality control renains poor at Anker for this issue. I originally was looking to purchase more of these speakers as gifts, but would never do so now. Simply put...If I can't charge it, it doesn't work. Not recommended if you are like me, and intensely dislike returning defective items.
 Good enough sound, easy setup, compact. The only problem - it does not show how much juice is left in the battery.
 Worked well initially but then stopped working properly after 35 days. The sound started to break and now it just sounds nasty. Sadly I am not getting the option to return the item as well because of the 30 day return policy. Would love to know if there is way to return this product.
 Great product; superb sound quality and helpful customer support. good battery🔊📲🎸🎹
 Sound is fine.  But the connection between the outlet and the charging cord is loose so it comes undone sometimes.  Which is annoying.
 I love this little speaker, it's easy to set up the Bluetooth and even though it's small, the sound is very good.
 Small, light weight, and awesome sound quality. Bought this for use in my classroom and has worked better than expected. Can set it up anywhere in the room and it is loud and clear enough for all students to hear. It is also very easy to lock away when I am not in my room, or take to another classroom when needed. I have definitely become a fan of Anker's products and have recommended this product to other teachers in my building.
 Works great with surprisingly good distance.  Good sound for the price and easy set up
 At the MSRP of $80, it's still a good deal. At sale price of $42.99 or less, it's a no brainer. Get this for the weird places you spend your day that may not have an installed sound system. Bathroom, workroom, kitchen, closet. This goes everywhere you want to go.
 I had high hopes for this speaker and it lived up to those expectations the first 3 uses.  The unit would not charge / hold a charge after the first few days of use.  Tried different combinations of cables and power adapter to no avail.  Going to return and find another brand bluetooth speaker.
 Small, great sound. Definitely missing bass depth, but what can you expect for this price range. Used it on the beach during last trip. No issues or complaints. A worthwhile investment.
 Good loud speaker but has trouble turning on and off. Very tedious and frustrating
 Sounds like a surrounding stereo....dont like the outside finish, and the function buttons are hardly vissible
 Great sound for a small speaker. Good bluetooth range. It does everything it is advertise to do and more. I would purchase again.
 I have always been a jbl and creative fan. I tried Anker because I could not find what I wanted. Best choice I made this year. For a small speaker with big sound this is what you want. Clear,good volume, and i can bluetooth it from down stairs. For what it is  im happy and Impressed.
 Great sound especially for the  price. The battery life is awesome. Only complaint is It would be nice if it had built in USB charging port for phone.  But that's not held against it.
 My speaker arrived promptly and  in good order.  Great sound!!!  I love it!
 Super great value! Very loud! Awesome sound quality!!! Best part, the battery lasts a really long time.  WAAAAY better than the Jawbone equivalent!!
 Great sound and quality for an awesome price
 I have had this speaker since June of 2017. It is now April of 2018 and I think it is on its 3rd charge. I use it almost every day for maybe 15 to 30 minutes. It is perfect for localized tasks like making dinner or shaving. I don't know about a party, but it's perfect for a small quiet gathering. The sound is really good and I have no complaints. Way to go Anker!
 Nice speaker with rubberized exterior which is a nice non slip feature.  Plenty loud enough for my taste.
 The SoundCore is not a top-tier speaker, but it isn't intended to be. For the price you pay and the small, portable size, the quality delivered is excellent, with a loud enough max volume to fill up a room and then some. I'm quite happy with my purchase—which, I must admit, I at least partially owe to the fact that I was sent two speakers for the price of one—and would recommend it to anyone looking for a portable Bluetooth speaker on a budget.
 Good speaker. Missing charging cable though. The package says it's supposed to come with a micro USB charging cable (not the plug, just the cable). I tore the packaging apart and there was no cable. I have a ton of them lying around so I only took one star but it would be nice to get everything that you pay for.
 Looks nice.  Didn't need to read instructions, it linked right up.  Nice sound, big range, long battery life.  My purpose: listen to podcasts while cleaning the kitchen and doing other chores.  For this, it completely satisfies.
 I am truly impressed by Anker products. Well made and high performance - highly recommended!
 Sounds good and clean, gets pretty loud. Only thing is that the bass isn't very good. If you're looking for more bass, try getting the version 2 of this product. It's water resistant and sounds better too.
 Great, lightweight bluetooth speaker. Easy to operate, good sound, and easy to pack. Battery life is fantastic. Bought this on a whim before a 1 wk trip to Hawaii and it came with us everywhere. Excellent for music in our hotel room, on the beach, or in the car (not much good radio.) Bass isn't great, but it's a small speaker so wasn't expecting that. Other sounds are clear and crisp.
 Can't review it high enough! Sound is nothing to be proud of but it's not bad. Battery life is amazing!!!! No really, battery life rocks!!!
 I use this speaker for everything. AMAZING. great bass and volume max. Love it. easy portable and LONG charge life.
 I never write reviews but since I was so pleased with this purchase I felt it warrants it. This is a great product! I was tired of listening to music on my phone and wanted something that would transport well either in another room or taking with me. Not only is this product nicely designed it is light, easy to carry &amp; very easy to use. Not to mention the sound is amazing! My only regret is not purchasing more as Christmas gifts while they were on sale! This is a must purchase.
 fantastic Bluetooth speaker. good range, I don't lose sound at about 20 feet. it's loud enough to drive and listen to in a car with windows down at 70+ MPH
 It doesn't have over powering sound, but I guess it's ol for being a compact bluetooth speaker.
 Purchased on a whim. Everyone i show is impressed with the sound quality, and how loud this gets. Is it the the best speaker out there? no, BUT It is fantastic for the price. The Battery life on this speaker is amazing. i regularly forget to charge this, and when i come back it has plenty of battery life.
 This speaker was very easy to operate and the sound quality was better than I expected.  Great price and the small size makes it easy to transport.
 Would give it more stars if I could! The bass is clear, the sound is pretty loud and the thing lasts forever without being charged. Listening an hour a day for a month, it still doesn't need to be charged! Seriously!! Liked it so much it bought one for work. For the price, you can't beat it!
 Good value, decent sound but very little base. Does the job when you need some tunes and don't want to spend much.
 I love this speaker. So easy to use. Sound is great and battery life is amazing.
 good stuff, pretty decent battery life. sounds great for price.
 Long battery life
 The Anker SoundCore Bluetooth speaker is everything I hoped it would be. The sound quality does not compete with speakers costing much more, but for the price, it is great for my use.  I use it when I travel, when kayaking and even in the car sometimes since I don't have a bluetooth receiver in the car.
 My wife appreciates the flexibility of moving the lightweight "brick' from room to room.
 Nice clear crisp sound for a inexpensive speaker wish it was just a little louder.
 Sound quality is not nearly as good as the reviews make it look.<br/>Having bought multiple portable speakers, I would recommend the smaller, metal Xiaomi product.
 The speaker works great with my amazon dot and sounds awesome. It is perfect for what I needed. I love this speaker and the customer service from the company. There was a slight issue with the first one I received and they immediately took care of things. Probably the best customer support response I have ever received.
 I brought a second one for a friend. It has great sound and easy to move around from room to room when needed.
 I've only used the unit several days.  So far it's a very good in sound quality and battery life.  I would recommend this speaker to anyone for use in a small space.
 The sound is loud and fantastic.  I pair it with my Ipad.  I take it to my kitchen while cleaning/cooking.  Great quality sound.  Happy that i decided to get a better quality one.  You wont regret
 Small, easy to figure out, sound quality has been amazing so far. I think it would be great if the charger has its own socket though? But this is what I’ve been looking for.
 Very nice compact unit with solid construction and deep richer sound than my laptop speakers. The unit is completely an uniform subtle red color with a metal grill and a silicone feeling type enclosure, yet doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. Unit has micro USB for power, 3.5mm audio input jack, microphone pin hole and power LED on side. Top controls for bluetooth sync, volume up/down, power on/off, skip track and play. Also the packaging is very simple and elegant which matches the actual product build. Some operation notes, is that it will install two bluetooth devices, namely Anker SoundCore Stereo and Hands-free. The latter is used with messaging apps like Skype that uses microphone and speakers.  The stereo device is used for music. May need to manually switch devices though as it can't auto detect music vs messaging. Lastly the skip and play function works with media files like WMV in an album you're paying, but it doesn't with music streaming (i.e Amazon music). The volume control on the device works with streaming or playing straight music file, but it won't raise it past the max. being received and makes a loud beep if you keep pressing the + increase button. Raising the max. volume is via your device. Lastly, if your PC/laptop sleeps or is turned off, you'll need to power on the device, because it won't auto connect.
 Awesome speaker. Sounds and works great!
 The Anker Soundcore A3102011 is a great choice! Excellent sound quality for such a small Bluetooth speaker; better than another more expensive one I had purchased in the past. It doesn't bounce around with the volume up and is pleasing to the eye. It also paired seamlessly with my Echo dot. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
 Nice little speaker. My only complaint is that it cuts out sometimes or gets crackly even when your music player is within 5-10 feet of the speaker. The sound is good though and it's a nice size.
 I gave it four stars because there can always be something added to most products to make it better. I love my speaker it is very durable. Battery life is long lasting and barely needs to charge although I do my use it often. Connects through Bluetooth well and volume is decent. Hate that I bought it for $32 in July 2017 (but yet it's worth it) now that I see it on sale now in December for about $23
 This thing is awesome. Got it for my college dorm room and its super loud for how small it is. My roommate has a JBL one that cost over $100 and honestly I think mine is better. It plays well, has good bass and the battery lasts a really long time.
 Great small speaker. Good sound quality and good for a medium small room. I use it in conjuction with teaching my voice students and it works very well.
 My wife got this for me to use in my home gym and office. The charge last for days and the sound is awesome!! I listen to a lot of music with deep bass and there is no distortion at all!
 Specs. looked good but hands on experience is disappointing. Quality of construction is good. Sound quality, consistency of bluetooth pairing and range is lacking. Expected more from the brand and for the price.
 For the price. Don’t think just buy it. You will not be sorry
 Couldn't be more impressed.  Great speaker (especially for under $40).  It sits on top of the fridge in the kitchen and is paired it with my Echo Dot.  I imagine it will also be a nice speaker for around the fire pit this summer.
 Great speaker. I use this at work in a clean room and the battery life is great.
 Speaker was bought in Feb, but got as a Mother's Day gift. Used in car, until power died. Once I tried to charge, it did not work. Noticed that the power port was damaged. I can only assume that this speaker was used. Will be contacting Anker over this issue. Since it is over 30 days bought not sure the outcome. After buying numerous Anker products I am hoping it won't be an issue. Will update rating depending on the outcome.<br/>UPDATE:<br/>Anker replaced the speaker. Customer service was quick to respond. The speaker does work well, but I am very careful with the plug port because I can tell that it would break easily. Hopefully, the newer models are built better.
 works good, sometimes loses connection with Alexa but it may be the Alexa not the speaker
 This thing is legit.<br/><br/>Loudest bluetooth speaker I've owned and great battery. Very hefty and well-made.<br/><br/>Anker typically makes good stuff and this is no exception.
 Pretty good sound for the money. I've heard better base in higher priced speakers but overall this one sounds good.
 It’s a great speaker for the price, great sound and battery life.
 Great little blutooth Speaker, surprisingly loud and battery last a long time, works great with out Amazon echo
 Love Anker products!  A fraction of the cost, but quality is superior!  Will not buy anything but Anker going forward!
 This product is a home run !!  It’s the real deal<br/>Have bought two more for friends
 Perfect speaker ..battery last forever on a single charge ..sound quality is perfect for small space. Highly recommended this brand and model.
 Loud for the size, clear, minimal distortion, looks pretty. My only downfall was not spending the extra money to get the second version, the Soundcore 2.
 This is a great little speaker. You will be surprised!  Perfect size and sound.
 Produces a good sound for the size and price.  I've been wanting a bluetooth speaker to listen to music and watch videos on my ipad or iphone for a while.  Of course I wanted the megaboom that cost 5 times what I paid for this little speaker.  That being said I needed one ASAP for a school project and decided to get this one after reading the reviews.  I was pleasantly suprised of the loundness and quality it gives.  It works great for phone calls and the music and videos.  I also like how you don't have to pair it with a code when using it with an IOS device.  It is rugged and simple to operate with the buttons.  The design itself is pretty neat as well. I like the robust red, makes it easy to find and stands out.
 The mic does not work at all. I connected it to an iphone 7 and tried using to talk via the built-in mic. All you hear on the other end is static sound.
 Great speaker and sounds and looks great. You can’t beat this and it’s price is crazy cheap for the quality
 Quality sound for the price. It's not as good as say a jbl3 but it's also only about a third of the price and the audio quality is definitely up there. As some other people have also said the bass is nothing amazing but it gets the job done. Would recommend to someone who needs a speaker but doesn't feel like buying a $100 speaker
 Battery lasts me several days, audio quality isn't the best but is good for the price.
 sounds great, pairs easily with iphone
 This lasts a long time &amp; I don't have to charge it often.  If you wants something really loud don't buy this. The volume is perfect in not bothering the neighbors when I am outside.
 I like this little speaker!  It's very portable given the size.  The quality of sound is great and it pumps out some volume.  I have yet to have to charge it yet from the charge it had in the box.
 Really loud , good quality!
 Sounds great!
 Fantastic device that has served me well for 11 months. Now all of the sudden it won't charge anymore. Unacceptable.<br/><br/>*update* Fantastic customer service. I was given a new speaker within a few days of contacting customer support. It's a stellar product I hope this keeps holding a charge.
 Great speakers for the price.  I use them just about every day.  They hold a charge well and sound incredible.
 Update 9/1417: speaker still works perfectly, would highly recommend<br/><br/>Update: 7/22/17, anker has since contacted me about the issue and has replaced my speaker. They're costumer service is extremely good. The new speaker so far has been working beautifully and I'll post another update after a month.<br/><br/>Worked great for like a month but now it has trouble connecting through Bluetooth. Was a nice speaker when it worked though
 Great speaker sound is great, I drive a concrete mixer which is very loud at times and I am still able to hear music loud and sounds clear.
 This is really gr8 product.  One feature is particularly nice...it acts as a microphone when calls come in if paired to a smartphone...the quality of the sound is exceptionally good whether listening to music (i.e. Pandora) or when in 'speaker phone' mode. (switching is totally automatic)  I highly recommend this product...a gr8 product at a very reasonable price.
 As a speaker, it works extremely well. The sound quality is excellent, as promised, and the battery lasts for an extremely long time, which is quite convenient. The only problem I've come across is that twice so far, it's suddenly lost its connection with my phone and been unable to reconnect. The first time it was solved with a soft reset (of my phone), but I haven't yet managed to reconnect it a second time. Still, it's a good enough speaker that I'd rather keep trying than go looking for a new one.
 I've had this for almost a year and I've charged it maybe 2 times. Bought a second as a gift for my dad and he loves it too.<br/>Bass is a bit weak but nothing I care about on the beach and where ever I take it
 Seems like a pretty either  nice Bluetooth speaker. I am not much of a technophobe but figured it out and the sound is remarkable. I'd recommend it for the price. My neighbor has a Bose for  hundred dollars and this seems just as nice for less than half the price and the 24 hour battery is a plus
 I was surprised at how full and balanced the sound was. Instructions straightforward. Played it for many hours after the first charge. What a great speaker. Couldn't be happier.
 Omg ..This is one awesome speaker..I use it constantly..great battery life too!!
 Love this speaker.  The sound is awesome, better than I hoped for. Perfect for my cozy house. A real bargain.
 Good connection with phone.
 Amazing purchase. Great quality, amazing sound &amp; long battery length. It has been perfect for a week long Caribbean getaway.
 This little speaker has unreal battery life and great sound for such a small package. I use it paired with my phone in my car as a cheap and janky sound system. It is loud enough to listen to podcasts on long drives and works well at home too.
 Was looking for a way to have music in a friend's classic car without removing the original radio.  Was able to place the speaker on the back seat while riding and connect to my cellphone with BlueTooth.  Works great.
 This little speaker sounds great! I didn't want anything too big but I wanted big sound.<br/><br/>Only complain about it is that the usb  power jack doesn't really fit average cables and is a little difficult to charge.
 Bluetooth Range is T. E. R. R. I. B. L. E. I can get about 6ft away until it starts cutting out. Such a shame seeing I love Anker. Great sound, but less then average range.
 I've owned this speaker for 4 months and recently the Bluetooth connection stopped working. Tried multiple devices and it is definitely this speaker that is the issue. Up until this, thr speaker had worked well and it was a good option for the price. The other complaint I have with this are the buttons - it's virtually impossible to read done they did not color the symbols on them.
 Love this spaker  so clear  the bass is just right, plan the I plan on getting the song called 2 love that 24-hour battery life that's what I like
 I love the battery life. I charged it for the first time in a month and i didn't really even need to. Also, I love how it turns off after 10 minutes if nothing is connected to its bluetooth.
 This is a great little speaker with a surprisingly loud volume. I work in a factory &amp; this is perfect. I've also only had to charge it a few times since buying. Definitely worth it.
 Item was ok until the 5th month and now has stopped connecting to my I phone for playback. Short life spans seems  to be a pattern for Bluetooth connection devices.
 Great sound and such a low price. I use it while I'm getting ready to go out or to work and the charge lasts a really long time. I would definitely recommend this.
 Best little speaker out there! Bought a second one as a gift because mine has been through it all and is still kicking after 3 years!
 Charges pretty quickly, lasts really long on a charge, has great sound quality at high volume, and is user friendly! Love it.
 The battery life is outstanding on this thing! I knew the sound would be good simply because of the brand but man, the battery life is just incredible. Awesome little bluetooth here!
 This little speaker works so well! It has great sound, the battery lasts well, and it is small and portable. Can't believe how good it is for the price.
 This speaker is so awesome and the quality is amazing. It connects right to your phone through Bluetooth and the music can get really loud!! Sounds great plus awesome to travel with and perfect size. Highly recommend
 great, great price for what you get. purchased on prime sale. honestly couldn't tell the difference between this speaker and higher end one that my lil one got for xmas that cost at least 5 times as much.
 I would accepted a 12 hour battery life for more bass. My now MIA ue mini boom was a better sound performer then the soundcore in my opinion.<br/><br/>Three stars because it does feel solid, volume is decent for size and battery life is a plus.
 Great value. You may find a slightly better sound in Bose, but you will pay a premium. If you want great sound, at a reasonable price, buy the Anker Soundcore Portable Bluetooth Speaker.
 Sounds decent for the price, long battery life; nothing more you could ask for for a speaker at this price range
 I LOVE the Anker products. This one is perfect for doing the dishes, takeing a shower, or even jamming out in the car. The sound travels and is impeccable, especially for the size.
 Has decent sound and holds a charge for a long time.  The charger port broke on the first one I got.  I contacted Anker and they sent me a brand new one.  Excellent customer service on their part.
 This unit is built well, and sounds very good with the acoustic and jazz recordings we enjoy. Plays well as our speaker when watching movies via Prime through our mac mini (our main reason for looking for a speaker, since the mini only has a very small reference speaker). It is attractive and solid with a confident weight, which makes it sit well and feel quality-built. There is nothing plastic about the exterior. The battery life is also amazing! We powered it up about four weeks ago and then promptly lost the power cable and it just keeps playing. The company includes a 1/8" cable to play sound directly from a device, which is what we primarily use it for (although this unit is clearly portable, ours primarily sits next to our mac mini). So, the included audio cable is usually connected to our mac.<br/><br/>For people using bluetooth only for music, the frontside blue light is like any other: it indicates search (blinking) and connected (solid) when powered on. A minor issue for us, which we've adjusted to, is when we play movies through the mac using the cable, the blue light kept blinking (it's a bluetooth device, of course, so it's doing what it is supposed to do). That created a distraction. Our solution was to cover the light, which works, but distracts from the design during daylight ours. We have since found another work around to keep the blue light steady: we pair the device with one of our iphones for music or podcast playback via bluetooth. When watching movies, we still override the input with the provided audio cable, but the BT connection also remains with the iphone (which is not providing sound output). The resolves the blinking blue light issue which was distracting when watching movies. (Another minor thing about bluetooth, which we have noticed, is that lip syncing during movie playback is delayed by a fraction of a second. I edit audio and am prone to notice this minor detail.) The direct cable link syncs everything fine. Of course, when streaming audio only, there is no noticeable delay.<br/><br/>Our recommendation to Anker engineering is to develop a method to "pause" the blinking blue light when the audio cable is plugged into the speaker.<br/><br/>Otherwise, Anker is a terrific company to do business with as they have excellent customer service and quality products.<br/><br/>This is our fourth different Anker product: the others are portable power chargers for our iphones that fit in our pockets:  https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Technology-Certified-Lightning/dp/B00M8YXV1Q/ref=dp_ob_title_wld<br/><br/>And, an external USB-3 2.5" drive enclosure, which we are using to power up our 2014 mac mini via an SSD 6G drive:<br/>https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Drive-External-Enclosure-9-5mm/dp/B00H98AXOE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486566119&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=anker+2.5%22+external+usb+3
 Looks great. Sounds Good.<br/>Nice little portable thing.<br/><br/>Only con is that I find sound output little low even on full volume.<br/>Its good enuf for a room.<br/>I wonder how it will be outside when there is other environmental noises too.
 I liked the size and portability, wouldn’t mind it being bigger, its smaller than you think. Its fairly loud for its size but I could have done with it being louder. That being said, I guess you get what you paid for in terms of sound. Battery is great though.
 Very easy to set up. Small and compact, so it's easy to carry around. Bass response s somewhat lacking, but for the price (24.99 super special} and size, I can't really complain. Battery life s very good at moderate volume.
 Sounds great &amp; the extended Bluetooth range is a definite plus. It's pretty loud too....not 'spring break party' loud but more like 'beer &amp; BBQ by the pool' loud.
 I purchased this Anker Sound Core Bluetooth Speaker for my 12 year old grandson.  He had no trouble immediately connecting it to his device and we were quite impressed with the sound quality!  I also purchased the companion case and the speaker fit in it nicely.  The order was fulfilled very timely and I felt the speaker was an exceptional value for a reasonable price.
 Bought this on sale and wasn't expecting it to be as amazing as it is. The sound is great, the volume is great and the battery life is amazing!!!
 Hey now, this is a good sounding speaker for the best. I had a JBL FLIP 2 which sound really good but the battery life was short,top about 4 hours. This Anker really gets up to 24 hrs of play, about 20 to 22 at high volume which is really good. So amazing the high and mid range are great. Play on my PC the voices are real clear, the only thing is it does not have the bass as the JBL but for 40 it great, every body i play it 4 love the sound and battery of this speaker. I'm know looking into buying the more expensive Anker mobile with more bass and a good battery life. But 4 the price and sound quality this is a GREAT SPEAKER.
 The quality is really great, the 1st time I purchased it started turning on and off randomly and it keeps doing it ever since. I contacted support and they immidiately issued a refund and sent me a new one. Amazing customer service and great product!
 This is the 3rd Bluetooth speaker I've purchased. I wasted my $ buying the other 2. This speaker has FANTASTIC sound quality, the battery life is beyond my expectations &amp; it connects to my computer flawlessly every time (my other 2 purchase were CRAP!).<br/><br/>Best bang for my Bluetooth buck. I 100% endorse this product.
 Great little speaker with a long battery life after charge.  Portable and has a 66-foot circle from source.  I use it as a speaker with my phone and computer.  I have hook it up to my Amazon Echo to allow the speaker to be in the kitchen or bedroom.  Recommend it.
 I LOVE THIS SPEAKER!  Battery lasts forever.  Sound is loud and clear.  You can’t beat it for the price.  I wish the usb charging port did a better job locking in a usb cable, they have a tendency to fall out, but that is a minor gripe.  Buy this speaker!
 Got this because of the great reviews. Yes they were correct, great small speaker. Nice volume and had it at least 50' from my phone and no connection problems. Had it at a sale and everyone was asking about it and how great it was.
 My son ordered this to take to college. Small enough to sit on desk without taking up too much space and can be tossed in backpack for music on the go. Sound quality was great for a portable speaker.
 The battery life is no joke. And the sound is BOOMING. This speaker is hands down one of the best speakers I've ever seen. Yes it's that good. Just buy one. Please.
 I love it!
 Good sound
 Anker has quietly become one of my favorite companies. They constantly produce high quality, reliable, and affordable products. This SoundCore was no exception. Amazing base, lightweight, terrific sound, perfect price.
 Compact enough for travel and good battery life.
 I'm highly satisfied with it. As with most speakers like this, it doesn't have much bass but it has enough to avoid sounding too trebble-ish. Very loud.
 Best speaker I ever bought for 35$.the material of the speaker feels nice when it's held. the sound is great it's loud for a portable speaker it's also does not get the stupid vibrating noise when you set on table loud as possible which is great. Overall sound 9 ,materials and hardware 10, only problem is that it's get super dirty easily from your fingers or dirt or grease something to keep in mind.
 I have bought and burned out many of similar speakers. But not this one by far one of the best just got a 2nd. One!
 Very pleased with this unit, good sound quality with impressive bass for its size. Battery life is as advertised (surprisingly) though range comes up short for me. All around good deal.
 Great sound from relatively small speaker. Pairing wad easy enough to do as well.
 For the price, this is an excellent portable bluetooth speaker.  Sound is crystal clear and perfect for my office.  I only wish the bass was a bit stronger.  Overall, a nice speaker at a great price.
 Great little portable speaker with good sound quality.  I love that you can charge it and take it anywhere.
 Very sturdy and sounds fantastic with a battery that lasts a whole day of playing.
 Great little speaker for a cheap price. I use it on my boat with my I phone and don't have to worry about it. Seems well constructed and has a great battery life. Sound quality is good especially at this price (Daily Deal at Amazon).
 Highly recommend if you are looking for a nice portable compact Bluetooth speaker. Battery life is great, pretty durable (don't recommend testing that too much though), nice sound. Speaker had everything I was looking for.
 This little speaker system is amazing. The sound it generates is very clear and has a nice bass response.
 The sound is decent but falls a lot flatter than the photive speaker I have.  I bought this to have another speaker but I should have bought another photive which is at least water resistant
 Love it! Sound quality is really good especially for the price.
 Has been working great. Was easy to connect up, feels like quality construction, beautiful soft-non smudge surface, and most importantly....it sounds great. No distortion that I can tell, plenty of volume, and simple operation. Came in a nice box that protected it well, although the directions were fairly worthless......but it is a simple device. Fairly heavy for the small size. Have only charged it once and that was quite awhile ago, so that's promising.
 My speaker broke and i unfortunately had to get a new one and i chose the perfect one. This thing has amazing sound quality for a 28 dollar speaker. i highly recommend this to any &amp; everybody. it is portable and easy to charge!
 haven't any problem so far
 I love this item...all around great product..
 It doesn't work anymore!
 Amazing sound! Loud, Crisp, awesome. I love it 😍<br/> I highly recommend.
 Perfect. Its loud enough and it lasted through a beach trip.
 This little thing packs quite the punch volume wise and lasts for hours on a single charge. Great buy!
 I am glad I bought this speaker ! It arrived fast and the quality is great , and even more when you consider the very fair price ! I would but this again without the slightest hesitation.
 Perfect speaker for the kitchen or garage, and sounds great
 Perfecto para viajes
 a pesar de ser pequeño tiene buena respuesta de frecuencias
 It was a gift for my son. Great sound. Very light.
 I bought this back in late September and it has been nothing short of amazing combine with its amazingly long battery life i would highly reccomend this combine with an aukey battery bank and anker powerline + cord it can last a very long time
 This sounds good real good if you put a equalizer on it and the bass makes it sound more bass to it.
 Great product. Must have!
 Very good quality. Bought to have music in my cars with no radio. Windows down and can still hear.
 I like how cheap it is. It sounds great and I bought it over two months ago. I don't use it everyday, but I'm still surprised that I haven't had the need to charge it, not even once.<br/>It's a cool, easily portable, incredibly cheap and incredibly loud speaker. I would highly recommend
 Perfect
 My laptop has lousy speakers that are not loud enough and they distort. This speaker has a more than adequate amplifier. Best of all the Bluetooth programming remembers all of your devices.
 wow - great sound.  I love the color, easy to hook up.  amazed with the sound quality.
 I ordered this one and the smaller one and they are both great. I actually use this one in an old truck and its as clear as a bell. If I could control the bass and treble a little that would be great but I still love using it. When I get out of my truck, on the farm, I just put it on the top of the truck and listen to music while I’m working. I gave the smaller one to my daughter and she loves it. I really don’t know how you can go wrong with one of these. Great sounds and at a very reasonable price. Thanks and great job!
 Good sound for it's size and price. My grandkid put it in a pocket and took it to school. Had to buy one for her !
 Very clear sound and well made.The sound is not loud but comfortable. I use it to hear lectures and satisfied with it
 I was looking for a decent but small speaker for my art studio.  My boyfriend suggested this Anker speaker.  It was very straightforward and simple to figure out how to use it.  My boyfriend has a jam box and we compared the sound and features and he was quite impressed by the sound quality.  The jam box cost way way more money.  I showed another techie friend of mine and he says that they use Anker at his work because it has great quality of sound for a reasonable price.
 I've owned this speaker for over 2 years now. I love it! The sound quality is great and the battery life is unbelievable. I use all day at work and then at home. I rarely have to charge it. The battery life is great. You're not going to get deep bass but it is loud and works great for me.
 Best investment, not a pair of Grado Headphones.
 Great speaker. Long battery life. My one complaint would be that the speaker buzzes hatch the highest volume for some media
 Works as promised. Using it to watch TV with external Bluetooth transmitter and there is a very slight lag between lips and sound. Great for music with great range.
 Great sound and made very well love the rubber that goes around the  hole outside. Bluetooth works great and I ordered the Anker 5mm line that goes from speaker to laptop.My better have doesn't like to mess with blue tooth when watching a movie on the laptop.
 I just received this yesterday.  I have it connected and love the sound - it is perfect for a small speaker and what I wanted.  I didn't rate the battery life because I haven't had it on that long.
 No complaints. Nice clear sound. Louder than I expected also. The battery life seems appropriate. Would buy again.
 Small but good sound. Best speaker for the size and cost. Anker is awesome quality. I use it with my iPad and love it. I can take sound with me when I'm outside or when taking a shower (not IN the shower with me). Love it.
 Bought 2 of these...you can't beat the sound quality for the price.  Seriously.  I would highly recommend.
 Great sound but it has problems with Bluetooth remaining paired.  Getting it to re-pair is difficult sometimes.
 Not the loudest, but sufficient for its size.  Works well enough outside by the pool.  Battery life is ridiculous...I don't know how the hell they were able to get this much out of it.  I use it daily for computer audio a few minutes at a time for youtube and such and it lasts me a couple of weeks.
 Good little speaker. I just wanted something to listen to music while I clean the house. Does that. Haven't charged it since I opened it, and it's still going, going, going.
 Just what I needed to pair with Alexa in a small area. Fast shipping, good sound quality.  Very pleased with our purchase. I've recommended it to friends.
 I use this every day! Really nice sound quality and it holds its charge for a really long time. The price is way better than others. It's lightweight and easy to bring around with you.
 Has very good sound quality and good balance of bass and treble. It can get pretty loud for its size. Has a good range for the Bluetooth and it's really easy to use. The battery life is amazing. When charged fully, it can run for 24 hours. I've owned multiple Bluetooth speakers and this is hands down the best.
 I bought this to go in a little truck that the radio doesn't work in and it works great. The battery life is really good, the sound is great, and the bt range is better than expected.
 Love love love this! I have an old car so  I am not able to play music on my phone. We brought this on a road trip and I never had to charge it the whole six hour car ride! It goes plenty loud and has an amazing sound quality for the price.
 Nice and compact. Good sound, a little too much bass on the speaker. Overall, I like it.
 Works great, fast shipping..  I own a number of anker products, happy with them all..
 This speaker has decent sound, the built-in mic makes it responsive to Alexa, and over all it's good bang for it's buck. BUT it has one huge flaw that drives me abso-f'ng-lutely bonkers (I went back and forth between 2 and 3 stars b/c of this, but it really does drive me so mad, I had to go lower) - When it gets low on battery it beeps, 3 tones in a row, at whatever volume you last listened to it at every 5 mins or so, UNTIL YOU PLUG IT IN. I live in a small studio apt., and I typically just leave the speaker on (since I use it with Alexa and just tell Alexa to stop playing, I don't walk over to the device and turn it off often). Therefore if this happens, at say 3am, it wakes me up, with this obnoxious noise! (and if I'm especially drowsy does so multiple times while I struggle to wrench myself out of sleep and go plug it in). Honestly even if it happens when I'm awake it annoys me b/c I dont want to HAVE to get up and attend to it. There are so many better ways this could have been addressed ....beep once and then turn itself off, flash yellow than red as the battery is getting lower so you plug it in before it gets to beeping mode, have a sleep mechanism that turns it off in general to reduce batter, etc...I'd happily pay more for the speaker if it had any of these features.
 This speaker is loud and has a clear sound. It took a while for it to connect o my phone, but now I can switch between this speaker and my Bluetooth headphones easily. I does not however connect to Bluetooth when it's unplugged. Whether starting unplugged or is unplugged while playing, it will not connect to either of my devices while unplugged. It's fine since I just use it in my studio and have no reason to move it away from an outlet, but it's not portable.
 Awesome speaker
 I bought this unit as a gift, bought my anker soundcore about 5 years ago and I love it so much (battery life, sound quality) I’ve started giving it as gifts!
 Great for use as a speakerphone with a cell phone. It is okay for music. It doesn't have deep rich tones but doesn't sound like a tin can either. It is very small and very portable. Great places to use it are to play music in a golf cart or to pass around a speakerphone in a large room when everyone needs to hear. Built-in mic. Charges via micro USB.
 I love my speaker! I have it on all day!!
 I'm not an audiophile, but music from this speak sounds great to me. It has a great Bluetooth range- it works with my  Amazon Echo Dot two rooms over (through two walls).
 I have purchased 3 BT speakers now and this one by far is the best  for my purpose  and for the $$
 Okay so I originally started out with an Emerson Bluetooth speaker which was cheap about $15 and decent although the sound was tinny and not as nice as I would like. Then I bought the oOnz angle 3 it has a nice sound for a little package but a little too much reverberation for me. Then I bought two ankers because I was so impressed with the first one. Has a nice Bass has a nice output love the fact that you can feel the air coming out of the speaker with the bass and it does not walk off because of the reverberations. I also purchased 2 UE mini booms and 2 UE rolls. No I am not compensated by anyone I purchase all of these planning on sending part of them back. The ankers do not connect through each other wirelessly however you can take a headphone splitter and 2 3.5 millimeter cables and run them into your headphone jacks on either your computer television or smartphone and it does both speakers play simultaneously without a wireless connection. This of course is a pain if you're trying to walk around with these speakers. However the two ankers wired together are very impressive sound wise. The base is pretty impressive as well. I also bought the two UE Mini Boom which are much louder then the anchor and the oOnz angle 3 but the base is not as pronounced as the UE roll. I planned on returning the ankers the mini booms and the UE rolls but there's 2 MAJOR problems... I LOVE THEM ALL AND my kids keep stealing hem. IF I could hook all 8 speakers together it'd be mind blowing! I have come to the conclusion that my son is stealing the angle threes my daughter is stealing the UE Mini Boom and my other child is feeling the UE rolls and my sister BOTH ankers.. so now I need to decide which of these I want and then split a set so that my kids have what they want and I still have an amazing system. At this point I truly prefer ankers or the mini booms. Realistically I'm robably ordering  4th set of ankers or mini booms they're just that good.
 This speaker is incredible for the price, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality bluetooth speaker that won't break the bank. There are very few negatives that I have for it overall.<br/>Pros:<br/>The speaker is on the smaller side, but still quite loud. It pairs easily, and reconnects quickly and efficiently when turned on. The battery life is excellent, with very close to 24 hrs of play time off of a full charge (I've never actually run it for that long between charges, but I've gone a week or so without charging it while using it for 2 or 3 hours each day). The sound quality is very good for the price.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The speaker itself is excellent, but the buttons are a bit difficult to use. The volume down button on my speaker specifically is difficult to press, and doesn't always register that I press it when I am trying to. This reason alone is why I didn't give it a 5 star review, because sometimes when I have it at work and need to turn it down, I can't have my phone out, and its annoying to have to press a button several times when I just need it a little quieter. The only other negative I can say is that it is, like others have said, a little lacking in bass, but as it's a portable speaker and not a surround sound system, I don't mind.
 Good value. Good sound for the price.
 I need a little something to listen to music while cooking. It’s small and great
 The first one I bought didn't work, but I tried again. The sound is really nice and this one works - but only on my iDevices.  It does not pair well with my HP laptop.
 I like it with the long battery life but you can’t use to speaker to control the songs, such as play the previous one or next one. The previous one I had is mech cheaper but have all the functions.
 Nice quality build
 These speakers are outstanding!!  Sound quality and volume level is excellent!  I bought two!!
 Not super duper loud, but I bought it to use on a golf cart so it's gas and is a little loud. Using it to listen to songs in shower or watch movies you'll be very satisfied<br/>Listening to music outdoors around a pool not so much
 The Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker is clear and balanced with excellent  sound. Simply the best of it's class and at a great price.
 Easy to pair with echo dot. Sound is good quality, good mix of bass. Pleased with distance for clear transmission.  Took it outdoors for music at dinner on a nice evening.
 After receiving a defective product, returned it and posted a complaint about it, Anker immediately was apologetic and wanted to make things right. They sent a new one immediately. Now I’m enjoying this great sound that amazingly comes from a speaker this small. Great customer care!
 Sounds decent. Was hoping for more deeper sound but at some point, you have to be realistic with you expectations. It's no Bose but sounds good for the price.
 My wife was looking for a great blue tooth speaker but also frequently likes to use her old-school Zune without blue tooth, This fills the bill perfectly because it has an audio input jack. The sound is awesome.
 nice
 I love this. I place it all over the house to listen to Music. My new favorite speakers.
 Wow. I find this thing amazing. For the price I paid on a lightning deal it cant be beat. I stick this in my sink (Dry!) while taking a shower and it opens the sound up 3 fold. Its as loud as any big boombox!
 So far so good! I like the fact that I can listen for hours without stopping to charge the speaker. The sound quality is much better than I expected and better than my other Bluetooth speakers.
 It connected right away to my laptop computer and has good sound I would recommend the purchase.
 Built great, it feels solid and comfortable, perfect size and the materials also feel good, regarding sound it is in my opinion excellent. The device is easy to use and its connectivity is smooth and quick.
 Very small and has great sound. Easy to hook but only has about<br/>25 foot range.
 I bought this for myself for Mothers Day, and it's the perfect little bluetooth speaker.
 You are not going to get thumping bass, but for it's size it has great sound quality.
 Great sound for the price, you will not be disappointed. The charge last forever
 About the size of a TV remote. Big and clear sound. Built out of firm rubber, feels quite durable. Excellent quality
 Best small bluetooth speaker you can buy.  I have had several bluetooth speakers including the Anker Classic Bluetooth Speaker and this is waaay better.  The battery lasts for days and the sound vs size is incredible.  I take this to job sites all the time and people are blown away not only by the sound but by the fact that it is only $35.  Strongly recommend!!!
 Great sound and battery life. Great value. Very pleased. Smaller than expected. Connects super easy at start up and every time to my Samsung S7.<br/><br/>Update: I am absolutely amazed! We used this speaker for about 10-15 minutes a day once every 2-3 days. We didn't turn it off. We let it turn off on it's own, and the battery lasted 3 MONTHS! We are just now charging it for the first time!
 I loved this thing for months and took it on trips and used it to amplify movies when I would watch from an auxillary monitor. I bought this on the 1st of May and the speaker's sound has already been blown out. You get what you pay for....I'm really disappointed.
 This is the coolest companion on my work sites.  In the garage, at remote work sites outside of radio range.  Deep rich sound in such a small package.  Great product!!!
 I apparently had purchased a faulty speaker. The sound was great but the charging mechanism had failed. Upon reading my review, Anker contacted me and replaced my speaker at no charge. I now have a great sounding speaker which charges perfectly. I am happy with this company and their products. Highly recommend......
 The best speaker I have purchased thus far!!! No complaints gets loud enough to hear music throughout my apartment. LOVE IT!
 Not the greatest bass, but still infinitely better sound than a phone speaker. Easy to pair, and has an auxiliary input so I can run wired audio from my computer.
 This little MF got a nice bass to it.<br/>Wow! Buy it.... don't hesitate...buy it !
 Great product, although the blue tooth range does reach 30ft... the sound does not. It's still a great product to use indoors.
 What a great little speaker for a great price.  Good sound quality and long battery life so far.  Can't beat the price.  My only negative is that I wish the bass was a little deeper, but I'm well satisfied with the quality for price paid.
 I have bought this product three times: one for me and two as gifts. Its best feature is battery life. It's super easy to use, to charge and to move around (portability). Great sound quality for its price. I super recommend this product :) no wonder it's among Amazon's best sellers.
 This product is amazing! I honestly never review anything, but this was sooooo worth the money. Very sleek speaker. Great sound. Great carry. Good base. Such high quality. Perfect for laying by the pool, using around the house, bringing on vacation, etc....You won’t be disappointed!
 Perfect.  Forget beats and try this.  My beautician has this same speaker in the shop and it does a great job.
 Nice speaker so far so good
 This was perfect for what I needed it for. Great sound for the price as well.
 Dope purchase. I bought a generic one that needed batteries from a different brand then I saw the reviews on this one and I thought yeah and they were right
 Worth the money...my Sony SR2-X2 is better but for the price the Anker does the work
 Pros:<br/>- Sound quality is solid<br/>- Speaker looks high quality<br/>- Battery life is great (though unsure if it is truly "24 hours")<br/>- Solid purchase for a speaker less than $50<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- The only major con is one that I should have considered in the first place; with the speakers on only one side, the speaker is best suited for the edge of a room instead of the center.
 Decent enough loud sound. Doesnt matter too much because I work in office environment. Pairs up quickly with my phone. rugged rubber exterior looks like a Bose a friend has. I like the 35 dollar price tag. Quality unit
 Great buy! I use this speaker for my office and it works great and has a long battery life.
 Works fine, just loud enough for my three room shotgun apt. Bluetooth connection starts cutting out under 50 feet away so that is definitely a disappointment.
 Great value and sound for the price.  This is a tough, long charging speaker that works great inside and outside!
 It's a wireless bt speaker, it'll work as advertised.
 Great sound and the charge lasts.  Issues with pairing and had to forget the device and repair twice.  Frustrating until I figured it out.<br/>Not sure if this is going to happen every time it runs out of charge.  Also, it's better to recharge with speaker off and from a wall socket rather than a computer.  Less time to refill and my mini-mac really didn't like it recharging.
 This is better than I hoped for, love the long charge it puts out, great sound quality for a great price!
 This is such a cute speaker with great sound quality and long life. The charge lasts for days. I've taken it boating and camping and daily use in my home. I love it! 100% recommend.
 Long battery life, great sound, very portable, at a very affordable price to boot!<br/>Very happy with this speaker.
 it is good
 More quality and style than anything for the price.<br/>The sound quality beats many more expensive "upper tier" speakers.<br/>Size is perfect.
 I bought one of their mondo batteries for my laptop, and I was VERY impressed.  So I gave this a try, and guess what?  It's very good!  Paired easily, charged quickly, and sounds decent for such a tiny thing.  No complaints.
 Easy to connect to Alexa and has a great sound.  It gives me the opportunity to play my Amazon music wherever I can carry the Bluetooth speaker around the house.
 bluetooth  connection range wasn't that great! was a deal breaker
 You can't go wrong with Anker products. Love this speaker. Sounds great and looks even better. Exactly what I wanted.
 Love this little guy! For such a small speaker it has great sound and utility. I would buy this again and recommend to my friends.
 I have been searching for an affordable small speaker with better quality. I absolutely love this speaker. It has a really long battery life and it's sound is great. I also like how small and easy to tote around it is. Excellent buy!
 AMAZING sound coming from such a small speaker! No need to buy an expensive one, this lil guy does the trick!
 Great speaker! 24 hours of charge is unheard of- maybe Anker should help out Apple and Samsung. Sound is clear and volume is really loud.  My kids love it
 battery last long, the speaker is small and easy to carry. But the sound is just ok, not bad but not great either
 This is a great little speaker. Good sound. Very portable. Long battery life.
 The speaker i received would not turn on... I was very confused and thought i mustve been doing something wrong, i charged it fully and still nothing. I looked it up online and this seemed to be a common problem. The company was very helpful though and sent me a packaging slip to send it back and I soon received a brand new one from the company that works great.
 Great battery life and good quality sounds...I guess I was expecting it to sound as good as Bose Mini speaker but not quite there but close enough for the price though.
 I've yet to actually run the battery out on this and the sound is great for such a small speaker.  I bought two, my wife uses hers in her classroom and I use mine in the garage.  Pairs up well and easy to use.
 I freaking love this thing. Like the bass is clean, doesn’t distort at all. Even at its full volume! I got it 6 days ago, turned it on right out of the box. I haven’t charged it since, and I play it A LOT. So yeah, highly recommend. It is a real cheap price for the quality it has.
 Bought the speaker because  of other reviews and the price seemed reasonable. It exceeded my expectations. Easy to setup and use.  I ordered a second speaker and l'm very satisfied with the speakers and highly recommend the Anker speakers.
 Very pleased with the size and sound quality.  The following reduced the rating from 5 to 4 stars ... When walking between the speaker and the sound source, the speaker sound breaks up, which makes it useless in a party setting since the sound is constantly breaking up while people disturb the Line-of-Sight (LOS) link.  I have not experienced this with other Bluetooth speakers.  The following item did not detract from the rating ... From a design perspective, I would have preferred that the unit did not make a sound when transitioning from ON state to Off state; the blue LED going off should be sufficient.<br/>Follow-up review: Anker Customer Service contacted me about the bluetooth connection problem.  Anker suggested a replacement unit.  The replacement unit bluetooth worked great and was about 30% louder than previous unit; showing that old unit had bluetooth connectivity and volume problems.  Upgraded rating from 4 to 5.  Hopefuly, Anker can get better Quality Control on their products.
 It's just more then I've expected ! Beautiful design, loud enough for a room, connecting in 2 second! Absolutely satisfied with the purchase!
 Great speaker! I did have a little issue recently where it wasn't connecting to any of my devices, but it fixed itself somehow.
 Great little speaker for the price! Seems to be well built and has a soft rubberized finish. It has more than enough volume to fill a room with music and it sounds reasonably well. Great value for the price.
 The sound is not real crisp,  lack of bass but again, for the price, we can live with this one
 I researched before I purchased and found that this was the most liked by the reviews.  I have to agree wholeheartedly.....quality, reliable products every time!
 Great sound for the price!  I’m actually impressed at the sound quality for such a small device!
 I bought this speaker and the Bluetooth stopped connecting so I posted a negative review. Anker sent me an email and offered to replace the speaker no questions asked. I revived an anker 2 soundcore and it works great. They were very fast about making sure I was satisfied with there product... I went from 1 star to 5... Good job anker...
 Bought this for my Grandson for Christmas and he loves it.
 I have owned this product less than a week. It does not hold a charge more than three hours and it doesn't pick up signal from more than 10 feet.
 Great volume. Great bluetooth sound. The only thing is I used to be able to talk on the phone with the audio coming up out from the speaker and the mic on the phone. This speaker doesn't have a mic but still grabs the mic signal... meaning I cant talk on the phone like I used to :(
 Excellent sound at a fraction of the big name brands!! I bought two, one for mom and the other for dad.
 A solid little device but if you are really into listening - to music it's not worth it. Go with Bose. If you listen to shows like BBC and NPR it provides adequate value.
 Seems to work good considering the price. I have purchased another one for $50 that just seems to be louder than this one, but it still works fine for my 12 year old!
 I would order this again! Just a basic speaker but it does the job!
 5 minutes out the box dropped it on accident dusted it off kept playing the whole time sound is great will be buying more anker products in the future if they are all made with this quality definitely will be a customer for years to come
 Great sound out of a little speaker and battery life is awesome as well. Use it for work everyday
 Aw man. What can I say? The sound quality is great and the battery lasts for quite a while. I use my Anker speaker at work and it lasts all day at a reasonable volume. The feel of the speaker of itself screams durable. I have recommended it to a bunch of friends and co-workers.
 Great product at a great price!!
 I bought this Anker soundcore bt speaker for Christmas as a gift. I opened it and thought it's small, but once I turned it on and linked it to my phone, boy was I wrong. This lil speaker has some kick!, It filled up the whole room! Rubber texture all around the speaker with its slim design is very good! Very good buy indeed!
 Good speaker.  Would like for a bit more bass, but does the job just fine.
 Really good speaker for the price. Gets plenty loud without distortion. Bass is not like a high end Bose, but pleasant to listen to. Speaker phone funtion works really well.
 Great sounding Bluetooth speaker. You use this outdoors as well. Little speaker big sound.  5 Stars.
 This little speaker! Omg for such a small speaker it had GREAT bass and it’s doesnt get distorted when you turn the volume all the way, Ive taken this into he bathroom to play music while showering and I’ve taken it to work where it was all girls and it’s survived lol it’s wonderful I strongly recommend it.
 Looks very nice and feels well made, but gives me listening fatigue because the bass tries too hard and deadens the rest of the music. Returned it, got and kept the Oontz, instead.
 Anker does it again! Love the product. I use it all the time, anywhere.
 Purchased as a gift for my wife. She loves it. Nice rich sound comes out of it.
 The best I have got
 Great sound for the price. Perfect for my desk at work!
 Very nice speaker.  We use it on our patio and the sound is perfect...
 I bought it in July, now is November. I use it regularly to play music for my baby. I never charged it since purchase, and it still has more than 60% of battery...Amazing! Regarding sound quality, it depends on you own expectation. As an audiophile, I think it is not worse than Bose soundlink. I’m quite happy with it.
 Worked for 1 year. I buy All Anker products and this is the only problem I have encountered  I have several of these in various models that are older than this one. There products are the best in my opinion. Don’t know what happened with this one though.
 This is a fantastic little speaker. It's very small but has a big sound and I've been very happy with my purchase.
 Well worth the price. Worked like a charm for almost 17 months before it stopped charging. Contacted support as it was still under warranty and they send me a replacement in 3 days flat. Definitely recommend and would buy again.
 We love this little speaker! It's just what we were looking for to use in our small condo. The sound is clear and crisp. We love how it takes up no space whatsoever. Have ordered another.
 Pretty good sound quality
 Easily paired my Windows Lumia 640 XL Phone to my brand new Anker Portable Stereo Bluetooth Speaker.  First played a classical piece by Bach and this new speaker played clearly and beautifully at high down to low volume.  Then I blasted Fleetwood Mac's Dreams and was just as pleased!
 This portable WiFi speaker is awesome.  It’s kind of heavy so it doesn’t move or tip over.  The sound is amazing.  It gets loud enough for entertaining and can be heard easily in more than one room.  Everybody wants to know where I got this amazing speaker.  Lol
 Solid Anker product. I wish it was a little bit crisper in the highs.
 Great buy it’s sound quality is great and doesn’t get muffled after constant use I even lost the charger and it still works great charging with my android
 It’s decent enough
 This product has an excellent reputation and I can't add to it. Excellent product.
 Bought it for a 16 year old boy. He loves it, uses it all the time, and takes it everywhere.  Sound is good, clear, and liud enough to suit him and fill the house. Great speaker.
 This little speaker can put out some sound. It holds a charge very well. I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth the money.
 love it but found it way easier to connect via cable
 This speaker is worth it.  Can Bluetooth it to anything and the sound is awesome.
 Excellent easy to use speaker for the price. Works well sounds good excellent battery life. I have used it all day without the battery draining.
 I put the speaker in the center of my house, pair it with my Echo Dot, and play music that I can hear throughout.  Looking forward to using it outside this spring.
 Works great! Decent sound and pairing is no issue. Battery lasts a good while.
 Excellent sound. Really loud. Mounted this to my motorcycle handlebars and it only drowned out when I hit 50 mph so for all other applications, I highly recommend.
 The volume did not go much higher than my cell phone speaker. Very dissapointed.
 Great product, except the screws on the face are not anti-rust.... mine is now all rusty.
 Seriously amazing speaker. I love it. And recommend it. I want another one just because how great it is. I don't need it of course. It holds it charge extremely well. So small..yet great sound and quality. I bought 6 before this one, and the price is amazing for how well it preforms. "Just buy it, you won't regret it."
 I have this one conected to my tablet in my truck battery holds well and sounds is ok.
 This little guys rocks !
 Great speakers, I use them a lot and they have great sound.<br/><br/>Update: I have had them for a little over a year now and they're still great. Battery life is great as well
 Wife loves it.  She plays it when I am not around though.  Apparently the sound is good but she knows I have a lot of study to complete for school.
 I have been using the speaker for a couple months, and it has been a high quality speaker. The battery last a long time and I drag it around with me to work and in the garage. While I was at work I put it up to another speaker that is 100 dollars and the same size, the quality was almost identical. My buddy couldn't believe the price of the speaker, it really has been a nice surprise
 Love the size and mobility of this speaker, the rubber is also nice, no hard plastic.  I had an issue with my charging port about 13 months, and it got a lot of use during those 13 months.  The 18 month warranty was a huge relief.  Only downside is that it's not USB C.
 Excellent quality and sound.  I would like it to be able to go a little louder, but it is a great value for a small size with a good sound.
 The sound quality of the speaker is really good as it says, and has no distortion. But there was only one problem, the right speaker wasn't working. That's when I emailed customer service, telling them about this problem, and they sent help right away. I cannot thank you anker customer support as much as they have helped me with their product, and I recommend for anyone having second thoughts on any of their products to just buy them! Thanks Anker!
 Great Stereo.  No need to spend the extra money on a Bose....this has great loud sound, last forever on one charge, and very easy to use.  Love it.
 Sounds as good as several speakers multiple times the cost...it's a no brainer. Great build quality as well feels really solid and does its job well. I use it for my home gym
 Nice tight package. Sound quality is not a 5, but definitely close to 4. Well designed, well made. Delighted with the price. Recommended.
 Exactly what I hoped for when I bought this speaker. Great sound for a office setup. And it looks sleek.
 This arrived today.  Set up took about 20 seconds or less including the time to take it out of the box - easy!  I have been listening to Pandora through these speakers all afternoon.  The quality is excellent relative to cash out of pocket.  May have to buy another one for my office.
 It's really a decent little speaker. Nothing booming, but definitely does the job. I enjoy mine.
 Great sound.  Not as bass-y as I'd like, but for the price, you can't beat the sound.
 Anker impresses me time and time again. Small form factor, big sound! Battery lasts as long (if not longer) than advertised and pairs very easy with my devices. Thanks for another great product.
 Very satisfied with this purchase. has enough volume and bass for my listening needs. Easy to operate. I liked the price as well.
 Fabulous little speaker.  So much sound in such a small unit!!  Plenty of base.  Love the compact sound!  Company is very responsive to questions.
 Great speaker, compares really well to similar products on the market that mostly come at a higher price. Anker as a company overall has been phenomenal in any interaction I've experienced, which keeps me coming back to their products.
 Good speaker wish it was a bit louder but the battery last a good while not sure if it's 24 hrs I'm working on testing it out though
 amazing , song , feeling at hand . Good bass , i love it
 Unbelievable sound quality from this little speaker!! I must say that I do love anker products and their customer service is top notch. But after unwrapping it, super simple setup and an amazing sound!
 Very happy with this speaker.  I bought one to try with an Echo Dot.  Works great.  Easy to pair and great battery life.  Will be ordering another for my other dot.
 Bought this speaker about a year ago and figured it was time to do a review.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Charge lasts a LONG time<br/>-Pairs relatively quickly<br/>-Great size for travel<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Sound is pretty meh for the price since there's only one side with a speaker.<br/>-You have to hold the "ON" button for a long time to turn it on/off.<br/>-There is no skip button on the speaker, just pause and volume.
 For the price and size, it’s hard to beat. Good sound quality, good battery life, fits on a window sill or anywhere small, and durably made.
 The battery on this thing is amazing.  I love this product.  Totally buy it!! I've had this for about a few months now and still love it
 Decent speaker. Sound is just "ok" and nothing to get excited about. Very little bass. The reception isn't great if there is any wind (like on a beach) and you dont have your phone right next to it.
 Great for the price
 This is an awesome little product, I bought it to work with my Echo Dot and it does so very well. Added bonus of streaming music from my phone. Great bass for such a small speaker.
 I use this speaker usually around twice a day for around 30 minutes to an hour each use and I only have to charge it once a week everything I can ask for a speaker I've dropped it from waist height multiple times and I have seen no decrease in quality because of me dropping it.
 Awesome sound, great battery life!
 A Veces se me desconfigura del iphone mas no de android, es un poco incomodo estar configurandolo cada semana con IOS
 This thing just arrived. It sounds great!! Holy smokes. The sound comes out of it like - you can't tell where the speakers are! Like surround or something. Very happy for $39.
 We use almost 4to 5 times a week. We buy audio and regular books and follow along with soundcore. Love it.
 Great sound and a quality little unit. Bang for the buck, this little speaker takes the gold.
 I’ll give it 4 stars because it feels like a solid unit and looks to be built well. Only problem<br/>Is, I didn’t like the sound. For me it just has too much base and the music sounded muffled. I’m going to try the soundcore 2.
 Great speaker for kitchen and garage. Would love a longer charging cord<br/>Did not come with wall charge piece, just usb
 I have been looking for this in my life for a while..24 battery..used it about 8 hours a day for 3 days before any recharge!!..love it!!!
 Awesome speaker for the Price!.... Loud easy to pair and long battery life!
 Got it for 30 bucks on a lightning deal, and it's a great speaker, really fine sound and good bass response for it's size.  Maybe a bit large for some folks preference with everything going "micro" these days, but my kids have smaller bluetooth speakers and to me this one clearly has much better sound overall.
 Sound great size great Bluetooth connects fast<br/>I’m so excited my husband can’t hear well and he couldn’t hear tablet watching YouTube now he had great sound from Anker Bluetooth and it so easy for him to use he could not bare wearing ear buds or any head phones on. Thanks Anker
 Awesome little speaker with fantastic battery life. I use this all the time.
 Grandsons love them!!!
 have had for 2 days.  i am happy with the product.  very good sound
 I received this speaker on Sept 29 and have yet to recharge it again! On average, I probably use it for 2-4 hours about 4-5 times a week. The sound quality is great and the speaker is much smaller than I expected. I honestly think that it's one of the better ones you can get for less than $50, well worth the money!
 Delivers clear competent sound in a surprisingly small and simple package. Pairing was sime with my iPhone 6s. Range seems as advertised, but I did not get a tape measure out. I get occasional momentary hiccups in audio playback, will have to watch that. Overall very pleased so far
 This is a great Bluetooth speaker to use around the house or when having a cookout on the back deck.  Good sound quality and easy to set up and change from different devices.
 Got this today, really nice sound for the size of the unit, feels solid and heavy. I had no problem pairing it up with a few different devices, worked without a hitch straight out of the box.
 Works really well, I use it to pair with my Alexa mostly, but as of late we take it out with us on the boat, its a pretty powerful little speaker.
 This is my second Anker product, and it confirms my feeling that Anker makes solid products at a great price point.  I would strongly recommend all their products.  The speaker fills a nice sized kitchen and has a good battery life.  I've seen some audiophiles question the high-end quality, but for the rest of us who just want a good speaker with a nice battery at a reasonable price, I would recommend this highly.
 items arrived as described. good product.will buy again.best battery i ever seen last a long time .really good Bluetooth 66 feet and more. i take it to work and everyone love the sound, buy you wont be disappointed
 Sounded good but already broken.
 Love it, use it all the time indoors and the sound quality is definitely an upgrade from what I had before. The battery also lasts for days at a time. Very rarely use it at all full volume because its loud enough
 Overall I think this is comparable to the Bose mini speaker, just missing a little bit of the base that I'm used to, but for the price a real bargain
 Small enough to throw in a gym bag...with sound big enough to get you through your workout.  It's not going to send an audiophile to nirvana, but for its size, it gets the job done, and with excellent battery life.
 Had decent expectations buying this BT device from prior Anker purchases (thumbs up) and the reviews on here, so far so good... the battery life is amazing and the sound quality is very good as well, better HDR than i expected for the size and price.<br/><br/>Enthusiastic thumbs up, highly recommended.
 I am extremely pleased with the sound quality and the playtime on this device.  I use it when a group of us are playing disc golf and the sound is wonderful!!
 Great bang for the buck here.  I researched many of these bluetooth speakers and decided to give this one a try.  It does everything I need.  Syncs easily. Plenty of volume for indoors and out, and great sound to boot.  If you need something with really high volume for a large space, this is not your guy.  But otherwise, you really cant go wrong.
 My purpose for this soundbox is mainly used for background music in the bedrooms when my toddler-age girls take their naps or go to bed at night, because playing youtube kids music through our phone speakers just weren't cutting it anymore.<br/>To my ears this soundbox is great. Good bass and pretty decent volume range without distortion.<br/>When I hold it in my hand, it is about the size of a hotdog in a bun. On the side, it has a mic hole, mini-usb power port, an aux in port, and a red led that comes on when charging or plugged into a power source. You get a charging cable, but no plug. On top are the function keys: On/Off, Vol down, Play, Vol up, Bluetooth. The "buttons" do not light up. They are like Braille, raised off of the rubber/plastic top with no color distinction so unless you have good lighting where it is being used, you can't really see the buttons. It kind of just blend into the material. That is the only thing I found annoying when I use it in the bedrooms with even a good lamp that is not overhead and bright.
 Very satisfied, decent value. Some initial problems with pairing, but is now trouble free. Feels solidly built and while far from audio quality the sound is fairly loud and acceptable for what it is.
 Love this thing! Nice and small, lightweight, well constructed, practical, fantastic sound. Haven't used it enough yet to comment on the battery life, but so far so good! Easily connects to any Bluetooth devices and small enough to throw in a purse/handbag.
 Good sound and fair range.  Range depending on obstacles.  Greatly reduced with doors/walls etc.  Very nice sound and easy to use.
 This Lil speaker by FAR has the BEST battery life out there !! It lasts for 24hours off 1 single full charge ! Incredible speaker ..super easy to connect to my phone too !! Nothing bad to say ...awesome buy for the price !!!!!
 I have used this USB speaker for 3 months now. This sounds really good for such small speaker. Battery lasts and hold charge well. Happy with this buying. Anker makes high quality speaker.
 Great sound! Love this!
 Great sound quality
 I love Anker, it's a company that doesn't compramise on sound quality as far as I have experienced. It ain't a home cinema system but for it's genre it's a great speaker and a good value for money.
 Nice product!  I haven't had a chance to use it very much yet, but so far it's great. I wanted a small portable speaker to use with my phone or iPad and received this for Christmas.
 It's almost as good as the $99 bluetooth speaker I already have but at a quarter of the price.  I am considering buying another one to give as a gift for a friend.  At this price point (only $25!), you will not find a better speaker.  Buy this one with confidence!
 Surprisingly good sound!  We find it perfect for playing music stored on our phones -- mostly background or light listening at medium volume.  Its probably not the best choice for high volume, rock concert playback,
 Anker has proven to do it again! This is  an excellent SoundSource! This has given me really good sound quality ... the highs are crisp and the bass is awesome! I really like the speaker!!!
 Had great reviews but disappointed in the sound quality. Maybe I was expecting to much for so little, but don’t recommend.
 The sound starts to distort around 3 hour of playing time, the base sounds muffled.
 Good sound. Easy to install. Does the job. Unfortunately the battery failed to recharge after four months of use. I contacted Anker and they replaced the unit within a few days without any hesitation . Amazed at the quick customer service. Would recommend.
 I love everything about it! Great sound quality at an affordable price and it's convenient to take along anywhere.
 It just stopped working after a few months. Would not buy again
 2 stars and only because of how nice it was when it worked. Pairs with every phone or tablet I try, but zero sound now.<br/><br/>Thought maybe it was a Bluetooth issue, so I tried to use an aux cable. Still no audio.<br/><br/>Really disappointed as if heard nothing but good about Anker products, and this one has been a giant bust. It sounded great when it worked, but sadly that was a short amount of time.
 Not sure if mine is defective or what, but the Bluetooth light won't stop blinking when it's plugged in via audio cable.
 Small but mighty. I've used the original Jawbone Jambox for the past few years. While that speaker has stood up well, most of the damage that has been done to it is due to its size. The Anker SoundCore is a much smaller package, portable, durable, and sounds way better. I'm still testing the battery life, but if it's anything like other Anker products I've used before, I'm sure it will be fantastic!
 Smaller physically than expected.<br/><br/>Very loud and clear sound for it's size.  Quick and clean Bluetooth Connect.  Haven't checked AUX in yet.
 The low end is garbage
 Such a great device!  Long range.  Definitely easy setup and consistent performance.  The sounds works for our purposes.  I wouldn't use it for a party, but for playing occasional audio or stories in my kid's room upstairs, from my phone downstairs, it's perfect!
 This little speaker really is incredible. Sounds fantastic and I rarely need to charge it.
 Great little speaker with nice sound.  Had a hiccup with the charging port after a year but Anker Customer Service came through as usual and sent me a new one immediately no questions asked.  Nice to see a company stand by its products!
 Retirned
 Live it sounds great
 Make sure to adjust tv volume settings or you get distortion.
 Loud enough to hear over my forklift when driving. Sounds great. I plug my iPod in so I can use the blue tooth to link my work phone to ring through. Now I can hear incoming calls over the running lift.<br/>I used heavy duty Velcro to attach to the lift. Takes the abuse.
 Great sound!! Battery last forever
 This is a great value for its size and features.<br/><br/>Since my 'legacy' Jawbone Jambox Mini is inoperable and is no longer supported, this makes a great replacement at an even better price. Anker stands behind supporting their charging cables and portable USB chargers, so I am very pleased to find that they have an affordable Bluetooth speaker product line as well.
 I got the anker speaker really fast, the first thing I did as I got it was turning it on and pair it with my galaxy...  the proccess went smooth , the sound is very nice and the battery last loooong. Great purchase!!
 Excellent little speaker and got a really good deal on it.  Sounds great.  Not super loud but loud enough for sitting on deck or working in garage.  I even take it out in the yard while I'm gardening.  So far the battery has never died on me while using.  Arrived quickly and great packaging.
 It's a nice little speaker. I love that it has a aux port so I can use it for more than just my phone! Since my computer does not have Bluetooth it's great for me because I can just plug it in!
 I got the SoundCore Sport and it has better bass while this unit has better highs and stereo.  I prefer the sport but this speaker is absolutely fantastic too.  Not as much for bass based music though.
 I use this every day while I’m getting ready for work, it was easy to synch up and has a great charge life, I’ve been using for 5 weeks and I’ve only charged it twice.  The sound quality is good.
 Puts out a lot of sound for the money, battery lasts a long time, sound quality is very good.  I continue to be very impressed with Anker products.
 Was having slight connection issues, but excellent sound quality for the price, just received it though so we'll see
 Really impressed with the battery life. Great sound for the price. Never a problem connecting.
 The sound quality is not good and the front panel(ANKER NAME) have a big scratch. Im disappointed.
 This is Wonderful!!! What more needs be said ..... Raggy
 I never have any problems syncing my phone with this speaker and it can get LOUD for such a tiny speaker.  Worth every penny!
 First the good news. Fast, and I mean FAST delivery. Ordered Friday and had it Monday with just plain basic shipping. I'm impressed. More good news, it seems very well built. Paired with no problems at all with my (older) Win10 laptop. Haven't had it on long enough to test the battery life but I'm sure its as good as advertised and attested to by many many others here. Visually its a nice looking piece of hardware, kudos to the design team!<br/>Now, the not so good news and quibbles. The sound quality is mediocre at best. Tinny and somewhat flat at worst. Highs are decent and mid-range only slightly less so, but bass ...... well bass is almost nonexistent. I was not expecting much in the way of bass from this due to its size, but even with low expectations I am a little disappointed. If you have an equalizer on your device it helps some. As a aside, my last speaker of this type was the Bose Soundlink Mini II which has excellent sound quality albeit at 4 times the cost. So maybe my expectations were clouded some by the excellence of the Bose. Onward. The help "pamphlet" is very skimpy with practically no useful information. But having said that, you really don't need much as this pairs so seamlessly. I really cannot emphasize this enough, it was a breeze to get working. Now the quibble, you only get a usb to mini-usb charging cable. If you want to charge it from a AC outlet you'll need an adapter. They are cheap and plentiful so I wonder at the lack.<br/> Conclusion. A decent enough piece of hardware for what it is. Very good material quality and build. The sound quality on the other hand is only fair to say the least and mediocre to say the best. Expect no bass. For the price its a nice addition for your device but I will not go out of my way to recommend it.
 Awesome product will buy again
 Great very loud
 very great battery but thats gained by the weak speaker its a bit too quiet for my intended use for it id take a louder speaker for less battery life
 There are a lot of Bluetooth speakers to sort through and I'm sure alot of them are great.  My experience with the this one so far has been awesome.  Long battery life.  Rugged and easy to use.  And most importantly its loud enough to hear over a noisy machine shop.  Great product.
 One charge lasts forever!  I use this when I'm doing the dishes or working outside and I haven't charged it in months.
 This guy works really great will tell my friends about the speaker o an great service an price too thanks manny mejia
 Great sound quality and volume. Just what I was looking for I use it all around my house and my roommates are always borrowing it as well!
 Excellent speaker with great sound quality. Easy to pair and battery lasts a long time. It stopped working after almost 1.5 years but customer service was excellent and replaced it without any issues whatsoever.
 Excellent product! Definitely exceeded our expectations. Charges fast, will play while charging, and doesnt have that muffled sound when played on "max". Buying more soon as gifts!!
 OK, short and sweet....can't believe the great sound, longlasting charge, used all through my house, the best 26.99 I ever spent!<br/>Steve S.
 works great, holds a charge FOREVER. my only complaint is that it makes this insanely annoying beep when I change between apps on my phone and I can’t make it stop or figure out why.
 Excellent product. Supplies great sound and hook up to Bluetooth is fast and hassle free - could not ask for better results.
 So far, we love it! Sound is incredible!
 We purchased 2 of these for Christmas and they've been perfect.  The speaker holds charge for a long time, and the sound is great... I'm not super picky, but I can recognize good sound quality.  We primarily use the one at home to play Netflix or Spotify through while we're cleaning the kitchen, and I can't imagine a better product for the price.
 Great buy! Works great.... excellent sound and volume. Love it.
 This is the third Anker Bluetooth speaker we've purchased and all have been outstanding in sound and quality. The SoundCore is more powerful and louder than the other two Anker Classic Portable Wireless Bluetooth 4.0 Speakers we own, but all have truly amazing sound. Never had any problems with connecting or charging. Packaging was first rate and delivery was prompt. Will definitely purchase Anker products again in the future.
 Outstanding clarity, amazing quality of sound.  This tiny speaker will make you realize how much all those other speakers distort your favorite music.  A real winner!
 Very pleased with the performance portability and simplicity of this device. Considering the size and price range, the quality is superb. A positive review on the Drippler APP hit this one on the nose. Highly recommended!
 Great speaker.
 Great sound for the price. Use it with my Amazon Prime Music subscription.
 Very very pleased with this. The sound quality is amazing for the size and Bluetooth set up was a snap.<br/>My review would be five stars if there was any way to adjust the sound (equalizer) to suit personal taste.
 I really love this speaker. It will get loud and sound quality is great for the price!
 The top buttons can be a little difficult to press.  I expected more output.  The volume and sound quality are equal to a much cheaper speaker that I have.  I must admit I am new to purchasing speakers, so I may have been unaware.  Suggestion: read and understand the specifications before purchase!!!
 AMAZING sound quality and feels like it's built very well.  Can't beat it for the price
 For the money this is the best deal out there. It gets loud enough to handle my uses for it. I'm sure there are louder units but they'll be twice as much money.
 Love this speaker, small but super loud and durable, had it a couple years and still love it
 Seriously can't recommend this product, let alone this brand, enough. Anker never ceases to amaze and this speaker is no different. First off, CRAZY AWESOME BATTERY. I use this nearly every day and it lasts me week or more easy without ever having to charge. Absolutely terrific sound and bass and solid construction. Buy this!
 This is an amazing speaker for the price.  The sound is far better than expected and the battery life is great.  It is really easy to pair and use.  I plan on buying another for the house.  Very happy with this purchase!!!
 I would have given this product 5 stars, but the bright blue light on the front of the speaker drives me crazy. Especially when the speaker is plugged into an aux cable, by which the light flashes even though music is being played.
 Love this little blast of musical power.  I wit outside with my dog every night, bring down this little bad boy (it actually fits in the pockets of my shorts, and I enjoy a few tunes while hanging with my dog The Wolverine!
 could not get this speaker to pair up with anything. I spoke to the company and they were very nice got refund no problem
 Battery lasts all day nice bass and volume dor the size.
 Best Bluetooth speaker for the price. It gets pretty loud, has great sound, and I've only had to charge it one time so far in the past month. Of course I don't use it ALL the time, but point being the charge lasts a good while!
 This item was a gift.
 High quality and a reputable brand. I looked at several at this price range and ended up buying this. Good decision! I promise. You can't go wrong this. Everything Anker makes is good. For the price, it's a deal. I usually don't write reviews but had to on this one. Anker all the way!
 Great sound.  Easy to connect to computer of phone.
 Good purchase
 Amazing little speaker at an affordable price. Long battery life. Rugged construction. Throw it in your bag and take it wherever you go.
 Really good speaker. Great sound quality and reaches a high volume without that annoying crackling sound.
 Love most of my Anker products, and this one is no exception.  Amazing sound from a small size, perfect in my bathroom, always connects easily, and battery lasts forever on one charge.  A+
 Love it
 Great sound, fits perfectly under my  Acer R240HY bidx 23.8-Inch IPS HDMI DVI VGA (1920 x 1080) Widescreen Monitor which didn't have built in speakers.
 We have gone through 4 different portable speakers until we found this one. Excellent sound, and acoustics. Solid bass, distribution and very easy to set up. We have used it around the house, and for a few parties and tailgates. One thing to note, is that once someone has synced with bluetooth, if another person adds it to use as well the first person will need to "forget this device" before being able to add it again. This stumped us for a bit but other than that absolutely no issues. Excellent product, would highly recommend.
 I have not found anything that would make me give it fewer stars.  Does the trick and the sound is just fine.
 Hands down the best speaker I ever bought. I got this for my mother for Christmas and I havent stopped using it since 😂 it is absolutely amazing! So loud, so small and compact, the battery lasts forever! And over all it's just amazing
 This is absolute garbage. I don't understand how 7000 people have rated this a good product. It claims to have low harmonic tones. What this means is 2 tweeters blaring at above 80 Hz. This is the worst sounding stereo I have ever heard. I have also tried Bose products which are significantly better than this piece of garbage, but Bose also cuts of certain distortion levels and cannot accurately reproduce sound. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money, and sacrifice a little space and buy a Sony XB-20 or XB-30. Sony has hands down the best sounding portable stereo speaker for the money. If you don't believe me go to best buy and try it on their display next to many others on display.
 Bought this for my Daughter.  I have the black one for myself. Spectacular little speaker.  I take it backpacking with me and have yet to kill the battery at campsite.  Plug my iPod into it and let it rip.  I use tge hootoo sith (also amazing) to recharge iPod and phone and never run out of tunes.  Must have BT speaker.
 For the price you pay this speaker is pretty good. Doesn't feel cheaply made. Sound quality is real decent for what it is. Battery life so far is great. Took it out the box and used to daily for about a week before it needed a charge. Not too shabby.
 This small device sounds surprisingly good.  So easy to carry to all places and the battery charge lasts long hours.  So pleased!!
 It was dead on arrival, charged the unit and it would never turn on. So I returned it.
 A friend had one of these. It has great sound for the price. I got it for my wife.
 I love the ease of use to this speaker. Operates exactly as described. Only thing I would ask for is longer battery life but it is adequate.
 Stepson says he loves it.
 Works, sounds and looks great.
 Awesome sound, and great battery life. Sometimes I charge it only once a week! With way more use than those 24 hrs. promised.<br/>It's an amazingly sized device, that I can easily carry. For me, Anker already means quality.<br/>I've bought Anker cables, battery, chargers, .. and they've never let me down.<br/>This is the best speaker you'll find on Amazon.
 the battery last more than 8 hrs like it says, it works great! good deal
 Quite good quality and very reasonable price
 Not what I expected for the price !!!
 Water proof, compact enough to fit into a pocket, and so ridiculously loud that I can hear it over an industrial sized dishwasher. That is what I have been thinking about this product since I bought it. It is well worth a recommendation!
 This is really nice for the money and perfect for what I needed.
 I was not able to link my Anker Bluetooth speaker to my PC's Bluetooth, my IT guys at work were unable to do so also.  This was very disappointing.  Also, when using the Anker speaker with my iPhone the volume control was not fine enough as I could not turn it down to a minimal setting so as not to be a distraction for others in the office area.  This speaker was a flop for use at work but I can use it at home.  Since the cost was low I will opt to keep it.
 Outstanding speaker -  Good battery life.  Good Stuff!
 Great little wireless speaker! Comes out loud and clear!!
 Best little speaker I ever bought! The sound is great for a speaker this size. It's clear and crisp! The thing that got me the most is the battery life! I recently made a 25+ hour trip by car and I had this playing all the way...and even after that the battery was still at 70%! I'm a big fan of all Anker products but this just blew my mind! I would recommend to anyone looking for an affordable long lasting battery speaker!
 This thing works great and sounds amazing for such a small package.  I'm very pleased with the purchase.  I have one or two other Anker products and have nothing but good things to say about them.
 Great sound for a small speaker.  Bluetooth works great, and the Aux connection to the IPOD also produces great sound.  Would recommend to anyone.
 Nice sound. Would buy again if needed.
 Took this bad boy to the beach and it was amazing. It wasn't overbearing for the people next to us but awesome for us. The battery life was as advertised because it lasted longer than our 4 hr day on the pontoon boat and 6 hrs on the beach after we got off the boat. Charged it at night while sleeping and it was ready to go in the morning. A little water got splashed on it but it survived just fine. I'll be leaving this in my bathroom so when I shower I can hear music. Great product. Thanks Anker.
 Love this speaker! Nice quality. Great sound. Good design. I just wish there was something to show the battery level.
 This little speaker packs a whole lot of sound.  Wray happy with my purchase. It even came fully charged.
 Nice sound in a small speaker. I love that I can disconnect the power and use it somewhere else.
 Great sound for price.  My son likes his purchase.
 The best 30 dollars ive spent for me. This speaker is worth it and is probably one of the best speakers out there for 30 dollars.
 So far so good.  Compact size, good battery life.  Great for our porch or deck.  Eight months later still feeling good on this.  Not the loudest in large areas with nose but great for porch, coffee table out kitchen island.
 I bought it based on Amazon reviews, as well as as reviews from external websites. Very good sound and easy set up for a good price.
 Great bang for your buck speaker. I've had it for the last year and a half. Holds up great with a great battery life.
 Sounds good but does not go 66ft only about 30 feet
 12 months later the charging port is faulty and the speaker can no longer charge. I am assuming it still produces great sound quality, but how would I know?<br/><br/>EDIT: Anker contacted me within hours of posting this review, and refunded me my purchase (including shipping to Canada). Very impressed with the service.
 We've been using this as a monitor speaker for the synth players in the marching band I work with. They're durable little units with great sound.
 This is my 2nd Bluetooth speaker. I use this with a laptop for audiobooks. The sound has a nice range of bass, treble, and mid-range, making the sound clear. Lots of power and the Bluetooth connected immediately, not so with some other devices.
 I love this! I did a little research and trusted some video reviews, and a website and am very happy I did! Great sound, love the red color, and has enough volume to fill the room. Very happy! Amazing price! Thanks Anker!
 Surprisingly good sound! Better than some more expensive speakers.
 sound quality is poor<br/><br/> updated review] they sent me the upgraded version of this speaker and its much better.
 Very convenient for the sound when showing films in a group setting: loud enough for a large room to hear clearly.<br/>Sound quality is excellent. Since I just purchase it, I have no idea about the battery longevity.
 We love our Anker, currently we are using it everyday in our playroom. After 2 months of use, I am very pleased with the battery life :)
 stopped syncing with my trusy Alexa Echo after a few weeks and never worked again. tossed. sucks because I heard this was the best brand for the Echo.
 Anker likes to boast about the quality of its products and their customer service, but based on my experience with this speaker I have to disagree. The speaker itself sounds very good, especially at under $50. However, the unit I received started exhibiting issues almost immediately. As others have mentioned, it has serious bluetooth connection problems. It takes anywhere from 5-10 minutes to find the SoundCore's BT signal and connect. Usually, I have to turn the unit on and off multiple times to get a connection. I've tried using different devices and they all have problems connecting to the SoundCore. The unit is less than 45 days old so I wrote Anker about the problem, and guess what...no answer. None. I've written them three separate times--and they've ignored all of my requests for help. This is unacceptable, and in violation of Amazon's customer service policy. I intend to escalate this complaint to Amazon directly so they're aware of Anker's lack of warranty support. In short, don't believe Anker's claims of great customer service, because it stinks.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Surprise, surprise. A few hours after leaving this review, I got an email from Anker customer support. They claimed the lack of response was due to "email issues." Uh huh. Considering I left two messages that weren't sent via email, I'm doubting this explanation. Anyway, once they did contact me I was able to solve the bluetooth issue. It required a simple reset. We'll see if this is a permanent fix. To be fair, I upgraded my review two more stars because the unit is quite good for the price. And once Anker support did their job, everything seems to be OK.
 It lasts up to 2 days and does not complete the load
 It was a Christmas present for my husband but I got to try it before giving it to him. Great size!...bluetooth!..just was I was looking for... Is loud enough for the size.
 Why pay more for a great portable bluetooth speaker? This was just what i was looking for. Portable, great sound, long battery life, lightweight, sleek and durable.  You can pack this in a carry on bag for those short trips or crank it in a bedroom.
 Awesome speaker with great sound, with a great price
 This speaker has a good quality sound &amp; is nicely portable
 This speaker sounds really good! Not over powering. I bought it to play music in my patio and it sounds great ! Anker really makes great products
 This product is great. Exactly what I wanted. The battery is extremely long lasting. I have owned this product for 2 months and haven't charged it once. There is no "skip" button which kind of poses a problem, but there is probably a way to skip in the instructions and I haven't checked yet. Volume is great for small spaces like cars or bedrooms. No problems with Bluetooth connectivity. Buy it!
 Works very well from over 2 months<br/>The feel and quality is top notch<br/>I totally recommend it
 Full, rich sound but bass is directional at a distance. Very easy to pair and use.
 My 15 yr old daughter got this for Christmas. She loves it!  She’s used it for several hours already without having to charge it. She said, give it a 20 out of 20 stars!
 We love this speaker!  Took it camping and used it for hours, my friend stayed up half the night trying to see when the battery would run out, but it outlasted him!  Still not sure of the exact amount of battery life:)
 Love this little guy! It's smaller than I thought but that isn't bad at all it's super portable and gets very loud for only $30!
 So much louder than it looks! Such a great speaker. I love that it has a microphone so I can answer the phone and that the call quality is still crystal clear. Definitely an amazing buy for the price. I also charged it once for about an hour when it first arrived and haven't charged it since! Really great product highly recommend!
 The battery lasts for what seems forever. I used it for several weeks after receiving it before I needed to charge it. It is also surprisingly loud and clear for the price point. I had an issue with the sound quality after a couple months, and it took only two emails for them to give me a prepaid shipping label and ship me a replacement. That's what I would consider excellent customer service. 5/5 would definitely recommend for anyone who wants a bluetooth speaker but doesn't want to break the bank.
 Is good
 The sound is unbelievable.  Really rich and full.
 Sound is only just better than the echo and the finish is not so good . It shows fingerprints everywhere.
 The product was dead upon arrival. I charged it for hours and, afterwards, I could not even turn it on.<br/>Very disappointed as I never had such an experience before
 Good
 This is the best Bluetooth speaker I've ever owned and worth every penny. The black colored one is $4 cheaper and is the same high quality.
 Great product
 The sound quality is very high. It’s lightweight and worked right out of the package. You can’t beat this for the price!
 The speaker sporadically connects to my phone or any other phone in my household. Sounds great when working, now it will no longer connect at all. Very disappointed in this product.
 Has awesome battery life and perfect sound levels for the use at my workplace.
 Looks great, super easy to set up. Would buy again.
 nice item
 For a small BT speaker, this delivers big sound. It's not going to replace the Bose Mini but it's good. This is not a base heavy sound but more of a balanced sound.
 Had an issue with the first but the new one works amazing, great quality very loud, I'd recommend this speaker to anyone, great customer service.
 aux line doesnt work at all. Paired to my kindle fire linked right up. However max volume on both was less than an average fart. Think my kindle speaker is louder. Very dissapointed.
 Power, volume up and down very hard to see in bright light, impossible to see in dim or no light.  You need to do something about that.  I added labels to the buttons for my 91 year old Mother.
 I bought this to use with my Echo Dot. I only had a very small space to put it on and I wanted good quality sound as well. This fit my needs perfectly.
 This speaker is so quiet I can barely here it when I'm in my living room even at full volume. Bass is very minimal and overall a bad purchase on my part.
 Great device
 Sound is loud enough for a small shop usage. It was easy to pair up on any source devices I had.
 REGARDING THE ANKER SOUNDCORE BLUETOOTH SPEAKER - Great sound and is pretty loud (if you want it to be). Hooked up really easy. Stays charged a long time.
 The battery life on this is amazing
 Sound is loud, crisp and clear. The speaker looks sophisticated.<br/>Opinion: Definitely delivers<br/>Recommendation: Yes!
 There is some static noise during charging, also produces weird noise even if the aux cord is plugged in completely. I have to twist and adjust the aux cord for best performance. Good thing is the battery last a long time, also the sound quality is superb.
 Awesome speaker for the price. Good sound quality. Long play time. My sister and neighbor each bought one after hearing ours.
 Everything is perfect except the loud annoying noise it makes to indicate the volume is maxed. Would rather it not make any noise as I can tell from the volume not rising.
 I got this speaker on sale at 60% off, but I am blown away. At full price, this would be a great speaker. Always happy with Anderson products.
 amazing product
 This speaker is fantastic for the price! Easy to hook up to Bluetooth and great sound quality!
 Excellent and powerful enough and clear sound. Difficult to beat for the price.
 Great product. Don't have to charge it often. I don't think I've charged it since I got it a month or so ago. When I connect it to my chromecast the sound wasn't adjusting at first but after a few different times playing Spotify and Youtube, it eventually adjusted itself.
 Good sound just wish it was a touch but louder
 Can't say enough about the battery life but the sound is great definitely a great buy
 Good for a regular room. Not pretty high volume level. Not bad sound qualilty. Cheap.
 The  microphone does not work properly.  It only works on the first two or three words of a sentence then it stops. I have a JBL clip that works with my iPhone but it’s not loud enough.
 My wife loves this and I have to agree that it has a great sound.  My son even bought one for himself after hearing this one.
 Decent blue tooth speaker for the price.  Sound is not great... but a solid "Good".  Easy connection to my I Phone.  Small / portable.  Decent product so far.
 I bought this to use with my Amazon Echo Dot. I absolutely LOVE it! I carry it to other rooms when I'm cooking and cleaning. My son has even asked to borrow it when he is moving to another room. Great sound, convenient, not a bad price for what you get. I recommend it for the Echo Dot.
 Great little Bluetooth speaker. Good battery life. Plenty loud enough for the office. No complaint at all. Anker comes through again and again!
 This speaker has incredible sound!  I bought this for my son to put in his vintage truck and he loves it.  He carries it into the house to listen to music that is on his phone because he loves how it sounds.  I would definitely buy again!
 I was lookin for a little more bass but sounds good for it's size
 Works fantastically. Great sound quality and the charge lasts forever!  I use it for an hour or two every day and I only have to charge it once every month or two. This is a fantastic item.
 This speaker was great for the couple of months that it worked. Then it all the sudden will not turn on. The red light shows it charging but will not turn on. I hope Anker customer service will read this and provide an exchange.
 This little speaker packs a punch. Easy to connect with iPhone pause skip and turn volume up and down big easy to use buttons awesome buy
 Sounds awesome, small, perfect for home and office and even camping.
 Love Love Love The Best Product I Purchase 👍🏾👍🏾 You Want Be Disappointed!!
 It was good when it was working. Stopped working after 4 months. Now its just collecting dust and i cant find the contact seller button anywhere on the product page.
 small size but the sound is great
 Really like it so far. I haven't put it through any torture test nor do I. Clean sound for my half deaf ears
 Connects easy, sounds great, good bass. Alexa now has a loud voice in my house. :)
 Good for an average sized living room at the loudest setting.
 Little speaker is really convenient to have and great quality and price
 great sound, and bass for a bluetooth speaker
 I own a Bose Sounlink and I've owned a Klipsch portable player in the past and I can say that this Anker bluetooth speaker beats the pants off both brands. Not only is it louder, but the battery lasts WAY too long. I've owned this for about three weeks now. It sits in a freezing cold garage and it's used every evening for 1 to 2 hours... and the battery life is still 100% according to my iPhone 6S!!
 Item as described with fast shipping. We are quite pleased with this unit and would recommend this product. The sound quality far exceeded our expectations.
 I love this speaker.  Sound is perfect for what I want.  I've been using it since I got it a week ago and the battery is still going strong.  It's easy to turn on and off adjust the volume and to pause.  I love The red color!
 This little speaker has great sound quality and was easy to sync to my phone. I turned it on in my main floor living room and could hear it in my upstairs master bathroom. It's great for taking out to the lake/park/BBQ's etc.
 Love this item, I use it daily and rarely have to charge it. Loud sound!
 Music
 This little speaker is awesome! I was leary of the claim that it would last 24hrs but I have used it at work for 3 days in a row without a charge. It's also loud enough I can here it over my forklift engine.
 I bought this without ever having owned anything Anker. I was pleasantly surprised at the clarity and volume of this speaker. Battery life is excellent, as advertised. I would highly recommend this to anyone needing a small speaker for casual music listening, or for nighttime white noise/nature sound machine.
 Small, portable, holds a charge well, and very decent sound for a small speaker.  It stays in the carrying case on my ATV at all times which means it gets jumbled about quite a bit and yet is holding up really well.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
 Love the speaker. Great sound and very portable.
 For $25 I guess I can't complain. Thin, tinny sounding speaker. Spend a little more and get something better.
 Bought this and the Bose... while this is not quite as good as the Bose, it is nevertheless very good and an excellent value.<br/>Will keep both.
 This is everything you want in a small speaker. Great price, very good sound and easy to set up. I liked it so much, I bought a 2nd one for my wife's computer.
 Great speaker with a great sound that paired up immediately with my samsung tablet. I can take it anywhere in the house and the Bluetooth signal never drops out. I like listening to music on I Heart Radio and this works out just perfect.
 The sound quality on this sleek little speaker is great.  It's a nice small stylish package with a very good sound.  Delivery was on time and as expected.
 Always plugged in and it is close to the dot, so can not say about the time and distance but the sound is great and the design is super.
 Much better than other bluetooth speakers I tried, especially since this was in the mid-thirties.  Includes two 30mm speakers and has decent bass.
 The best Bluetooth speaker I've seen for the price. Long battery life and gets decently loud for its size.
 Loud and cheap.  Just like me in college.
 Awesome!
 I've been having major issues with the anker after the first week of using. I'm on my first replacement speaker and am still having troubles with it not charging. The blue light keeps blinking and won't connect to my phone even though it did when I first got it. Its so frustrating. The sound quality is good and it has great volume but I haven't been able to use the first or the replacement for more than a few days!
 great value, although the user manual leaves a lot to be desired.  sound quALITY IS PRETTY GOOD FOR THE MONEY FOR SURE
 I WAS SO LUCKY TO SEE THIS WORKING AT MY PART TIME JOB. A GIRL BOUGHT IT IN TO PLAY ON HER IPHONE AND THE QUALITY WAS GREAT.  I LOVE IT SO MUCH I BOUGHT THIS ONE TO PLAY NETFLIX ON MY TABLET AND I ENJOY IT . IT HAS HIGH QUALITY SOUND AND I CAN SIT AND WATCH MY MOVIES WITHOUT THOSE EAR PODS STICKING IN MY EARES. PLUS YOU HAD IT IN RED TO MATCH MY TABLET. THANKS SO MUCH. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
 I've had it for about 2 years now. Holds its charge for months on end without use. Even thinking about buy another one as gifts for friends.
 Louder then my soundbar and the battery lasts forever
 This has been my favorite Bluetooth device I've purchased ever! The sound is great and the battery seems to last forever.
 Does not have a 66 ft Bluetooth range... Barely a 10 ft range.
 Great sound, nice price. I was looking at some in the stores and this one sounds as good as ones costing 200. Yes, buy it if your interested in this speaker
 love this speaker! charges for an hour or so and or lasts days at a time.  the sound is incredible,  awesome bass and quality is clear
 A lot louder then it looks,and not that loud rattling but a clear pure sound...I set it up in my kitchen for my cooking and the sound goes straight Threw to my living room...great gift, great individual use you really can’t go wrong
 Very happy with this speaker. Small but packs a good sound.
 Did the job!
 Really nice USB type speaker! This is a replacement for two other branded speakers that I bought in the past. Sounds great, and holds a charge longer than the others too!!
 Ok speaker though not very loud.. Horrible microphone.<br/>Update:<br/>Anker stepped in and sent me a replacement.
 Bought this after seeing a good review video and not disappointed!
 Why do people buy other brands for 3-4 times as much again?? This thing works great!! Glad that I bought it! Oh and I ordered it right around midnight on Monday and it delivered before 2:00pm the following day! BOOM!! Love It!
 Great product. Awesome sound quality easy set up love this. Great quality. Good price.
 Excellent sound quality and battery life is unbelievable good
 Stopped working after a month. Sound quality was lacking as well - a bit muffled.
 Affordable yet powerful.<br/>Get item!<br/>Will buy Anker products again for sure!
 We live overseas, but bought the speaker through Amazon in the US.  We only used it a couple of times before it stopped turning on or holding a charge (not sure what the problem is, only that it won't turn on).
 Works pretty well.  The stereo image isn't very good but it sounds OK.
 Outstanding battery life, easy carrying clear sound.
 Best Bluetooth speaker I've owned. Great sound for it's size, pairs every time, good range. Solid construction and rubber case are perfect.
 Great battery life great sound
 I am very pleased with my Bluetooth banker speaker, so far its doing everything I new it would very well made and the sound is really nice for it's size. If you need a good speaker this is the one, Ed from parma Ohio.
 Bought this for my son and he loves it. Its small with a good sound and loud for its size
 Sound quality is far better than I expected. The reviews were honest and for the price this little speaker cannot be beat. Battery life is the real feature to look at here you will never run out of juice. I have no complaints and if you are looking for a solid functional bluetooth speaker look no further.
 Impressive.
 Doesn't seem to hold a charge for very long. Otherwise serves the purpose for purchase.
 Fantastic speaker. You won’t be sorry you got it.
 It's ok, I guess. But I am using it in a 2012 Jeep Wrangler. The problem I have is the mic. I can hear fine but the person(s) on the other end can't. So I have to yell, which sucks.
 I bought the unit a few weeks ago, and found it very good. After a few days I had some problems with it. I contacted the Anker Support Team, who immediately asked me to return the unit to them, and at the same time they sent me a new unit. It works perfectly now, and i am very happy with the quality. Many thanks to the Anker Support Team for their quick support!
 Great for the money, gets decently loud. Has ok bass for a little speaker, all in all it's worth the money
 works well  fair sound well worth the price easy to set up
 For $26 the sound is amazing. Glad I bought it.
 I searched through many of the Bluetooth speakers sold on Amazon, read through reviews and settled on this one.  Given the price point compared to the others, I am very happy with the product.  The sound quality is exactly what I was looking for and it holds its charge for a long period of time.  I recommend to anyone who wants an affordable, lightweight speaker to use on the go.
 Good little speaker, has great battery life. It's not very loud however, so don't expect to be making parties happen. More of a background music or when you're doing a more quiet activity.
 Nice small speaker with good sound
 This is the best little speaker. I purchased two of them. I am using them with my Echo dots from Amazon, I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend this speaker.
 This speaker is amazing small, light weight, portable and pretty loud for the size. It is a great speaker to have on the go. It is a little bigger than your average cell phone lightweight. Iam just amazed at how small and how powerful it is for portable small speaker. Also I believe it's fairly priced speaker and pretty rugged to.
 This thing has a very full sound, and the battery really does last 24 hours.  Easily paired with multiple devices. Charges quickly.  Anker makes quality products.
 This one has a great sound and volume for the price without any of that tinny sound that other blue tooth speakers have.  Easily connects to all my devices and the charge lasts a long time.
 The sound quality of the speaker is good for its price and its very portable size. I initially received a defective speaker, but the Anker customer service diligently took care of my issue and was very attentive.
 Excellent Product for price point. Performs better then similar products at twice the cost and battery life is superb. Seems to charge quickly and has a sleek and intuitive design.
 Great sound and perfect run time.<br/>Anker product quality is top like always and no I'm not payed by them and I payed full price for this awesome speaker.
 The audio quality is good no distortion. The biggest issue I have is that it really isn’t that loud.
 It's been almost 3 months since I bought this product and let me say IT IS INCREDIBLE.<br/>The sound is amazing, haven't had a problem with distortion and the battery is incredible. My speaker has been running on a single charge since I bought it, haven't had to charge again and I use it almost daily.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this product for anyone looking to buy bluetooth speakers.
 Love this speaker! It's solid, super portable and the sound quality is better than I expected. This was my first purchase of an Anker product but won't be my last. Very impressed!
 This speaker works great and puts out great sound. we just used it for the first time on our camping trip last weekend and it lasted the whole weekend without needing to be charged.
 Great product, my so loves it.  The sound was very good for such a small speaker.
 I liked it enough to give it to my daughter and purchase another.
 Really nice little speaker and sounds great! Holds charge well, easy to connect. For the price I highly recommend it.
 Great speaker for the golf course.
 Great sound - powerful volume - charges pretty quick - battery lasts as good as advertised.
 I purchased this item based on it's reviews and I must say, I'm very impressed. The bass could be a little better, but I'm a bass junky. For the price, this speaker is awesome. It was even commented on by a friend of mine and I got him one for Christmas.
 Battery endurance is insane.  It lasts forever. Sound no complaint so far I can turn the sound way on could have gotten a couple of friend reunions more to a music climax better than the sound system they had
 One of the best BT speakers for the size and price category!!!
 This is such a amazing Bluetooth Speaker. I had bought a Bose a couple of years back for a lot more money. This Anker puts out better quality of sound. I'm not sure how loud it can go as I live in apartment but for what I need it for it's perfect.
 Wife really enjoys it.  She runs it at a fairly low level in her office and only has to recharge it once a week.
 Great product that comes from a great company, Ankers customer service is top notch with their worry free 18 month warranty.<br/><br/>Love the long lasting battery and the sound quality.  Can’t wait to see what Anker comes up with next.
 I listen to audio books frequently so clarity is key and this speaker delivers plus the simple sleek design is a plus.  Works great with my Amazon Alexa.
 Fantastic sound and mobility.  And when the bluetooth connection proved defective after a year's use, I contacted Anker with my order# and they replaced the product with haste.  IMPECCABLE customer service.  Thank you!
 Great sound and I am picky about sound quality. This speaker is used with Alexa in a big room and the sound is crisp.
 Loud sound for such a small package. I tend to find that ANKER products are very well made with quality in mind.
 What a fantastic little speaker!!! Sounds freaking amazing, long battery life, BT 4.0... this was a steal for $25. Very happy with this purchase.
 Great little speakers.
 This is a great speaker, I just wish it went a little bit louder so I could hear it better at highway speeds on my motorcycle.
 Died after a few days, wouldnt reset or turn on.
 Piece of crap. cannot even connect any of our phones. Do not buy it!
 So far, a nice, inexpensive option for listening to music.
 Quality of sound is not the best.
 This speaker is really amazing for the price. I barely have to charge it and I left it out in the rain and it still works!!! Very impressed with the sound quality and its overall performance!
 Best little speaker for a good price. The battery has lasted quite a while without charging.the bluetooth synced instantly with no lag. It's 24 hrs bluetooth and 30 hrs aux port. What I really like is the air tube that serves as a subwoofer, it gives a heavy bass without having to worry about blowing the speaker, and the bass is really heavy lol. The rubberized skeleton looks amazing and feels premium. I got the red and it really pops out with high contrast and luxert. It doesn't say if it's waterproof or not, but I'm pretty sure it is. when I had it outside I was watering my yard and accidently sprayed it with the hose, I took it inside wiped it off and in a couple minutes it started playing music with 0 effort. Also the rubber skeleton worked great for when it fell off of my desk, no damage whatsoever. After buying this speaker I have fallen in love with the anker brand. I will have the confidence of buying more speakers from them.
 decent speaker for the price. not too loud
 wasn't impressed with the sound.  returned it.  Alexa is much better, does more, and for not much more money
 Sounds Great! I really like the long battery life. I haven't tried using is for 24 hrs straight but I have used it several hours a day for several days with no problems. I highly recommend it
 Love this! It connects to my phone and whatever I play through it sounds great!
 Amazing sound for such a small speaker. I am using it with my Amazon ECHO DOT easy to pair up plays music great buy for the price
 Not deep rich sound like Bose mini sound link but does the job otherwise.
 Small speaker. Nice in Blue with a rubber feel to it which adds some water resistance. The sound and volume is pretty good for a speaker of its size and price. Don't expect to much dynamic range from it. The battery life is AMAZING.
 Having a bit of a problem syncing with my "echo", got it synced with my "dot".
 Great product.  I use outside camping, and the garage.  Sounds is clear and volume is higher then a person could use.  I would recomend to anyone.  I have nose one as well and for the money this is the way to go
 We use it all the time.  Very good sound quality.
 Works ok when close to device. Any further than 6 ft away the Bluetooth signal is intermittent. Not a good Bluetooth range at all.
 best speaker ive ever bought. loud and very clear sound
 Just over a year after buying this speaker, it suddenly stopped pairing with any devices. The blue light flashes endlessly, and every device I try to pair with it fails. I have really loved this speaker, and am bummed that it only lasted a year.
 Awesome speaker!! Sounds great and battery last a very long time! Perfect for putting in my toolbox at work and keeping the music on all day at work
 Great product, awesome sound and battery seems to last forever. I only charge because I think it should be low on battery. will be great to be able to have a visual view to know when battery is low. Other than that love it!!
 Last long and sounds great
 I love this little Duhicky, I use it everyday, even my neighbors like it 🤔 or not, lol
 Excellent sound and quality for the price! My wife uses this on a daily basis to increase the speaker volume on her phone while she watches Netflix in the morning. I also use this speaker around the house and in the garage with no problems at all! Overall, great product and would easily take this over any higher-priced equivalent!
 Decent sound but great battery life.
 This a truly an fantastic product for the price asked.<br/>There's just one thing that bugs me, it's the sound it makes from time to time when the speaker is connected with bluetooth, but no music is playing. It "honks" softly and then goes to a very quiet whistle, and then honks again, and the whistle stops.<br/><br/>Other than that, when music or movie is playing, it has good bass, and does its job really good overall.
 Sure did love this little speaker until one day it just completely stopped working for no apparent reason—won’t charge, won’t produce a sound. I thought Anker produced good products but apparently that isn’t true. Bummer.
 This was a fine speaker at first, but over the past two or three months the signal quality has dropped significantly. I can't take it more than a few feet with out the signal losing integrity. This happens with multiple devices. I've used this speaker for home use.
 Doesn't do well pairing with multiple devices. The sound quality is OK though.
 For the price, this is totally worth it! I have a Bose Bluetooth that still works wonderfully but wanted another portable speaker for camping and this is just the ticket! Great sound and quick Bluetooth connectivity. Now time will tell how long it will last.
 The right size love the red.
 Quality stereo. Working fine after 3 months. Nice color.
 Works great!  Sounds better than my mini jambox, that's for sure. 4 stars only because it doesn't seem to have an auto shut off feature.<br/>Otherwise great sound and easy connectivity.
 This is an awesome bluetoorh speaker with really good battery life and great sound! Very satisfied with my purchase!
 Bought this 2 years ago when my other speaker capped out on me. I take this everywhere and haven't had any disappointment, whether I'm camping or on my lobster boat this speaker is by my side
 Works great, sounds decent.
 Works well enough for a bluetooth speaker!
 For the price, good speaker!!! Good sound quality. Good battery life
 Excellent speaker, easy setup, takes time to charge battery. Great sound and last for over 20 hrs.
 I love this speaker !  Works great with my Iphone and was easy to set up.  I would definitely recommend it.
 Great speaker for the money. Sound is very good. I am no audiophile but I do like my music and this speaker is quite good.
 It loud and clear
 This was a very affordable speaker. The battery on this thing is insane. I use it for get togethers and parties at my home.<br/><br/>It connects quickly, has great sound quality, and is very modest.<br/><br/>Love this speaker.
 Absolutely fantastic. I've been in the market for a small (but powerful) portable bluetooth speaker for a while now and was even considering purchasing a Bose or Sonos product but couldn't be happier that I gave this one a try first.  I bought this when it was on sale ($35) and for the money, I don't think anything else could even come close. Very clear, rich, natural sound and it packs quite the punch for its size.
 Nice speaker for the money.  Do your research and then buy this one. You can't go wrong. Great sound quality.
 Excellent quality unit. Audio is terrific. Works great with my iPad Air. Thumbs up!
 Average sound at best. Muddy in the mids, lacking bass and highs. It's cheap, and feels, looks, and sounds like it.
 I've had it for almost two years and I can barely listen to music in it through Bluetooth. It breaks up after about a minute of music playing and I can never listen to more than a couple songs before the music basically stops playing. Its a shame because it was great in the beginning and had amazing sound.
 Great speaker. Great sound. Nice size. Incredible battery life. Raised controls on top allow me to control the unit in the dark when it's on my bedside table at night.
 I'm ordering 2 more! Great speaker!
 Very happy with this one. Anker caught my attention 5 years back, and has done nothing but gain my trust in their products.  Thank you
 Great product. Sounds good and each battery charge plays for a long time. Play times seems to be longer than 50 hours at least.
 its about the best you can do for this price point.  its not going to blow out a $100 speaker but it does well for a smaller area.
 Bought specifically to Link to my Echo Dot to allow listening in other rooms. Linked by Bluetooth with no problems. Good sound quality, simple controls. And got a good lightning deal price.
 It's a small, portable speaker with great sound. I use it around the house, at the beach, and out by the pool. Plus, the warranty from Anker is great. The instant that I had an issue, I contacted the company and they sent a replacement.
 Of all the speakers I've bought for my son, a skater, this is the most toughest speaker yet. It's been able to withstand any damage it's been subjected to.
 Awesome portable bluetooth speakers! Great for the price and quality! Good amount of battery life and brings life to casual parties.
 Holy crap this thing is loud. Small, stylish, seems rugged enough. I like the red.
 great for the price; easy pairing. control buttons a little hard to read, only criticism, a very minor one.
 Given the size, I had my doubts. While it's not as good as a Bose or the Logitech UE Boom, it costs far less and sounds great. My wife likes it because she can listen to music and use it as a speakerphone.
 This speaker is every bit as good as a far more expensive one. Battery life is great,as well as sound. I would recommend it for the money.
 For the price, this has to be one of the best Bluetooth speakers out there. I cannot overstate how solid the battery life is. I have had and used the product frequently for well over a year and have only charged it 5 to 10 times. The range is fantastic and sound quality is good too. Highly recommend!
 It makes sound! Sounds great. Lasts a long time. Connects easily. It makes sound.
 this can last over 24H with a single charge. It performs great for its pice
 I would have rated it a five star, but the USB charging port broke after about a month and now I can't use it. I know my teenage daughter is tough on things but i just can't image it was that fragile. I contacted Anker and they immediately replaced the speaker so i changed this to a five star rating
 The aesthetic of this product is lovely and it feels great in your hands. The sound is amazing, however, it sounds a bit muffled as if something is placed over the speakers. Hopefully that sound will go away once I break it in with a bunch of songs!
 Product broke in less than 30 days.
 Got this on sale, very happy with the quality for the price.<br/><br/>Gets loud, sounds clear, and lasts forever.
 It sounds really nice and loud. Also, the the design of the speaker is very sleek and light-weighted. Easy to connect and disconnect from speaker through bluetooth.
 Product came as described.  Easy to link Bluetooth,  sounds great for a little speaker! Especially for the price!
 This speaker was recommended by my brother.  It works well by blue tooth or hardwired and it has a great sound.
 This speaker is great! It's power battery charge last a long time too!
 Decent sound but no excuse for the visibility of the buttons. Why aren't they a different color?
 For the price you can't beat it.  Almost as good a my Jawbone Jambox and not too far from a Bose soundlink.  A little more bass would be nice.
 Great sounds for small speaker 😉
 This speaker works great. Use it in vehicle while travelling. The sound is nice and clear. Bluetooth connection very easy.
 Seriously good sound. Decent battery life. My girlfriend loves and uses it all the time.
 For a small speaker this little thing has great sound and excellent bass.  Easy to connect to blue tooth.  Great item.
 Good sound. Easy to use.  Anker makes quality stuff, I've only bought USB and SATA gizmos prior, all were good.
 The price was great and the sound is very good. It syncs successfully with my iPhone every time I turn it on.
 nice battery life - small - portable - powerful
 high quality sound from a small device, exactly what i have come to expect from anker
 I listen to music about 2 hours a day and this speakers battery is still at 100%!! I’ve had the anker souncore for about 3 weeks and it’s been amazing. The bass isn’t as powerful as higher end speakers, but the sound is loud, clear, and you can’t beat the price
 It was a gift to my cousin.She loves it.Great sound almost as loud as my bose.
 An excellent speaker for this price. The battery last for a long time.
 I was surprised by how small it was, but was amazed by how good it sounds. Will probably buy another one. GREAT value.
 Kind of amazing how much sound this tiny little speaker puts out.  Obviously it's not going to have tons of bass, but for most genres of music it works quite well.
 This speaker sounds great. It definitely sounds better than other bluetooth speaker twice the price. Great buy. It even sounds better than my Sony sound bar.
 Worked great for exactly one day then became unresponsive. Unit will not respond to any button presses, but still pairs with phones etc. Unit is now stuck 'on' but will not produce sound.
 This is the second one I've bought. Great sound and quality for the price. It's loud and clear sounding with enough bass. My office mate was surprised when i told her how much it was. You can't go wrong with this one.
 Loved the sound on this small speaker! Works great for what I needed it for. Non-skid rubber cover is useful and looks great. Easy set up. Have only had it for a couple weeks so time will tell more but so far so good.
 We bought this little speaker to put in our outdoor gazebo. The sound is great and it is very easy to connect any bluetooth device to. We are very happy with the purchase!
 Best speaker ever with great sound!  I use it every day and have only charged it a couple of times in the several months that I've had it. I wish had this kind of battery in all my devices!
 This is the second Anker product I've bought. After buying their selfie stick and being very impressed with the build quality I was more than comfortable being a return customer for this SoundCore. Once again they have out done themselves. This speaker has great sound with no degrading in quality at full volume and is built to last. I highly recommend this product!
 This "little" speaker packs one heck of a punch. Not only is the sound quality AMAZING for a speaker this size, the build quality is top-notch as well. I would HIGHLY recommend (already have) to friends and family any day.
 Good sound, long lasting battery, blue tooth works as advertised. Excellent buy...
 love this it is the best use it everyday
 Lovie it! Truly amazing small but strong! Worth every penny!
 Sounds awesome for is size
 Great speaker, good sound and perfect for having some music with you wherever you are.
 I really like this well made Bluetooth speaker. I've only had to charge it once since I got it and it connects readily to broadcasting devices via Bluetooth.
 Anker makes good products, the fact that it was by Anker pretty much made up my mind about buying it.  Easy to use, it's loud, sounds good
 Amazing speaker. Been holding true for months.
 Worked great. Not as loud as I hoped, but works great
 Seriously the loudest and best little quality speaker!! I am a teacher and I need a speaker loud enough to be heard by all my students. This little thing is the BEST ever!!!!
 I love this speaker !!! It is so loud and plays very well when I am outside at the park!
 This thing sounds great and is priced right! Easy to use and well made, you can't go wrong with this neat little item!
 It's awesome, battery life is amazing and pairs super easy to Amazon echo dot.
 I am very satisfied, excellent cost-benefit.<br/>Really it works with larger distances than other boxes, not that it is imperative, but when it comes to obstacles in the way the interference is much lower.<br/>I loved
 Just received today at discounted price.  No one is paying me for review.  All I can say is I wish I bought more.  At 30 bucks yikes.  I'm no audiophile,  but this thing is awesome.  Yes,  front facing.  But sound is stellar.  No complaints on peak sound,  because it's too loud at that point.  Picked up on BT easily.  Poweramp worked better than amazon music,  just because of equalizer on Poweramp.  Not sure it's worth original price,  but at 30 bucks,  I am more than happy with product.
 It's blue, it's rubberized, it has great battery life and it sounds wonderful.  I can't compare this to other brands, because I haven't used others.  All I can say is, for the money, the Anker folks put together a nice product.  I recommend fully.
 Best speakers around and the battery lasts forever! The red is a very stylish color and is so hard to miss! Nice and loud for listening to audibooks, podcasts, etc. Sounds crisp and clear.
 Excellent speaker, good sound (especially considering the price, size, and battery life) range I get fron my galaxy s7 is good though at longer distances ~40' it breaks up some (expected).
 Sound quality is pretty good, though it doesn't get very loud. Feels as if there is some sort of speaker protection involved to keep people from blowing them. At full blast sound quality isn't compromised, which is cool, but it doesn't get very loud.
 Speaker sounds great. Easy to pair with my iPhone and amazon dot. Only 4 stars because I called Anker about a charging issue and they didn't send me new charging cable.
 This small Anker Bluetooth speaker is an excellent value. Audio quality is very good, fine tuned.
 I am incredibly impressed with the sound from this speaker.
 Sounds just as good, if not better, than our JBL flip 3.
 Great sound and battery life for a well priced speaker.
 I bought this speaker because my new desktop needed one. I like that it's very clear, but it could be louder. Though there's a weird screeching sound that it makes every once in a while. It may just be because the USPS mailman threw it onto my concrete stairs instead of walking up to my doorstep.
 Superior loud sound and great booming bass! Both my son and daughter loved these as Christmas presents and were very impressed with the sound quality!
 The sound quality on this is great and deal with the pricing. I purchased other Anker items and the quality of the other items made this is a simple decision. Battery life is great, build quality great, &amp; sound is great. Love this item. Gave a couple as Christmas gifts as well and they loved it.
 lasts along time between charges, good sound and product support is fantastic.
 Nice, clean, simple design.  Easy to setup.  Charge lasts a long time as advertised.  This device at max volume is good for a medium-sized room 15'x15'.
 Works great.
 This sounds as good as my JBL flip for less money.
 Love it, new go to 30$ present
 Battery seems to last forever!!!!
 Muy bueno
 Excellent sound quality.  The battery life and Bluetooth range are a real plus. Several friends have tried to steal it :)
 It arrived with anker logo upside down on the speaker :(
 Fantastic little speaker. For the money you really can't complain. I use it primarily for pod casting. Perfect. Shipped to Australia within a week!
 My brother has a SoundBot speaker and I really liked that one, so I was stuck choosing between SoundBot and Anker. I'm glad I paid the extra $10 or so because this speaker is perfect. Even at maximum volume, the sound does not get distorted. The battery life is also way better than the SoundBot speaker. It is small and light, and works well with my phone and my laptop. I would gift this for somebody.
 this this is amazing. its loud enough for small get together.  and you can take you calls on it!!
 Overall I like it...I Iove that I can hook it up to my small TV and great battery life, but I would have liked more bass sound.
 This is an excellent Bluetooth speaker! Sound is clear and good quality, was simple to pair with my phone. I highly recommend you get yourself one!
 Sound quality is good. The battery lasts a LONG TIME.
 Best budget speaker I have!!! People are surprised at the high quality with such a low cost. I'm going to buy a few more as gifts and to have on hand.
 Great sound. Easy to use
 I LOVE this speaker!!<br/><br/>The sound is amazing, it holds a charge FOREVER, and the price can't be beat.<br/><br/>I very highly recommend it
 Exactly what I wanted. Easy syncing with my iPhone, great sound. Would recommend to others.
 Its a cheap speaker, its ok for traveling and being small but its AWFUL for phone calls.
 It was great at first,  but it's already vibrating with sound.
 A co worker recommended.  Works great.  Amazing sound and base
 Was skeptical at first because of the price but this is an amazing speaker. Bass is great, also Bluetooth range goes very far. I had the speaker in my basement Bluetooth connected to my phone and went all the way up to the third floor in my house and it was still playing.
 If just based sound quality this would be a 4 star product, but once we factor in the low price it is clearly deserves a 5 star. As long as you don't compare it to pricier Bose/Sony etc, it will not disappoint.
 Great speaker if you are looking for something simple, yet effective. Very easy and straightforward to use. Doesn't feel/look cheap. Has a nice weight to it. Didnt get 5 stars because I thought the bass could be better. Overall, good product for the size and cost.
 Pretty good speaker for the money only possible downfall would be it isn't loud enough.<br/>Sounds great easy to use
 I absolutely love this speaker, it’s super easy to carry with me everywhere I go . I bought it for work and it is perfect, the sound is nice and it has the perfect bass .  Battery life is good i barley charge it.
 Awesome sound for a small speaker.  Great for filling a small room with sound.  Easy to charge, to connect via BlueTooth.  Extremely simple controls.  Anker has phenomenal customer service:  when I had a problem with charging the unit (despite using a different microUSB cord), they sent a new one to replace it.  Thanks, Anker!
 Sounds great. Works perfectly for listening to music on my motorcycle!
 I was a little skeptical about this product but when I got it I was glad I did.  The sound quality is great and it does have a good bass sound to it for its size!  I love the fact that it is very portable and lightweight
 this prouduct look like of good quality but doesn't conect automatically on any of my devices, if i want to conect  in other device i need  do it manually , that is not funny,<br/>It is assumed that once paired it should always connect with my pc or phone automatically but it does not.<br/>And I need often turn off and on the speakers to be able to connect manually.<br/><br/>I'm not happy anker
 What an amazing value!! Great sound, simple to synchronize... works surprisingly far from source. Love it.
 Plugged it in for 5 days still won’t get charged or hold a charge nor will it even turn on. I was sent a damaged one.... also wasn’t the best speaker I was looking for as well. :/
 Not to be confused with a Bose mini soundlink.  This provides great value, use on my business trips mainly for playing podcasts.  Nice clarity.  Good treble.  Very good value for price.
 I was quite surprised by these speakers. Quite hefty And put out some quality sound for its size.
 Did not connect to Bluetooth easily. Finally threw it away and bought a more expensive one that works great.
 Battery life lasts quite a while and the sound is quite good even at the higher volumes. Definitely recommend it to friends and family at this price point.
 Easy to use.  Sounds great!
 Exceeded my expectations! Close your eyes and you won't believe something so small sounds so good.
 Great speaker at a great price! I was nervous about it being loud enough for me. No worries! Its loud! Louder than the little circle one I replaced! Such a good feeling upgrade!
 This speaker is awesome value for it's money. I bought it for my office while I'm doing computer work and the sound is very good. The battery life is also unbelievably good as it's described. I would recommend this for someone looking for good sound, extended battery life, and good receiving distance for the bluetooth link.
 Love this speaker.  Great value for the price.
 10/10! I thought it would be decent after looking at reviews and $25 isn’t that much to lose if it’s a bad speaker but its incredible! Super crisp and clear sound and has a good amount of bass for such a little speaker. Perfect for around the house or beach days. Highly recommend!
 This speaker is awesome ! It sounds amazing very loud without the volume being turned all the way up and the battery on this thing is really long lasting. I have charged it once since when I first received it and I use it for about an hour or so a day it’s been a month and still haven’t charged it yet highly recommended
 Great sound for the price.  It's small like the Oontz angle and the sound quality is similar.
 So far it’s great
 Great sound from a little speaker. Fills up a room with volume and can be heard well outside. Super small and portable and I'm assuming the battery is great cause haven't gotten it to die yet. Love the feel of it too
 Amazing sound from such a tiny unit. Battery life as advertised. Priced very fairly. Originally recommended by my brother who has a unit.
 Love this speaker.  I previously purchased another brand of speaker and bought this one for another  Echo Dot in our house.  I like the Anker better.
 I bought this item to replace my water-damaged Jambox. So far the Anker has delivered exactly what I need at 1/3 the cost. A very good purchase indeed.
 I know you guys don't know the lay out of my house but my phone was in my bedroom and this speaker still worked in the garage<br/><br/>#nuffsaid
 I really liked the Bose Version but at the time it was selling for 200.00 - wAY TOO MUCH! Then I saw this one and I couldn't believe that it would sound as good for the price but while it might not have as much power and sound quality as Bose, it comes damn close and at 39.00 it was a no brainer.  Its worked fine so far and I expect that I will buying more soon.
 So far this product is great. I've been able to use it for over 5 hours without a charge and still sounds loud and clear. The product and the sound quality is very good. Great for a small or midsize room. Great for the price.
 14 year old son loves this; says it words great with his iphone!
 At maximum volume I am finding it is unable to handle most types of music, but overall the battery life is great and at a moderate volume it has been working great.
 Worked for about 3 hours then no more sound would come out of it. Only reason I gave it two stars is because costumer service is sending me a new one... maybe it will work longer. I didn't drop it or anything it acts like it connects but just no sound even with aux connect.
 It is small and good looking and gave me an easy and economical solution to how to get my music from my phone to my room.
 Solid build, good sound quality with plenty of volume for me. Easy to use.
 This speaker was more than I expected. I bought it at the last minute to use it for a mock audition I was doing for my daughters upcoming dance audition.  My guest were asking, "Where is the music coming from?  That sound is coming from that little thing?" My son ended up taking the speaker for himself and I have not seen it since but I do hear it very well!
 Great little speaker. May purchase another one. Holds a good charge.
 great sound quality for something so small
 We used to take a portable radio on picnics but never guaranteed good reception. This thing works incredibly well sounds incredibly good solid as a rock I've had no problem charging it very satisfied.
 We really enjoy our Anker and haul it everywhere with us.  When doing projects around the house, it's a constant companion.  The sound is really good for it's size.  Portability is excellent!  Our friends love the sound quality, as we do also.
 Constantly loses the Bluetooth connection and cannot reacquire.  This happens on both my PC and iPhone.  I've never had this issue with any other speaker.
 this thing is little but it sounds great. It's priced really good for the money.
 Anker is great. Thank you!
 This is a great little speaker for the price.  I first bought one for myself and once I tried it I bought two more to give to two of my daughters.  I concur with another reviewer who says you get a better bass sound if it is place against a wall.
 Great speakers for a good price. I used these on my Macbook and it works perfect for playing music and watching videos on youtube.
 Excellent speaker long charge life the only thing I am not happy with is you can’t skip to the song ahead
 Battery lasts for ever. I use it on construction sites, fits ina tool bag, lasts all day,
 The battery life on this speaker is phenomenal. I last charged it in May 2017. This speaker has been used for 6-10 hours a week since without ever being charged. The battery just beeped to let me know it was dying. I had never heard that  before. Just put it on charge and look forward to another 9 months of battery life.
 Wow, awesome sound! Battery life last several hours.  Blue tooth range works almost the entire 1st floor of my house. Simple setup, great buy!
 Great unit....good bang for you buck on this item. Well built and great sound. Have it hooked up to my Echo Dot. Paired first time with no issues. Definitely recommend!
 For the price you can't be wrong.<br/>Sounds great, small, with nice feel to it. Over all battery life is crazy long.
 Love the sound, battery duration and price
 Pretty loud and works nicely.
 It's stupid and it lacks a lot. It stopped working after a month. It connected but no sound
 We just connected this speaker to our echo dot on Christmas eve.  We are very happy with it. It was very easy to connect and the sound does a miss job.  Merry Christmas!!
 I got this today paired it up and oh my goodness Love it the sound is fantastic excellent price excellent sound quality and fantastic price 😁👍🏻
 This small speaker has mighty sound. It is compact--great for travel. Paired easily with Echo Dot. Couldn't ask for more. Thanks.
 Great speaker for the price. I was very impressed with the build quality and sound from this little speaker. I definitely recommend this product.
 this is my first time buying an anker product. i have to say i am very satisfied with the quality, the price and the overall design of this speaker. the bluetooth connection is always fast n reliable. the sound is incredible and this little speaker is very loud for its size. overall a great buy.
 great price, surprising sound from such a small device !
 If you are looking for a small speaker, for a great price you have found the right place. The SoundCore is a small speaker, but it fills a small room easily. I did notice a bit of distortion at max volume, but nothing major. The battery life is great, and charge time is maybe around 2 hours. If you want great sound, in a portable package, for a great price you found the product here. The SoundCore comes highly recommended.
 This is advertised as having 24 hours of playtime, but after the initial full charge, I slept with it on for 4 nights (8 hours) as well as played it 2 hours every morning before work for 3 weeks!!  It charges pretty quickly and has a wonderful rich sound!  I'm so glad I chose this speaker and more than happy with its performance!
 Big sound fro the size and price.
 Good sound. Holds charge well
 Love it! The sound is awesome, super crisp. It came to us completely charged and I've used it daily since it arrived...haven't had to recharge yet. Great battery life. Anker products haven't let me down yet.
 Really enjoy this speaker - I use it a lot.  It works exactly as described.
 wonderful, especially for travel
 Like the two other Anker products I have, flawless in every respect. Easy to pair, connect, and control. Great battery.
 Great sound and built well
 I don't often post reviews, but I LOVE my new speaker. I have charged it ONCE since it arrived and while I don't use it for hours on end, I do use it every day. And the battery level is at 90%! And it's been almost THREE weeks! Very happy customer here. Oh, and the sound is great, too!
 Great BT speaker in that price range. Very loud. Battery never runs out! :)
 My first speaker speaker didn't work well but they sent me a new one. The replacement works great :)
 Love this speaker - definitely worth the price. I use it every day and only need to charge it every couple weeks or more. Also gets great distance when your phone isn't directly next to the speaker without interrupting the song. Highly recommend.
 Bought this as a gift for my aunt,<br/>Lovely sound, just as good as a bose, easy for her to use. Nice quality and warranty.
 Easy to connect to via bluetooth and good button controls
 Perfect for my apartment.  Plenty loud and easy to sit anywhere you want.  Rock on!
 Sturdy build, just a little muddy at the limit. Worth it, though.
 Great now that I learned to use it and now have the cable hook ups
 So good for the price.  Don't expect much bass from anything this size.  The battery life is excellent, connects easily to all my Apple products (iPhone 6s, iPad, iPad Mini, Macbook Pro), and takes dropping on driveways with ease.<br/><br/>I compared the sound of it to my friend's <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Cambridge-SoundWorks-OontZ-Angle-3-Next-Generation-Ultra-Portable-Wireless-Bluetooth-Speaker-Louder-Volume-10W-More-Bass-Water-Resistant-Perfect-Speaker-for-Golf-Beach-Shower-Home-Black/dp/B010OYASRG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 Next Generation Ultra Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker : Louder Volume 10W+, More Bass, Water Resistant, Perfect Speaker for Golf, Beach, Shower &amp; Home (Black)</a>.  The Oontz was the same volume, but sounded a bit clearer and had just a touch more bass... and it's water resistant.<br/><br/>The Anker wins for battery life for sure.  One annoyance I have is that I sometimes go to push the power button, but push the bluetooth button instead, which disconnects it from my device and I need to repair the two; no big deal though.
 GREAT speaker. I can't complain about anything - battery life, look of the product, etc etc. Just buy it- you can't go wrong with Anker
 so far, so good (only 4 stars for now, lets see how long it last, battery wise and endurance to traveling). got it quick!<br/>it has a surprisingly great sound for its size, the bass is present and the highs are clear. if fills a room with great undistorted music, well worth more than the purchase price
 Very nice quality and definitely worth the price.  Very long lasting battery and the mic works very well too as speaker phone
 I'm giving this product 2 stars because initially, I loved it. It is a LOUD speaker! I absolutely love the sound of it. I have sensitive ears, but this speaker, unlike others, does not make my ears hurt. Ok, now the reason for 2 stars is that after the first two times I thought it had died because it would not turn on. I had sworn I turned it off when I was done using it. So... after multiple attempts I put it to charge for the 5 hours the manual says. The light came on indicating that it was charging so I was happy. THEN, I attempted to turn it on after the 5 hours. NOTHING. I tried and I tried. AND I TRIED. I looked over at my husband and was like, "LOOK, IT DOESN'T WANT TO TURN ON." And it turned on. WOW! Ironically it turned on at that moment. So I was like ok, maybe I held it down longer? I don't know.. I use this for my computer so I don't use it all the time, but when I feel like watching YouTube or listening to music, I have such a hard time to turn it on. I have reported this to Anker so hopefully they process my refund. Luckily, I have the SoundCore Sport, so I can use that, but I really loved this speaker. So disappointing to have to let it go.
 It’s a fine speaker
 The sound just doesn't compare to JBL.  I purchased a Pulse by JBL and am much happier.  It is good if you don't need to worry about how far the sound carries but I use this in the classroom.
 Use this for my office great sound quality
 Awesome. Good sound clarity and quite loud. I didn’t expect it to be this small, but it is worth it!
 decent sound quality and battery lasts long. im satisfied
 Quality sound. I like the long playing time between charging
 This lasted me almost a month before I even had to charge it. Great sound too. It's a steal for the price at $27.99. Anker is by far my favorite brand for electronics. Quality products at a phenomenal price. They never let me down.
 amazing sound and battery life highly recommended
 I love this product. This is my second and am so happy that I got it at amazing price!!! Can’t wait to enjoy music alllllll over the place
 We have this speaker running off our TV Bluetooth. Not only impressed with the small, sleek and good looking design, but very impressed with the sound quality. We have the TV running every day and into the late hours and have been getting around three days listening time before needing to recharge.
 I'm surprised how loud this sucker gets, and the audio levels are pretty in balance.<br/><br/>Overall, great buy, I'd buy it again too if I need to.
 Good quality and little to no distortion. However, the speaker is not as loud as previously expected, so keep that in mind if that’s important to you.
 Great speaker and range. Works flawlessly with my Echo DOT. Easy to set up, good sound, and portable!
 I bought it for my girlfriend. So far she loved it. Can’t give much in battery life however.
 Great audio quality and battery life!  I like that I can travel with this speaker on vacation trips.
 This speaker goes with me everywhere I travel. Great sound fidelity and good range of volume. The vibrant blue color is aesthetically pleasing and keeps me from overlooking to pack it when i’m ready to go.
 This is a great little speaker. It is smaller than you think, but it sounds larger than it is. It is a great buy.
 Great speaker the only minus are the buttons on the top very hard to find same color as speaker
 Great sound for the money. Not as good as my Bose, but I wanted a less expensive speaker to keep outside in the warmer months for my new screened porch.
 For the gold box deal it is worth it.  Sound isn't as good as the JBL flip or Bose mini sound link in my opinion.  More balanced than the Bose but lacking in bass response.
 This was the perfect addition to my home gym. Battery life is great!<br/><br/>Obviously you aren't going to get the sound quality of more expensive speakers, but this definitely delivers good audio quality and volume.
 Purchased it on sale. Battery really lasts. Fairly small too. Bit expensive at full price
 I paired this with the Echo Dot. Has a great sound. Had no problem getting it set up. Was very easy. I would recommend.
 great volume great sound
 Arrives on time, ez to figure out instructions... simply charge it up, hit the bluetooth button and.. you're in business. Sounds was about as good as one expects for $30. I wanted clean, uninterrupted sound... and I got it. Inside, outside... just makes life a little more enjoyable.
 Purchased as second Bluetooth speaker for girlfriend's bathroom, we both like to listen to music while showering.  Excellent sound for small, inexpensive speaker
 Update - They sent a new one, and this one sounds incredible. Great sound for the price!<br/><br/>The sound crackled at full volume. Returned. Bought the Doss bluetooth speakers for $33, much better option.
 Battery lasts forever! It’s a very nice little speaker.
 Good little speaker for a good price.  Easy to use.
 good sound quality. good speaker but feel like it could be a little louder.<br/>other than that GREAT PRODUCT.
 Great sound and awesome quality
 The sound is very impressive.  I compared it to my Bose Mediamate computer speakers.  The volume of sound was extremely close.  The only difference I noticed was the Bose had a little more deep base.  The only thing that is irritating is that the pause/play button only sometimes works.  I am using it with my Samsung Note 2 with a program called BubblePnP to play audio files.  Battery life is impressive.
 Love it. Long battery live certainly a plus. I use it for hours every day charge once a week.
 Warm, loud, nice travel-friendly shape.  Only wish the controls were not black on black…hard to see at night.  Recommended above the more expensive Anker Premium
 Small and simple but the sounds is pretty great. I use it for several hours a day every day and only need to charge it every two weeks or so which has been awesome.
 Great sound for a small speaker.  Enjoy using it in my garage or on the dock.
 Arrived on Sunday! Before promised. Bought as a gift for girlfriend. Excellent Bluetooth speaker. Very balanced sound. Great range &amp; volume. Easy to use. Very pleased with purchase.
 This Bluetooth speaker are the best get it I like I am using it for my TV because the sound for my TV don't work
 Great value.  Sounds better than I expected it to.  Battery lasts a long time.  No fuss on the setup.<br/><br/>I'm becoming an Anker fan.
 Love it, works great and stays charged. I am very impressed by the product and the company. Thanks
 Great little speaker, high quality fantastic sound quality. Well worth the money
 Great packaging great speaker great warranty great battery life. I would highly recommend to anyone who is shopping for a Bluetooth speaker I was actually quite surprised for how loud it could get while I used it. I haven't noticed any dips in performance so 5 stars from me
 Great little speaker
 Sounds ok for a a small speaker, but when I received it this morning I opened it right away and all in the picture was there except a charging cable or port. I looked at the reviews for this speaker and noticed others got the charging cable in a box saying "Charging cable" but I didn't. WTH.
 Great sound easy to setup and use
 Fantastic product. Great sound quality for a great price! I read 1000 reviews before purchasing and i am not disappointed!
 Powerful little Bluetooth speaker. Well worth the price. Bought one for my son and one for me... my husband now wants one too!
 These ANKER SoundCore bluetooth speakers are OUTSTANDING speakers and I would buy them again!  They charge quickly, pare easily, play 24 hours on a single charge, sound great, up to 66 feet from smartphone or TV!<br/><br/>I highly recommend you buy one or two!  You will not regret it.
 Booming battery, range and quality. Not bass heavy.
 Great sound. I use it to listen to podcasts during workouts. Long battery life and overall high quality in a small form factor.
 Have had it for a while now , speaker sounds great and looks good. This was a great purchase pat a great price.
 It works very well and is very well built.  Good sound quality.  I highly recommend it.
 Loud, proud, and fantastic battery life. Arrived early and is everything they've claimed in their decription. Definitely worth the purchase.
 perfect
 Works perfect wish it was a little louder other than that it’s good quality
 Fast shipping.  I really like the portability of the blue tooth speaker.
 Good speaker. Sound quality and volume are good for its size. Has the commonly used ports and inputs. The buttons on the unit are not too compatible with some apps or devices. Battery is excellent though, so I'll leave it at 5.
 Amazing product with big sound. And the price is well worth it.  My son dropped it like 15 feet and it didn’t even hurt it.
 This little thing sound really well. Perfect for a small office. The battery will last all week on a normal work week.
 I use the speaker everyday for two months and I charged it after 2 months. I use it everyday while I'm inside the shower
 I am very impressed both with the quality of sound and the battery life. I purchased this because the ad said the battery would last 24 hours between charges. I've had this little guy for almost three weeks now and have only charged it once. I use it almost every day. Very impressed. Sound is impressive for such a small package. Money well spent.
 love it.  small unit with descent sounds and incredible price!
 I actually love this! Got an amazon deal and I would like to buy another for 20$ for work
 I like everything. It works with my AmazonEcho dot.
 Light speaker with great volume and medium level of bass. Good for a small or medium open room.
 Great battery life, good sound, we'll finish product.
 Came in at the right time and was very easy to set up. I paired it with my iPhone 7plus and it works beautifully. It’s a good affordable speaker and it’s a good size. The sound works great and I love it!
 Am very happy with this purchase.  Have to admit, it was much, much smaller than I expected but that ended up working better for where I wanted it.  The sound is terrific, including the bass.
 Got this on an Amazon deal but even I didn't this little speaker has amazing sound for its price. You would think this would cost hundreds like a Bose or JBL speaker. The packaging is high quality and so is the craftsmanship. Anker makes amazing products for the cost.
 Long battery life, excellent sound and range!
 Holy crap this speaker is so annoying. It has a annoying loud beep every time an ad plays on Pandora, every time you get a text and non stop when you have Snapchat open. Sounds good but not as good as the oontz angle. Just wanna throw this one out the window I’m so annoyed with it.
 It may not be loud enough for my outdoor use but for the price it's turned out to be great for my indoor use.
 This bluetooth speaker is such a steal! It has great sound and an unbelievable battery life. I like to have ambient sounds in the background to help me fall asleep and it will still be going until I wake up in the morning. This can go on for DAYS! I'm so happy with this product.
 They seem to have an infinity battery life. I switched from my laptop speakers for the bass which they provide in good if not exceptional quality. I've never had any connection problems either.
 I love this product. I use it nightly along with the Relaxio app. The Soundcore worked flawlessly for four months, and then it suddenly wouldn't charge. I emailed Anker's support, and they immediately shipped out a new unit. Two days later, I'm back in business. Wonderful customer support!
 Decent sound for the size. Easy to use. Use it a lot since it's so convenient.
 Love this speaker. Has great sound. Perfect for kitchen cooking (dancing) or blasting tunes in your room. Excellent bang for the buck
 Great speaker with awesome sound. I am an evening custodian and I rock all night long with this wireless speaker. I have yet to run out of power and it has really good range for a B/T speaker in this price range. Definitely would recommend to anyone that needs a speaker like this.
 I have 3 in the house, in various rooms and the garage. Small but very good sound for the size. Charge lasts well too.
 Pretty solid Bluetooth speaker with superb battery life. Sound is decent, not heavy with bass.
 So easy to use !
 This speaker packs a powerful punch in a little package.  You cannot go wrong with this choice for price and performance. It is rated very high in the under $50 speaker choices and it was everything as advertised.
 This little speaker is full of power! It has a great sound for such a low price!
 Very excellent.  I was amazed at how easy it was to set up and plays well.
 Started with losing Bluetooth range and connection, now won’t connect.  Don’t recommend
 Great sound! Once I figured out how to turn it on!! U have to hold down the power till it makes a beeping noise. Really great volume.
 This happens to be a very good speaker ! It's very loud and the bass is good . Not even that heavy too. I would give it 5 starts but the connection to my phone is a slight inconvenience. There's no trouble pairing to your phone, but when I step onto another room the connection seems to get disrupted and the room isn't even that far away from the speaker. The solution to that is that I just keep my phone near the speaker
 Sounds great. And it is so handy to use at work or anywhere. No problems pairings, so easy to use. Only thing I could suggest would be a longer charge cord.
 working very well. Good for traveling
 I BOUGHT THIS SPEAKER CAUSE IT SEZ IT HAS A 60 FOOT RANGE.I COULD BARLEY GET 40 .HOWEVER IN MY HOUSE THERE IS A LOTS OF ROOMS SO I FOUND OUT LATER THAT THE 60 FEET IS BASED ON A BIG ROOM WITH NO WALLS..ONE THING I MUST SAY,THE SOUND FROM THIS SPEAKER IS THE BEST I HAD EVER HEARD FROM A SPEAKER THIS SIZE .I RETURN IT ONLY CAUSE I NEEDED THE RANGE  AND I ALREADY HAVE A BLUE TOOTH SPEAKER OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE KEEP IT..
 Great sound and plenty of volume. Love it.
 Great for price.
 Good customer service,<br/>I had a problem with the speaker I received earlier after I used it for two months, Anker has reached out to me and replaced the speaker and followed up several times. And the new speaker I received works well. Alexa and an Anker speaker are a good combination.
 I am a professional audio engineer and I am always usually so skeptical about speakers (especially ones at such a steal like this one) but I am beyond happy with the purchase. It delivers great sound at nice even range and lasts forever, the range is superb and it's travel sized. Oh and just in case you are wondering it does have an aux cord input hole. You won't be dissapointed.
 As a once audiophile I am quite impressed with this little speaker's sound.  At this size, who could ask for more?
 Very impressed with this product. Clean sound with surprising volume. Well made and supported. Will be buying morw Anker products.
 Great sound at a very nice price.  Better than i expected and pairing was a breeze.  For the price i recommend
 Anker products are great! This speaker did not disappoint. Paired right up with my mobile device and Amazon Echo.
 I'm very impressed with this little speaker! It rivals more expensive speakers and beats out other speakers in it's price range.
 It was a gift, my son loves it!
 I was playing music in the shower with my speakers and it suddenly went off! It did not fall, it wasn't submerged in water. It just went off. It never came back on again. I couldn't even use it with an aux cord! Very disappointing.
 Got it, super easy set up, pulled it out of the box, pushed power button, connected to blue tooth and it is fabulous.  Love this, will be buying more!!
 defectuoso
 Excellent sound quality, the battery life is something beyond any expectation.<br/><br/> Thanks ANKER.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend it.
 A bit too bass-heavy for my taste, but can't really complain at this price, I guess. Amazing battery life, and nice design for the most part. I wish they didn't print ANKER in big white letters at the front of the speaker, and that the blue LED was positioned a little better. But these are just nitpickings. Satisfied with the product.
 Me agrada por su durabilidad de la batería con uso continuo
 Great sound quality, battery lasts long, no issues at all!
 Bad bluetooth signal, whatever I play on my laptop or xperia smartphone has constant delays and interruptions. Works well with a cable, buy hey - this is a bluetooth speaker.<br/><br/>Don't like this product
 Works flawlessly and sounds awesome
 I love this little speaker! I use it at home, in my office, and can take it anywhere. I actually bought a second one in case I ever lose the first!
 This thing is awesome and well above worth the price!! Sound quality is great! Also battery life is amazing.
 Excellent for travel nice sound perfect for a hotel room or beach.
 Very good speaker. Great for when I'm cleaning houses.
 The only thing is I wish it were water proof, it's small in size but its really loud for its size, sounds great!!
 This is a great little speaker with a big sound
 love it
 Sometimes the Bluetooth connections get finicky while switching between devices. Great battery life.
 Works great. Not crazy loud. But it’s for when I’m working out at home. Good for the price.
 This my second one. It has decent volume for a small, inexpensive speaker. It's nice and compact,  but sturdy construction. For the price, it's awesome!
 very pleased with this speaker sound is great no distortion have always found anger products to be good  and their service dept. is very good too
 Wonderful product
 It was a present and she let me know she is loving the sound quality and how easy was to pair with her iPhone. Small, nice looking.
 Long lasting charge and great sound.
 Very good sound. wifi connection is sporadic sometimes but connected if you give time to settle.
 Out of the box, this speaker was way smaller than i had imagined. When we plugged it in, it's size didnt matter.  It filled the room with sound!
 Anker doesn't seem to be able to make a mistake.  So far I've been positively impressed by all of the Anker products that I've purchased.
 Well i bought this speaker on Saturday I got Monday I'm i open it put it on the charger  to charge but when it was done charging it was not turning on
 Sounds clear, well built. The red I received is so pretty! Love it. I highly recommend this speaker. Work great
 I like it
 Solid sound, each to use, battery life seems fine. It's a nice addition to my singer-songwriter work area.
 The speaker came perfectly boxed. The battery life is pretty amazing helps me get thru a day of work love the color and love the sound quality I expect a little bit loader but still gets the job done
 Great speaker. Loud and works well. Every one at my moms wants to take it from my son.
 The sound for the money on this speaker is great! It's got loud volume with no distortion. It's not super bassy, but for the money u can't complain. I love that I can hold a phone conversation through it as well and that the music picks back up where it left off when the call is over. All-in-all, WELL worth the money!!
 Not thrilled. Would not buy this again. Wish I had returned it.b
 A high quality speaker that lighweight but powerful! It fills up a whole room, I've been wanting to try it outside for our next tailgate to see how it works there. But I have no issues with it, and it looks and sounds great!
 Amazing sound quality. Amazing battery life. Amazing product!
 I bought this speaker as a replacement for my last BT speaker (it died when it fell into the sink at work), and needed a new one fas, so i searched on here for a cheap yet good speaker and have to say I'm more than happy with it.
 Perfect for the price.
 Money well spent
 Great value and sound for the price!
 Great product sounds very clear and loud, long lasting battery but only thing is the pause button doesnt really function sometimes it pauses and sometimes it doesn’t but highly recommend this speaker.
 Best Bluetooth speaker I have ever had!!!  Started vacation on Saturday and still got my strong Thursday with no charge after the first charge and amazing volume and good music!!!
 Great product at a great price.  Sound quality isn't like more expensive models, but it's good enough for general daily use.
 Decent sound quality, adequate volume, great bluetooth range, comprehensive track controls and amazing battery life. Also slim enough to stuff into a backpack. Couldn't be happier.
 The sound is terrific.  The only draw back is that you can not see the controls because they are in black too.
 Not a good battery life at all. Very low volume, but good for a small room.
 Love the sound  quality and the battery last so long. I love the material it is made of as. Especially because i am clumsy and always dropping things.
 I have had this speaker for a couple of months now and so pleased with it.  The sound is magnificent.  Will buy again.
 Nice sound, love it. Just can't set it directly on cement patio-it cuts in and out
 For the price this is an awesome speaker. It rivals the $200.00 Bose speakers my children own. Plus I have dropped it two or tbree times onto tile and it still works exacly the same.
 I use this speaker outside as I work on my car. It has a great sound for its tiny size. The battery life is great. Its one of the best items I have bought in a long time.
 Very nice quality speaker.
 A great small portable Bluetooth speaker. Battery is fantastic too. The sound quality is great from such a compact resonably priced speaker.
 the bluetooth stopped working on it within a week my daughter can’t use her speaker anymore ..HORRBILE BUY
 It works great in my room.
 Sounds great for the size, and has good blue tooth range (not 60'... why I dropped it to 4 stars since they don't meet their claim).  A great small speaker!
 Rich, full sound and easy to pair with your device.  Get the hard case to go with it and keep it safe for travel.
 I'm very pleased with the sound and the battery life. The size makes it easily portable.
 It's nice and small with a clean matte finish design. I really like it. Packs a punch. I would recommend it. They should make a water resistant one.
 This thing is awesome.  We camp on the beach and needed a device that would last and charge fast.  This, we call it our brick, works as intended.  It has enough sound to fill our camp site without blaring out the neighbors although it could.  I definitely recomend.
 It's been over a year and I still love it. I take it literally everywhere.
 I've had this speaker for about half a year and it works as expected. It has decent sound quality and battery life, and is pretty durable, compact and lightweight. If you need a basic speaker, get this.
 love it from day one
 Where do I begin, great looking product. When I can get sound out of it sounds great.<br/>What I take issue with is ergonomically the Andre speaker is fundamentally, retarded!<br/>It's cool liking well built but cannot tie its own shoes a redesign is recommended.<br/>From wher the power and input cords live to the switches that operate its functions.<br/>And above all else when it attaches via BT stop flashing.
 great sound for a smaller speaker!
 Amazing. GREAT battery life and decent sound for a cheap Bluetooth speaker.
 Happy so far. Outperforms JBL I have.
 What a powerful little speaker. I did a lot of research on the reviews of many types and decided on the ANKER. Glad I did and i am very happy!!
 Unfortunately, I've had two Soundcore's and had the same problem with both of them. The problem is that the AUX port does not work, or at least it didn't work for me. The first was returned directly to Anker, as they sent me an email asking me to review or give my opinion of their product. I explained to them that the speaker works but the AUX port did not. They sent me a label to return it directly to them and they would send another out as soon as I sent the defective unit back. Anker did just that and I received my new Soundcore. Guess what? The AUX port didn't work on this one either, so I contacted customer service. I didn't hear any response from them for 3 days after I first contacted them, so I took matters into my own hands and just sent the defective 2nd unit back to Amazon for a refund. I'll look into another brand next time.Obviously, they never checked the unit they sent me to see if the port functioned or not.<br/>If you're not worried about the AUX port working on yours, then maybe you'll be ok with it. However, I needed to be able to have a functioning port.
 Maybe it was a bad unit but any podcast or song i tried sounded distorted or muffled.
 Purchased this for a girlfriend and she loved it!<br/>For its size, the sound was amazing!
 it is great than My thought!
 Sound is very good, more than I expected. Size is smaller than expected. I didn't rate it  a five star because of speaker covering leaves fingerprints. I was disappointed sbout this.
 This speaker worked really well. Connected easily to phone and good sound. Then recently started to turn on and off all by itself, even when not connected to phone. **But customer service is AWESOME! Contacted Anker and they immediately resolved the problem and sent a replacement.
 Been eyeballing this for over a year now, and I'm so glad I got it. I used to sell the bose soundlink mini 2's at work, and I honestly prefer this speaker. It is deceptively loud and high quality compared to its size.
 great
 I am disappointed about this product, the 1st one stop working after 1 month, 2nd one doesn't work after 10 months, the blue tooth doesn't work any more, only wired working.  The quality is not good.
 Doesn't sound the greatest.  A bit tin-can ish.  It's loud enough, and portable.  So it works for me in situations where I want to have a portable speaker that I don't care much about.  I won't buy this model again when this one kicks the bucket.
 Perfect portable Bluetooth speaker. Works great.
 Really impressed with this.  Good sound for the price. Nice compact size makes it easy to take with you anywhere. Battery lasts quite a longe time.
 Love this little speaker!  We mostly listen to music an hour or so each evening...and this speaker will stay charged for days at that rate.
 It definitely gives what I expect in reference to sound and battery life.  I would buy again.  I've had this about a year and a half and still works great.
 Great sound,very handy
 Love this speaker.  She it with our Kindle Fire.
 LOUD!! Way louder than I expected it to be which is a nice bonus.
 great volume great sound
 Very happy with this little speaker.  I am so glad I relied on all the reviews others have made, praising its sound quality, its packaging and how well made it seems to be.  I agree on all points.  I just wanted to point out that the main negative I read about was the lack of bass tones - and I have not found it to be a complaint for me.  I was happy that when playing music with a lot of bass, it still sounds good, it just doesn't deliver a deep rich bass tone.  It is also very easy to use, and connects easily to a variety of bluetooth devices.  AND it works great for talking on the phone.  I can talk on the phone using this while doing dishes, and the sound coming out is loud enough, and the mic strong enough to easily hold a conversation.<br/><br/>UPDATE: This unit stopped working only two weeks after I received it.  It just won't turn on even though its fully charged.  It was good while it lasted!!  I returned it to amazon for a refund.  I was then was contacted by Anker who offered to send me a new unit for free since the one I bought was defective.  They sent me a new one, and the new unit works just fine.
 Line input stopped working after it dropped from table.
 Outstanding sound for such a small unit.  Bought to permanently be connected to a small TV in place of its terrible speakers.  Volume fills a large kitchen and is controlled by the TV remote.  Just bought a second one for portable tablet use.
 My first Bluetooth speaker purchase. Sound quality is surprisingly good for it’s size.
 So far this speaker works and sounds great!
 These are great.  I've got two of them now.  Solid sound, good battery life, what I've come to expect from a Anker product.
 Nice price point
 The speaker stopped working and will no longer turn on.<br/><br/>Edit: the company was kind enough to send a replacement and has been working fine for several months.
 Great speaker, works well with my itables
 Awesome.  Great battery life.  Big sounds
 good music sound
 Daughter uses it all the time.
 Very happy with the Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker. It was very easy to set up and the sound is wonderful .I also purchased the carrying case to keep it dust free while not in use. I wanted a speaker below $50.00 and after reading many reviews with many companies I am glad I decided on this particular Anker product. I particularly liked the 18 month warranty and the speaker's battery life between chargings.
 no wonder this device has received such great reviews. Just received mine today - for the size and price I think it is amazing
 Just received this product packaged beautifully charged it up fully turned it on paired right up with my smart phone sound is great!
 Was very upset when my old Bluetooth speaker finally stopped working. I looked forever to find one just like it, but no luck. I ordered this one and do not regret it one bit. This speaker is even better than the other one I had. Very good, clear sound. Would buy this again without hesitation!!!!
 For the price, this is a great speaker. I purchased it for use in my camper. It works perfect outside. Nice clean sound and plenty loud enough for everyone to enjoy.
 I had a Bose and this puts them to shame on price, Sound is amazing!
 Okay, speaker that doesn't have much bass and it's highs are a little too high.
 The speaker is great overall but after a short time the speakers just stop working the battery is good the light is on but won't turn on not even the sound . hope to get this fixed
 I charged this once for months ago and I've used ten percent of the battery. Truly amazing. It's loud, it's cute, it's the best.
 Best speaker my kids have gotten. It's got a nice  clear loud sound. Even when they play music with bass, it sounds great.
 Not too bad, and very easy to use. Not a lot of bass though. I was quite surprised by how small it was.
 I am using this as a speaker to Skype with friends and listen to music.  It works great and looks great!
 Excellent product!
 Slim design, easy to clean (when I take it to work), the battery plays for a long time.<br/>Love the red exterior.<br/><br/>I bought this after borrowing my friend’s Anker speaker - I think a model before mine. It came highly rated by him as well as other reviews.<br/>I haven’t been disappointed yet.
 Works great
 My daughter  lent me hers, and I was impressed enough i went to Amazon and bought  one, same day. Great product, easy to use, exceptional  sound.
 excellent
 Arrived today guys USPS. Sounds really great, would give 5 stars but the micro USB port seems to be defective, I've tried several charging cables and they keep falling out of the port, none will stay connected.
 Precio
 Love this! Bought it for my mom (75 years old) to listen to music off of her IPhone. She has been listening to Christmas music all day and really enjoying it. Highly recommend.
 I am very disappointed with the sound quality of the speaker , it's totally lack of bass , now I don't know what to do. Can I return it and get a full refund ?
 I love this speaker. I use it to listen to music while at work (office setting). I generally leave it on streaming music 7-8 hours a day. I've been using it for almost 2 full weeks on one charge! I do have the volume pretty low normally. However, this speaker will pump out some sound. Case is sturdy and feels like a quality product. My only complaint is while powering off and on the sound is quite loud. This is not so desired in an office setting. Otherwise 5 stars, pleased.
 Awesome little Bluetooth speakers.  We purchased 2 of these for birthday gifts and they were a HUGE hit.  Sound quality is amazing!!
 Not really louder than the smaller version but cleaner sound.
 Kinda crappy.  Difficult (sometimes impossible) to pair. Have tried with multiple iPhones and iPad.  The range is very short so you have to keep your device very close to thre speaker or it gets choppy / stops working.  Bad investment.
 Great affordable bluetooth speaker. The speaker sounds great. The battery lasts seemingly forever!<br/><br/>I personally don't like the button design on this speaker. The real buttons are hidden under the rubber casing. It takes a long to time to turn on when I press the power button. It can take a few tries sometimes.
 Its the second ANKER SPEAKER I own. Its amazing sound is so crisp and clear with such a surprising amount of BASS!!!
 Sweet Bluetooth speaker at great price. Don't spend more on less quality. So impressed I've purchased other Anker products when available.
 Was quiet with no bass
 I purchased this speaker to use with my laptop when I work on my online classes and watch Netflix. I wasn't 100% satisfied with the sound quality. The company contacted me and sent me the Soundcore 2 speaker! Excellent customer service.
 Great product.  Will order again
 For the size it has a very good sound. I’m not sorry I bought it.
 Bought these at the beginning of the semester as a treat yoself sort of thing. They've worked really well so far and they create a pretty impressive sound while being small enough to carry in my bag.
 I love this speaker. It's a convenient size and has a really nice feel to it. The build quality is very impressive. I've had this thing for months using it a couple times a week and I can't kill the battery!! It just won't die. It's starting to freak me out.
 This is the best little speaker on the market!!<br/>Great volume...Connects easily.. Long Battery Life... Great Speaker!!
 Great sound quality and battery life.
 Bought as a birthday gift for my son and he LOVES the quality of the sound and the range.
 I initially had a problem in pairing with my Echo Dot, but support quickly walked me through it and it's now paired and working fine.  The sound quality is very good for such a small unit.
 I use this product in my car, worked great for a couple months, then just stopped working and can not be charged.
 Cool speaker, good quality.
 This little speaker has good sound and lasts for hours.
 Im so glad that all the reviews where spot on. This Bluetooth speakers are amazing! Im very happy I purchased it.
 Lasts about 2 nights on 1 charge.  I bring it on vacation for white noise music.  It packs well and sounds good.
 I love it, but wished the directions were bigger and more complete.  It took me a while to get it synced up.
 Very good sounding, compact portable speaker.  I really love the "memory" function where it remembers my devices.
 Awesome battery life!! The sound is pretty decent, not great quality but fairly loud and with approx half volume it will run for almost a day !!
 Works great, nice sound and battery life is good
 This thing is amazing for the money it's very small sounds fantastic easy to set up get it
 Sounds very good
 Great sound, volume, and one charge lasts a long time! I'm impressed with this especially for the price!
 Incredible sound from such a tiny package. SO easy to set up and pair. Perfect little speaker for the price!
 Great lil device, pairs super quick. Great battery life. Yes you will find speakers with a richer sound, but this is totally fine for the average person. Unbox Therapy was right.
 Sounds good and clear but a bit light on the low end.
 Amazing sound for such a small, compact and inexpensive piece of hardware.  Very pleased and would highly recommend.  Synchs seamlessly with multiple devices.
 It is compact but delivers huge sound. I can hear it all around my 1000 sq ft place, even when volume is not full blast. I researched a lot of speakers before purchasing this one, and for the money, the great quality of this one can't be beat.
 Excellent Bluetooth speaker.  The battery life is amazing, the sound quality is great, and it's easy to use.  Highly recommend.
 Mine had a problem and Anker emailed me many times really fast trying to work out a solution to get another soundbar. Really happy and impressed, and i like their products.
 very happy. Play music from my Iphone and it just keeps on playing.  Good sound.
 Small and convenient, has good sound.
 So far very pleased with the Anker and great sound for audio books
 For the size of the speaker it has a great sound
 I bought one of these for a Christmas present for my son. Had to check it out before I gave it to him and what would you know this speaker rocks for its size. Ended up I kept it for myself! It's nice in an older truck without a stereo, great in the garage or just around the house. I felt bad that I feel in love with it so I ended up ordering another one, my son loves it too!
 Has quality sound. Gets pretty loud if u turn the volume on your paired device up on addition to the speaker.  Easy to travel. Nice price.
 Great sound in a portable package. Respectable bass and the clarity of the higher registers of sound is impressive. The battery life is second to none in the current market which allows for more flexibility during the day.
 Works well.<br/>Sound volume is really good for such a small speaker.<br/>Sound quality is good.<br/><br/>To my surprise, the built in speakerphone works really well!
 I wish it were louder
 I used this speaker for a few days and then couldn't get it to connect to my devices. Anker immediately responded with the solution and offered to send me a new speaker if their suggestions didn't work. No connection problem now and I am very happy it! Thank you Anker!
 I use this in my bedroom and living room. I think the sound is great. Battery life is incredible. I highly recommend this speaker and I'm thinking of buying another one.
 The charging port goes bad in less than two years. Customer service won't do anything. It was a great speaker until this. It seems like this is a major issue.
 Outstanding  sound quality and features and really nice looking, I only don't like the Anker letters in the front
 Nice Bluetooth speaker. I have used it quite a few times and have not had to charge it yet.<br/>Great Anker quality.
 Connects to my phone instantly.  Not as loud as some others, but this unit's battery life trumps them all.  The sound is quite good, too.
 Ok so I had originally given this product a bad review because the Bluetooth range was not as advertised. I was completely wrong though, the reason was because my phone was older (iPhone 6). If you have al older phone the range is not going to be very good. I just upgraded to iPhone 7 yesterday and the range is really good. The sound quality is and has always been very good.
 Love it so far. Great battery life, and easily connects to my phone.
 unbelievably good sound and battery life from such a small speaker.  Also better base than expected. I listened to the speaker all week at work, and haven't needed to charge it yet.
 Loud and awesome quality.  Best for the $
 This a great mini sound bar that packs the power of I standard size sound bar. It also does lasts for days as described.<br/><br/>My only issue with the speaker is that the charging port became worn out within 2 weeks. Therefore I have to put the charger in at an angle and then press it up against an object in order to keep the charger in the charging port.
 Worked perfectly right out of the box.  Simple design. Nothing to learn if you are familiar with Bluetooth.  I have other Anker products and I am impressed with the quality.
 Great sound in a small package. Plays a long time between charges. Excellent bang for the buck!
 Love this speaker. It is everything and more that I hoped it would be. It sounds as good as my Bose tabletop AM/FM CD radio. Great price and I would buy again for gifts.
 I loved this speaker! Bought it for my son for Christmas. We actually had to turn it down. Hes very pleased with his speaker as i was with the price!
 Sounds great
 Good, clear sound, and not too big.  Great for someone who needs a speaker for presentations but doesn't want bulk.
 Works great!  Used it outside at a birthday party and we could here it very well.
 Love it! I used it in my truck on a 3k mile trip. It always delivered great sound and still working on the original charge!
 Great sound, easy pairing, seems to work with every device we've tried so far. Especially for the price, this is a great speaker.
 Easy Bluetooth connectivity and good range, good sound but poor bass.
 Great Bluetooth speaker!!
 I use the sound bar at my job I'm a diesel mechanic and this bar can be heard over the loud noise of diesel engine running. Can go up to 50ft away from my cell phone with the sound bar and it still picks up and sounds 👍
 We own two. It's no Bose, but I'm not listening to anything like a symphony or opera either.
 Love it !!!
 This is a real surprise. For the cost, it has a great sound. I intend to use it with my laptop when showing clients a DVD or video.
 I'm a big fan of Anker and have several of their products. However, this speaker is a bit of a disappointment. It worked great for the first couple days, but then it started skipping- the sound just keeps dropping out.<br/><br/>I was really looking forward to using this speaker, but there's just no point if it can't maintain steady sound.<br/><br/>ETA: A representative from Anker reached out to me to offer solutions to the problem and replace the unit if those suggestions didn't work, and followed up a couple days later. As it turns out, I didn't even need those suggestions because the next time I used the speaker, it was fine. Since then, it's become my favorite tech purchase as of late. It's easy to connect and disconnect to different sources, the sound quality is great, and it's so easy to use. It's perfect for my 1-bedroom apartment, but also easy to carry around with my when I'm on the go. I've recommended this speaker to all of my friends and even bought one as a gift!<br/><br/>I do wish that it came with a carrying case, but it's easy to buy one on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D4BY2SC/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1
 this is an awesome speaker! 24 hour battery life is awesome. very clear, with some bass but not a lot. overall, this is a steal compared to those expensive speakers which i would say has nearly the same quality
 Great sound, easy setup and can't beat the price.
 Truly easy to use and sounds great
 By far the best speaker around for the price!!  It's loud and crisps highs and deep lows!  Perfect for any situation!  I put Velcro on the bottom of mine and mounted it on the dash of my truck. $45 Bluetooth speaker DIY
 Bought 3 in different colors for my daughters this Mother's day who are all mothers. They made a perfect gift and the girls loved the color, ease of connect to the speaker, and the sound.
 I love this speaker. It's very cheap especially considering the quality sound it resonates. I would definitely recommend this rather than spending $200 on a speaker that sounds the same.
 Great little speaker. Great sounds for it's size and easy to pair up with everything I tried it with. Well worth the price
 The battery life is amazing  - as advertised.  The sound quality is a little lacking, especially the bass.  Since they advertised the "spiral base port" I figured it would be better than it was.  I really didn't test the range at which the Bluetooth connection works, but I haven't had any complaints about that.  Overall, for the price, it's a good little speaker, but if you value a more full sound, you might should go for a more expensive option.
 Bought this for my husband to take to work for his forklift. He absolutely LOVES it! Great sound and long battery life. Highly recommend!
 Not as good as I expected. I listened to a soundcore mini and was fascinated by the clarity and bass. This is louder but the audio is not as clean and the sound core mini packs more bass. I'm truly disappointed
 This was my second purchase to use as a speaker for my satellite radio/blue tooth. My first I use with Alexa.
 Awesome sound from a tiny package
 I love this device! I use it in a large, open area  classroom and it’s splendid. I misplaced the charge cable, called support today and they kindly are sending me a replacement at no cost! 👏🏼👏🏼
 Here we have yet another awesome Anker product and an even more awesome price. It was smaller than I thought it was going to be, but still very loud. The receiver is also very good, it picked up my from through two walls in my house! Very easy to use, also.
 I BOUGHT ONE AND NOW THERE ARE SEVEN IN THE MAIN KITCHEN!!! I DESERVE A CUT!!!!! AIHEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!ALL SENT TO ORANGE OR VINTON!!
 Great Speakers. Loud enough for me to listen to podcasts and music while on my daily commutes.
 Accidentally ran it over with my car and it still works like a champ, pretty loud
 Surprisingly loud, love the portability. Only tried it twice so hopefully will hold up!
 Very easy to connect to bluetooth/my phone. Very loud and very portable!! Amazing product and would buy again as a gift.
 Great sound quality for the size and price. Also, the charge lasts forever.
 Like is small and easy to carry...but not loud enough but is okay!
 Beautiful band! I love the look of the band I purchased in silver. It looks so much better than the band it came with. Strong closures as well. A total score!
 Sounds good, no issues here.
 Love it just wished it was louder.
 This speaker is amazing. I have had it for almost  5 months now and I use it almost everyday. In these past 5 months I've had to charge it maybe 3 times. The battery life is absolutely amazing and the sound is great for the price. Highly recommend this prodcut
 Seams to be very good quality and sound, so far the best Bluetooth speaker I have ever bought, very satisfied with the purchase.
 Excellent speaker for the price.  Sounds great!
 This is a great little Bluetooth speaker, and so cheap! I replaced an aging and ornery Jawbone Big Jambox with this and couldn't be happier. Compact, light, works great. Unlike the Big Jambox, it doesn't make a LOUD ANNOYING sound every time you push a button; it is silent.<br/><br/>I bought this to listen to audiobooks, and the timbre of the sound is perfect for that. I deliberately got this model rather than the newer "2" model because the newer model boasted more bass, and I don't want more bass for listening to audiobooks. My Big Jambox was way too bass-heavy for audiobooks; this one is just right.<br/><br/>The range is super and it seems really tolerant of me doing things like walking away from it to the other end of the house with my phone in my pocket for a while and coming back. My old Big Jambox would start making a pitiful weepy sound if I walked away, and within just a few minutes would give up and turn itself off. The Anker just hangs out quietly until I come back in range.<br/><br/>I can't speak to longevity since I've only had it a week or so, but so far I am VERY happy.
 Excellent product !! I love it, I do recommended. I will buy it again.
 Another great product from anker<br/>Very good and deep sound, amazing battery life, compact and for this price is just amazing.
 Would have given 5 stars for sound but could use a bit more bass. But, for the money it's great. Yes we would buy again and yes we would recommend to a friend.
 arrived on time, great speaker, very pleased with overall product
 Awesome for price and quality, I take this everywhere with me. Bathroom, Kitchen and even in my car because of its cool hands-free feature.
 I bought this speaker for my car with apprehension, because I love my music loud and bluetooth speakers usually do not do well in cars. This speaker has gone above my expectations. The sound quality is amazing on either low or high volume. I only wish it could be really loud, but no complaints just my preference
 battery life is great!  just needs a bit more base, and usb c
 Good sound quality and range. Easy to set up.
 works great
 Hey guys, since I bought the speaker it has a Bluetooth problem. The speaker itself is great, the sound is decent, but the Bluetooth connection is very weak. If i move the speaker 3/5 meters away it stops playing the song. I tried different devices and it happens all the time. Can you please help me? Thanks!<br/><br/>Btw. I bought 2 speakers form you. Only one of them has the problem.
 This product is really nice and have been using it for a couple of months. It had retained most if not all of sound quality. It has had normal wear and tear, but it still works perfectly.
 Really good service, sound construction, packaging and quality. Going to order another for a different location
 Never received.. however this would be my second speaker or would of been. The first one works great.
 It’s looks great, it’s small, has a little weight to it and the battery last a while. It’s just not loud enough for me.
 Great sound!! This is equal to our Bose. Excellent product with excellent sound! Thinking of getting another one for a friend.
 Great sound!
 Not enough volume.
 I thought the bass was going to be as good as a JBL speaker but it was ehh.. over all the speaker is loud so I actually like it!
 This little speaker works some magic!  It connects easily to my phone and has clear sound that fills up a room nicely.  Whether I am using it to listen to podcasts while doing chores or playing some soft music for my students as they test, it does its job.
 I got it for my son for Christmas. He really likes it--and so do I which is why I borrow it all the time.
 Great speaker. Unbelievably loud for how compact it is, I can have the speaker in my bedroom and it will fill my whole apartment with sound without even having it on full volume. I use it for several hours a day and I only have to charge it about once a week
 This speaker is great but it has been 5 months I owned this and now stoped working. Doesn’t recognize my phone or any other device and stoped holding charge.<br/>As much as I liked it I couldn’t give 5 stars review since it only lasted for 5 months
 I can't believe how good the sound is. Well worth the $.
 I bought this speaker on a whim, because my work buddy told me it was great. All I have to say is amazing job Anker. This is a really well built product. I am used to a little more bass from my music, but you cannot beat the sound quality at this price set. Truly a good buy. Would buy more of them if I could sync them to each other.
 Anker makes great products, this speaker included. Good sound for it's size, long lasting battery
 Pretty good sound quality and incredibly loud for the compact size. Bluetooth connection is solid and works from a fairly long range.
 Great little blue tooth speaker for the price!
 Awesome speakers. The sound is excellent. Don't even think twice about getting this. I am a sound nut and this is awesome. I have several Anker products and have NEVER been disappointed.
 Other than the annoying as all hell beep. It’s a nice speaker.
 Great price for sound quality! Will definitely buy again.
 Completely satisfied with the product. I also have one of Anker's external batteries, which is fantastic. So I thought I would give their speaker a try. Love the Bluetooth connection for notice from my phone, but since my work computer does not have Bluetooth, I bought their aux cable for connection to that. Great sound with just enough bass. Price at $35.99, is reasonable.
 Very Good Speaker\Mic, we use it on many conference calls with the iPhone 6, calls our louder and clearer than the iPhone speaker, our clients have commented that the mic is very clear, Highly recommended
 Love it. It's perfect. I use it while showering and running around the apartment cleaning.
 This speaker is great. Never fails me when I power it up. To be honest I’ve never had to charge it and have owned it more than a year. But is such a great product. Would highly recommend.
 Lacks depth that you can get from other competitor speakers in this price range. Was disappointed.
 Has a good sound and cheap....
 Great speaker for price
 Sound was good, but it beeped loudly over the music every minute despite everything I tried to do with troubleshooting. Garbage
 I only wished that the power cord was on the left side instead of the right, so I wouldn't have the cord draping across my dashboard.
 Great sound and price. What a combination.
 Awesome! Works great for camping any by the pool!!
 Sound is good. But whenever somebody else wants to connect, then I try and re-connect, I have to hit the "Forget this device" then close out my bluetooth, then re-open and re-connect. NONE of my other bluetooth devices do this and it is rather annoying. So I am returning it.
 Happy with this product. Great value for the price.
 Great sound and virtually indistinguishable from much more expensive speakers such as the Bose mini soundlink. Never have any issues connecting to it from my MacBook Pro or iPhone. Great value for $25 and the battery seems to last for a very long time.
 Sound and quality is better than I expected for the price I paid.  Battery life is great too!!
 I needed a portable speaker for when I do small presentations in conference rooms that are not equipped with audio capabilities.  I bought this one based on the ratings and my previous experience with Anker products.  I had an hour before the meeting so I quickly unpackaged it and charged it and it worked perfectly.  No problem or hassles.  Great sound quality for its size.
 Poor sound.  Bought it looking for a well reviewed Bluetooth speaker.  It did not meet my expectations so I sent it back
 battery life is amazing havent charged it yet and still running very loud i love it
 the sound is great. good build quality
 Well made, quality piece - great sound! Small enough to use anywhere --- great stereo sound,  I will be buying more of these for gifts
 good sound, controls hard to see and work with it
 My boyfriend loved it.
 The speaker. The Battery and the Wound si very good
 Best bluetooth speaker in the market. Material was very nice. Sound quality is amazing and the bluetooth range is execptional. Will definately recommend this speaker
 Love this speaker, the battery really last longer.
 Maximum volume isn't high enough, for quiet devices. Anything that has decent volume to begin with works well. Consider buying an inline USB amp to accompany this device, and thank me later.
 Great Christmas swap gift! Worked right out of the box - very popular item at the party.
 I bought several of these for gifts. They sound great for the price...
 great speaker, nice sound and light weight. people ask me all the time where i purchased it, highly recommend it
 works well
 I wanted to contact Anker prior to writing this but couldn't find contact info. The speaker sounds great for its size, my son loves it. It gets loud, louder than you'd expect for its size. My only issue is has less than a 10 foot Bluetooth range. Judging from other reviews I'm going to assume it's just a bad unit.
 The sound quality is sufficient for my untrained ear. Set up is simple. My only complaint is that it occasionally drops the connection although the signal strength is adequate.
 outstanding battery life, very good quality sound
 Great size, sound, and quality! By far the best Bluetooth speaker for the price!
 Nice sound
 works great
 Long battery life and great sound. Connects Bluetooth easily too!
 Bought this to go for a bigger fuller sound, compared to the Oontz angle, but still extremely portable.  this speaker goes much louder.<br/><br/>Not heavy on the bass, but enough to feel the lows.<br/><br/>It's heavy and firm build factor are consistent with higher end brands.
 Arrived quickly<br/>Great sound
 Sound is good and works great.
 Sounds is great for the size. The controls are easy to use and setup was incredibly simple. Very happy with this purchase.
 Very satisfied. For a small speaker it sounds great. And battery life if very good.  Highly recommend.
 It took me more time to unpack than to get it working with my iPhone 6S. Great sound and simple to use, easy direction small print.
 Bought this for my mom and she loves it
 Great speaker! Bought it about a month ago and still haven’t needed to charge it... and I use it frequently at my desk.
 Colors are beautiful.<br/>Smooth feel to touch.<br/>Very loud &amp; long battery life.<br/>You’ll be proud when you purchase this item &amp; the price is very affordable.<br/>I also just so happen to like ANKER products as well, they’re very GREAT!
 great sound,worth the money
 Plays really well, better than $100 speaker I purchased a couple of years ago. I'm very satisfied with the purchase.
 very good sound for its size and price. Convenient portability,too.
 Very good sound. Clear and has some thump to it. Easy to set up. Great value for the price. Looking at buying another one.
 works very well.
 Great speaker! Would have given it another star if it was a tiny bit louder.
 Anker really gets my vote as a company that really delivers. Granted this isn't a room speaker system, and you can't expect that either, it's a really good speaker with good range and clear detail. Total thumbs up!
 Like all Anker products this speaker is well designed and works great with my iPad Pro.
 Sounds good for the size and price, but has horrible Bluetooth signal. Lots of pauses, even with my phone right next to it.
 I absolutely love the sound of this portable speaker. Compared to  others I have purchased, it is definitely superior in sound. However, I have purchased two, because the first I but stopped working with in a month, and the same thing happened with the second.  I absolutely could not believe it!
 Does not stay paired.  Instructions for pairing are vague.  Works once in a great while and that's it.  Totally dissatisfied.
 the instructions were like coded mumblejumble.nothing helpful and in every language known..Manufacturer should make it known that some brands of t.v are not compatible with speaker.,Wiith ANKER speaker you can only have either remote or TV NOT BOTH. this is with Samsung Smart TV. I guess I will try speaker and see how it works out.  P.S  the charging cord is  much to short.
 Great product for a great price!!!<br/>Works perfect!
 Has good sound - links with Alexa automatically once set up. Which is easy.
 Works great clear sound
 It blew my mind how good this thing is for $36. I was expecting a tinny piece of garbage for the price I was paying, I just needed something louder than my laptop speakers. These actually sound good. They don't have a heavy bass or anything, but they are fairly balanced high, mid, low. I am very happy. It does not come with an aux cord, but you can get one of those for a couple of bucks.
 Product as described. Easy to set up and use. Sound quality surprisingly good for its conveniently small size.
 Surprisingly strong speaker for its tiny size. I use it as the speaker for my Amazon Dot. Holds a charge a long time, or just leave plugged in. A great buy.
 Great little speaker. Smaller than expected but great sound, easy to use and wonderful battery life. Would buy again for sure
 It sounds great, i havent charged this thing at all. I just took it out of the box and started using it. I've had it for about 4 days of all day play. The thing wont die. The only thing it lacks is volume but you really get your bang for your buck
 Easy to use and durable, not too big. I love it.
 Exceeded my expectations very happy, although I'm curious to know if it's me or the battery for this unit it's starting to die on me because after 5hrs the battery is at 70%
 Sounds okay - does what it should, little tinny at higher volumes, but connects easily.
 Good sound, ridiculously good battery--we charged it once, and months later (with occasional use) still working on same charge.
 This speaker is FANTASTIC.  very solidly built.  I use it in my car because my stereo's bluetooth is on the fritz.  I have an hour commute each way for work.  I listen to music the whole way.  I have had this speaker for several months, and have only had to charge it a few times.  AMAZING battery life.
 LIKE a lot!
 Great speaker, just be careful of the charging port as you can push into the speaker deeper.
 I bought  this for my mom for mother's day and she loves it. The battery life is great, the setup was easy for her to figure out, and it has very good quality sound. Over a week of using it every day, it only died once. The sound carries well and is clear and crisp. Overall this is a great speaker for what I needed!
 Easy to connect to my phone or iPod, great sound and the charge lasts a long time.  I was amazed by how good it sounds.
 Great product
 This product is fantastic! Super sleek and easy to use. I've had no problem connecting to it using my phone but have had some trouble using my Mac, although this is likely more of a laptop problem than a speaker problem. I recommend it to anyone that is looking for a portable speaker but doesn't want drop serious money on a more popular brand name speaker.
 I love this Bluetooth speaker! My son has one and I liked the way it sounds so I bought myself one. I highly recommend this product.
 Everybody get one!
 Not as loud as I’d hope. No bass..
 For this lil guy to be so little, he puts out some loud sounds!!!
 Battery lasts! love this product!
 Sometimes I have to "Forget device" and re-pair it with my laptop or ipad but works like a gem and drowns out my neighbors =)
 For size, performance, simplicity, and value Anker has certainly provided a great product. Highly recommended!
 The sound is alright. A little low. Love the look and design of the speaker but I wish the sound quality was better.
 Bought this in September if 2018 and it no longer works.  Will not turn on.  It lights up when you plug it in to charge so not sure what the issue is
 Not the loudest thing but it sure does hold a charge.  I have recommended this to a bunch of my friends.
 Fantastic!
 I've had this speaker for about a month and I've only charged it twice. That's an insanely good battery life it has. The sound is really great, the bass is deep and everything. Only complaint would probably the sound volume not being so high but either way it's a great speaker.
 Well made product.Good for near-field listening. I like having it around the house to listen to news/podcasts.
 Seriously, the battery lasts forever. I can't kill it. How is this possible? Sounds pretty ok too.
 Exceptional speaker. Works as advertised, easy to control, loud enough, good enough sound quality (for this size and price). Don't even know the battery lifetime, haven't run out yet.
 Great portability. Hold a long charge with this unit. I keep it in my work bag and use as a speaker phone for conferences.
 I love the speaker but this is the second one I bought (same model) and my first came with an a/c adapter.  I would like to get one if possible.<br/>The sounds itself is great and I had no trouble pairing it.  Great little speaker!
 I loved my first purchase so much that I purchased another one when it went on sale.  Have not been disappointed with this purchase at all.  It holds it charge a long time and the sound is great.
 Great product for a very good price!!!<br/>Crisp sound, easy to config.<br/>As all ANKER products ;-)
 Works well, and the sound is good
 from its packaging to its weight, everything about this speaker is 5 stars!
 Decent
 Perfect thanks!
 The speaker worked fine, sound was good. However, the charging port (which I didn't have to use much) became unusable. The cord will not stay in the port so we cannot charge it now. I was highly disappointed because I liked the speaker, but feel like the port should have not become a problem with the small amount of usage for charging. I won't buy another one of these speakers because of this.<br/><br/>UPDATE - Ok, here's the skinny, this speaker is GREAT! Wanna know what's better than the speaker? ANKER Customer Service. 5 stars for the speaker, 12 stars for their customer service. If you read this and other reviews, you'll notice that you don't have to call them. You can, and please do if you need them, they are great, but they picked up on this review and REACHED OUT TO US! That is fantastic customer service. I have many Anker products, chargers, speakers, what-not, never an issue with any except this speaker. And even the speaker is great, it was only the charging port. ANKER was proactive and reached out to us. That is rare in this world and great to know it still exists. I will continue to buy from Anker because of this, great products that are only outpaced by their other worldly customer service. If you're considering buying any Anker product, but you're not sure between it or some other manufacturer, GO WITH ANKER. Thank you Anker!!
 Bought as a birthday gift for a friend. Really beautiful build quality and  great battery life, very loud but not as much bass as I would like. Has AUX port as well.
 Really solid sound quality for the size and price. Quality materials/feel. Excellent battery life.
 Love this speaker, Great sound, Amazing battery. Outstanding price!!!
 I love this Speaker... lots of bass, clear and loud... i recommend this product to anyone who likes to listen to music wherever they go. This speaker is fantastic. Thanks for the availability of this speaker at a great price.
 this product is horrible. it did not function properly. would not hook up via Bluetooth. i was forced to return it for a refund
 I really enjoy the experience with this product even though I wish it had some bass. Well I have bought one last year and that was great too all though the charging port did not work any more after a few months on my old one.  So far I have my new one for about 2 months and everything is going good so far
 is working fine.
 The speakers have impeccable bass. The battery life is very impressive. I have yet to test it for 24 hours but I have yet to run out of battery. It is portable and light, and very user-friendly.
 Holy moly!  This little box packs a wallop.  The sound is so crisp and clear all the way to volume limits.  It can be quite loud, just like I like it.  Lots'o punch for not much $$.  Plus, it's a bluetooth speaker for your phone and has a mike built-in.<br/><br/>The quality of this speaker and company is very easy to see.  It's like a brick, very solid.  It's packed beautifully from the factory.  German engineering is so precise.<br/><br/>This blue color is exactly like online.  It's a stunning bright shade of blue.  So much better than usual black everything.<br/><br/>I DID NOT receive this speaker for an honest opinion.  I give my honest opinion without being bought, thank you very much.<br/><br/>Try it, you'll like it!!<br/><br/>The company includes a neat little card that says "Happy" on one side and "Not Happy" on the other.  Then, you read that part of the card.<br/><br/>Anker is a cool company with high quality items.  We will definitely be buying more from them!
 Husband like this a lot
 Great sound and design yet after a few weeks it just stopped working. It sucks because my return window just closed last week!!!!
 This no longer works :( it worked great while it last
 This speaker has been everything I wanted.  I even put it outside and listened to music while I was working.
 This is the best Bluetooth speaker I’ve ever bought. This speaker has very great battery life and lasts me days of listening. The sound on this speaker is also very clear and loud. It is very compact and fits greatly in backpacks for traveling. Definently recommend this Bluetooth speaker.
 Perfect little speaker with minimum distortion even at full volume. I've now purchased two of these for myself, and I absolutely love them.
 Pros: Good sound, super portable, excelent battery life, cool speaker, pretty nice packaging, and a great price tag!<br/>Cons: weak bass
 i like how it has great sound. more vibrant and clear speaker i’ve ever had. definitely better than a beats pill.
 great sound, easy to connect via Bluetooth
 One of the best wireless speaker in my opinion. The Anker sound core fulfills my needs; I like that I only have to fully charge the Ancore speaker once every 2-3 weeks. The sound quality is great. I only wish it had more subwoofer bass, but that would be asking too much in it price range. Overall this is a really good sturdy built speaker that will last a long time.
 Nice portable speaker.
 Good speaker !
 Powerful sound in a small package, what else is there to say? I was pleasantly surprised when I found that the speaker has a built-in microphone, which I had not expected.
 Great sound and easy to Bluetooth
 This is the best little speaker for the money.  I have two and they are pretty loud, for the size.
 Very good sound from a small box.  My teenage daughter is very happy to be able to wireless (Bluetooth) connect with her iPhone.
 I'm very disappointed when I got it worked for like five minutes then it shut off i even had it on the charger all night and now it comes on but it doesn't  play sound at all I wouldn't suggest it
 Very happy with the purchase
 Great had it a long time great sound
 Amazing quality of sound. I love it.
 This is a great little speaker. Color options were nice too! Would recommend.
 I love this speaker so much. The sound quality and battery life is incredible!! I can always count on Anker to make quality products that never disappoint.
 very good speaker works great easy to sit up. highly recommended.
 Its really good for the price, like the shape and weight not to heavy can be carried around.
 Awesome
 Great little speaker especially for the price.  I take it to work and then drop it into my purse at the end of the day to listen at home.  We will use this little speaker during the holiday season to provide Christmas music in our office.  You can't tell the difference between this and my boss's Bose mini speaker.
 Very good item. Great sound.
 Mine sounds very good. Controls work good. I do "occasionally " get a squeal noise. So I dropped a star for that. Otherwise, if performance is consistent for 2 yrs, I add a star for durability
 I rarely give good reviews on things, never 5 because nothing is perfect. This speaker though, I give 5. It is worth every dollar spent on it, I can hear it from one side of my home to the other. Great speaker and would greatly recommend it to anyone!
 Incredible sound for an incredible price. Loved it so much I bought one as a gift for a friend. The battery lasts forever when charged and it's super portable. Highly recommend.
 Pairing it with my Samsung Galaxy S7 and with my iPad was a breeze. Sound gets loud while remaining clear. The bass doesn't boom, but I expected that going in. Battery life is shockingly long. We have a vacation coming up this summer and this speaker will be perfect for outside &amp; at the beach.
 Love it. Small with big sound. Exactly what I was looking for
 great product i have bought this product for me and 2 others for somebody at my work she loves it great battery takes drops like a champ and battery almost never dies will buy again great speaker for work to listen to music in the truck
 Great battery life and sound!! Highly recommend to anyone!!!
 After spending more than a little time looking for the right bluetooth speaker, I decided to give this one a try. I've heard great things about Anker products, and it seems like that reputation is probably well deserved! This speaker may not top a $200 Bose but for the price you get clear sound, pretty decent bass and amazing battery life! If you're in the market for a budget bluetooth speaker that doesn't look, sound or feel budget, give this one a try!
 These speakers are very good, I have never had problems, it has fallen several times, and it has not been damaged, and the battery lasts all night. I recommend it.
 Sister in-law says this the was the best present she has ever gotten!
 These speakers sound harsh. The bass doesn't punch, instead it splatters the bass. Music clarity isn't a problem, but nothing special. I've paid $5 for a better speaker than this product.
 Bought this speaker just over a year ago... I use it maybe 2 or 3 hours a week on average. Since I got it, I've charged it TWICE, once when I first got it, and then about 7 months later. Unbelievable!<br/><br/>Audio quality is great too, what's not to love?
 We have two of these as well...both teen boys wanted this and love it!
 Bought as a gift at Christmas, for my friend. She loves it!
 Awesome product with Crystal clear sound! It's also really loud for its size.
 For $25 bucks. Best Cheap Bluetooth you can buy.  I'm impressed. Which is not a very easy thing to do as far as electronics are concerned. This little speaker is pretty dang loud and has great sound quality.
 Very good soulnd for the price, connects easily with Echo Dot and soulnds good.  Would recommend to others
 Great little speaker! Strong reception and great sound at 35ft. My 85 year old mother has a hard time hearing the TV without turning it way up. With this speaker by her chair, we all can hear the  TV even in a 40ft den. We're all happy!
 This is an amazing speaker for the price. I use it at work all day and the battery last also doesn’t drain my phone battery
 Stereo quality sound!  Very impressed with the quality of the sound from this little speaker.  It come with USB charger.
 It was probably said before,but I'll say it again,small box....big sound!!!!! Light weight, compact...great deal for the price.
 Compare to my old shark box it smaller. Sound good but hands down the shark better because it has better bass.
 I bought this for my office at work, and it's great. not bad for the price.
 Sounds good on everything except Jimi Hendrex...Not so good 😀 I love it!
 We really like this product, its easy to use and the sound is great.  And, the price is fantastic!  I couldn't ask for me.
 This little speaker sounds great.  Almost as good as the wife's Bose.  I like the size and the output.  Easy to set up and just what I needed.
 Surprising great sound.
 Great sound and a compact size!  Love it!
 It's really too new to rate. My wife gave me an Anker SoundCore speaker Pro sport for Valentine's Day. it sounded great but quit working after 3 days. Amazon refunded our money &amp; it was all good. I am hopeful I just got a lemon Anker ,  so I tried it again since the reviews were good. Hopefully between 6 month-12 months I can give it a 5 star rating.
 This is perfect for my office. It has a great volume max. Pairs perfectly with my android phone.
 This was a gift.
 Have issues with connecting to bluetooth with more than one device. And of course addressed the troubleshooting.
 good volume but i personally wish it would be a little louder
 easy to use and quality is high
 Disappointed with the sound. Maybe my expectation was high from this range, but good enough for me.
 Easy for this granny to use and sounds great!
 Considered by some online to be the best speaker under $50. So far their review is proving to be spot on.
 I have had this speaker for almost a year now and everything is still great nothing wrong with it at all.
 great products - can't go wrong with Anker  Holds a charge with continuous play well past the big names...
 Can't be without one of these, so I'm told.  This was on my son's Christmas list and loves it!
 It worked for the first 4 months, but the bluetooth randomly stopped working one day so I can't connect to anything anymore...
 Pretty good sound from such a small box
 Awesome little speaker. Perfect size for home or to carry around. Paired easily to all my devices and sounds great. I do not have anything top compare it to, but if you are looking for something portable,  good sounding, and simple then this speaker is an excellent choice.
 Excellent for the price
 Nice speaker. Good price. I bought this again. Goooooooooood. Thanks.
 Works through out my house and last all day.
 Seriously impressive sound, and battery life, for it's size.  Take it with me most places.  Good sound quality, Bluetooth links up well, not too heavy. Good sound balance for it's size, too.
 Nice speaker with good sound from such a small box.
 Fine little speaker. Bluetooth hooked up to our Echo Dot immediately.Easy to carry around to where we want it.
 Very solid speaker that exceeds my expectations. Obviously at this price and size I wasn't expecting to ratlle my fillings but it's very loud for its size and price limitations
 Perfect Bluetooth speaker
 great sound.  Perfect for small rooms, beach and pool side music.
  Written by my 7 year old]<br/>Well it's a fine speaker, I'm very surprised that this was this good for the price and brand that I've NEVER HEARD OF!! But know that I have, I am EXTREMELY happy with what the Anker SoundCore speaker gave me, so if you are looking for speaker, I recommend this one very much!! Anker, if you see this review, you will be happy!! And for its size, it's an AMAZING SPEKER!!
 Like it all, use it for iPhone music at work
 Wasn't has laud as others I've heard the same size of the banker Bluetooth speaker
 Works great. I have four of them. I use them with Alexa and the sound is excellent. I highly recommend this item.
 This is a kick-ass speaker its loud,clear, and tough as hell. I'm a carpenter and it gets all kinds of abuse on the job site, none of which has changed its performance. It's still just as strong as the day i got it.
 Overall very happy with device.<br/><br/>However, since I would like to always keep it on so that my phone uses the speaker whenever I enter the room, I have two niggling annoyances. I can't keep it on the bedside table because the blue LED blinks incessantly if my phone is not connected. Then when it does connect to the phone it plays a loud set of tones. It would be nice if the volume of the connection confirming tones could be quieted or muted.
 Daughter thinks it sounds okay
 Let's start with what I love about this speaker.<br/><br/>One of the first things that hit me about this speaker was it's clarity. Whether I'm listening to music (Jazz, Blues, Gospel, Funk, Classical) or whether I'm listening to people speaking, I don't cease to be amazed by how clear the speakers are. The dual 3W drivers make it even better when you're really close to speakers, because you can almost hear the separation of the instruments and picture them around you.<br/>And with these speakers, you can enjoy that sound for a really long time. I honestly feel like they accurately represented the 24-hour battery life of this speaker. I use this speaker unplugged all the time. It's usually on, but not playing anything during the majority of day, and I usually play music out of it for around 2-4 hours a day. I usually only have to charger it once every week or two.<br/><br/>Despite all that this speaker has going for it, it has 2 major issues that really detract from the experience for me: loudness, audio interruptions,<br/><br/>This speaker doesn't get very loud over Bluetooth. I like to listen to music in the shower, and this speaker can barely overpower the sound of the the shower, which is really disappointing.The way this volume over Bluetooth is really weird. I've used this speaker with my Android phone and an Iphone, and here's what I've noticed.<br/>- On Iphone, the volume controls are "centralized" for lack of a better word. What I mean by this is that hitting volume up on the Iphone increases the Iphone's media volume, and pressing the volume up button on the speaker also turns up the Iphone's media volume.<br/>- On Android, the volume controls of the speaker and the phone are independent. Pressing volume up on the android increase's the Android's media volume, but pressing volume up on the speaker increases the speaker's volume, and not that of the phone. Basically, you can turn up the volume on the android and the speaker independently, and I've found that that gets the speaker a bit louder but still not terribly loud.<br/>I have this theory that the speaker was intentionally made not to become very loud, in order to increase battery life. The reason why I believe this is because it's possible to get this speaker really loud, but just not over bluetooth. If you connect through the 3.5 mm jack with something that can drive the speaker, like a desktop or laptop, you can get this speaker to play REALLY loudly without distortion. But I've noticed that when doing that, battery life really suffers.<br/>And it's a shame, because I would gladly have traded off a bit less battery life for a bit more loudness over bluetooth. But now I just get a bit sad whenever I remember how limited the loudness is.<br/><br/>I bought this speaker back in October, and I just recently (December) started having problems where the audio would just start randomly and frequently cutting out. It doesn't happen all the time, but when playing audio over bluetooth, sometimes, the audio will just stop for like a second or two, and come back. And this just keeps happening every few seconds. It's extremely frustrating.<br/><br/>Miscellaneous/Minor Things:<br/>- The bass isn't very loud. It's audible, but it isn't really "present"<br/>- The flashing light is super annoying at night<br/>- The rubberized finish is really nice to the touch, but it gets greasy really easily.<br/><br/>All in all, this speaker has some really great things going for it, but the loudness over Bluetooth does not cease to disappoint me and make me feel a bit sad about this purchase at times.
 This speaker has the best sound quality for the price. I was impressed and we use it everyday with our echo dot.
 I like the size of the speaker very convenient to put in my beach bag. However the buttons are hard to see at night. Also when paring with the same device you sometimes need to delete the speaker from the device then pare it again.
 Perfect for bedside sound. Small enough to not take up too much room, yet the sound is great.
 it looks cool and generally ok.  i wish it had a skip track button.  very good customer service
 Great
 We love it. My husband has an older ipod that is not blue tooth and he does not have a smart phone. He needed something that he could connect to the ipod. Read reviews about the Anker and it did not disappoint. It has amazing sound for something small and portable. The charge on here is also fantastic. I can use it with Bluetooth on my phone so we're both happy. Everybody that comes over gets a sample of this amazing sound!
 Not bad for it's size. It's held up well.
 Bought this as a gift and they loved it
 Was good at first for the price, only lasted about 6 months before It stopped working and wouldn't charge any more (tried multiple cords &amp; outlets). Pretty disappointed
 Works great and has a good sound for the price. I have this hooked up to my echo dot, basiclly for the music and it sounds pretty good.
 Sounds very good for its size. Charges lasts a very long time. I listen to it at work nearly every day for 8+ hours a day. Cant believe the quality of the music that comes out of it.
 Sound quality is great but the best thing about this wireless speaker is the life of the battery.  We use this a lot and the battery lasted a lot longer than advertised.  So happy with it, we've bought a 2nd one for the office!
 Works decent, but hard to connect and looses connection easy. :(
 I just got tiha speaker so idk how long will it last but sounds amazing<br/>I own 2 more Bluetooth speakers that I paid over $100 dollars and they don’t sound this good and feels right in your hand. Feels like it’s really well built not something cheap
 Water resistant, good size and clear sound. Reasonably loud with an outstanding battery life. Just lacks any deep bass.
 Great and powerful little speaker i was really surprised would order again.
 The speaker sounds absolutely amazing it’s really loud it’s the best speaker I’ve ever had
 Good sound and range in the right sized speaker for portability
 good
 absolutely love the quality
 Sounds very good for a small speaker. The battery life is fantastic.
 At first it seemed great, but after maybe 10 uses it started crackling, speaker seems to be blown and i never even brought the device to full volume.
 This is honestly one of the best Bluetooth speakers I have tried and really like.  This speaker really has decent base, for its tiny size, as well as crisp mid tones and highs.  I've only used the Bluetooth functionality once or twice.  However, I plug a Chromecast Audio into the AUX port to listen to my music from my iPhone.  I have three Chromecast Audio products, and I send music to all of them, using the new multi-speaker functionality Google just enabled, and this speaker performs very well in this role.  There is no lag between this speaker, my stereo speakers, and another Bluetooth speaker by another manufacturer.<br/><br/>The dark controls, on top of the speaker, blends into the dark material the speaker is made of, so the buttons are a bit hard to see.  This speaker hs very crisp sound.
 Love this speaker!  Doesn't get super loud but works great for what I needed it for.  Love the fact you can talk to people if u get a call and they can here you clearly
 Perfect for my needs.  Nice sound!
 Definitely served my purpose. Low-cost portable Bluetooth speaker, looks very stylish. Somewhat lacks bass, but that is expected with the low price. Audio is great for a non-audiphile
 This is a small very powerful speaker. The sound is loud &amp; clear. The price is very reasonable. I love it.
 Bought one for myself and some and the sound that comes out is legitimate. High quality aand recommend. When I played showed  a friend he gave me the money to buy him one.
 Great quality sound for the price.
 Great speaker just got it a few days. It had some bad reviews for battery issues so I'll see. Easy to pair nice sound
 Great speaker!  Good sound.  Great bang for your buck
 Love it, easy to use and small
 GREAT SOUND, BATTERY LIFE AND REALLY WORTH THE MONEY IF U LIKE TO LISTEN TO REAL MUSIC....
 I did a lot of research before purchasing this bluetooth speaker.  I wanted something that was easy to grab and carry around the house so that I can listen to music in different rooms.  I wanted something with long battery life, so that I could spend more time listening to music, and only have to charge it up occasionally.  I wanted a speaker with Bluetooth 4.0 (for use with my iPhone), and with an Aux cable input (my old iPod Nano doesn't have Bluetooth).  I wanted something colorful (most units are boring black).  I wanted a device with decent sound, but was willing to trade off bass performance for size/weight/cost.  It needs to be loud enough so that I can hear tunes in the shower when the speaker is on my bathroom counter.  And finally, I wanted something affordable.<br/><br/>I narrowed my choices down to this Anker SoundCore vs the DKnight MagicBox II.  While the DKnight MagicBox II is comparable in size/price, and has a lot of positive reviews, my belief is that many of these are fake reviews, paid for by the company.  I ended up choosing the Anker SoundCore speaker for 2 reasons: 1) I have many other Anker products that I love, and trust their brand; 2) I got this unit for 30 dollars on an Amazon daily deal.<br/><br/>Now that it's arrived, I am quite pleased -- it met all of my criteria.  It quickly/easily paired with my iPhone, and the sound quality was fine.  It lacks the deep bass that you can get with larger speakers, but I knew that going in, and I am not disappointed at all in the sound.  In fact, I was impressed with how loud the volume can go -- it packs a big punch for a small speaker.<br/><br/>There are 3 things I would change if I were designing a 2nd-generation version of the SoundCore speaker -- of them cosmetic changes: 1) Remove the giant "ANKER" logo from the face of the speaker (it looks tacky); 2) Instead of making the unit red all over, make it black and red (e.g. black housing with a red speaker grill, or red housing with a black speaker grill) since there is just too much red; 3) Make the top buttons actual buttons with good button feedback instead of raised symbols molded into the housing.  Other than these cosmetic changes, I am pleased with the size, price, sound, battery life, and overall build quality of this unit.
 Great sound. Not the best distance but doable. Wish the charger was an ac adapter.
 It works well. Good rechargeable battery that lasts a long time.  However, I wish the buttons are more visible.
 Very good product! Loud, direct, and has great bt connection distance.
 Excellent speaker!
 The sound is muffled. The battery life is amazing though. UPDATE: (Jul 7th - 2017) Anker's costumer support is really good and the SoundCore2 I was sent has a much better sound quality. I'll definitely be buying from them again in the future.
 Great speaker, good build quality... Really worth the money.
 The charge lasts a looooooooong time! Way longer than 24 hrs I think. Very loud too for the size. Strongly recommended
 Nice sound
 Use it in my garage when working on stuff. Great sound for a little box and long run time.
 Sounds very good works good  I bought it for my wife for Christmas she really likes it
 I would recommend the sound quality. Sounds like an expensive surround sound system in one little box. Turn it all the way up, cause the sound quality is still there!! The tornado effect bass woofer really packs a imatational punch\thump.
 Great speaker and long lasting battery.  Bluetooth range not as far as advertised
 This speaker is just what I needed for my Echo Dot. It has a nice crisp sound and I can place it anywhere in my 3 story house without losing the signal. It blends in nicely sitting on the kitchen counter or on a piece of furniture. I am very pleased with it.
 Great Speaker, it gets the job done, is loud enough, and works with all of my bluetooth devices, and the price was great for this wonderful speaker.
 Amazing sound quality, great battery, wirks wonderfully in cold weather, connects to my phone very quickly would defiantly recommend
 Very usefull and the sound is amazing.
 It's a good little bluetooth speaker.  Has great range, but even better battery life.  I actually bought a 2nd one to keep at my office.
 item shipped quick and the sound is incredible I like it better then my old beats pill at 1/4 of the price,meets all my needs and the battery life is incredible.
 Nice build quality, but, the lack of volume is noticeable and disappointing.  Also, doesn't come with anything to store the unit it.  Even a cheap cloth bag would have been helpful - so, I took one from an old ski goggle.
 I'm thrilled with my Anker Bluetooth speaker. It's even better than I had hoped for. Thank you!!!
 Works well but it's just not that loud.
 Sound is a bit muddy, very long battery life. Syncs quickly with Amazon Dot. Average at best.
 This speaker was purchased for an external speaker for my phone and ipad/tablet - it is exactly what I was looking for! Reasonably priced, battery was fully charged when it arrived, easy to connect via bluetooth, and the battery life is excellent - haven't had to charge it since I received it!
 Wish it was waterproof, but wow this thing has some power!! I love it and so do my friends, I can take this to the beach and hear it over the crowds of people.
 works fantastic, I had to buy another one for my wife so that I could use mine.
 Great speaker for the money.
 Good battery life and very clear audio.
 Very Happy with the sound quality. Easy set up with tablet and mobile phone.
 Great little speaker. The sound quality is pretty impressive for such a little speaker.
 Absolutely worth the price paid. Loud and easy to use. Distance and range is excellent.
 Mic using Bluetooth does not work with Lync / Skype for Business.
 Poor quality out put
 I did some research on Bluetooth speakers because I have had such bad luck with the majority of them. Let me say that this Anker speaker is far the best product I have bought. I highly recommennd it, especially the long battery life! 5 Stars!
 Love,perfect ❤️❤️❤️
 I decided to get this to listen to podcasts in my car on my way to work, school, ect, and I love it! I feel like it really does stay charged for 24 hours at a time. I cant remember the last time I charged it completely. It is also pretty loud without making that scratchy noise that speakers make when they are very high in volume.
 Great speaker for the money. Loud, good sound.
 I needed a Bluetooth speaker for my front porch, as I have pricey hard-wired speakers on the back deck. Easy setup on iPad &amp; Android, and the sound quality is really amazing given the size. Sound quality was exceptional. Love the product, and the brand, Anker is really a good brand. I have several items from Anker... Switching b/tw Apple/Android takes literally seconds on Bluetooth, but I did get a cable, just in case.<br/>Great product!<br/>-David Allen
 This speaker sounds great. The only issue with it is it loses the signal on my phone after about 10 feet.
 This is a killer speaker, especially for the price point. Clear, balanced sound, connects like a breeze, and packs a real punch when it gets up to top volume. 100% satisfied and would recommend to anyone.
 my phone lost its blue tooth pairing and i have not successfully been able to pair it again, directions tossed. help?  it’s become an unrecognizable device.
 Super portable, crisp sound with very minimal distortion...also the battery life on this thing is phenomenal!
 I spect better quality of the sound, not that bad, but I will not buy another one like this.
 I was about to write a 3 star review because it wouldn't pair with my phone. I did some troubleshooting on the phone though and it works just great now. If only I had been able to use it on the vacation I just got home from. :-(<br/><br/>In any case this is a wonderful speaker. I love its solid construction and the sound. As for the construction it is made of plastic of course and it is very solid feeling. All the plastic is soft to the touch, almost rubbery in texture. I guess the name the industry uses for sales purposes is "soft-touch coating." I guess what I'm trying to say is it's very nice to touch and it doesn't slide easily on a hard surface.<br/><br/>Now to the most important thing, the sound. I see mixed reviews on its loudness. Using a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate it at a 7. This means if there is a lot of ambient noise or you are at some distance from it then the sound won't be as great. I have no idea if other small speakers like this go louder or not so it's just a heads-up, it isn't a drawback for me.<br/><br/>When I played some music at high volume I didn't hear any distortion so I'm impressed by that. The bass is not strong but it isn't distorted either with the music I was playing, which was admittedly not often bass heavy. Even so I love the sound. It is rich and full, not the tinny sound I expected.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>- Feels great in your hands. It's got some heft and it is soft and slightly rubbery to the touch, which is nice.<br/>- Sound quality is very nice. It has a full, rich sound rather than the tinny sound of some other speakers<br/>- I got the color blue and It is a straight blue, not sky or robin's egg. Just primary blue.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- Not much bass. I haven't heard it distort so that's good but it's not there for the really deep bass.<br/>- It's not very loud. I put this in the cons because others might like to know. It's not a deal breaker for me. I'll be listening to it inside with little ambient noise so it's plenty loud for me.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I'm very happy with this speaker. I like the feel and the sound. I recommend it highly.
 Seems to be of good quality. Has a great sound and is user friendly. I've only had about a week, but so far, so good.
 I’m pretty impressed with this Anker Bluetooth speaker! For the price and the quality, I had to get it and I don’t regret it!
 Excellent
 Great sound for the price . Use in my electric golf cart and plenty loud. Extremely satisfied.
 I always read reviews and use them to aid in purchases but unfortunately rarely leave reviews myself.  This is one time I felt it was necessary.  The speaker has been a great disappointment.  I understand it is a very inexpensive purchase but I did expect at least decent sound.  It worked for about 2 days on my desk at work then the sound began fading in and out, became very 'tinney' or repeatedly stoping all together.  I'm continuously turning up the volume then turning it right back down.  I'm just going to have to discontinue use and find another for this purpose.
 Good speaker for basic needs. Not a lot of bass, but still produces good sound quality. Stays charged for a good amount of time.
 This is a great little speaker. It sounds as good as my older larger bookcase speakers I used for classical music.
 Pretty good speaker for the price and size. It does crackle sometimes and the rubber shell is fingerprint magnet
 Works well. Have been using one for several years for our camping travels. At the picnic table when tent camping and now on the dash of our Class B. Bought a second one to use with my Surface tablet and Android phone. One of the few "hassle-free" devices of my gadget-life.
 Good buy
 Very good speaker. Can get pretty loud if you want it to!
 Excellent sound quality and easy to use!
 Almost perfect Bluetooth speaker. It has a remarkable sound quality. Would have loved if it was a little louder though. But very good
 Nice and loud. It has no problem connecting to my Samsung Galaxy S5 or a Moto X. Great for any situation really. I use it in my car.

 Got this for my father for Christmas and wanted to keep it because the sound is amazing!
 Great audio from this speaker
 This speaker kicks ass! Ive had one problem overall with it but other than that it sounds great, it had a super long lasting battery and it's the perfect size. Just don't let too much moisture get underneath the grill on the front of the speaker and you'll be fine
 It doesn’t turn on.  I will be sending it back asap
 Hard to know when it needs charge. To much guessding. Hasrd to read dials
 Great speaker for the price. Bluetooth range good but acts up every so often. Still work every penny. Cant beat the battery time. Would buy again for sure.
 Awesome looking speaker, the BLUE color is great. Sounds pretty good, best value speaker out there!
 I love these speakers!  I got them for my classroom to play music and interactive videos with my students.  The sound is clear and loud.  I love how so much sound can come from such a small speaker.
 Small but awesome! Husband loves it.
 Bought this for my daughter and she has no complaints or issues with it.
 Priced right. Sounds great.
 Perfect for my use. I hear music almost everday from my pc / laptop. Didn't noticed any distortion and the battery life is awesome - I didn't had to charge it yet. The design is very nice, although the size was a bit bigger than expected, so you might want to check the dimensions first.
 This speaker is fantastic. It has great volume, bass and overall range. The battery lasts forever and it can take a beating too. I gave this to my wife who can destroy any technological device within days and she has used it daily for the last 9 months. This speaker is hands-down the best Bluetooth speaker I've bought so far.
 ROCKS!
 Bought two of these. Only one will charge. My daughter used it once and it will not recharge. Real nice.
 Excellent sound quality!
 mine died within a week
 Love this speaker. The sound quality is amazing &amp; I like the option to choose a color. I highly recommend getting this speaker.
 I've always wanted a speaker but didnt know what brand to get, until i was recommended to this. I am very pleased with this speaker especially since i love my music ! Its easy to take anywhere and is very loud. The battery last for a long time and it's very easy to connect your device. 👍👍
 Great quality and lasts for days!!!!
 Everything it was cracked up to be: small, powerful, great audio clarity, keeps a charge for an extended period, and easy to operate. Great purchase!
 Big big sound from my little red box!!! It's awesome and so much more than expected.
 great sound for the price
 Great product and even better price. Has the sound of a soundbar but more compact and portable! Would recommend. Charge lasts for quite some time as well.
 Love it
 Product works great in a small to medium sized room. I take it with me and use it while at the office and the clarity is on point. My pops bought the Bose speaker that was selling on PRIME day and to be honest this one can almost compete, although the base is not there. would recommend this for the price point!
 great for the size and the price. I rarely have to charge it and get's pretty loud.
 Good sound quality and the battery lasts forever. I had some issues maintaining call connection, but that's not a feature i regularly use.
 Great sound in a small package.  The battery life is good and it's sorry simple to use.
 Pretty decent sound from such a small device and great battery life. Anker  seems to always make pretty good product.
 So far, so good. Great sound, works well with my tablet or phone.
 Great speaker. Only thing I dislike is the annoying sound it makes when it reaches max volume .
 Excellent design, product, and quality of material. Not the loudest speaker, but loud enough to enjoy.
 I am now the walking party where ever I go
 Well worth the money! Use it every single day!
 I love this thing! Used it a month before I had to recharge it. I had a problem and messed up and the company was totally helpful and took care of everything for me. HIGHLY recommend product and company.
 Great little speaker for a great price.  Great sound, super long battery life.
 This is a powerful little speaker with a crisp, clear sound.  For the price it is impressive!
 Used primarily for music blue toothed from the phone, but found a use for it as a phone speaker and transmitter. The shape is convenient to hold like a princess phone.
 The amount of sound that come out of this little box is insane. It sounds great, is super easy to connect to, and the battery last quite a while all for less than $30.
 Great product
 wonderful so far
 Worked just fine until it didn’t. Think it will no longer charge.
 Had to return it. Didn't meet my expectations. Love the color and that's about it.
 Sound is good, easily connected to device. volume good.  Wish icon controls were more visible (black on black).
 The speaker was smaller than I thought it would be but has amazing sound quality! Loved the red color! Would totally recommend.
 Works very well.  Great sound
 For the price, a great little speaker!  Great sound!  I chose the red for a pop of color in my kitchen and I love it!
 To start, this is an amazing speaker. For the price point of $45 (Got it on a sale) it is a very nice speaker. It goes pretty loud if you max it out. It doesn't have that much bass, but I wanted a small speaker louder than my phone. I highly recommend this speaker to anyone for small group listening (3-5 People) if you can get it for &lt;50$.
 Works well. no complaints.  Sounds decent..
 Nice simple speaker.. works great sounds good
 Sound quality is excellent, Bluetooth connection easy.  However battery life is very poor is why I only give it 3 stars.
 Good speaker.  The weight holds it in place better than the little ones.
 Nice, aesthetic design, with sound that is really as good as one can expect from such a small stereo speaker, efficient and easy charging and bluetooth.
 Clear sound, light and very easy to understand instructions.  You won't get the same sound effect when compared to Bose Bluetooth Speaker. Highly recommend to someone that can't afford the higher end competitors products.
 Use it all the time. Battery last a long time
 perfect for work, able to listen to music quiet enough not to distract others.
 great little speakers for a house. We like to stream Pandora from our phone and those speakers are perfect for it.
 This is my second purchase of the Anker speaker.. had to get son one !
 So far so good.  I've had it about a week.  Sound quality is surprising for how small the speaker is!
 Everything I hoped for. A nice little inexpensive, but good, speaker.
 I am having a hard setting this up and synching it wit Echo and Spealerand Phone.
 I like the size and color but I thought the sound quality would be better. I have another anker speaker that has better sound.
 Works perfectly, easy to use, my kid has dropped it all over the place and it still works perfectly
 I have never been so happy with amazons products. As far as i'm concered, your the best. I will have no<br/>problem telling my family &amp; friends. I already had a friend that wanted a speaker for herself. I just ordered it for<br/>her in my name. She was also very pleased. Thank you so much.<br/><br/>  Linda Bates
 This speaker is WELL worth the money...!!!!
 Works great.  Easy to use.  Sound fills room.  And it's super cute.
 Best little speaker on the market!
 Battery life is great. I was concerned about there being no way to really tell what level battery it's at with no LED light indicators, but the thing never dies. I charge it maybe once a week if that. The sound quality is excellent. The maximum volume it can reach is sufficient. I had no problem connecting it to my phone and laptop. I'm actually running out of ways to describe it's near perfection.
 ANYONE who has anything negative 2 say about this speaker is not telling the truth.cranked up on the highest level 0 distortion and i mean NONE👍I purchased a mini life jacket 4 $180'00 and no where even close 2 the sound of the ANKER it shreds.
 They're ok. If you're looking for lil speakers with goood bass then don't bother.
 little loud speaker and low price will buy again
 so small and sound great!
 Easy set up and great sound for such a small speaker.  The color really pops. Like it more than the normal black color.
 Sounds amazing for such a small speaker. Unbelievable battery life as well. My wife uses it all of the time.
 Great, very loud, great sound!
 Pretty good. Loud and clear sound for its small size. I wish it had micro SD slot.
 Even better than I expected!!!!! Great sound quality!!! Very happy with this Anker product!!
 Very good quality, gets really loud for such a small speaker
 Great Bluetooth boom box
 Exactly what i was looking for. I recommend this product.
 I'm really impressed by the sound quality and volume on this speaker. It's super portable and seems to hold a decent charge.
 I adore this speaker.  The sound is so much more robust than the one that I previously used.  It can fill an entire gym.  I recommend this to everyone.  Period.
 Got it on sale for $22, can't beat this for that price. Loud enough for a night of drinks with friends. Seems very durable.
 Great speaker for the price.
 It is a great speaker and meets my level of quality of sound (I'm not a music juncky). A couple drawbaxks: can't connect to multiple devices at the same time (I have disconnect it from my MacBook then I can connect it to my iPhone). It doesn't have forward and backward buttons so you can skip a track or go back and listen to a track you like. Overall I'm happy with it considering the price point.
 I just order this speaker and was really excited to use it! Turns out that whenever I try to charge it, the port can’t sense the charger. Completely faulty. I barely even got to use the speaker!
 I am super happy with this purchase.  I listen to podcasts daily when I get ready for work &amp; when I had to dock my iPod to play I'd have to get up &amp; hit skip if it was the end of a show, or fast forward through a commercial.  Now I have my iPod right next to me &amp; I can do everything I want without having to get up.  The battery life is FANTASTIC.  I think I've only charged it once (maybe twice) and I've listed for weeks.  It takes up no space at all &amp; the bluetooth picks up immediately.  I really hope it continues to work this great long term.<br/><br/>On another note - I am buying another one for my bathroom.  Seemingly unrelated but it will get there I promise<br/><br/>KROQ (radio station in Los Angeles) has played a Red Hot Chili Peppers song every 20 minutes for the last 25 years, and I am OVER IT.  So finally I just couldn't take it anymore &amp; I changed the channel (I'm a 90s baby so this was hard for me to do and it took the full 25 years for me to do it)  So I changed to 98.5 &amp; then I noticed they play a Red Hot Chili Peppers song every 30 minutes!  I am so freaking frustrated.  I literally STOPPED listening to the radio in the mornings &amp; just listen to podcasts &amp; then I'd only listen to the radio when taking a shower at night &amp; then when I blow dried my hair (an hour later).  With both KROQ and 98.5 I can take a shower &amp; they play a Red Hot Chili Peppers song every single time &amp;  then AGAIN when I blow dry my hair they play another RHCP song. WHAT THE HELL?  So, all of that to say I am buying another Anker bluetooth speaker to listen to my iPod in the shower &amp; when I blow dry my hair.  Bye bye by radio.<br/><br/>P.S. I USED to be a great Chili Peppers fan - this is not an anti-Chili Peppers rant. This is a "I've listened to a Red Hot Chili Peppers song every 10 minutes of my life for 25 years &amp; I'm putting a stop to it" rant.  Enough is enough.  Stop the madness. Anker will save me.<br/><br/>P.S.S. If you read this review - you are going to notice The Red Hot Chili Peppers is on every 10 minutes, save yourself w/ Anker.
 Sounds amazing for the size.  Can't beat the price.
 Good balance sound
 Excellent quality and the price. So worth buying. Was better than some of those that sold in stores.
 product failed to sync up after first recharge
 This is a great blue tooth speaker. Good range, great sound, and long battery life
 Great for outside
 Another great Anker product the sound is great and the life of the battery on this item is unbeatable
 Great sound for the price! Feels solid. Battery lasts a long time between charges.
 The speaker is very loud for it's size.  Perfect for the Amazon Echo.  I would highly recommend this product.
 Amazing sound and loudness out of such a small rectangle!
 Love how lightweight this speaker is. I've had it for several weeks and haven't had to recharge it yet! Good sound quality, but was hoping for more volume. Overall, nice speaker!
 Perfect for on the go.  Just wish it had forward and reverse control features.
 The battery can last for a long time and it's great sound for the price!
 Everything came as advertised. Good packaging, easy set up and operations. The range of blue tooth is great, better than my BOSE. The sound is good, but not better than my BOSE. Charge seems to be holding very well, listened for 4 hours without charging. I use outdoors and it has plenty of volume. I would by another.
 Really good! They stand by their product as well!
 Sound is great!!
 I could not be more satisfied with this purchase. Easy to use , amazing sound ! Super small yet powerful.
 the dynamite in sound with this little speaker system. happy camper here.
 super. love this.  This has made my life so wonderful.  I can easily take my music to any room in the house and even out to the patio
 Great speaker regardless of price point. It has plenty of bass if you don't require booming distortion. I liked mine so much I bought one for my folks who are just getting introduced to the Bluetooth world.
 Decent sound, good connectivity, and quite portable for the price.
 Good battery durability and wealth the price. I had almost a week now and I haven’t charged the battery.🙏👍
 It has excellent sound quality and is well made. The price was good and it shipped in a matter of a few days.
 Charging port went bad on both speakers.  Even if very careful. They are weak.  Great sound aside from that.  I do not know how to see if it is still under warranty.
 Very good sound. Multiple people asked about it the very first day I had it.
 Perfect for bedroom, bathroom and small environments. I still love it 😍
 Wish it synced to Two devices at a time but works great sounds great love the products from this company
 This is a crazy good little Bluetooth speaker!!  Going to buy more as gifts for the family.
 Purchased for my college aged daughter. She likes the sound and the sound for the small footprint is great.
 We have an Echo Dot that we use mainly for music.  This little speaker has great sound.  Love this guy!
 Amazing sound, long battery life, lasts a week or so for me on 8 hr days with medium volume level.
 Smaller than anticipated but for the price, it sounds great and the battery life is phenomenal.
 descent sound for such a small speaker
 Great product overall , nice audio foe the price , you can't beat it
 Great sound quality and volume.
 Love it
 Works every way and any where I want it.  Great power
 This is an awesome speaker. So small yet so powerful!

It does what it says, and I'm satisfied...but the bass just isn't great. There are some songs that don't make me go all melty because I miss the thump of my KRK monitors.  But!... Good news!  I stumbled on a competing device that is WAY better sounding!  JBL makes a line of cylindrical speakers: The Xtreme, which is huge but sounds SO GOOD. I'd go for the JBL Charge <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/JBL-Charge-3-Waterproof-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker-Black/dp/B01F24RHF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">JBL Charge 3 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Black)</a> which is not much bigger but has much better bass than the Anker.  I tried them both in a noisy airport electronics shop...and WOW real bass!  I played the first 20 seconds of "Angel" by Massive Attack (a strong bassline is critical to creating its dark wonderland) side by side with the Anker Soundcore here.  The Soundcore was kind of muttering into its beard "buh uhhhh uh-uh bmmm", and the JBL's bass was all staring you in the eye BUM BUMMM Bu-Bu BUMMMMM.  The JBL design is: put two bass drivers on the end (like lids on a can). Those drivers, like the KRK's, are small but move a LONG way, like an inch or more, to compress the air around it.  I've never seen drivers move farther than their cone diameter, but I think these did.<br/><br/>That said, I don't mind the Anker Soundcore.  It works fine. The battery lasts forever, and in quiet hotel rooms it sounds pretty OK.<br/><br/>My review below is still accurate. The volume controls are still annoying, and power button too: You have to HOLD ... NO, KEEP HOLDING IT.. to get it to turn on.  It doesn't ever accidentally turn on in my luggage though, unlike my stupid razor, but designers, surely there's a better way to avoid this than inflicting a tiny pain on the user every time they use your device.  And, like every Bluetooth device I've ever owned, it NEVER re-connects itself if you use another bluetooth device. It's like a jealous ditzy lover: you have to make it forget you and then it's no problem to reconnect.  (this is a design flaw with Bluetooth itself, no Anker's fault, I believe. I can't wait for NFC or something to kill Bluetooth entirely.)  The JBLs were just as annoying, FYI.<br/><br/>Seriously, I wish ALL these devices' product managers would call me and have me redesign their controls.  I'd let them kill their competition just by tweaking their controls to bring users a tiny bit of pleasure, not pain, every use.  Then I'd redesign the aftermarket car stereos, and ...ahem.  wow, this iced coffee was really strong.  anyway.  But I am serious, product designers. Try me. I'll make you look great.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br/> I tested this little guy and it's two more expensive brothers against some high quality audio monitors in the video attached.<br/><br/>The short version is: Get this one.  The other devices are larger, more expensive, not enough louder or better.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/> - audio quality is decent, given the size.  Bass is lacking, of course, but it's definitely better than the LG G4 phone's speaker (which isn't terrible, actually)<br/> - nice size; I like the battery life/weight/power ratio (always a design tradeoff)<br/> - simple to use (standard plugs<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- cannot charge another device from its internal battery.<br/>- not waterproof<br/>- the usual crappy tap-tap-BOOP volume controls (same as almost all bluetooth speakers)<br/>- The buttons are stylishly blended into the case, so hard to see and use. At least they're fairly large, and have a click feeling when you find them.<br/><br/>Later I'll get a $300 bluetooth speaker and see if I can get ANY small portable device that sounds even half as good as my studio monitors.<br/><br/>The end.<br/><br/>PS - Here's a bonus volume control rant: Turning it up -- how loud is it? you get NO feedback...then a punishing BOOP sound when you reach max volume.  WANTED: a simple rotating volume knob, with a on/off detent!  You can SEE how loud it is. You can FEEL when you're at the max volume (knob won't turn farther). you can CLICK the entire device off. The latest headphone amps (e.g. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Magni-2-Headphone-Amplifier/dp/B00SCBKPW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Magni 2 Headphone Amplifier</a>) have them - YAY!.  These speakers are behind the times, punishing us with these stupid volume buttons.
 Great sound, easy to setup, connects to my phone effortlessly.  Phone calls are intuitive and good quality.
 Been using it, love it.
 Not the best in the market ... But the price is right and gets the job done!
 Excellent lil speaker!
 This is just a great speaker the size is awesome and the sound is great
 I bought this unit last year to use with our motor home tv which has really bad audio.  Initially all was very good but by the end our summer tour, say 12 weeks, charging was becoming very difficult as the USB connector would not maintain a connection for more than a few seconds assuming it would even connect.  It was my intention to junk the unit but as with all good intentions I forgot.  Well,  now I am paying the price of my lack of memory and tomorrow it's a trip to Best Buy or Wally World of I can find one while we travel!!!
 Great sound, I purchased it for myself but my 15 yr old took it over.
 Put through a lot of stress in restaurant kitchens, still plays perfectly. Loud
 I love it so much
 For its price, you can't beat it.
 This speaker is great! The battery lasts well over a month with daily use. I love it. And the sound is great. Easily pairs with phone and computer. Very happy with it.
 Great quality sound for our apartment, not too loud not too soft.
 Great speakers works well we had to buy 3 more!
 Nice clear sound and fairly loud for indoors/outdoors.  Good value for the price.
 I like the concept of this speaker. However, the speaker doesn't keep a connection. The connection constantly drops whether I'm next to the speaker or 10 feet away.
 You cant beat it for the price.  Big sound in a small package.
 I like that its loud enough for me to hear music all through my 533 square foot apartment. And I also like little rubber feet on the bottom
 Great sound
 I give a try to this Anker speaker. I have a Bose Mini II but want another Bluetooth speaker for outdoors and the Soundcore its so good, the construction its good, bass and mid-range sound its awesome and has powerful volume. Very easy to connect on Samsung tablet or cellphone. The battery duration....wowwww.....its awesome. I use it for 16 hours and still has energy for more hours.<br/><br/>PRO:<br/>1. Very compact<br/>2. Light weight (better for travel)<br/>3. Excellent sound for a room.<br/>4. The battery its awesome...I play 16 hours without a charge.<br/>5. Easy connection to any of my Androids, phone, tablet, etc.<br/>6. Very good construction<br/>7. 3W each woofer<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>1. It doesn't came with a power cord for charging it.<br/>2. At maximum volume the sound its not so good as 50% or 80%.<br/>3. The sound bass its not so powerful but its acceptable.\<br/>4. Anker name in the front so big its a no-no.<br/>5. Low charging<br/><br/>I love my Bose Mini II but for the price for what you get with the SoundCore I left my Bose on my room now and take the Anker enywhere, Anker really do a Home Run with it. Yes I know, there are other Bluetooth Speakers less expensive with the same power, but it doesn't have a duration battery like the SoundCore or look so good. After looking to a case I found it here in Amazon and works perfect for protection and travel. Find it here: http://www.amazon.com/Souindcore-AK-A3102011-Portable-bluetooth-Carrying/dp/B01D4BY2SC?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00
 Great little speaker. Nice and loud and simple to use. Very nice color as well and I get compliments for it often.
 I feel the bass isn't good.  Other than that I really like it
 Great sound!  Just the right size.
 I bought many Anker products before and I was never disappointed with the quality, this stands true for these speakers, good sound quality, user friendly and just fun to use.
 I would prefer to get the Soundcore 2 or Does Soundbox  ! This one doesn't have that much bass but it does last like it says.
 Great speaker for the money. Very portable.
 My perfect addition to outdoor patio making my iphone music easy listening!
 Great speaker
 Easy to set up and great volume
 3rd Product from Anker - awesome stuff.
 Long battery life. used daily for podcasts. Sounds great.
 Nothing to add.
 Bought this as a Christmas gift for one of my daughters who is not allowed to have her phone in her room, so the Bluetooth range was a big factor in choosing this particular speaker. She's quite happy with having one, so that was my biggest concern. She's also pretty happy with the sound. She's into hip hop and says the equalizer settings are just right for her tastes.
 so far as i am totally happy, with the speaker system,,tu very much,,I highly recommend it to other customers...
 I was surprised by the sound quality of such a small speaker. I use it on a shelf in my shower, out of the range of any water spray, and it works great. Battery life is great
 Works pretty good, just like a wanted.
 Could be a little louder but not bad
 The quality of the sound is awesome.  However, this speaker stopped working after 3 months.. Would not recommend.  You get what you pay for.
 Great sound, light and compact to take anywhere, only complaint is that it was difficult to learn how to use it. ( but I am not tech savvy) instructions are in French, Japanese, and Spanish. English instructions are only pictures? But now that I can use it, I am VERY happy with it.
 Use for better sound from small TV in Kitchen.  3.5mm plug for sound and connect speaker USB to TV.  Works great
 I know it's got a gazillion great reviews, but it's just not that into me, OK? It isn't that we haven't tried to work it out, SoundCore and me. She's a fickle one. Sometimes the SC pairs, and it's lovely (mostly, more later), but frequently she doesn't and I have to tell iPhone to fugeddaboutit. Then we re-pair, and it's lovey-dovey for awhile.<br/><br/>So the other problem. Speakerphone. Sometimes clear, other times callers say "can't understand anything you say."<br/><br/>A champ, however, and playing music loud.<br/><br/>For the low thirties, it was worth a try. I think I will introduce her to my Echo Dot.<br/><br/>Update: Anker suggested that my unit was defective and sent me another. I am very happy to say that tru love has blossomed between my iPhone and the SoundCore. They are now a firmly attached pair! I am changing my review to five stars for pairing ease, sound quality (at this price point) and loudness.
 Am very pleased with the Anker product and the people at Anker are very professional.  Had to replace the first one I bought and everyone at Anker made sure the process was quick and easy.  Got my replacement in a matter of a few days, works great!!  Thanks again at Anker!
 I love love love this speaker!! Amazing sound! I haven't charged it in over a month and use almost everyday for 2 hours or more a day!! For the price I wouldn't pass this speaker up!!
 Love everything about this speaker, but could use more bass!!
 EDIT 4/26/17 --  The speaker came almost fully charged, so I didn't charge it myself before using.  As noted below I was having a lot of static.  I initiated a return.  Anker contacted me, beseeching me to fully charge the product.  I did.  I've been using it for about 6 to 8 hours on that charge. (My phone indicates it's still almost fully charged.)  No static yet.  Hence, I'm amending my review.<br/><br/>One of the reasons I bought it was for the speakerphone.  Used it for a half hour call yesterday and it did great.<br/><br/>Aesthetics:  good.  It has a rubberized matte finish and the power button is picking up a lot of fingerprint.  I can live with it.<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>I can't use/ tolerate it.  After 15 minutes interference sets in.  Maybe I got a bad unit, but I'm moving on to the next product.
 Perhaps not as loud as my Bose Soundlink II but for the price, it is well worth having a few of these around. I purchased the red and it looks nice!
 Great speakers with great sound! The Bluetooth is great to connect with any device and it is small enough to pack up and take anywhere. Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it!
 Loved this at first. Won't charge after 6 months. Trying to figure out if I can exchange it
 After trying several bluetooth speakers this is by far best all around value. Sounds great, long battery life, adequate construction all for under $40.00. Also long enough usb charging cord. Some others came with a cord that was so short that I couldn't charge it anywhere.<br/>Can't go wrong with this one. Way better overall than Bose for 3X as much.
 Worked well for about two months. Now won’t connect to any device. Can see it in discovery but never connects. I guess you get what you pay for.
 This is a great little compact speaker.  Doesn't take up much space and sounds great.  The built in mic for phone calls works just fine as well.
 My niece loves her new speaker.
 Great product for the money!
 great little speaker, my whole family enjoys it!
 The controls lie on top of the unit in the same color as the unit and are not clearly visible.  Instructions could also be a little clearer for first use. Otherwise, the unit works great.
 I’m so excited about my new Anker!!
 Very good quality especially for the price!
 Louder than expected. Incredibly easy pairing.
 I bought it like 5 months ago. I have NEVER charged it. We use it like 3x a month for at least an hour and it is still running without being recharged. The sound it provides is great for its size. Easy to pair with my android phone and echo dot. Small enough to be taken anywhere. Love it!
 Sound quality and loudness, leave a lot to be desired. Kinda disappointed.  The Sound Core 2 came out right after I purchased  the Sound Core.  The Anker company replied immediately.<br/>Great customer service.
 Great little speaker! Fills a large room well.
 Delivered and works very well!
 great sound for the size and price. Have yet to buy an anker product I don't like.
 Nice tunes to take with you wherever you go.
 great sound, charge lasts, and i can walk away from bonfire 50ft and still picks up on signal. Sounds just as good as my bose for much better price
 Good price, reasonably solidly built, sounds good at low volumes and even puts out a little bass. Indicator light on the front blinks continuously when connected via cable, which is a bit annoying.
 Our Anker just arrived today and we are enjoying the sound. It was so easy to set up! We have decided to purchase two more.
 VERY GOOD
 Excellent speaker for the price. The sound isn't the absolute best you'll ever find, but it's very, very good for what you pay for. I love this speaker.
 Great sound quality
 I've had this for a  month now, it's great. The sound is nice and the battery life is what they say. Great purchase for the cost.
 Great sound quality and connects quickly with my phone. Works well even when I take my phone 40 feet away with 2 walls in between. This is great!
 Put this in a family grab bag for Christmas. Seemed to be a big hit!!
 Great
 This is the second Anker SoundCore I purchased, this one was a gift. It replaced an older bluetooth speaker and the recipient loves it. Thanks!!
 Great battery life, sounds amazing, not heavy at all. I can use it at work for 8 hours straight, 3 days in a row, at max volume, before the battery hits 10%.
 Best speaker i could ever get for the price. The sound quality is great! The range is exceptional! And it feels solid and comfortable to carry around, I'm not scared of it breaking. I tie it to my quad/atv and drive around with the volume up and you can still hear it and it doesn't break on those bumpy roads. Definitely would buy again!
 very loud and works well.
 The sound is amazing! I think it sounds better than the $200 name brand one my mom has.. The product itself is sleek and lightweight, but doesn't feel cheaply made. Definitely worth the money
 Great speaker. Loud and clear. Would recommend and purchase again.
 The Anker didn't connect with my kindle.  Was going to give as a gift. Couldn't do that became it's to difficult to pair with various tablets.
 Anker never disappoint! Great product and worth the price.
 Bought this for my review on my Youtube channel. However, I can see that this is an excellent purchase. The design is simplistic but durable with the soft plastic but I'd recommend not dropping it too often. The small form factor earns it many points in terms of portability and for the price, you get great sound quality. Highs and Mids are very good and vocals are quite clear as long as you don't have it at max volume. Bass is decent but not too breathtaking. Connection via bluetooth is fast and simple. I took a star off because there are no skip track buttons and the buttons themselves don't have much of a tactile reaction when pressing them. The battery life is spectacular and I recommend this for anyone on the go or even for the household as it can definitely fill up a small to medium size room with audio. A great buy for the price and highly recommended.
 Good size speaker that wont break the bank. Sound quality is good and the product is built very well. For the price, consumers are getting a great product that I feel is worth more
 Excellent sound and pairs easily.
 Excellent quality for the size and price.<br/>Great built quality.<br/>Only thing I didn't like with the speaker<br/>(red colour) that is the material seems to be very easily stain so make sure your hands are clean and grease free while moving or pressing the buttons.
 So far so good . Only had it a few days but works good . Time will tell will update in few weeks
 Purchased for my husband.  He loves it.  Good quality for the price.
 Great sounding and easy to install!  Worth every penny.  Highly recommend it.
 Connect easily and sound good.
 love it
 Good sound. Į connected it to my Echo Dot and it will stay connected and work properly for more tha n 7 days with minimal use.
 LOVE IT!!
 The speaker arrived fast and I have no complains. It's loud, clear, and easy to use.
 Great little speaker for the price.
 This is a great speaker! Works better than expected, consider it to be well worth the price. The battery life is amazing, use it outside, inside in construction and holds up and keeps  looking good has a tough rubber type coating that is very well constructed and hold up well! Had for over a year and buying another for my son!
 Really loud. And clear.. Love it..
 I bought this for a travel trailer it is more than enough speaker if you're not trying to blast it outside.
 Great small speaker.  Connects easily. Very good sound.  Easy to use and is so portable.
 Very pleased with this little guy.  I have a Rukus and this one is louder and clearer.
 It says the bass and sound are loud but it’s not that loud
 Yes the sound core is the most awesome thing I own. I use it everyday at work I like that it's so portable and sounds great also I use the blue tooth hands free with my iPhone in my car religiously. I just wish it came with the wire to plug into my iPod. Thank you for putting out such a great product I'm spreading the word to all my friends. Take care!!!Dave Rogers
 Love this speaker. Great sound for its size. Better for music than for. say, spoken word streaming, which it has a bit too much bottom end for. However, very satisfied and intend to get a second, although the version II. Extremely long battery life.
 Great for its price.
 Best BT speaker for the money!!!
 Great quality in sound so long as it's not on the highest setting
 Very unhappy with product. Constantly cuts out even after full charge. Have tried leaving several messages with customer service. Not one return call back.
 So far so good, no complaints on this speaker. I took it on my cruise to the Bahamas and it worked like a charm. I even had my phone inside charging while the speaker was outside on the patio and it never lost connection. I would recommend this for sure!
 stopped working after 1 month!
 Couldn't be happier with this little speaker. Gets nice and loud, connects easily, long-lasting charge. Would buy again in a heartbeat
 Battery lasts forever. Good sound!
 It was definitely smaller than I was thinking it would be, but it puts out decent sound for its size. It also pairs really easily with a Bluetooth device.
 Nice sound from such a small bluetooth speaker, battery life is great.
 For the price you cannot beat this speaker.  The sound is great &amp; it is easy top use.
 I am absolutely happy with this product and at a really good price it is worth the price
 A lot of Boom for the buck!!!
 Great value buy.  Perfect for what we needed, easy setup and pairing with our iPhone.
 Not very loud
 Excellent sound, just what I wanted, and a great price too.
 works better than expected
 Reviews are accurate, sounds great, very compact, and great battery life
 Too be so small, this speaker packs a punch. Great sound and bass. Excellent quality and as a first time buyer,  would buy Anker again.
 Great play charge time .
 this is a great speaker, i added this to my echo dot and it sends out great sound...
 Everything was great with the ordering and the shipment, arrived on time. It was a gift and I have been told that the sound is very good, not tinny, and that the charge last a long time. Happy with purchase.
 Much smaller that I expected.
 Great fun. So glad I purchased it. So nice to have something with my last name on it.
 Best speaker on the market in my opinion, It is loud and the battery lasts forever.
 Sound is great, although the bass is really low. Another thing is I can't go more than 15ft without t starting to lose connection so the advertised distance is not accurate. If I go into another room it loses connection through walls as well. So far I've played it for about 3 hours on a full charge and no sign of battery drainage yet. Will continue to update, just wish the distance was longer.
 Loud, quality, and compact. I love this little speaker!
 Pairs beautifully and reliably when laptop wakes up.  Sound quality is excellent and haven't tested battery life yet but expect it to be as reported; LONG.  Reliable, nice simple design, easy controls, Only possible drawback is not waterproof, but I will gladly care for this like the rugged but quality device it is, in return for its performance.
 You can hear the music, it feels cheaply made, somewhat flimsy.
 Bought this product a long time ago and it's still working great. 100% would buy again.
 Anker Anker Anker insane battery life good sound I love this thing !!!!
 It sounds great for the price. The lasts quite a bit, so far 14 hours without needing to be charged. So far so good.
 Sounds good (balanced treble-midrange-base), long lasting battery, tough rubber case. I drive a bus and I can now have tunes on the job.
 Awesome sound!
 Good for kitchen and sewing room.  Compact and simple.
 Love the size, feels hefty and cord stays plugged into unit. Downfall is that it's raspy sounding. The s all sound like a bunch of snakes talking
 Love it.
 Excellent sound even at highest level. Very clear sound and smooth bass.
 LOVE this speaker. Sounds great - especially for its size. Battery life is actually better than advertised.
 really nice and handy, I used it outside and inside.. great volume range.. just what I needed, and very affordable
 I love this speaker. I’ve had a blue one for a few years and it’s still going strong. Thought I’d buy another to keep in the bathroom for shower concerts
 Love this...it says it stays charged for 24 hours, but it seems like it lasts longer, and sound quality is great,and we just pick it up and carry it outside if we want music outside.Great deal for the money!
 very good sound from a unit this size and the battery life is great , will play all day plus more.
 I bought this for my 16-year-old son and he loves it! Great quality, great sound.
 Amesome battery life,  very loud,  clean crisp sound
 I was surprised by how small the speaker was,  but then amazed by the sound quality and level.  Seems to be a well constructed speaker and performs great for such a low cost device.
 I use this speaker in the classroom.  It really fills the space well.  Sound is clear and my students love it:)!
 Amazing little speaker! Strong construction, great sound, ridiculously long battery life!
 Just what I wanted in blue tooth speaker.<br/>Sounds great and battery last all day long.<br/>Well made unit. feels sleek and solid.  Battery Charges full in just an hour.
 Awesome bang for the buck. I bought two different models and both are amazing
 VERY GOOD especially for the price, 16 year old daughter likes it!
 Very nice quality and sound for someone who likes to listen to music but isn't a pure audiophile.
 Great product, weather proof! Okay not recommended, but I accidentally left this out in the poring rain for five hours, I set it in the sun to dry out before I started it up, works perfectly!  100% great product!
 Got this on sale for $25. Can't complain. Not as much bass as some of the more expensive speakers but the battery life so far is much longer, so, not really a downside unless you listen to music with a lot of bass.
 I liked my first Anker Soundcore so much that this is my second one for another device.  Would highly recommend.
 Great sound from a small speaker, simple and easy to use
 This speaker is small on size but big on quality sound!  I bought it to use with my Amazon Echo Dot, and the sound quality is very impressive.
 works
 This little guy sounds great!
 Somewhat disappointed in the meager bass response. Otherwise quite good.
 awesome range and clarity and it lasts forever....<br/>but as of 06/30/18 the device doesn’t connect to my Bluetooth devices anymore.
 great on golf cart and poolside.
 Updated review: thank you so much for helping me with my anker. I highly recommend the vendor and product. The customer service was above and beyond. A new anker was sent to me after a rep reached out and tried to ensure I had a positive experience. Thank you!
 Awesome portable speaker, Anker makes great charging cables and this speaker is just as great.
 Great speaker! the sounds is just awesome! Battery life is great and it is super easy to connect and use. Very sturdy also.<br/><br/>My only complaint is it seems like the blue tooth distance isn't very good, I can't walk away with my phone. But the speaker is light and small so I just take it with me. For the price I defiantly recommend it!
 Good sounding speaker for the price. Has good Bluetooth range. Ok volume could be louder good for medium sized room I brought it to work at a warehouse and can hear from about 50 feet away ok
 The Battery is great! Sometimes I don't charge it for days, and I play rain sounds every night for about 6 to 7 hours a day.
 Works and charges great
 I was really trying to find a speaker that had superior sound quality with a good battery.  I find it in this speaker.  The sound quality is truly amazing especially for the price point.  I set it in the corner of the room and it fills up the room with quality sound.  My living room is 15x 30 with 17' cathedral ceilings and the sound is amazing.  Outside this speaker doesn't disappoint. I take it to a family get together and don't have to worry about the battery running it half way through the day.  And I can wall with my phone more than 10' away from it without losing signal unlike other speakers.  I would very much recommend this to my friends and family.
 Good quality product. Thumbs up!

Perfect for kids and for travel.  Check out the video to hear sound quality.
 Wow incredible. Better quality than beats at a quarter of the price.
 Love it
 It's vary good way better then I expected for the price. Vary happy with it.
 Very nice little speaker that has transformed my workouts by allowing me to have some music for distraction without sweaty headphones or earbuds.
 Good product for money. No issue so far. We use it every day. The base is good, although it might be too much so the treble is rather dull. Battery can last full day.
 considering it is a small Bluetooth speaker.....sound quality is good, battery life is probably right around 24 hrs...I use mine periodically through out the day and charge it once a week.  I think it is a good deal For $35
 Fantastic sound. Great price for the quality. Hard to believe 24 hour battery life in small package.
 This little speaker is AMAZING! The amount of sound and quality is a lot more than I expected! The price is a steal! Awesome little speaker!
 It will not charge. I only got to use it once. Horrible. Very disappointed.<br/>Edit: the manufacturer contacted me and sent me a replacement super quick. The new one works good. I was happy with their customer service.
 Love it
 Great sound, easy to connect, rugged and portable.  Everything I needed in a BT speaker.
 awesome sound , works great you can be as far as 60ft from device and still working,
 Very pleased with this speaker. I like the range, the sound, and the length of battery life. They are all remarkable.
 The speaker has a solid build quality. The black speaker has a rubberized coating which is wonderful to grip. This will inevitably rub off over time especially if not kept in a case when traveling with in a backpack for example. The volume level is respectable and does not distort at full volume. There other other speakers that will get louder yet not offer the sound quality this one offers at a $25 price point!<br/><br/>I knocked off 1 star for one reason: I specifically purchased a small BT speaker in hopes to find a way to utilize it's built in mic to record lectures to Audinote (app) on my MacBook as there aren't apparently BT desktop microphones available. Amazon and other sites show this speaker has a built-in mic and I can physically see one on the speaker. Yet the Anker website and product manual states there is no built-in mic (see screen shot). Additionally there is suppose to be a "scratch off product code" provided in order to register for warranty. The site states they will not warranty the speaker without this yet there was no such code provided.<br/><br/>To contact support there is an email address only. I have reached out to them twice receiving generic automated responses stating support will respond "as soon as possible".<br/><br/>I feel that a product is only as good as the company supporting that product. Them not acknowledging the microphone and offering no info in the manual about it is a red flag to me. I will update once I have more info to share.
 Great price and battery last very long.
 It's a little smaller than I thought it would be but the sound is pretty good.  I was hoping for a little more pop but for the price it is good.
 The battery life of this speaker is outstandting.. it's better than I could have ever expected. The sound is everything I would expect from the size. One of the best porches I've made.
 REVISED REVIEW: The first Anker Soundcore I got would not charge and I returned it. This is the review I wrote at that time:<br/>"Got this yesterday and set it up to charge. The first charger I tried didn't work (red light flickered and charger light flickered - learned here that that meant it wasn't charging properly); switched chargers, got the steady red light which is supposed to mean it's charging. I tried out the speaker for a minute or 2 (while charging) with a 35mm input attached to an ipod and it sounded good. Left it to charge from 3pm yesterday until noon today and now nothing: will not turn on, will not turn on if plugged into charger, although steady red light says it charging again. Currently it's a $36 brick and it's going back."<br/>Anker then bent over backward to resolve my dissatisfaction, and ultimately sent me a new Soundcore. This one didn't like any of the chargers I had on hand, but charged fine off my computer. I had no problem synching the bluetooth. The only further complication was that when using the bluetooth, the Soundcore gave an annoyingly loud BEEP everytime I tried to change the volume. After finding nothing about this problem anywhere on line, I discovered by accident that this beep actually alerts me that the volume can go no higher or no lower. This wasn't immediately obvious as the sound output at the time was not so high or low - the confusion was because of the volume level on the *connected device* - NOT the Soundcore. Not sure this explanation makes sense, but if your Soundcore beeps when  you change the volume, adjust the volume on your connected phone, tablet or computer and that should solve it.<br/>All that said, the sound is quite good and plenty loud.
 Excellent
 The 1000's of reviews on this device have it dead on - well made, great sound, does what it is promoted to do.  Purchased this to pair with an Amazon Dot.  Am happy this is the choice is that I made.
 Works and doesn't sound horrible.
 I like the product, and customer service is great!
 Awesome portable sound quality
 this is fabulous!
 Purchased as a present for my boss. She loves it. great sound and problem free
 Good sound quality, will be buy it again, anker always maintaing good quality in their products.-
 So great I decided to buy another one the same day it arrived. I've always bought Anner products I decided to give this one a try and I've got to say its amazing.
 Purchased as Christmas gift.  After some use I discovered a issue with the usb port.  Sent the issue to Anker and it was handled quickly and to my complete satisfaction.  Great customer service!!!  And the sound quality is superb for a speaker of this size.
 Very good sound great
 GREAT Sound for the compact size!! Instant Bluetooth setup. Internal battery life is good too.
 Great product very loud with great sound quality l would recommend anytime
 Good speaker. Battery life is great can play over 8hrs of music andvstill have a good charge.
 I love the look and feel of this bluetooth speaker. Super easy to connect via bluetooth to my phone. Perfect to accompany my summer days spent by the pool!
 Bluetooth has worked without a problem and sound quality has been great.  I have used several times over the past two weeks.  I'm very happy with this great little speaker.  Good quality and at an affordable price.
 Excellent speaker for the price! Compares to one a friend bought for $100. more.
 really good quality, good battery life and awesome sound.
 LOVE this speaker!!!
 For the price, this is a very nice speaker.  Connect via bluetooth seamlessly.  Output is pretty loud and base is adequate.
 Perfect sound and small enough that it doesn't take up too much space.
 Ordered this for my son who is 17 and he loved it! He said that it was easy to set up and the sound was great!
 Excellent product. Only weak point is a lack of bass but it's somewhat expected at this size. Battery life is such a great feature.
 I really love this. Really Affordable, sounds great low or high volume, and truly amazing battery life. Just awesome is all I can say. I got the blue one and it's a very attractive and vibrant blue color. A+
 Great Value!
 I gave it to someone and he seems very happy with it. Sound fills the room, which is great.
 Used as a wireless blues tool speaker for listening to audio. It works.
 Totally changed the atmosphere of my home
 Blue tooth connection just stopped working on two of these I have purchased...<br/>Not worth aggravation...
 the usb charging port breaks easily but it lasted me along time. 2 years not bad.
 This is a really good wireless speaker for the money . The sound is great and it is the size we were looking for.  As others have said, it is not a Bose, but then it costs much less. We are using it for travel and for the price and sound quality, I would definitely recommend. Also, I am no electronics geek. This was very easy to set up and use.
 Excellent speaker for price!
 Good little speaker.  I would however spend the little extra money and get the Sound Core Boost by Anker.
 Works great! Sound quality is loud and clear.
 This is a good speaker for the price I just wish the volume could go a little louder
 Can’t go wrong buying this speaker! Great battery life and sound quality for the price!
 Not quite the quality I had hoped for. But for the price I guess it is OK.
 a great speaker from a great company
 Worked for 30 minutes then would not link up
 I got this for my son , and he's pretty satisfied about the quality of the sound and battery life.<br/>The box just looked bigger on the site , so he was kinda disappointed about it's size , but everything<br/>else is ok . No charger came with it , just the cable .
 Works good
 Great sound
 Worked despite being burried under a foot or more of snow on a recent trip in sub freezing temps for hours.
 This speaker is awesome, great sound and feels to be made very well. I would recomed this to anyone looking for a Bluetooth speaker.
 Very nice speaker.  Easy to use, easily pairs with ipad, phone, etc.
 Very satisfied with the product and especially the customer support at Anker. I had a problem with a cable and they immediately took care of it and made things right . Very impressed with thier service ..
 Wrote review a of being stuck in pairing mode. Anker said that they would resolve my problem and they did.<br/>So 5 stars to Anker and their support.
 Really great!
 Great product for the price. Easy set-up, rugged design, and great sound. Even better, the charging port was damaged just 6 months after purchase and Anker sent me a replacement immediately (because of the 18 month warranty). Great product and great customer service.
 fills multiple rooms with sound, incredible!
 I really wanted a good bluetooth speaker so I didn't always have to have earbuds jammed into my ears. I looked on Amazon, checking out the cheapest ones first. The first thing I do is read the "one star" reviews, as I feel they will tell me the shortcomings that I want to avoid. I was tempted to purchase one of the cheaper models, but decided to look for something at a reasonable price that would check all, or most, of the boxes. I came across this Anker product, and lo-and-behold, all the reviews were either 4 or 5 stars. I read a good number of them and was convinced that this was the one for me.<br/><br/>I have no "cons" to write about, so I'll give some "pros". This speaker provides great range. I had my iPod in my bedroom and took the speaker out to my garage, which is about as far away as I could get. Other than one slight delay, it received perfectly. Can't do that with my Bose earbuds! The sound that is produced is very good. Connectivity to my Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy pads work quickly. I had to "disconnect" my earbuds from my iPod before it would connect, but I think that is an Apple problem. Like a child, it hates to share. Another bonus: when you hit the power button (hold for two seconds) to turn it off, it also stops the iPod.<br/><br/>In short, I am very pleased with this unit and would highly recommend it.
 I now own 2 of these. Great!
 Everything is good
 Great battery life, small and portable. It could be a little louder though.
 Was a gift
 Amazing sound quality and portability! Great price for a Bluetooth speaker. Long battery life between charges and comes in stylish colors.
 My first Anker product. A great speaker for an unbeatable price.
 Good speaker for the price.
 Poor sound quality. Hums and and picks up electrical interference. Cheap speaker.
 I was very unimpressed with how this speaker sounded.  24hr battery life was cool but maybe they should have focused on a little more of that battery power go to the speakers.  I gave it two stars because its a cool concept to have that much run it just needs more sound.
 Great sound and great price!
 Amazing speaker for price. Good sound.
 It works great and we love it for our Alexa!
 This speaker is incredibly easy to use (important for me...) and the sound quality is fantastic.  Love it!
 Amazing amazing sound. You can  actually use this for a big party it's that loud and good. This sound quality is amazing.very crisp and loud
 Great sound at at great price. Works very well with my Kindle to listen to my audiobooks.
 Love it!!  Great sound for the small package.
 This speaker works great. Good sound and easy to sync. Charges up quick.
 Not as good a speaker as the Jambox, the controls on top require a little time to get use to.  They are a little difficult to use, and hard to see in low light (Just got to remember the power button is above the "A").  But for the sale price of 26.99 well worth the price if the Jambox is not in your budget.  Excellent sound.
 Good quality sound. Sits stable on desktops and countertops.
 Great build quality and fantastic battery life. Anything ANKER is fabulous and worth while. Always Fantastic! Anker Rocks!! Keep up the great work!
 The battery lasts forever and it sounds great, gets really loud. Easy to connect to all of our devices and very durable
 Bought this for a Chromcast audio system when it was on sale.  You get slightly more than what you pay for with this speaker with my biggest complaint being the pretty bad bass and biggest like being the volume.
 very loud works great!
 Awesome speaker! Small speaker with amazing sound! Great for on your desk or sitting outside. Would definitely recommend!
 Lot a bang for the buck
 Plays music. Bluetooth hype.
 Surpassed my expectations. I really love this speaker. When i first got it and opened the box. I saw that the speaker was small. Sound quality its great. Pretty loud.  Totally recommended
 very high sound quality and performance despite as cheap price
 This speaker is amazing and the batteries last for ever. I am pleased
 Perfect Pricing and fast delivery... thank you so much! Perfect Sound!
 Great speaker for a great price. Perfect
 Hooked to a 50" HDTV and sounds like an expensive sound bar. I would recommend this product.
 Great rich sound from such a small speaker.
 Great sound but for me the huge advantage is the connectivity reach of the speaker.  Love keeping Echo Dot inside house and enjoying music outside.
 Excellent sound
 Bluetooth connected to my phone for a day and it hasn’t connected to my phone since. Just says pairing unsuccessful every time.
 Speaker sounds fantastic. It connects quickly and lasts all day.
 This is the 2nd Anker speaker I have purchased.  The sound quality is great and I love the 24 hour battery life.
 Great sound, easy to set up and use.  All Anker products are high quality.
 Very good sound for the money
 Have this Speaker hook to my phone's Pandora, sound quality is just as good as any of the fancy expensive mayor brands.
 Sounds great. Battery lasts forever. Use mine while in the shower and haven't had to charge it since September. Great range
 Shortly after purchase, I found that I have to place the speaker in a verticle position ( USB port up) for charging.<br/>This is the only way to I can have a proper connection with USB cable for charging.<br/>This is a fine speaker with the exception of this quirk.
 It worked great I just needed something bigger. Perfect for a small party.
 Great speaker for the money. Works great in my office
 loud, clear, last a long time
 This product is great
 I need to have sound in various rooms. I looked at Sonos but the quality and price point was too much for me. I basically need room filling sound. My Echo device works great in the living room/kitchen for that need.  Moving to the Master Bedroom I wanted to add a Dot device a pair it with a speaker.  The SoundCore fills the bill nicely.  In my setup I also ordered an Anker wall charger (speaker does not come with one) and a 10 ft. USB charging cable.  I put the speaker out of sight on top of an armoire  which hid the speaker and the charging cord.  Pairing was quick and efficient. I did set the volume to high on the speaker so the Dot ("Alexa, set sound to 4...) can control the sound level. The speaker fills our large MB with sound and plays nicely at low and high sound levels. Mid level settings produce the fullest sound but any level is fine and there is no distortion. The cost for the speaker, cable, charger and Dot  were about $110 compared to the $199 for Sonos Play1 which requires a device to drive it. Yes, in a Sonos system you can play sound through all the speakers, but I really like the "limitation" of the Echo environment that you can only play songs (currently) through the device you requested a song from. Besides that the Dot can control my NEST thermostat and latter any lights or other IoT devices I connect.
 I purchased this product in December and suddenly stopped working on the 27th of February. I am not pleased.
 Great speaker !! Online support, too.
 Great quality
 This battery literally lasts for days!<br/>I think it says 24 hrs, it will play music for days if u don't have it maxed out. I'm going to purchase another one to give as a gift. Best Bluetooth speaker ever!
 works great!!
 The sounds is pretty impressive for the size and price.  It has great range as well.  I know I was close to 60 feet outside around a corner and the sound was just there always. Pretty good build as well.  The feeling of that matte rubber around the body makes it feel sturdy.
 Actually a bit surprised, as the speaker has  great sound at a great price.
 I use this at work. It is awesome sound quality and plays through an entire 8 hour shift at full volume and still has battery to play longer after I get home. Volume could be louder but overall I love it!
 Second day with it and I love it! The color is just as pictured, super pretty, and it's surprisingly loud for the size. I also didn't expect the bass to be so good so that was a nice surprise. I would totally recommend this speaker!
 Maybe I got a "lemon" but has very short charge and most the time have to plug to a power source or won't work at all.  Sound is great. But really have to play with buttons to make things happen
 There might be better, but this is pretty damn good.
 perfect
 The sound is great and the speaker is small enough that I can take it with me.
 This unit has done a great job of playing audio books and music from my iPod and my iPhone.
 Can't complain.  The sound quality is pretty good and I like listening to lectures with it.
 The sound is excellent..!!!!<br/>Had a BBQ, used it outside linked to my phone and friends couldn't believe the beats came from only this Anker box.<br/>Perfect purchase!
 Great battery life, range and sound
 It sounds great for what it is. Phone calls even sound decent on it. I take it in the garage when I am working. In the kitchen when I am cooking. The bathroom when I am .... well, you know.
 Great sound, easy to pair up with my Android phone. We bought two.
 Good value
 Smaller than imagined, bass not rich, good high pitch sound,bluetooth works very well.
 Works great.. sounds great.. battery last a long time!
 I loved this speaker, is convenient, small, good BT range and the best you can have party all night long and don't need to re charge.
 Excellent housing and sound, particularly for the price.  Plenty of volume for its size.  Good battery life, too.  Will recommend to family and friends.
 Great sound and amazing range on the Bluetooth!
 it works very well in closed area but loses it's fullness in large uncovered areas
 Great little speaker!  I would recommend this over the Jam Box because of price.  Also because it's a little bit bigger then the super thin J.B. I feel that the Anker has a little more base (or lows).
 Bought this for my wife about a month ago. She loves it and it works very well. The sound is excellent -almost Bose quality. Only drawback is that the initial charge took a very long time and it did not last long. I am hoping this is a fluke. If it continues then obviously the rating would be lower.
 This Bluetooth speaker does the job for me.<br/>Due to age related hearing problems the TV volume had to be high.Now the volume is normal<br/>with the Anker speaker close to my ears.
 This speaker has decent bass for its size, it's not extremely loud but adequate. It has good battery life.
 awesome speaker.  It will fill a room with sound.  Long lasting charge.
 Awesome speaker! Highly recommend!
 Great sound!! Paired easily. Can take my phone into other rooms throughout the house with no interruption.
 great sound form such a small device.  Very easy to use.
 Compact, portable and very  good sound especially for the price.
 Amazing sound..I'm just super happy with  the Anker speaker, easy to conect bluethoot, loud, clear ++++A I do recomend it this speaker for the price it is the best tou can get!!!!
 Stays charged for SO very long. Range does good rather than excellent. Very impressed for the price, was in the rain for two days and still works perfectly. I’m never disappointed with Anker.
 I drive a truck for a living, over-dimensional stuff mostly. Anyone who listens to an AM radio station in a vehicle is aware that any change in the electrical field around the radio will cause a change; static, buzzing, loss of signal. I have 6 constantly-blinking lights on my truck, in addition to the electronic log, GPS, cell chargers..... You get the idea. I have unlimited streaming on my phone, so I stream my favorite programs over my phone.<br/><br/>I'm in a 5 year old Western Star day-cab with a big CAT and an 18 speed sporting a chain-laden headache rack most of the day. The AC works, but we're required to have the windows down on job sites. This speaker performs beautifully in a quiet environment, and I'm very impressed with the sound in the truck as well. Considering its size, the bass is pretty good. The mid and high ranges are where this thing shines. The speaker is definitely directional, and the sound is greatly diminished in the case I purchased. I bought a soft sided (yet hard) case, https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FGEJWXU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 to protect it. I thought maybe the sound would penetrate the case - it does, but not well enough for my application. The battery charges quickly, and makes it through my 14 hour days without a problem.<br/><br/>The first time I used it on a job site, I walked away from it with my phone in my pocket. I heard the speaker roughly 50 feet away on a site with a dozer and track-hoe operating around 300 feet away. When I walked to the end of my truck, about 100 feet away, the guy by the cab of my truck said the speaker never cut out. Anker claims 66 feet, but it stayed connected at 100 feet for me. It may have had something to do with the steel trailer between the speaker and my phone (I never claimed to understand how Bluetooth works).<br/><br/>I highly recommend this speaker. In fact I'm buying a few more in the coming months to give as gifts.
 Amazing speaker for size and price. Great quality. Love all their products. Totally recommend.
 I purchased this speaker originally in Sept and after about a month it stopped working. I called Anker and they replaced the speaker and the new one arrived and seems fine.
 WOW  just hooked it up and am very pleased
 Love it - perfect size for portability and good sound!!
 After a month of use i must say it has great sound. But i am having issues with the speaker staying connected to my phone.  Now for some reason i cant even get it to pair up with my phone.
 I used it daily for about a month and only had to charge it once. Excellent battery life. Good sound quality. Portable. Easy to use. On/off button is a bit finaky, have to push at the right angle. Overall excellent.
 Solid construction. Easy to use and quality sound. Thanks.
 Big sound from a little speaker. Even at high volume it has little distortion.
 I love this speaker.  Fantastic sound.  No tiniest to it at all.  It filled the room with delightful sound.<br/><br/>Blutooth was easy to pair with my phone.  Signal strength was fine.  I got a good distance from my phone (down a little hallway and around a corner)  before the signal started breaking up.<br/><br/>I also have Flip speaker (the original one), which I adore.  The sound of the SoundCore is equal to the Flip at over half the cost.  The only place where the Flip surpasses the Soundcore is when it comes to the buttons.  The Flip has actual separate hard buttons.  The buttons on the Soundcore are almost a part of the unit and aren't easy to distinguish.  You kind of have to feel around like you are reading braille to use them.  Sure they are slightly  raised but are the same color as the unit so they blend right in.  aT the very least,  I wish they were a different color to stand out more prominently.  As tacky as it might seem, I might get a white sharpie and trace over the top of the buttons so I can see them better.<br/><br/>This is a great speaker at a fabulous price.  Never again will I spend $60-$90 (the cost of a Flip) on a portable speaker.  Goodbye Flip, hello SoundCore.  Anker products never disappoint-- I have purchased several.  This speaker is no exception.
 This speaket sounds fantastic and I only have to charge it once a week. Lasts all my work week on one charge. Love it!
 Just as advertised.  Wish it could communicate with my dot by using the built in mic, but other than that, very pleased.
 Love love love this speaker! The sound is really good for the price and I love the covering shell on the speaker so when my kids drop it it doesn't break :)
 Very satisfied, easy to pair good quality sound.<br/>I would recommend this product.
 Very good speaker at great price
 Music sounds a little muffled
 Love the ease of use and the ability to move it around easily.  I would have preferred more bass but it's not too bad !!
 Perhaps not the most amazing in sound quality but definitely above average as others have noted.<br/><br/>Battery life is great. Looks fairly nice and is simple to use.
 It is very loud and clear for its size. Love how easily portable it is AND the battery surprisingly lasts a very long time without charge.
 My son loves this with his echo dot
 Works great. The only problem is our 8 year old thinks it is hers even though I bought it for my husband. Guess I know what to get her for Christmas.
 The sound is good for the price, but my speaker would not pair with any device after 2 months of use. Now I am unable to use it for anything other than a paper weight.
 I never do reviews but I had to with this it is such a great product. The sound is great for the price I've went through at least five other Bluetooth speakers none of them work as well as this one definitely a great Buy.
 I now see why this is so highly rated, awesome amazing speaker for the price. Well worth it , sound is fantastic and speaker is solid and light weight.......
 Awesome sound quality and volume. Super long lasting battery. Seems very durable, good for any occasion.
 Great got one for my wife too
 love it.
 Excellent sound
 Great speaker for the size. Have not had to recharge yet. Very good sound.
 GREAT bluetooth speaker. Honestly sounds better than most I've seen -- especially the one by Beats.
 This speaker works great, holds a charge and sounds terrific!
 Great sound and supposedly 24 charge. We'll see, but certainly great sound.
 Power supply would have been nice.
 This is my favorite portable speaker. The sound is great, it connects fast and I rarely have to charge it.
 my fifth anker speaker - I also recomened them two others -another thumbs up to anker.
 I consider anything from Anker a premium product. This speaker is great.
 Great sound from such a little speaker.  Pairs very easily with our blutooth devices.
 I love it and for the price and sound quality I'm a very happy camper.
 Love it, Great Sound
 Me agradó muchisimo este articulo. Es bien economico y bien sonido. Todo una chulería !
 With these old eyes, it is hard to see the controls being black on black.
 works like a charm. I use it with Alexa Dot and is great
 Good quality and works well especially considering the price.
 Haven't had it for very long , but so far I like it.
 Great item for the price!!
 Great sound for the size.  We love Anker products.
 Bought one for myself, liked it so much I bought one for my daughter.  Big sound from a small speaker.
 Awesome speaker for the price! GREAT sound and battery life for size and price range! WOULD buy again.
 Using this with a Nexus 7 (13) tablet and a Nexus 6P phone. Sound is good, I can feel the air pushed out like a mini fan if my hand is in front of the speaker at higher volume. It gets loud, well enough for a room, more than enough if it's on a table in front of you. There is an audio in jack (no cable in the box) to plug in non-Bluetooth devices like older iPods.<br/><br/>When it is turned on, it will pair to a previously connected device quickly, within a few seconds (with a loud-ish two tone beep)<br/><br/>The speaker has some weight to it, like a small brick. I have not tested battery life but with the weight of this thing, it better be good. The shell (top, sides, bottom) is a hard rubber that will not slide on a table, 4 small bumps on the bottom act as cushions to minimize rattling of other items on the table when bass is played. Front and back panels seem to be plastic. I did not get a case for it, but have been using the box it shipped in as a case when it goes in my gear bag.<br/><br/>One very annoying gripe is that when you turn it up to max volume, you get a LOUD beep for almost a second to let you know you can't go any higher. If you use the + or - buttons on the speaker or volume buttons on your device, you can tap up to hit almost max level to avoid the beep. But if you swipe to rise volume (like in some audio and video apps) you can easily hit the max level and get that LOUD beep. I considered returning it just for that BEEP, but decided to keep it and try and use the hardware buttons to go to one level below max when turning it up.
 Tested the product when I receive it in good condition. I am quite happy with the sound quality. I still reserve 1 star here to make it 5 because this is the first time I use Anker bluetooth speaker. Hopefully I can use it for long time without any problem later on (touchwood!!!!!!) and before I recommend it to others.
 So I purchased my speaker and it wasn't turning on. Contacted customer service and they immediately shipped a new one out to me. The sound quality is really perfect. Very satisfied.
 The sound is everything I hoped it would be, it's range is great, and being able to use an AUX cable is nice. Occasionally there are some issues switching between devices on bluetooth, but nothing terrible. Definitely worth the money!
 Love the battery life, and it gets loud enough... Don't expect it to be a party speaker lol, but it's definitely sufficient for my bedroom or small kitchen.
 Works great! Great sound
 Works great with my Amazon Alexa, has great range!
 work as so
 Not as much depth in sound quality as I'd hoped, but certainly worth the price. Will help keep me company when working in the garage. Has excellent battery life and exceptional support from Anker Direct.
 Don't let this little speaker fool you....amazing sound!!!!
 This little speaker is awesome! The sound is very ballanced and crisp. The other day I walked outside and my kids said the speaker never missed a beat. Not sure if it is a full 24 hours of play time but I do know it takes a long time between charges.
 Great sound quality. Far better than my old Jambox Mini. Just to note, sound only comes up the front, unlike the Jambox.
 I love the sound of this speaker; this is the 2nd one that I purchased from this brand
 Took about two hours for initial charge but works great. Haven’t put it fully loud but sounds good at normal volume.
 Ver cool
 Works great - don't know about the 66 feet of range though
 Very pleased with the craftsmanship of the speaker, the quality of the sound, and the sturdiness of the packaging.  Definitely satisfied.
 Wonderful speaker for a great bargain. The bass is lacking a bit but, for the price, you can't beat it! I'm very satisfied
 Good speaker for the price. I highly recco...
 Gives great sound as an addition to our DOT
 Great sound and price. This is the second speaker I’ve bought because the first one I loved. Battery life is good, lasted a whole 8 hour shift on one charge. Definitely would recommend any Anker products.
 I bought my Anker 2 months ago, and so far I am enjoing the sound, and and all of it!
 Huge sound and great price. Turns my desk into a disco
 Love it! Great Sound!
 Excellent sound ! Great speaker! Works so well I actually bought another one.
 Very Nice Speakers For the Price!!!
 Great crisp sound in a little package, Maybe not as loud as I expected but happy with the purchase
 Pairs easily, (super fast compared with my 2 Bose Minis) and works great at work with group phone calls or where I need handsfree. Very nice little speaker for the price!
 GREAT sound for the size and price. Very portable.<br/><br/>However, sometimes the Bluetooth is interrupted making the playback choppy like a glitch or out of range even within the 66 feet limit. I guess you get what you pay for?
 LOVE THIS MIGHTY LITTLE SPEKER!!!!!<br/>It came supper fast, and is everything the reviews claimed. I bought it for my office and its such a big hit, my boss ordered one for his home! You will love it, don't hesitate.
 Just what I needed to be able to listen to my audible books as I am working around the house.
 No complaints!!
 Great portable speaker and impressive battery life
 Liked the sound very Clear and the Battery Life is amazing.  Great Little Speaker and the company is very quick to respond and help with any Questions.  I would purchase again.
 Amazing Speakers!!
 Anker makes some great stuff. The sound quality did not disappoint.
 This is just perfect. I am carrying it outside and it has replaced an enormous boom box. Feel like I have taken leaps and bounds in outside entertainment. Sound is very good. And for anyone like me who is a bit on the old side, I also learned to android Pandora all my music so now I can use Anker to play my playlists anywhere. No free products here, I paid for it and it works great.
 The sound for this speaker is outstanding
 Great sound quality and gets very loud! purchsed as a gift for my sister. she is very happy with it
 Very happy with speaker.
 I purchased this speaker for 27 dollars. I was not expecting this nice of a speaker. Sounds way better than my phone. I mean way better. Good job China!
 Great little speaker.  Powerful too. Wonderful quality. Worth tge money.
 Great sound for small speaker
 Just order it.  Great value.
 Best Bluetooth speaker for the price. No wonder it's. Best seller. Great battery life and amazing sound, for 40 dollars this feels like a steal. I have only had it for 2 hours but I'm already in love. There is nothing Anker can't do and I am proud to stand behind their products.
 Product as expected.
 Bought to use with the Echo dot. Set up was so easy and the sound is fantastic
 Fantastic Bluetooth speaker
 Impressive speaker, a steal for the price.<br/><br/>Will definitely recommend for having a few of these in the home.
 Rich base, amazing volume.. 4 stars because the package was a day late from the company. Would reccomend to anyone.
 Anker is now my favorite! Great company! Enjoying tunes with friends outside at the bonfire! Perfect size also. Thank you.
 Great product! for the price!!<br/>Great battery capability - charge my speaker once in 2 days<br/>Nicely build &amp; Strong<br/>The volume isn't that big but for the price this is really the best you can get !!
 I had no idea this little speaker could provide so much volume.
 Never did get it to hook up to Wi-Fi.
 It works perfectly and battery lasts!
 Sound is awesome!
 Happy. Great quality, long battery life.
 The battery is really going strong. I listen to it so much and have barely charged it
 Better than expected quality an performance.  Very pleased.
 Very good would buy again
 Excellent product. Pairs easily. Great range. Superb sound quality . Very happy with the priduct.
 It’s great!
 We use this for our home projection unit attached to my iPhone and it is fabulous! Great quality. I can’t believe the sound. Definitely worth the money.
 Very pleased with this item.  Sent very quickly.
 Its actually a high quality speaker for the price. Heavier than expected, which no doubt is because of its quality.<br/>Synced up quickly and easily.<br/>Sounds great. It’s missing that deep bass I like but Its still really good. I’m impressed
 Great bass from such a small speaker. Gets exceptionally loud with out distortion, definitely recommend. I use it for a 45 mins every week day when I get off work and only charge it once a month.
 You get a lot of sound in a small package and the battery lasts forever! Would purchase again.
 This is on my night table and use it with phone for noise machine volume...it has great sound and was priced right
 Love this speaker, very good sound, affordable price. Pleasantly surprised with the quality.
 Wished it was a little louder, but I love it and the battery has never died on me! Would definitely recommend!
 No way 66 ft range but I love both my Anker speakers. They're fantastic.
 has good sound clarity up to a certain point.. great battery life!<br/>poor low end bass sounds, and definitely doesn't have a 66 foot range.  i've had sound dropping/glitching at around 15-20 feet, especially through a wall or if in motion.
 I like it because I can listed to info you tube while phone is attached to charger
 It is just excellent, the volume is great. Just what i was looking for.
 The sound is really dry and with no bass mode<br/>, which is really disappointing to me. Other than that, stereo effect wasn't as good as advertised.
 I just got this speaker and it sounds great. Has a good range for such small a speaker. Its definitely a good speaker for the value. It seems durable.
 Really good sound quality and dummy proof bluetooth sync. I'll update this if things change, but having it for a week now and using it daily has been awesome so far.
 Sound is high quality and the bluetooth length is legit.  Stayed connected with no problems for me across a warehouse full of auto parts. Pretty sure it was longer than 66 ft.
 Great sound and battery life, can't beat the price.
 Good but not as loud as I was hoping for.
 Great Speaker for the price!  I've had it for about 6 months and I love it!
 Sounds Great and easy setup
 This product was delivered on time, and the sound quality was clear and powerful enough. The echos of Anker Soundcore portable Bluetooth Speaker is pretty good inside my car while I am driving. I definitely enjoy it!
 I recommend it. It is as described.
 PEFECTION IN A BOX
 great quality for the price!
 For not much money, this speaker delivers. Decent bass, good highs and mids. Looks and feels great. I'm happy.
 This speaker is very nice...The sound is loud enough to hear throughout my small house...I would recommend this product..
 This thing last literally 4 days with constant play on one charge......the sound quality is better than my JBL speaker and I use that everyday until I got the anker
 Love it! The sound quality is great and the unit is very robust.  Highly recommend for small area,  hotel room, office or  dorm room.
 These little speakers have great clear sound and are really easy to set up and use. I would recommend them to anyone looking for simple quality speakers.
 good for price.
 The best Bluetooth sound speaker out there, for this price. Battery lasts forever! Portable and sleek, looks amazing. Very durable and made of quality material. Manufacturer does seem to care about costumers.
 Clean sound but without bass.
 I keep this speaker with me in my daypack and often use it at work to listen to music.  Quite nice for the price, decent sound.
 Liked it at the beginning but it didn't even last me 3 months doesn't work anymore. Wish I could return It.
 Perfect for listening to music anywhere and everywhere!!! We use this everyday inside and outside our home. It works great out on our boat as well!!!
 Excellent speaker for its price. I do not have functions such as changing a song directly from the device. And I would be happy if it was waterproof.
 Great speaker. I use it every day.
 My only wish is that it would get a bit louder...other than that, I'm very happy with it.
 Quality
 Amazing sound and quick linking to phone. Love it.
 It is a good clear sound for listening to talks. I was looking for Bose quality but didn't want to spend that kind of money so I researched and found this and we are very happy with the quality for listening to talks. Not sure about music. I have tried a few others and was very disappointed. But I am very happy with this product.
 Not as great as I thought. Not that loud nor bassy, but it was cheap!
 Bought it for the wife for Mothers Day.  She seems to enjoy it so far.
 my husband loves it
 great product/service phenomenal the way this works!!
 Awesome sound!! Thanks again,
 Good sound good device
 Works exactly as advertised.  I love the sound and the ability to move it easily from room to room.  Charges quickly and easily  Very happy with this purchase!
 Excellent, excellent speaker. Hard to believe the speaker is so inexpensive and sounds so good. Anker has a win here.
 Everything was all good and dandy until I used it for some time. I brought this in May. It is now September and I can barely use it! The sound breaks up when I turn up the music. Its disappointing. At least it was fun while it lasted.
 Was looking for a portable bluetooth speaker to listen to Pandora outside.  We have a lot of dogs in the neighborhood, so needed one that was loud.  This one is perfect!!  I sat outside last night listening to my music and enjoyed it so much!!! I'm thinking about buying another one to put in my car.
 This speaker is amazing, for its price there is no competition. Crystal clear sound and amazing battery life, perfect for at home use.
 Works and looks great
 This was for my wife for Christmas. I just asked her how it was working for her and she loves it.
 high quality speaker with a sleek design. Long battery life: one battery charge lasted me a month on my daily 1.5 hour commutes to work
 Amazing!
 True Ratings.
 For the price and features the kids are blown away with the sound.
 Works well, comparable to much more expensive speakers.
 great product, great price, would recommend to anyone
 Superb sound quality, and extremely long battery play time.<br/>I don't know how long the play time is.<br/>Because I'm using over a month after I fully charged this one when it is delivered.<br/>I'm playing at least 2~3 hours every day to check the battery length.<br/>But the battery indicator still shows 70%... amazing and unbelievable.
 This thing sounds great for it's size fills the house with clear sound even turned all the way up. Love it
 I am happy with the sound and how well it picks up a bluetooth signal.  I like the mobility of this as well.
 A very nice speaker for the money. The treble and bass are  good for such a small unit. I would say give it a try.
 I really enjoyed the speaker the first few weeks but recently it's been randomly distorting my music and has been very difficult when trying to connect with another phone
 Tried several other Bluetooth speakers of the size. All way too bassy for my liking. This is a great speaker for voice reproduction, radio, newscasts, etc. Easy, reliable connection to Bluetooth.
 Very high quality speaker for a good price. Anker also has excellent customer service.
 Wow excellent
 Purchased as a gift for Christmas for my sister --- she LOVES it.
 I did a little research before I made the decision to buy this. Got it today, tried it out, and I LOVE IT!! Easy to pair and the sound is great. Can hear the bass like what I wanted in a speaker. And it gets loud too! So far I have no regrets in purchasing this item. Great product!
 Surprisingly good sound from such a small package. Well built. Easy to use.. Loud and clear.
 This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product I've purchased on Amazon. But I'm so happy with this purchase that I figured what the hey. This is a great speaker for the price of 30$.
 Great sound for the price.
 Works great, priced great. Shut up.
 Love it
 Nice little speaker for the money. Was very impressed. Good quality sound
 Clear sound range, and great for the price. Perfect for small room or small gathering outside. Not as loud as other speakers, but doesn't compromise quality for loudness. Which is why I prefer this speaker over others. Bought this one due to reviews on gizmodo.com  ...] It replaced a more expensive speaker that was louder, but always sounded tinny.
 excellent build quality, very good sound and battery life. and the price just makes this product one of a kind.
 Good
 Great Speaker I have many and this on is almost as good as the UE boom mind you the UE boom is 100.00 . Great speaker for the price the battery life is also Great !!!
 Great sound and easy to setup and use.
 I did not like the fact that you cannot see the control buttons on top without a flashlight
 Looking for a portable speaker that will bump without breaking the bank? Look no further.<br/>This speaker's battery life is as long as advertised in addition to being very clear when fielding phone calls.<br/>I have recommended to all of my friends who need another speaker for the house or camping that this is the one to go with.
 This speaker was everything I hoped it would be when I read the description and reviews.  Great sound quality and perfect price point.  The speaker holds a charge for longer than expected too.  VERY pleased with my purchase.
 Bouhgt as a gift, excellent sound. Recipient loves it.
 Sounds great, nice and compact, good to take on vacation.
 love it
 The beeping that happens when it’s turn on/off or at max volume is far too loud and very annoying. But regardless, this speaker puts out awesome sound for its size and is incredibly well priced!
 Why spend $200 on a similar product from a trendy overpriced manufactuer. Great quality for the price. Great for tailgating or just working in the yard. Definitely recommended.
 I wish everything came with a battery this good.
 I purchased this as a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it. Simple hookup and has very great sound, and the price was very affordable. We listened to music all afternoon!  .
 Great product! FAST delivery!
 It arrived on time but after using it for bout a month. It wont connect to any bluetooth device
 I'm very happy with my speakers.  They work great; much better than another brand I replaced
 Been using anker products for a while now. Got the blue one for a friend and she liked it!
 Great sound
 This little speaker is nice and comparable to my friends similar Bose unit. Can't beat the price and the battery life is solid.
 this little thing is awesome, great sound, and battery last as they said
 Bought one for myself and one as a gift and both of us love it!  Works great!
 Poor sound quality, Very Poor BlueTooth Signal
 Decent sound, great battery life and compact. Has lasted much longer than a JBL, which lost Bluetooth capabilities within a few months.
 Item was defective, it never worked. Very disappointed. Returned!! We will buy Bose next time.
 This little speaker has amazing sound, the charge lasts forever and I am super happy with it - so much so that I just bought another one!
 Honestly shocked by how great this sounds for the price and size. Bass is a tad low but overall great speaker.  Music fills my office without distortion. Going to buy two more.
 Haven't had it long but like it and am enjoying the music on my patio. Use my old cell phone to stream music and it works well so far!
 Great speaker extra long battery life great sounding great prize love it
 Sound is good, not great depth of range but waaay better than a lap top and is a small enough for the kitchen counter.
 Everything it says it can do, it does. Love anker batteries and chargers. Slapping a good speaker on one was a great idea. Battery lasts longer than the pink bunny drummer.
 Great little speaker that stays charged for a while. Perfect for Amazon Tap.
 Very well made and of highest quality.  Great sound for such a small size. Well worth the price.
 Great sound for the money ! Would buy again and have this is my second one the first one was red
 Used it for at least 3-4 hours, never ran out of battery.  Pretty loud and good quality sound for the price
 This is definitely a you get what you pay for type speaker.<br/><br/>We'll start with the pros,<br/>The build quality is very good.<br/>The device is very simple to use.<br/>It is fairly loud.<br/>The sound quality is decent.<br/>It's stable.  It shouldn't slide off most surfaces.<br/><br/>Now for the cons<br/>There is little bass.  (I may be bias on this as I also have a JBL Charge 2 and the Charge 2 blows this out of the water.)<br/>It's about the same dimensions as the Charge 2 but delivers much less bass. (About as long as a US currency note is.)<br/><br/>Over all for the money it's a very nice product.
 good sound, long lasting battery
 Have to charge it every time I use it<br/>But the sound quality is great for the price. Super bummed. If it held a charge I'd 5 star this bad boy faster than you can say beats by dre
 Good  speaker
 Love this speaker
 Great sound out of a small box very good quality.
 Love this speaker. I have used it for two days now and it’s wonderful. Great product by anker. Battery life is amazing two days of use around 9 hours so far and it’s still fully charged. Sound is wonderful and it’s fairly loud.
 Got this for my boyfriend for his birthday, and he loves it! It’s very clear, no feedback noise.
 Not bad sound for such a small speaker.  Connects easily and stays connected.
 Great sound for the size. I used it all night to stream Amazon prime music for a very nice dinner party from my iPhone and people thought we had hidden Bose! Also use it to amplify sound off the Amazon fire tablet for my 3 and 4 year old.
 The sound is incredible.  It was much louder and clearer than i expected.  Used it for one day so far. I bought it for my wife who operates a forklift and plans to use it for her music.  I will post an update once she has used it for a few weeks.
 Very good, no regrets.
 Good sound quality, paired easily with my phone and tablet.  I've only had it for a few days but overall very impressed.
 I love this speaker. The sound it produces is absolutly amazing! I would (and have already) recommended this product!
 Works excellent, great product. Clarity and sound is perfect. Easy to set up and use. Great product and excellent power.
 I love it. Slim profile, great sound, totally worth it. I really like the packaging. At full volume, I can hear it from downstairs. I really like Anker I'm a fan.
 The shipping package was very adequate and shipping was prompt. My Ankar speaker sounds terrific. I would order another and recomend this to a friend.
 This speaker works great! It's no Bose Soundlink, but the sound quality and loudness are great for the price. The sound clarity is very clear, and only distorts a tiny bit at max volume. The Mid and High range sounds are crisp. The Bass is adequate and is definitely there, but do not expect this thing to bang. I've had mine for almost half a year now, and I've had zero issues with it. The battery life is excellent too!<br/><br/>Edit: Half a year later, this thug still works as well as it did when brand new- even the battery.  I only use this for ~1 hour or 2 per every 2 or 3 days, but I seriously have only charged this speaker once or twice in 6 months- the battery life is that good. I'm sure it also helps that the highest I use it is as half volume.
 I have a Bose sound link speaker, but I use this ANKER speaker much often.  This is a high quality product at this price, and I will come back to ANKER to buy other products from their brand.  This is my second product from ANKER and I really like this speaker.
 This speaker is awesome. I have had it over a year now I use it all the time . Battery life is great I get the full 24hours of play. I only need to charge it 1 full time to get a complete 2 to 3 weeks of use.
 Love this small wireless speaker with huge quality sound!  Highly recommend!
 Great and portable speaker. Better than the bazooka, of which we also have one, as this is front fired, and easier to connect and use.
 Been wanting a Bluetooth speaker for quite some time now and glad this was a nice add-on to my Anker package deal and great quality. Would recommend to others if they need a decent speaker for around the house, outside activities and for travel.
 Happy with this Anker speaker.  Not a Bose, but close enough for the money.
 LOVES THIS TANK!
 This thing is incredible! Battery lasts forever and great sound
 Excellent for the price
 Such a powerful little speaker, sound is clear and full of bass! My favorite part about this company, packaging is 100% recyclable! Thank you Anker for an amazing product and for being a responsible company thinking about our environment.
 The battery lasts forever, nice crisp sound. Expect some connectivity issues if you take it outside though, otherwise this is worth the price!
 Just what I wanted.  My son recommended this speaker.  It sounds great!
 Great speaker for price. Feels solid and sounds good. Got one blue and one red each for my kids for Christmas. They really like them.
 This thing rules. The sound quality is great, it's super easy to use, and it's a pretty attractive lil speaker to boot.
 Anker stuff is always good, high quality.
 Excellent!
 Brilliant product.
 Wow! I love this speaker! It's loud enough for my room or a get together. I was so surprised by the quality as well. I definitely recommend this Bluetooth speaker. I got the blue one.
 Amazing fidelity and ease of use for such an inexpensive speaker.  I'm using it my dining room, with my computer and on the back deck for entertainment.  I'm awestruck with its sound--crisp, clear and not overly base.
 bought as a gift as a cheap option to use outside and not have to worry too much about it. they use it often and really like it.
 Had originally purchased the Samsung Level Mini for the same price. No comparison whatsoever. The was my 1st time purchasing an Anker product. I was completely blown away. Quality and price are amazing. I will definitely purchase more Anker products in the future.
 I use it at work in a loud environment so its not real loud but does the trick.
 We love this speaker. My girls enjoy using it upstairs in their playroom.
 good buy for the money.  sound is pretty good for a small speaker.
 great speaker, love all my Anker products so far
 Awesome!!! Best Bluetooth ever!
 Great sound and it goes very loud for outdoors. I am very happy with it. I have had it a few months and I have no complaints.
 I used this speaker maybe 10-12 times over the period of a month. It is now completely dead, despite registering as charged when plugged in. You get what you pay for. Don't waste it on this one.
 Nice lil sound box.
 My son takes it everywhere and loves it.
 Works great I use it when I'm on the beach lasts a long time on one charge
 Excellent speaker for travel.  Light, plenty loud, and the battery lasts for a long time.
 wow, small but big sound!
 works great but effective range is really closer to 40 than 60 feet as advertised
 Great sound!  Very good product.
 Works great.  Bought it for my boat, sound is good, deep and rich.  Easy to use.
 I have these hooked to my PC and they work great. They may not be the top of the line but they are running close :) With the rubber seal that makes them feel even stronger, I can rest assured that they will stand up to a coffee spill!! :)
 Absolutely amazing, it sounds as if like there is no speaker anywhere and the sounds are coming from the walls of your room, of course if you place it perfectly. Got my moneys worth.<br/><br/>Edit: I bought this is 2016 and now its 2019, it still works like itd brand new.
 This is a great speaker, fantastic sound, it's small and powerful, the sound is loud, very satisfied..
 Everything I could want in such a tiny package. Powerful sound. Rich tones. Excellent quality. Highly recommend this speaker.
 Great speaker overall, holds long battery life, decent sound for the price! Perfect for my small office.
 Graet bluetooth speaker. Also has a graet batter life.
 This speaker sounds AMAZING!! Definitely would recommend this to everyone!!
 good quality and price &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
 Sounds as good or better as my Bose sound link. Yes that's right! For a third of the price!!!
 Believe the reviews, this little bluetooth speaker is great. We use it in our kitchen.
 I bought this portable speaker to use with my Amazon Dot. I absolutely love it! The sound is crisp and clear and it's easy to just take it into another room with you, as needed. It holds its charge for a long time too! I love, love, love this little Bluetooth portable speaker!
 Easy to connect via Bluetooth. Good sound. Very small. Great value. Use it all the time.
 Great quality sound, nice bass, super portable and easy to use!
 Awesome sound! Love it. Took me forever to find a good one, this one rocks.
 Like it
 I love it I wish it did get a bit louder but it’s still pretty loud. The battery lasts really long!
 Great build quality<br/>Good sound<br/>Portable<br/>Great battery life
 Great sound, lightweight and portable.
 Nice little speaker for the discounted price I paid.  It's nothing fancy, but great for listening to music in your bathroom in the morning, or in the office.
 Broke a month after purchased! I only used 3 times!!
 Better options out there for just a few dollars more
 Great speaker.  Works well with Echo Dot
 Amazing deal of its great sound and portability.<br/>Pros<br/>Can use while charging<br/>Cons<br/>It a finger print magnet
 The speaker arrived quite quickly and has been working perfectly since I set it up with my laptop.
 another great product the sound is loud and clear
 i used it for a month.and now its not working
 I've had these six weeks and absolutely no problems.  I've read a lot of the negative reviews and I've experienced none of their issues.<br/><br/>I have never used Bluetooth before and figured that would be my first problem.  Connected immediately.  It was so simple.  BUT -- be advised -- the directions I received were not in English.  I went to their website to set this up.  Lame, I know, but I'm glad I did!<br/><br/>Mine, with a full charge, actually last longer than 24 hours.  I've had no problems with the charging port but the cable (oh the cable!) cord is ridiculously short.<br/><br/>How I've been listening to music thru my crappy Kindle speakers is beyond me.  Now I'm rocking out all day with this Anker speaker.  I notice no distortion at high volume and the sound quality is great.  And wireless to boot!<br/><br/>If a problem arises....  I will update.  I notice all the negative reviews have a comment from Anker customer service giving a phone number to rectify problems.  This is very rare from a company.  The complaints about them baffle me....  they seem to really want their customers to be satisfied.
 good
 Great speaker, use it all day and never runs out of battery.  The connectivity is great, even through walls.
 Fantastic. It's small, durable and I charge it once a month. I use the speaker daily and it lasts forever I've also bumped it off the shelf that's about 5 feet tall onto a hardwood floor more than once and it still works great. It's loud and has good bass. Worth every penny
 Battery really lasts forever.  Sound is a bit tinny, but since it's such a small little guy thats bound to be the case.  Nice little speaker.  I approve.
 Battery lasts a long time and easy to use! Have purchased more as gifts!
 Great sound and easy set up<br/>Would definitely buy another as a gift
 Works great _ was going to buy a Boise but this price on the ANKER could not pass up trying it after reading the reviews. Easy to bluetooth set up from ipad.
