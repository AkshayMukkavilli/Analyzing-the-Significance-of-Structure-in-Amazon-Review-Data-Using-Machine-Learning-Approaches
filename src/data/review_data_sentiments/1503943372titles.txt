Fabulous, moving history of WWII in Italy, Beneath a Scarlet Sky will not disappoint. Working as a spy against the Germans, Pino Lello places himself in danger to help his beloved Italy. Along the way, he meets his beautiful Anna, the love of his life. This book is a reminder of Hitler's atrocities and how his own people followed his madness. But more than that, this  book is about the kindness and character of a young man named Pino.

Unbelievably gripping, heart-wrenching and heart-warming all at the same time.
an unknown hero and his heroic actions to save jews in milan where Hitler was taking his fantasies of the one reigning dictator of the world country by country.  it tells the mostly unknown courage and heroic actions by a teenage boy and the hellish atrocities he saw and witnessed first-hand.  i wont forget this read anytime soon.  i hope i never do.l
An unbelievable gripping tale!
Good WW 2 story
Tugs at the heart!
Captivating story of wartime Milan and its heroes!
It has young love, espionage
An awakening of the relatively unknown WWII story in Italy
A remarkable life and journey of an 18 year old living through one of Western Civilizations most conflicted epochs.  How many of us would have the fortitude to live the way the protagonist did.  The prologue was equally compelling; a personal story of close to throwing the proverbial towel in, God throwing the towel and back and saying “wipe your face, your almost there.”
