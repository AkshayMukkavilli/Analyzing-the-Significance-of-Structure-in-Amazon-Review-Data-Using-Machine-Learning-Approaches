A good mystery marred by endless academic musings and lousy characters

A procedural combination of the previous two books in the Robert Langdon series.
Formulaic
While I agree that many people point out the idiocy is many of the supposed intelligent characters, I actually 100% disagree tha
Thrilling - but inaccurate
You’ll Never Look at Anything Quite the Same Way Again
A Deeply Intricate Read!
Langdon and Brown both seem lost in this one
Dan Brown knocks the ball out of the park again!
Cool Story.  Not My Favorite Writing Style
Cookie cutter religious fiction
Excellent, as usual
Book Smarts, Missing Common Sense
Sample is good but electronic QC really needs some work
Exciting until the end
Stupid is as stupid does
I enjoyed Da Vinci Code and Inferno
Barely Tolerable
So bad it's almost a parody of Dan Brown writing
Warning: Don't lose yourself in this book!
Entertaining. Same old Robert Langdon formula
is it better to see the movie or read the book?
My best thriller read in the last six years
Fast-paced, but annoyingly manipulative and too long
Meh...
America, watch out!
Even with familiar plot devices, villians and structure, I couldn't help but enjoy the story
Ok book. Kind of predictable, but still fascinating with facts and history that I'd never research myself.
typical Dan Brown, but enjoyable!
Entertaining, But Not Quite
A good read, good entertainment!!!
but he just killed it with endless religious and symbolic lecture that keeps saying the same boring and uninspiring thing over and over and over again
Spectacularly awful
Dan Brown needs to stop insulting the intelligence of his readers.
The Lost Symbol should have stayed lost
Four stars for an informative book.
Suspension of suspense
Entertaining and Suspenseful
Much ado about not much

Pretty unimpressive thriller
Decent Thriller, Tired Premise

Yet Another Robert Langdon Story...
The Lost Symbol
Entertaining, but much left to be desired
not as good as The DaVinci Code
Easy to digest but not much of a departure from Da Vinci Code

Forgetting it was Fiction
A resplendent jewel
More plot holes than swiss cheese... ABSURD!
Bit of a yawner, its hard to write suspense when your rehashing old story lines
ROBERT LANGDON RIDES AGAIN
Plodding, Didactic & Overwritten
Captivating, but characters are flawed.
Fascinating subject matter, for what it's worth...
Not really quite a 4-star
Decent story, but disappointing woo propaganda
About four times too long
Yeah, I've read this before... sort of.
Fact as fact; fiction as fiction; and pseudoscicne as fact?
Public Pressure to Repeat
shallow characters, terrible theology, but some good twists.
The Lost Symbol
C+...Major letdown after..
I didn't get the big mystery.
It was a pain to finish this book!
annoying but readable
Improbable, Impossible and Informative
Not Worth It (your time, that is)
A good book... On its own...
The Lost DaVinci Demons
It keeps going and going and going.......
Oh, C'mon!!
Enjoyable but similar
Better Than the Reviews
Not one of Dan's better books
Ultimately Unsatisfying
Too many symbols, not enough characters
Similar plotlines, similar characters, a let down at the end
Bravo Mr. Brown
All of his books are the same
Entertaining but more of the same from Dan Brown
Ending Disappointment
Absurd
Haven't we read this story already?

Unfortunately Disappointed.
Not a good introduction to Dan Brown
I liked it better when it was called Angels and Demons.
Pedantic, boring, tedious...
It Starts with A Bang and Ends with a Slight Bang
Not As Thrilling but Better Than Most
A lot of information, but some really weak plot twists
Almost two books--and that's not good
Failed to get me invested.
It is NOT the best of the three
Fun and yet not...
Not like the others, but similar!
Good for what it is
Brown rides again...and again...and again...
Good airport wait reading
Review from One Book At A Time  onebooktime.blogspot.com
E pluribus unum
"Jack and Annie" for grown ups
Read It For the Symbology, Not The Characters or Writing
Not so good as Browns other Books.
...wow.
Not as great as the last two but still really good
Another book, same old Robert Langdon
Interesting at the beginning but quickly became tedious and routine
How many face palm and 'oh brother' moments can a book have?
Very suspenseful--but flops at the end
Terrible.
Knowledge gained, time lost
Like being played on Internet click-throughs
Entertaining read, lots of fun
Beware!
Great story
An OK read, but not spellbinding
Freemasons, conspiracies and little more
The "Easy to Figure Out" Lost Symbol
Blah, blah, blah
Typical Dan Brown
Boring
The Lost Symbol - A Good Quick Read
BEYOND DISAPPOINTING
A hand for Peter Solomon
The further adventures of Robert Langdon
beginning okay, but it just goes down hill.
Intriguing, yet excruciating
Lost Symbol - not Da Vinci Code, but not bad either
I Really Wanted to Like It But...
Bland Page Turner
Mystery's Scholarly Substratum!!
A good story, but another let-down ending.
Fantastic research
Entertaining at best
Awful, awful, awful
Ugh!
It Just Didnt Gel For Me
In a word: Dull
There is more
Dan Brown, I have some bad news for you.
Standard Dan Brown Stuff
Lost Momentum
It was a good read!
They're all the same
Loved Angels & Demons, enjoyed Da Vinci, HATED Lost Symbol.
Great thriller: too much philosophy
Not Quite as good as the preceding books
Deciphering Boredom
Suspense
Overdone and overwrought
So, Is there any Help for the Widow's Son?
Meh...The hype did this one in...
How would you end "The Lost Symbol?"
Revelation
The Lost Symbol
Save your money
This one LOST me...
What a Waste
Interesting and Fun Read
Moron's tour of DC
Not up to par with his earlier works...
The Further Adventures of Robert Langdon
Good book
Fascinating, Illuminating, Totally Entertaining
I want this week of my life back
The Lost Symbol
Not as good as the others
Such a dissapointment...
PATHETIC MASONIC PROPAGANDA
different title, different subject, more of the same
A screenplay pretending to be a novel
That was absolutely terrible!
The Lost Story
One Great Character
Deserves a negative star it's  so awful
Page turner
A thrilling book you won't want to put down.
Great read, favorite in the series!
Very tiresome
Hey, it's fiction
The Lost Symbol should have remained Lost
Don't buy this.
Skip this one
Another great book! Not as good as The Da Vinci Code though...
Pseudo-History and Junk Science...together again!
Good read but familiar story.
formulaic, but fun
A Waste of Time
Not Brown's best work.
Good Read!
About midway through, I could no longer deny how utterly irritating this book is.
More of a promo for the Da Vinci Code
Good, cookie-cutter thriller
Great story, but what's with the research?
Predictable
Disappointed
Dissapointing
Dan Brown meets David O. Selznick
A Washingtonian's View
Not up to Dan Brown's previous achievements
Okay, Well then.
Not as good as The Da Vinci Code, but still a worthy read
An entertaining piece of garbage
Entertaining, but not his best by a long shot.
Entertainingly lame
Not bad, but a little stretched
End of the trilogy ... please!
Masonic symbols unraveled to save a friend
Wanting to believe the bad reviews weren't justified...
Great Theme, Full of Plot Twists, Metaphysical subject matter
It's OK
Good Read but So Disappointed with Ending, has SPOILERS
Great addition to the Robert Langdon collection
Not quite up to The DaVinci Code
Equally interesting and annoying, (possible spoilers)
If you liked his other books...
Cheese, cheese, and more cheese!
Very poor showing.
A good read!
Batman redux
I just Threw Away 6 Months of My Life to this Book
Huge Letdown
I read 500 pages for.....THAT?
Not as good as DaVinci Code
It is impossible to say how bad this book is
Am I being punked?!
This book was supposed to be called Lost Time
Wild-goose chase for nothing
Formulaic and Predictable
good entertainment
Quick thriller walks through wheezy sub-genre - no harm, no foul
Entertaining thriller, but with some issues...
A Tedious Page-Turner?
COMPLETELY IMPLAUSIBLE
Consider waiting for the movie...
Maybe Next Time
Lost by the Lost Symbol
Too many flaws to be a good read
Have I read this before???
Not nearly as good as Davinci or Angels
The Lackluster Blockbuster
The Lost Symbol : The Lost Cause ?
The Lost Writer
Disappointed
Disappointing, unfortunately
Same Old
Predictable pattern
The last 100 pages are unrealistic
Not As Good As Expected
Flawed, but still fun
A great sequel
Mehh.  Fast, easy read.
Note worthy read...at best
An Original! Must read for Langdon fans
its a great 400 page book in a 900 page book format
Note for Intention Experiment Readers
Sliding downhill without skis
Started well but fizzled
Fascinating Topic but Worn-out Plot Formula
A quick review
A "national security crisis of unimaginable proportions."
Disappointing
Yet Another Fantastic Read
I give it 4 stars because it kept me entertained
The best yet if you can handle it. . .
Worst book I have ever read?
how do you beat the Da Vinci Code - Well the Lost Symbol comes close.
I enjoyed it! SPOILERS
National Trash-ure
Meh
This book is fun and it makes you think.
Wavering quality
Professor Landon, Stop Getting into Chartered Jets.  Please.
A page turner, but too familiar
Should be called "The Lost Novel"
The Lost Symbol
An average addition to the Robert Langdon series
The Lost Symbol
Ancient Mysteries, Secret Societies and Technology
Can someone please explain?
my personal favorite Dan brown novel
Not What I Expected
Expecting More - All the Righ Parts - Poor Execution
Liked it but didnt love it
Should I have felt priveleged to sit at Dan Brown's feet while he "taught" me the meaning of life?
Too Formulaic
The Da Vinci Code's poor cousin
Great first 2 quarters, highly disappointing after half time.
Advice:  Set your expectations properly.
Not much different than the others, but still good.
Problematic Installment
Disaster
Another Brown slam dunk...
Outstanding!
Been there; done that!
Created interest in the freemason influence on our history
Worth Reading
Laughable
entertaining
AUDIO version review
Disappointingly Predictable
Another silly ending, but fun getting there
Brilliant!
When did Dan Brown's characters get so DUMB?
To be perfectly fair.
The Trilogy is completed. Move On.
Huge disappointment-Hard to top DaVinci Code, but not even close
Heavy-handed
Disappointing and dull
Formulaic, repetative Letdown
A Good Read - and a good example
Smart, Mysterious, and Crazy Fun!
Save Your Money
Another page turner, Another thrilling ride
Best read!
Give Dan Brown a Break!
Fun Mystery Steeped in History and Symbols
Patetica
The not very lost symbol
Too much
It is what it is, man...
Something Old, something New????
Ending Ruined the Whole Book
If you want to stay a Dan Brown fan, Don't read this book.
Compelling and Thought Provoking Read.
Excellent
A Little Disappointed...
I loved this book!
Lots of Potential, But Little Kinetic Energy
Barely held my interest.
I have to admit that I loved it.
Decent book but not my favorite.
Enjoyable....
Loved It!
National Displeasure--Mediocre at Every Level
Getting a little "been there, done that" with Dan Brown in this one.
Great for a PowerPoint
Very poorly done
Ugghhh
Somebody needs to put Langdon out of his misery
Makes no sense
eh
Not worth the wait (or the hefty price)!
Does not live up to DaVinci or Angels & Demons
Just a pot-boiler
I couldn't even finish
Mind candy (which is just what I wanted)
Nice Try
Worth the wait
Entertaining
OVERBLOWN EXPECTATIONS
Would have been better than DVC. If it had come first.
What happened here??
Just Awful Narration
Who shot the editor?
Silly storyline, but fun for what it is
Truly Enjoyable!
Decent read with interesting science
A Huge Disappointment
The Journey was far more interesting than the Destination....
Excellent mystery
The ending ruined it all for me.
Entertaining, but predictable and drawn out
Symbolically Familiar Brown Format
Too much like his others
Another religious story filled with suspense.
The lost symbol
Oh so lame...
Decent...but could've been so much better
Dan Brown Lost Symbol
Intriguing read
Worst ending I've ever read
Dan Brown gives us a provocative - sometimes even an eye opening - perspective on familiar national objects & everyday phrases.
a real page turner if you're a fan
Entertaining but very flawed
Laus Deo, It's Over
A Disappointment Even with Low Expectations
Would this book even have been published if an unknown author wrote it?
Let down - Read a good Cussler instead
Bad Novel
Excruciating.
From Triump To Turkey
Has it been worth the wait? Overall, yes.
Ending was a major let down
Very disappointimg
Dan Brown is a hack
A pleasant read, but ending falls flat
Good read; then ending sucked.
Great book!
How Convenient
Too Much History, Professor
Great Combination of history, action and consciousness
Good Continuing Adventures of a Favorite Character
Starts with a bang... Ends with a whimper
A Page Turner
Not enough plot to get past the atrocious writing
Alright
Badly written page-turner
Great Cure for Insomnia
(Spoiler Alert) What a Lame Ending
Page turner yes, but weak at best...
Another great thriller.
Gee, I really enjoyed it.
Love it and Hate it
Excellent Read!!
Not Great Literature, but I Kept Reading
A disappointed reader
The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown
Give me back the anti-religious Dan Brown
You just know Brown is playing you as he cuts ...
Terrific suspense!
Not as good as The Da Vinci Code, but not a total dud either
Great book
rip-roaring story amid the lecture
Entertaining - though not as good as Da Vinci Code
Roller Coaster Ride
Familiar...maybe a little too familiar
Is Okay ... But Geometry Be Damned !
The Lost Symbol: My Impression
Rube Goldberg plot device engage...
I wish I had the time back I've invested . . . .
I wish I hadn't found "The Lost Symbol"
"Damn The Torpedoes, Full Speed Ahead" or "When I See a Critic, I call Pest Control"...  Take Your Pick.
Another Wet Dream For Conspiracy Theorists
The Money has Gone to Brown's Head
Robert Langdon and a female lead, someone in distress that is facing a gruesome death....
Bad Exposure or Free Advertising?
Another Thrilling Ride
Classic Dan Brown
Good book
Brainy and entertaining
Save yourself
Dan Brown's Major Premise is Incorrect
Slice off the final 50 pages = great book + save trees
Whitewash of darkside of Freemasonry
Not nearly as enjoyable as Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons
Dan Brown's Latest
Not Bad-Not Great, But Not Bad
Different Parameters
So disappointing
Over-stuffed, weak ending
Formulaic = Snooze fest
Feels like History Textbook
Lost Symbols
Classic Dan Brown
Disappointing!!!
2452nd Review of this book on Amazon
Oh Dan Brown, don't preach to me anymore please
How many times...
Mysteries, Ciphers and Cryptograms!
On and on...
Where's the shocking mystery?
Interesting topic poorly rendered
Good book, interesting read, though a bit drawn out
Decent, not grand, but still Brown
For Me Personally, Somewhat Surprising
Not very good
A Total Waste of Time
Passable but not his best, it borrows from Da Vinci Code's ideas
Dissaponting compared to his others. (Spoiler alert)
Bravo
Very weak plot
Relies on formula and the suspensie build-up doesn't deliver...
plodding and sometimes silly ...
Lost Symbol
Symbol Qua Symbol
Entertaining but flawed
Entertaining
Good read
Many, many turns and twists
Dan Brown is an Amazing Writer
Brown knows his symbols!
Another Fantastic Novel from Dan Brown
A Commonplace Letdown
The first 30 pages were exciting, then it died...
The Insomniac Maker
No one really talks like that....
What an Absolute Let Down
Loved the setting but disappointed
Reminds me of a Talking Heads song
Pedantic, Repetitious & Hard to Finish
Prolixious Pompousness
Not stellar, but entertaining and at times interesting
Fascinating
Dan Brown needs an editor with a backbone
Decent Read, but Predictable
Did I expect too much?
It was also easy to see where the plot would turn as opposed ...
Langdon started bugging me...
Dan Brown is grasping at straws
This book is kind of stupid
Common sense stopped my reading this book
The Lost Time
I read the "audio" book. During the first part ...
One Wikipedia article said to the other...
Am I Missing Something Here
No mystery, light on history.
Dissapointing (spoiler alert)
Intriguing premise but even more predictable than Da Vinci Code
Speechless in DC
FIll In The Blanks?
World of Symbolism
Definitely Lacking Da Vinci Magic
Davinci + Angels = Lost Time, uh Symbol
Love all his books!
All Promise- no payoff
Your editor approved this??
A bit of a let down....
Reads Like a Wordy Screenplay
A furious pace and promising story which falls flat in it's finale.
My least favorite of Dan Browns works, disappointing
Unbelievably boring
More predictable than before, but just as engrossing
Entertainment
Completely Enjoyable
Not as captivating as Da Vinci Code
500 pages of smugness
A solid B+
A Whole Lot of Fluff
Chuckles and Winks
Not bad
Very disappointed
RErt
Very hard to finish
Two Masonic Thumbs Up (One Angry Editor's Thumb Down)
A Thriller to a Dead End
Typical Dan Brown Entertainment
Review **SPOILER ALERT***
Highly recommended
IMPROBABLE
Another ripping yarn
Wow.  A best-selling author can get anything published.
Way below Par
Save your money!
a giant helping of New Age blatherskite
Disappointing
A tough book to set down, but deeply flawed.
HUGE LETDOWN.
Fast paced yet annoying
Not worth the hype
Not as good as the others
Same Old Story
Mediocre and poorly written
This book is similar to other Dan Brown books in ...
This is a good book despite the reviews
Another enjoyable story from Dan Brown
You, the Amazon Reader could do better
Revolting nonsense
Entertaining In Usual Dan Brown Fashion
Dan Brown - THE LOST SYMBOL, 2009
Too many busy words not enough story line
It would be absurd if it weren't so boring
interesting read
More Boring than this Review
Good tension, conflict, formulaic
The Last Langdon (I hope)
Great Thriller But With Some Stereotyping
When searching for the light, don't forget to bring a flashlight
Needed a better editor
Nothing great
Disappointment
Started Great, Then Lost Steam...
Sub-par
Lost Symbol--a great read!
Believe the Critics
INOUE SATO is not a Japanese name for crying out loud!
Another Fascinating Trip With Robert Langdon
poorly written and edited
lost symbol review
Not a bad sequel
Avoid the audio route
Disappointing effort by Brown!
Way, WAY too formulaic and unbelievable
Meaning Behind the Mystery!
A bit of a disappointment
The Lost Dan Brown
Interesting Facts Wrapped Around a Poor Story
Dan Brown Does Not Disappoint
The Lost Symbol lost on many...
Watered-Down Milk, at best
Bring your suspension of disbelief to this book!!
Amazing, I couldn't put it down
A decent page turner
`I come for wisdom and he offers me wealth.'
Barely Brown
Long winded critics as well as author
Fair story
OK - But not on the same level as his other Langdon works.
The Symbol Got Lost as well as the meaning
Another Page Turner Knock-Out
Not a bad read, but just goes on tooo long
Good start...mediocre middle...terrible end.
Better than I expected
Langdon Slipping
A page turner that leaves you disgusted at the end, one of the worst novels I have ever read
Worth a read, but only if you don't mind a lecture
Meh.
I was whelmed....
Tiresome plotline
The Lost Review
Read your Bible
WOW!! Great page turner!
disagree with
It is what it is.
boring too long i got a headache
ANOTHER CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT!
A most enjoyable read
Truth, Fiction, and Lies
implausible story
Worthless pile of dreary information
I couldn't finish it
Bestsellers That Disappoint
What a Let Down
Not his best work
Another great one from Dan Brown
All of Dan Brown's books are complex, intriguing, ...
Don't Buy This Book!
Rated PG-13 - Only weighing in on the language, sex, and violence
Steaming Pile ...!
Disappointing....
I Agree With The Bad Reviews, But . . .
The Gullibility Test
Mostly good
Dan Brown managed to push the new low
Weighed, measured, and found wanting...
Great for first 4/5ths of the book...then crash!
A writer of many words and no surprises
Riveting and disappointing at the same time
Disappointing
Page turner but ending disappoints, also "flashed on" has got to go...
Took me a few months to get through it
Short review
Utter Rubbish!!!
Same Story, Different Point in History
Pains me to give Dan Brown low stars
How dark the con of man.
A disappointment
Mr. Langdon Goes to Washington....
A screenplay, not a book
YUCK
Same Ol Plot, Disappointing story
So glad I borrowed this instead of paying for it
Worth the Wait:  Everything an Intelligent Thriller is Supposed to Be
Entertaining but not his best
same old set up, repetive and ridiculous.
If you like one, you'll like them all
A let down...
If you read past the words, there is a great story here
a huge disappointment
Seeing The Light
Dan Brown succeeds again!
I just thought I'd buy into the hype but honestly how could you give this two stars
Big disappointment
Taken Advantage Of!!
One of the bottom ten books I've ever read!
Suspension of disbelief snapped
Wow, this boook is bad
laughing all the way to the bank
Same Blue Print but good
Like carbon copies?
A BELIEVABLE NOVEL BECAUSE MUCH OF IT IS TRUE AMERICAN HISTORY AND FACT
Not What I Expected in an Arrogantly Hubristic Manner
Set aside all rational thought if you want to enjoy the book
some great, some good, & some awful
This Book Builds and Builds to a Climax and Then . . . . Plop!
Much like The Da Vinci Code
And the secret word is......
Not a great read!
Annoying!
A fantastic page turner!
A Fast and Fun read
Flawed, lazy writing
Hannibal vs. Freemasonry
Good, but not great
A Fantastic, thrilling Page-turner!!!!
Not up to his other books
Stop the annoying suspense at the end of each chapter
A fun and exciting story, but more of the same
venting for both my son and myself
Worthy successor meets high expectations
OK but nothing great
Why Dan? Why?
great bedtime reading...bores you to right to sleep
Borrow, don't buy
A lot of smoke and little substance
Surprisingly better than I thought it'd be
Disappointing
Good enough for an airplane ride
Falls short of expectations
Ending was HUGE disappointment. What a rip off.
A matter of perspective
Dan Brown is a great author
Excellent intelligent entertainment.
Here's the real deal
Dan Brown does it again
Loved this book
Boring
Skip this, waste of time
Not his greatest work
Great writing, soft finish
Underwhelming
Another Dan Brown page turner...
2.5 stars.
Great at times but very predictable
Bits and pieces from Brown's other books
Dan Brown meets Neal Donald Walsh
Not as captivating as I'd have hoped...
Flawed? Yes. Great Read? You betcha!!
Felt Like He Tried Too Hard
From being an "Angel" to be "Lost"
Dan Brown has done it again
A Thiller with a Spiritual Twist
Thought provoking, masterful work!
Accurate but slow
Painful to read ...
The US Da Vinci Code
Both GOOD and BAD...but then again, this ain't Literature
Not Dan Brown's best
Really? *this review might contain minor spoilers*
Sooooo disappointing
Complete waste
Dan Brown, what happened?
Absolutely fabulous book
Good story but a little long as to the history ...
Meaningful, Fascinating
a book with three distinct parts, the good, the boring and the anticlimax
Great book.
Philosophical Suspense
White Knuckle Page Turner!
Typical Dan Brown
Great story
Fabulous!!
Some heady stuff--and not just the chase scenes
A travel guide to Florence
Could be better...
Enlightening and exciting reading.
Leaves me with more books to read
Blah, blah, blah
Typically excellent adventure to solve a great puzzle with lives and ...
Can't wait for his next work
novel or madlibs
Lost Symbol
Entertaining Novel!
Same old routine
Not his best work
The Lost $ymbol
Agree with all crticisms but it's also a fun read, couldn't put it down...
Lost symbol
Great Book
The Albrecht Durer Code
Great Disappointment
Very average
Great suspense and very interesting walk through cult and symbolism.
Half Fantasy, Half Religous Tract
This is by far the best book I've read in all my life
Frustrating
In the end it felt like the Wizard of Oz
Dan Brown improves on Da Vinci
Editing needed!
Not his best
Was intriguing until...
It's not Brown's best work. I bought this to listen on my ...
Predictable and tiresome: deeply disappointing
too much of a repeat..
One Star is Generous
Too similar to 'the Da Vinci Code'
Masonic rubbish
Suspenseful writing
not his best, not his worst
Enjoyed most of the book.
Good, but Slow and... Just UGH
Good beach read
Claiming that the plot of Michael Brown novel is ridiculous ...
Excellent novel
Transformation through books
Coulda' been half as long
Ok, but not great.
Right down the middle
Disappointing
Just another book
Long awaited, quickly read, langdon longing returns
Even Bollywood would have a better story line
Probably the worst book I have ever finished
Could have been better!
Right under our nose
Five Stars
Just what was expected.
Very long, not the best ending
I Expected More
Intriguing plot carried forward in an interesting and informative manner ...
I expected better.
Fast paced thriller
Looks like someone decided to play mad-libs...
I read the whole book for THAT?
Disappointing...
Interesting Book Quality Purchase
Entertaining read.
M. Night Shyamalan of the book world
Not my favorite read from the author
It was a good read but I had a couple or issues with ...
Meets expectations
My favorite of his books so far
Not a classic, but great storytelling
Are you kidding me?
Fascinating Facts
It's Like Clue meets Groundhog Day in a screenplay disguised as a manuscript.
A confused symbol of a lost writer.
As Good as "The DaVinci Code!"
Best of Dan Brown
Could have been written in half as many pages...
No editor ever looked at this piece of trash.
Excitement and Adventure
Formula or Mirror by any other name
Getting too formulaic
Waited this long for this?
Really Terrible Book
Disappointed
A ton of build up to nothing
Dan Brown does it again!
Mindless fun, if not taken too seriously
Let Dan Brown speak
Almost 600 pages...and a waste of your life.
He has done it again...
Not bad some factual problems but entertaining.
National Treasure was better
Better Researcher than Novelist
The flash backs were tedious and usually did not help move the story along ...
This book is almost as good as inferno
Arrived on time!
Another Great Roberter Langton Book
It was alright.
Couldn't Put it Down! Dedicate a Full Day to Reading it!
Lots of twists and turns
High School Evaluation
Could not put it down!
I hated it and I loved it
As above, so below
A fully cognizant holographic 4 star read
Praie the Lord...secretly
Star Wars with twists? Plagiarism?
I love this series by Dan Brown
Disappointing
Familiar Formula
It goes like this-Good (First few pages),it's OK(middle [part)..ohhh that's it!!..what the heck! dude!!
Where is Dan Brown?
Predictable, Stupid and Infuriating - no spoilers
Suspenseful
Lost Symbol entertaining and thought provoking
... a lot of suspense and drama and had a great surprise ending
You get what you pay for
I loved it!
Must compare as a book
The Lost Symbol
I give up..
More of the same
As enjoyable as Da Vinci Code
Frantic and Breathtaking
light entertainment, but otherwise useless
Abysmal!
A bunch of pseudo-science garbage
It should be article, not a novel
Pass.
pleasant fluffy read if not for dense main character
Done with Dan
Contender for top 5 worst books I've read
Screenplay ?
Much Ado About Nothing
Its...OK
Dan Brown doing what Dan Brown does best...not writing...
A bit disappointing....
Not nearly as bad as the negative hype would suggest
An accomplishment.
A great letdown at the end.
The Lost Symbol: A loser
Asks for too much
An Instant Best Seller
A Very, Very, Very Boring Book!
Preaching Overtakes the Story
I really wanted to like this book
Absolutely the Worst Book I have Ever Read
So disappointing
A lost great novel buried in fluff and preaching.
Pretty good read typical of Dan Brown
loved this book!
Dan Brown does it again
Boring Mystical Crap
The lost symbol
The Lost Symbol
The Lost SymBOREDOM
Worth a skip
The Lost Symbol
Could have been done in 100 pages or less
Good job, Dan Brown
Amazing
So Sad
Crazy Twists and Fascinating Subject Matter
On my--this is disappointing!
Good thriller.. a little long
Yawn
Over Hyped and Under Written
Reads like a screenplay
Entertaining Again
Like others, I too could not put this book down
Silly story and plot twists
Cheap thrills
Entertaining story
Its a screenplay not a novel
Slow to warm up and just ok in the end
Only thing I can say? Garbage
Read something more worthwhile. Very predictable
A good read from Dan Brown.
Phenomenal!
A Thrilling Read - Shouldn't Expect Anything Less From Brown
Don't buy it, get it from the library for free
An interesting and thoughtful read
2/3 done, should I finish it?
About 200 pages too long
Five years to create - what a waste, Dan!
I'm pretty sure it did not go down like this
An Open Mind with Vast Diversity
Well presented novel with interesting setting
A Little Disappointing
3 stars? Fair rating
A very unbalanced book
The Lost Symbol
Fabulous...
Very contrived
Favorite Dan Brown thus far
Read the review by  Valannin "Pantheon Outcast"
Had Potential, but dragged out too long
Slow start, thrills all the way, but ultimatly rather a let down
but I always enjoy Dan Browns books
A Disappointing Sell-Out...
It had good plot twists and surprise ending
Fun Book, not as good as the others
decent enough retain meant, but not revelatory.
A great Nancy Drew novel
Horrible Beyond Words
Great, great book
Difficult read
A MUST for DC natives
Page turner with too many pages
Loved it but.......
INTERESTING, SPELL BINDING AND WELL WRITTEN
Couldn't put it down.
Interesting
Would Rather Read about Cockroaches...
Yep, It's Lost All Right
Huge disappointment!
Fun and entertaining!
Tedious
I really really wantd to like this......
Disappointment after disappointment after disappointment after disappointment
Hated for it to end
Dull, see-through, didn't live up to the hype
Tired
Four for the price of one!
Waste of time and money
Stayed true to the series
Written for a movie rather than a reading audience
Brown has lost all credibility
A fast read
Thought provoking!
Was able to put the book down - Permanently - at p 73
Thought-Provoking theme!
More like Clancy every manuscript
Let the battles begin...
When will it end?
how much is Dan Brown paying you 5-star reviewers and where do I sign up?
What history do I wander within?
Dan Brown begins to fizzle out.
Fascinating
Another great read by Dan Brown!
Blah, Blah, Blah
Enlightenment
Suspense
Should have been cut to 1/4 of it's length
Another great book by Dan Brown!!
Unbelievable read
Classic Dan Brown. Very intriguing discussion of The Masons ...
most disappointing
Worst Read of 2009
Don't buy candy and complain about the sugar
Bored to tears
Seize the book
Riveting
Interesting
Fascinating narrative
Worst of the 3
Interesting concepts, boring delivery
The  Lost Symbol
Biblical Themes in The Lost Symbol
New-Age book disguised as a Robert Langdon novel
Waste of time and money
Listen to the abridges version or skip this one entirely
I expected more
Good, but
not his best
One of those "must finish quickly" books
Sorry, I had to resign at p.307...
Still a page turner
Tremendously Exciting Reading!
Hate to say it.....
enough already
Hate was too strong a word so I gave it two stars
Enjoyed it,but found it predictable
He jumped the shark around chapter 100
Not worth the wait
No surprises
Excellent as always.
predictable and disappointing
Disappointed
too predictable
The Masons are a Spent Force and the Noetics Don't Deserve Publicity
Weakest of the series
Homoerotic awfulness...
Freemasonry and Human Enlightenment
Good Solid Read
Another Langdon book delivers!
Couldn't put it down.
About What I Expected
Exceptionally boring
Does not live up to hype
Brown is NO Rowling
An OK read, if you like Dan Brown
Brown Largely Delivers the Goods Here
And Three is Not a Charm....
Another Fast-Paced Brown Novel
More lost than symbolic
Story as expected.
Lost on me
Enjoyable!
love the pictures
I Don't Care....
Rubbish
Lost me right from the start
More of the same
Too wordy and repetitive
Good style & plot, but sudo-science core.
OK read
Pretty amazing
Same story, New City.
A waste of money
A lot more detail than needed detracts from a good story.
Worst book of Mr. Brown
Great Read
Gutsy Followup
Just Not There
At times it shines, but rather same-ish and longwinded
The Lost Theology
Why couldn't he leave it at 450 pages??
Disappointed
yawn
Written for the screen for sure
Creators and Destroyers
Brown's Agenda is Anti-Christian, Pro-New Age
to be less then eloquent - Duhh...really THAT is the mystery?!
Disappointed
Washington dc
And if I could I would have given it zero stars
Another Good Page Turner
This was like shoving carpet tacks under my fingernails.
A blockbuster's blockbuster
Robert Langdon is in here.....somewhere.....
Perfect Novel
Enough Already
Good until the last 30pages...
Great for a laugh on a long road trip
The best
Thrilling Suspense!
Lost Symbol is lost in self interest.
The Lost Symbol...lukewarm
Amazon gave Symbol 5 stars?
Start with the ending first next time Mr. Brown
Thinking in Matphoical language expands our view of reality.
Insipid new age swill
Another great tweed and loafers novel, for those of us that love Robert Langdon.
A great book
Craft-y but not crafty
A good read.....
Good Grief Dan, were you paid by the word?
AWESOME!!! MY FAVORITE AUTHOR!!!
Wow!
Somewhat disappointing
The best Dan Brown book yet!
Predictable but incoherent, with a boring final
Not Impressed.
Disapointing Brown
Intriguing but overly wordy
Not the Best but Definitely Not as Bad as Some have Stated...
A Historical thriller based in the US.
OH MY GOD! Can a book be this bad!
"lost" to be sure
Awful book
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
A Continuation of Dan Brown's Work
My review
Interesting Faction read on Washington DC.
Swing and a Miss - Spoiler Warning
Good fun thrill ride!
A good book but give it 1 star for being a DRMed copy
A quick read but not a good book.
Interesting
Left Cold ...
Formulaic
Major disappointment
Predictable and repetitive
Avoid this book
Langdon Lost a Step
Horrible
I enjoyed this book!
Like it, but didn't love it!
Ugh
Lost Plot
Tommy Lightfoot Garrett Reviewed Dan Brown's latest Novel For Canyon News
A fun, adventurous ride.
Rollicking roller coaster of a read
Don't waste your time or money
Fast paced and interesting, but not as spell binding ...
Full of questions.....answered
Great
Good read
For much one of the best
Author Returning to his "roots"
this is the worst one yet
Dreck
Not his best effort
Interesting facts but no substance
A thrilling page turner.
very disappointing
Page turner, but in the end, it was mostly worthless calories
Boring and Unimaginative
The Movie National Treasure Was Already Made
the lost symbol
Boringggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg!
Don't waste your money and definitley not worthy of Hanks/Howard
can't go wrong with DAN BROWN
Slow going
OKAY book
Skip It!
Not One of Brown's Best Efforts
A Disappointment!
It should stay lost
Anticlimactic and Bad
Typical Dan Brown Novel
I loved this!
Brown always delivers
Not all that great but not awful.
Great story line
A good read
Worst of Dan Brown's books
Ho-Hum...
Educational and Thrilling
Don't Buy it -- Don't Even Borrow It
EXCITING and Thought-provoking
Outstanding story about science and the "Ancient Mysteries."
Very entertaining !!
I Agree 100% With Justin Lee
Underwhelmed
Kept my attention, BUT
A quite poor variation on an old theme
In Silly Fun...
def not par with Davinci Code
Weak
Hard to live up to the Da Vinci Code.
Just not worth the effort . . .
Thrilling self-development textbook
Masturbatory material for the non-existent mind!
Screaming. Piece. Of. Garbage.
I pre-ordered it. I waited anxiously to receive it...
Extremely Disappointed
Just as captivating
Breathtaking
fast and exciting
Disappointed
Typical Dan Brown
Sure there is a formula here...but if it is one you like...you will like.
I did manage to finish it, but barely
Great content!
Five Stars
facts not in evidence
So disappointing
I enjoyed the sprinkled facts about the Masons and their ties ...
Entertaining, but...
Utter garbage
This Book Makes Zero Sense!
The Lost Symbol
Lost Symbol Ranks as Brown's Best.
Good Read
I loved the descriptions of the historical WA DC buildings
Fun
Should've been titled "The Lost Sanity"
This is a hot mess.
Weak Weak Weak Ending
Horrible, horrible, horrible!!!
Four Stars
great book
a mind-numbing lecture on symbolism
Lost Eurasian Culture or Lost Symbol?
Another great read
Good book...not as good as Davinci Code
One of My Favorites
Slow
Some things should never make it to a trilogy
The weakest link in an otherwise great and funny chain
More of the same in Dan Brown's latest comedy
Politically Correct
Slow Start, Then A Page Turner
Disappointing
Great book!
Great Entertainment
A pager turner, but ultimately disapointing
ughhhhh ....
Lost Symbol
intriguing and full of suspense
Great book
couldn't put it down
Interesting and better than average

And Then, I Came to the End...
Mad-Lib Langdon Story
Very disappointed

Book Club Reading
...............
Dull characters, cheesier plot
Not Dan Brown's Best Book
Da Vinci lighting in a bottle elusive
digging up old definitions is an ok hobby I guess, but
What a bunch of baloney
Enlightening
Maybe I'm missing something......
I Love Dan Brown's Books
Three Stars
Followup to Da Vinci Code
Not sure about all the 1 stars, I thought it was pretty good.
Almost as Good as DaVinci and Angels
Loved it!
It is ok
I should have known better
Not robert langdons greatest adventure...
If you liked the De Vinci Code you'll like this
What's Not To Like?
No Text-To-Speech?
good read!
Dan Brown has tapioca for brains
A dangerous path of thought and belief.
Sleep deprivation!
The secret is... How to Die
AVID reader
Non-Stop Action and Suspense!
Interesting, bit of a let down...
One of Dan Brown's best!
Thriller, yes; worth it, no; quite disappointed...
Mediocre replay of the same formula.
Enjoyed the Hoodwink
Awful..I had to force myself to finish it...
Well jeez, I really liked it
A true page turner.
This is my last Dan Brown book
Read the last 35 pages first!? Dan Brown redeems himself!
entertaining
Not what I had expected from Dan Brown
Convoluted Plot
One of The Best!

plot twists were painfully obvious
Disappointing book.
Good read

The Lost Symbol - literally wonderful
Simply not engaging
Not up to his earlier books
Yuck!
TERRIBLE!!!!
Worth reading but nothing as good as Da Vinci
One of Brown's best
Not as good as his last two, but worth reading
The worst of his books
A page turner for the wrong reasons
Don't bother
What an awful book
A Fair Read
Awesome Read
