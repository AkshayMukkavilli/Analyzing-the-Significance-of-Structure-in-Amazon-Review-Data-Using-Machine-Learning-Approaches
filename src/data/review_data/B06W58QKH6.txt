 Ok so I promised myself I would test out the Fitbit against the several negative comments and come back and leave a review. All but ONE of the negative comments prove true. Let me start with the negative comments that proved untrue and why:<br/><br/>Myth 1: this Fitbit doesn’t record accurate heart data, especially when working out. TRUTH: Yes it does record extremely accurately, including during workouts but you have to read the instructions!! When you workout the instructions say to tighten the strap one hole tighter than you usually wear it. Then you move the Fitbit 1-2 finger widths up from where your wrist meets your hand. After doing this I checked the Fitbit heart rate against my polar heart monitor every 5 minutes during a 45 min kickboxing workout. It was EXACTLY in tune with the polar heart rate monitor, always right on or within 5 BPM. The people who say otherwise are not following instructions or giving it a chance to figure out the best wrist placement.<br/>Myth 2: The light against your skin keeps you up at night/you can see the light as you try to sleep. TRUTH: No, you cannot see the blinking light that is against your skin. If you can then your band is way too lose. I wear it every night and never see the light blinking. I don’t even remember I’m wearing it!<br/>Myth 3: it scratches easily. TRUTH: I’ve banged mine up pretty bad and to my surprise not a scratch in sight!<br/><br/>Okay now for the negative comment that I discovered was true: It does not track steps when you are pushing a grocery cart or stroller. Sadly, this is true. Very frustrating when you have a child and you push them around the zoo all day in a stroller to later discover your steps barely moved. I solve this by letting my husband push the cart/stroller when possible. :) But this is the biggest negative for me about this Fitbit. I just learn to let the number on the screen go on those days when I have no one to push the cart and know that day I had a lot more steps than recorded.<br/><br/>Things I love:<br/>1. The constant HR monitoring where you can see your heart health over time improve or get worse (in the Fitbit app)<br/>2. The sleep monitoring - this has been so eye opening! I can’t wait to check the app in the morning to see how much deep sleep I had the night before. I now know based on my results how I’m probably going to feel that day.<br/>3. Getting texts and calls!! It buzzes when you get a text or call and will scroll the message across the screen or show you who is calling. LOVE this feature.<br/>4. Stays charged for a long time.<br/>5. LOVE that it shows you total calorie burn for the day. Like the calories your body burns just by sleeping or sitting to workouts. This was the biggest reason I got this Fitbit (besides the constant HR monitoring) so I could make sure I was truly burning the calories I thought I was burning to aid in weight loss. That helped me to I know exactly how many calories to cut to lose weight.<br/><br/>Things I wish I could change/do but in no way a deal breaker:<br/>1. Rearrange which stat I see first when I tap my watch.<br/>2. Be able to set it so that I can constantly see my HR when I’m working out. It gets old tapping it several times while I’m working out to find my HR.<br/>3. I don’t trust the calorie burn calculator. It seems really low. After a kickboxing workout where my polar monitor says I burned 300 calories, the Fitbit only recorded 130 calories. I’ll keep looking into this and see if I can get something figured out. Thankfully you can add your workout in MyFitnessPal and it will sync up to the Fitbit app, including the calories you burned.<br/>4. Would be cool to have an option to add optional stats when you click through on your wrist, such as the weather.<br/><br/>I recommend this Fitbit if you are looking to track constant HR, sleep, total calorie burn, and get alerted to texts and calls. I have learned so much about myself and my health.
 My Fitbit Alta HR has been super buggy over the last couple of months (screen goes dead midday despite full battery) and I followed all the troubleshooting advice (which usually consisted of a "reset").  It helped for awhile, but this week the HR monitor stopped working altogether.  This is the SECOND Fitbit that I have owned that mysteriously stopped working around a year after purchase (I had the Charge previously that literally started falling apart after a year).  When I contacted Customer Service, their "canned" response was that my device was beyond the one year warranty window (by two months, FYI), and the best they could do was offer a 25% discount on my next Fitbit...end of story.  I have now had two failed products from this company...that's a ridiculous track record and abysmal customer service...why on earth would I buy another?!?  There are WAY too many fitness trackers on the market these days at WAY more reasonable prices to treat customers this way.
 Item arrived not NEW. I didn't like the product itself, I should have read more comment about it before buying. It's hard to use, and I realized I better by smartwatch.<br/><br/>What I don't like:<br/> - it's vibrates only ones when phone is ringing and vibration is too subtle, so I will probably miss the call if my phone is in backpack or somewhere in the pocket where I don't feel it. That is why I want to feel vibration on my hand as other smartwatches do.<br/> - tapping constantly (and hard enough) on display is nightmare, it's not usable for me or my wife.<br/> - icons are too small on display<br/> - twisting wrist constantly is hard<br/> - display is constantly goes off. it's like 8 bit display, why can't you make it show time all the time, I need to know time when I need it, w/o twisting my arm like crazy.<br/> - it doesn't count steps correctly. I really don't know how it counts, but it counts something different.<br/> - when I bought this wristband, there was already someone's steps counted, so we couldn't remove them, this is bad!<br/><br/>Update: now I got calls from fitbit(or seller I don't really know) related companies ask me to remove that review, as it hurts their business. Guys, I don't agree with you. If product is bad for me I have a right to express it, so you can make next one better and not fool customers.
 I purchased for my mom, her doctor said she had slight high blood pressure and needed to lose some weight. I always thought this was a fad but she is really enjoying it. It monitors her activity and I have it set up to send a report to my email. She loves when it shakes and tells her to "get moving". Also loves the "fireworks" when goals are accomplished. She has gone from 5000 steps to 10000 steps daily. I failed to mention the user is a 68 yr old woman who is NOT computer literate, was previously taking blood pressure medication and now is not. In that sense this device paid for itself. I also think it's kind of a status symbol of some sorts where people of the baby boomer generation think your "with the times" when you are wearing technology at their age. It's also a free activity that is beneficial for people in retirement on a fixed income. I'm probably being too harsh for the removal of one star. As a designer I feel like the gold color is on trend and looks expensive. I felt like the band and pink color goes more to the purple side and does not complement the rose gold. Although I'm not a fan of rose gold, I decided that it looks more natural as gold next to my mums jewelry than fake shiny gold. She has chosen a band, that is more lux of which there are many options on amazon. I'm glad it displays the time since she is a flip phone user and still wears a watch. The FITBIT app on her iPad (which she uses for NYTimes but still can't write an email) she said is very easy to understand. Overall, I'd recommend. I'm glad I didn't get her the watch since that has too many features and more for Gen X and down or a tech savvy baby boomer. Also glad I didn't get the one with NO screen and just the lights, that one is better for young people who want to conceal their FITBIT and carry around a smart phone (also nice since they make bands like Tory Burch and other "designer" licensed products). The Alta unfortunately does not have this option of tory burch bands but even though the selection is limited, good options are still available. Final thought...can't believe my mom uses a tread mill now, that's the kind of excitement this little device has spurred on.
 I really wanted a small slim tracker, I have very slender wrists. And I wanted one with a continuous heart rate monitor but all trackers with those where to big for me. I was very happy when the Fitbit Alta HR was announced. I have had it for going on 1 week now and I am very pleased. It fits well on my wrist and doesn't look guady at all. The watch like clasp is great, the clasp on old fitbits were awful, they did a wonderful update with these ones. The continuous heart rate tracker is exactly what I was hoping it would be. So far I am extremely pleased with my purchase. I would give this 5 stars, my only reason I'm holding off is because I want to see how long the battery lasts on a full charge. Will update then.<br/><br/>Update: The charge lasted 6 days till it notified me low battery, I let it run another full day and it still didn't die. Charged it on the 8th day. Very happy with the battery life so far.
 I love my Fitbit! I think you can get the best usage out of it by also using the phone app. It not only tracks steps, but also heart rate, sleep patterns, food intake, water intake, and exercise.
 Although I refer to it as the most expensive alarm clock ever, I do love this little gadget and the vibrating silent alarm feature is definitely my favorite. I'm not a morning person, and this wakes me up without making me want to smash it to bits. It was really easy to set up and it's easy to operate both the device and app. Battery life is great - I get about a week out of it. I haven't used it for fitness yet, per se, because I was hoping it would show any sharp changes in my heart rate but unfortunately it shows a "snapshot" every five minutes or so. Despite that, there are a lot of really great tools I'm glad I have this for because it's been interesting to KNOW when my heart rate increases and being able to link it to a cause. The sleep tracking insights are my 2nd favorite feature - Invaluable. The best thing I can say is that I've gotten so used to wearing it that I forgot I had it on and accidentally submerged it in the pool once - Still works great. I also splash it washing dishes frequently, so the water resistance feature is strong with this one. I recommend it. Hope to update this review with workout tracking in the future, but I can say for now that it is really satisfying to see the "fireworks"  show congratulating you on meeting goals! I love the fuchsia color strap, but I get tons of compliments on the brown leather one I bought separately.
 I've only had this for a couple days so I will update as time goes on. So far so good with this tracker! I've had the Fitbit flex, charge, and charge HR as well as a polar FT7 and M400. The polar watches I like but I felt they were too big for daily use. With the charge and charge HR I again thought they were too big for daily use. The Alta HR so far has been great for all day use since it's slimmer than any other fitness tracker. I like the display and have mine set to show the time and my heart rate. I tested the HR monitor out by wearing my polar H7 chest strap and then comparing the results from the polar h7 chest strap to the Alta hr and they were actually pretty similar. Overall I'm really happy with my Alta hr!<br/><br/>Added some pictures. The sleep tracker on this is pretty cool. I like how it tells you which type of sleep you were in and for how long.
 I've worn this everyday for a month or so.<br/><br/>I may have purchased this for different reasons than most. I use it for a repeating silent alarm throughout the day (one that is not my cel), tracking heart rate at the gym/hiking, and tracking sleep. I don't really care about steps or calories and those really seem to be what the device is made for (although I haven't checked its accuracy).<br/><br/>Out of the gate, it had a problem starting. It was supposed to automatically sync during setup after it was charged, and it wouldn't. I had to search online to troubleshoot it, and there were many other people that had the same problem and few different things to try it, but the info provided with the product was not helpful.<br/><br/>The display is supposed to come on automatically when you turn your wrist to look at. Doesn't for me. I have it tagged in the setup info to be on my left wrist, which it is. But it will display when I'm moving my arm in every direction except how one would look at their watch. The alternative it to tap it. I know it's not a touch screen, and one shouldn't expect the same responsiveness, but I have to tap it hard 4-6 times to get the display to show. It's especially annoying when the alarm goes off (which I use very frequently) because I have to keep tapping it several times to turn off the alarm otherwise it will go off again in 9 minutes.<br/><br/>The heart rate monitor is pretty consistently 10-20 bpm off when I'm on cardio equipment at the gym that can also read my heart rate. It doesn't matter what brand of cardio equipment, what type of exercise, the Fitbit is always much lower than the reading the equipment gives me. I've tried both tightening the band and sliding it up my arm, but it doesn't seem to help. It seems to be worst when I'm sweating so I don't know if that interferes with it somehow. (Which you can see might be an issue when exercising). I know I can get a reading from the machine I'm using, but I wanted the fitbit to actually track and record my heart rate, which is proving challenging. Plus, I have very little faith in the readings it makes when I can't cross check it with anything else (hiking, running outside, etc).<br/><br/>The sleep monitoring is interesting and useful. I have nothing to compare it to, so until I know better the time I spend in each stage is what it tells me it is. Much like how I planned to use my exercise information, I like that I have a record to see how I'm doing over time.<br/><br/>And be aware if your skin is fairly sensitive to touch, the device itself gives off a strange pulsing feeling while you wear it. It is odd. I don't love it and it's a good excuse to take it off whenever I'm not trying to track something. Be warned.<br/><br/>I would have definitely given it a 2.5 rating if that was an option. I probably would have gone down to a 2-star rating, but I do still use it everyday and plan to continue using it because it's the only option I have for what it does. I just wish it did most things better. I wasn't expecting perfection, but I am disappointed. After you break the seal on the box, I'm not sure it's returnable for any reason other than it being defective (I don't know), but even so I feel you need to spend some time with it to really get a feel for it to decide how it works best for you. Other than the display being a pain in the ass to work I'm not sure any of this technically counts as defective, and even the display is seemingly more a function of poor design than not working the way it is supposed to. It's just not a great product.
 It simply doesn't work well. It would add 2500-3000 steps per workday while I was sitting at my desk working all day. It would also add 150-300 steps per night as I slept. Very disappointing. I was really looking forward to using the Fitbit for a long time to come. However, I had to return it after just 3 days. The data it provides is inaccurate and unreliable, which makes it completely worthless to me. And I don't think I just had a defective item as I found MANY users reporting exactly the same problem in online forums that I wish I had seen prior to purchasing. Ah well...resuming my search for a decent looking fitness tracker that really works. Is there one out there?
 The screen cracked due to summer heat only. Looking at the Fitbit boards, they know this is a problem for Alta HR products and want it to be a 1-year throw away item, or less depending on your purchase date. The heart rate monitor during exercise is also terrible as is the sleep sensitivity. So if I wake up, but I'm not going to get up for a while, or I'm watching TV on the sofa, I try to take the fitbit off. Their customer service and two types of reps on their chat boards are also annoying, don't answer questions, delete responses that are not in violation of the community policy, they deleted adventures, when in 2016 and 2017 they said they were going to add to them. The only incentive to stay with them is to keep getting badges. So if you don't have a fitbit, don't get one. Better not to start down this path. The Charge 2, according to the customer support rooms are having the same screen cracking problems and Fitbit won't accept a return after 30 days. However, someone suggested that depending on your state law, if it happens early enough it should be covered as a faulty product and they must fully refund it.
 If I could give it negative stars I would. It worked for about a week and the battery failed. They sent me a replacement and it would not even charge. I asked for a whole new kit. They told me to send them the defective unit. So I put it in the original packaging with all its components. They tell me they only received the fit bit head. I don’t know what happen all I know I have never had an issue like this.  I spent extra money on extra large envelope to fit the whole box. Now it’s been quiet for about 2 weeks. I’m on hold with yhem now. All I can say it was the worst Christmas present as far as my 11 year old daughter is concerned.

I have been looking around for a fitness watch for some time now, I would say at least more than 6 months. If I was going to spend a great amount of money on something I wanted to make sure it was just what I wanted and that I liked it as well as the way it fit. I measured my wrist and i was right at small and large, so I went ahead and went with large, which gives me some 3 more notches to use for it's tightest fit, so the 4th notch fits me perfectly. I suggest if you are just right at the end of a small and beginning of a large measurement, I would recommend going with the large band. I chose the fitbit alta HR because it can still give me my text and call notifications and I was not worried about answering it from my watch or texting back. If my phone is in the other room and I get a call or text, I can see who is calling and read the text on my watch and decided if I want to reply now or later. The functions of the watch are great, easy to use, and scan through right at your wrist where your stats are at. I love that this watch is on the smaller side, it is not bulky at all unlike some watches seem to be. The sleep tracker on it seems to be so accurate and gives you really good details. The app is amazing too, everything is synced with my app on my phone and can read into further detail when I want to. Fitbit also has other apps that it can work with, like MapMyRun.<br/>If you found this review helpful, please let me know my selecting helpful at the bottom.
 This thing has refused to sync to my phone off and on since I bought it just over a year ago. It'll work fine for a day or two and then go back to not syncing, resulting in days or even weeks of lost data while fighting with it to start syncing again. This has been an issue across three separate Android phones.<br/><br/>There are 4 possible results of my attempts to sync my Fitbit Alta HR. 9 times out of 10 I get one of the first 3 options.<br/><br/>1. The progress bar acts as if it is doing something but never actually syncs.<br/>2. The progress bar stalls at 10% and never actually syncs.<br/>3. The app can't "find" the Fitbit and hangs on "Looking..."<br/><br/>Or, most rarely,<br/>4. The Fitbit syncs.<br/><br/>Upon scouring Fitbit's forums for a solution and trying everything mentioned countless times (restart the device, disconnect and reconnect the device from your account, restart Bluetooth, restart the phone, etc), I've found nothing that helps, at least not for more than a day or two.<br/><br/>And don't bother asking for help from Fitbit Support, as they completely disregard anything written in a help request, blatantly advising users to do what they've already tried and said didn't work. If I had known how little help Fitbit would be in terms of supporting their own product, I never would have bought this. It appears that once a customer has bought the product they no longer care whether or not it actually functions. Unfortunately most reviews don't seem to mention this.<br/><br/>There are other brands out there that I think are more worth looking into. I definitely will not be buying another Fitbit.
 WARNING - This is a really great product however it can have a very serious charging problem. If you do not believe me search the internet for Fitbit Alta HR Charging problem and you will see plenty of proof. I have one now and I have an open ticket with them.  Yes they have support but they will march you through endless steps to get it working.  I am not sure if they will fix mine yet, but wanted to warn people that you need to expect to say goodbye to the unit while they fix it, IF they fix it.
 Wonderful quality. Had it for two months. Honestly no complaints. Its the perfect size for me width-wise and the small fit well - I have a little wrist. I love that the screen comes on when you flip your wrist - convenient for the clock without it being visible all the time (and I can casually check the time without being rude!!). I love that the app tracks things - my personal favorites are the steps (of course), the water intake, that I can see my texts and calls on the fitbit (helpful while at work when I am busy or can't/shouldn't look at my phone), the alarm, and the sleep. Heart rate is definitely neat but not really helpful after the cool-ness wears off after a month or so. There are other features but I use those on a daily basis. Battery lasts several days, maybe 4 or so? depending on what features you have turned on/off.
 If this device actually did what it was designed to do, it would have been perfect for my needs. But it doesn’t. The heart rate monitor on the device itself is flawed and randomly announces that your heart is going to explode in fibrillation or that you have no heart at all- useless for workouts, useless for those who need to get early warning of heart symptoms.<br/><br/>The app on iOS is so flawed, it tells me that I’ve not moved for days at a time, when I train 4+ hours daily. The sleep tracker doesn’t work either- I’d be dead sleeping more than a fitful hour nightly- at one point the app actually accused me of alcohol abuse, siting the sleep tracker’s errors as proof! Water consumption tracking forgets amount you’ve entered, and dietary tracking is down too. Not a single function is working properly. Phone support in India or Pakistan or come neighboring country accuses you of trying to scam, and lies about known tech issues and refuse to file a bug report to their IT department.<br/><br/>If you’re considering a tracker, it’s a life changer... but I cannot recommend this model, and the company’s practices are questionable.
 Device not responsive after several hours of charging and troubleshooting per Fitbit support instructions on Fitbit forums (ensure charger connected correctly, try multiple times to restart/reset, try to sync with a PC...) Still nothing on the screen or any indication of power. While I like the Fitbit architecture, this is a lot of trouble for a fairly expensive device. I decided to return for a refund rather than bother trying to exchange.
 I'm fairly frustrated with this product. It certainly keeps accurate information on steps, heart rate, etc.  I really like the grey band color a lot... even more than I hoped.  Notices for phone calls and texts come across the screen as expected (preference set up online).  BUT, to get this fitbit to illuminate, at my request, to check any information at all, requires whacking it several times on the screen or shaking my arm like a crazy person, and even then, it doesn't always come on.  It is neither smooth nor easy.  Grrrr... I don't want to whack my own hand repeatedly.  I don't want to shake my arm uncontrollably. I want to turn my wrist toward me (which is also supposed to illuminate the screen) or tap on it ONCE, with average intensity.  This shouldn't be so hard.  I find myself not wearing or using this fitbit it as a result.  I called customer support when I first received this item and was told to reset it using the computer, which I did.  The problem continues and now too much time has passed to return it.
 I love this thing.  It lets you customize almost everything and is easy to use.  You can sync from your computer and then to your phone, then to the device.  You don't need the dongle although sometimes it might be useful for some.  The charger cord is a bit short too but it's not the end of the world.  Depending on where you charge this, you can get a USB extension if necessary.  It will charge faster from a wall outlet than a USB connection.  Over all, this is a great product.
 Tracks heartbeat all day but becomes useless when you start exercising. No amount of adjusting the position or tightness gives consistent pickup. Half the time or more you just get "---". Also no way to start and leave exercise mode, so you can't keep track of time spent. Very frustrating im going to half to buy a Polar to supplement this  if I want exercise tracked reliably. Touchscreen responsiveness is also inconsistent.
 Really like the Alta over my previous Charge!  The look is sleeker, the battery lasts a really long time and they continue to upgrade the app to provide some great feedback on sleep and heart rate.
 Not a fan of the autotracking an activity session with this new fitbit. Reason being is that the tracking will drop the Heart rate completely in the middle of an activity session, and thus messing up the time tracked. I've tried turning Heart Rate tracking to always on, adjusting the strap tension and strap position, and even tried to keep the skin under as dry as possible by wiping or blowing quickly, and sometimes the Heart Rate will not pick up again for several minutes. So it ends up reading the amount of time (and calories burned) being less than your actual workout. I'm disappointed in this honestly. Maybe if the fitbit phone app has a function to set that when you're in and out of activity mode from there, and let that information sync with the device, maybe that might help offset the autotracking prematurely ending.<br/><br/>I guess this is the trade off with this model being more slim-line: they can only put so much into the hardware.<br/><br/>PS. It seems like its also not good about tracking strength-training sessions, and primarily works only with cardio sessions.
 I have &amp; love fitbit's charge 2 &amp; I just bought the new Alta HR to wear for other occasions (it's half the size &amp; practically does the same as the charge 2) Other bonus is the gray color band the Alta came with. Love the color. It's lightweight &amp; awesome, and prior to buying another fitbit, I read that you can set up multiple watches on your fitbit account &amp; it took less than 10 minutes to fully set up &amp; sync to my phone &amp; computer. Your account will automatically detect which one your wearing. Must buy if your a fitbit addict like me :)
 I like the concept of how this product tracts sleep. The fitbit Alta HR does not work properly for me. I place it on the recommended spot 2 inches below wrist and it does not record heart rate consistently. I go through gaps during the day where it does not record.  Many times I think it makes up heart rate. I was taking a cycle class and we were at a climatic intense part in class and the fitbit said my hr was at 88 bpm. That is not likely. The device does not record hr consistently when I excercise. That's basically the whole point on why I bought it. Many times it doesn't record hr at all.
 UPDATE: Sensor failed so I cannot turn off the heart-rate monitor, which glows a brilliant green both on and off the wrist, causing the battery to run down to zero in less than an hour. After a reasonable amount of time repeating the instructions on their website, the heart-rate monitor still wouldn't turn off (and I bought this model because I wanted the monitor). I called their tech support line and it is not repairable. The best I could get from them was a 25% discount on my NEXT fitbit. NOPE. 14 months is not enough for me to give these people any more of my hard-earned money, I can get a free pedometer.<br/><br/>I almost immediately managed, by reaching into my otherwise unarmed handbag, to put a disfiguring scratch across the face. So it seems a little over vulnerable - I put my hand in there all the time and have never come out with a scratch like that. It looked sleek for about three days then it was all over.<br/><br/>It cannot be turned off, and flashed on whenever you turn your wrist. Therefore, you have to remove it and make sure it's in the bottom of your purse before you go to the theater. (same dangerous accessory mentioned above.) I gather it just sits there flashing until you fish it out again, which doesn't help battery life. I guess the alternative is slapping some duct tape over it, but you know...<br/><br/>Now, almost a year later, I find that the strap keeps popping off. It's kind of inconvenient but I suppose that it will eventually drop off in the subway and that will solve that problem.<br/><br/>It does count steps and measure heart rate, and tell your phone a lot of interesting things about my sleep patterns. I suspect that I didn't really need to spend $179 for this.
 I loved the Alta HR when I first got it. Worked great, for 4 months. Now it is losing more and more steps. A mile  in March-August was about 22,000 steps. Then it started dropping - 2000, 1900, on til now it registers less than 1500 steps a mile. I tried to work with Customer Service twice.  The reps couldn't seem to understand the device was degrading over time under exactly the same circumstance. They kept explaining it must be things I haven't changed at all, like the band, where I wear it, etc.  I suppose that's because it's just device failure and they do nothing about that.
 I can’t give the Fitbit Alta HR anything but a 1 star since it was defective. The product arrives with zero instructions with the exception of download the Fitbit app. I have sense enough to know that you should always charge these type of items fully before use, which I did - try. I plugged the item in, the screen flashed a clock briefly then went blank. Not knowing if this was normal I left it to charge. After several hours I tried to activate it and nothing would happen. After finding suggestions on the internet and attempting them, I called support. Followed their instructions. Nothing. I was told to ship it back. Very disappointed. I did notice during my search for instructions that many others were complaining of the same experience.
 I've had my regular fit bit alta since it came out and was excited to have the heart rate monitoring available in the HR.  Alta HR #1 - Day 3 by 9am it registered that I had walked 20,000 steps, when looking at the hourly graph the total was 1,900.  I had an online chat with fit bit and there was nothing they could do and it was not a known issue.  By the end of the day I had over 30,000 steps when my average daily is 7k to 10k.  I got two 'badges' I didn't REALLY earn added to my fit bit profile and they  can't remove them.  So I requested a replacement.  Alta HR #2 - been wearing for a week and it TOO is no accurately tracking, steps are ok this time but sleep is WAY off.  It's not registering and shows step activity that did not occur (not just restless or awake).<br/>Bottom line-  I'm now trying to figure out since I sent back the original how I can get a full credit for the replacement, had to send an email to Amazon  because it showed a $0 refund.  PIA!!  Fitbit has more work to do to figure out weird glitches on this device.<br/>Back to my regular alta....Sad.
 I have very small wrists measuring barely 5.5 inches. This fits my wrist great! I had an old fitbit charge small and it was bulky and big and left pretty wide gaps around the sides of my wrist. There's no gaps with this one and it feels so light when I'm wearing it. It's also much slimmer which I think looks much better on a small wrist like mine. I've been looking around for a fitbit or other fitness tracker that would fit me properly and not look big and bulky and out of place. If you have tiny wrists like me this will fit you great! I have mine set on the second to last notch and it's perfect.
 After about 30 days the Alta HR's "detailed sleep stages" capability -- a key selling point from Fitbit -- stopped working.  This is a well-documented software problem with the HR, which Fitbit is taking its own sweet time fixing.  Just search on the Fitbit "help" forums for "Alta HR stopped showing sleep stages" or do a more general search on the Help forums.  If a key feature of the watch doesn't work, what's the point of buying it? I strongly recommend that you look elsewhere, at least until the problem is fixed. I will update this review when/if FItbit fixes the problem.<br/><br/>Update 11/10/18.<br/><br/>So far, no progress from Fitbit on addressing the problem of not providing "detailed" sleep stage information.  Very discouraging.  A lot of lip service from Fitbit on the "Community" boards, but no results whatsoever.  If you're looking for a device to provide useful sleep information consistently, as of this date look elsewhere I'd say.<br/><br/>Also, beware that the Fitbit Community boards are NOT a bastion of free speech.  I have had, and have observed, multiple posts even modestly critical of Fitbit for the detailed sleep stages debacle pulled down.  So if you have a good impression about a product after reading the Community boards, take it with a grain of salt.  If you don't happen to know what a "Potemkin village" is, google it.  That's what Fitbit is operating in its "Community."<br/><br/>Update 11/30<br/><br/>In the last almost 3 weeks, there has been no apparent progress resolving the problem.  The only change is that the Fitbit moderators on the Alta HR Help forum acknowledge the problem and claim Fitbit is working on it.  Feels like the Gulag guards acknowledging their is a shortage of food.  Anyone who buys this tracker for sleep is . . . unwise!<br/><br/>Final Update.<br/><br/>After months and months of getting the runaround from Fitbit, I gave up and got a Garmin Vivoactive 4.  Much better device and software, waterproof, pulse ox as well as heart monitoring.  Please, you owe it to yourself before buying any Fitbit product to do the research.  Every Fitbit device -- Charge 3, Versa, Alta HR, etc. -- has pages and pages of posts documenting problems with sleep tracking as well as other functions.  Based on product quality, the company is circling the drain; they just don't know it yet.  Choose something else!
 Before purchasing ANY of the Fitbit trackers, verify that your device (smart phone, tablet, computer) works with Fitbit. I have an LG smart phone and NONE of the newer models (v30 , v40, etc.) are supported. I also attempted to down load the Mac application to sync through my laptop (mac powerbook 2017 model Seirra MacOS) and that didn't work either. I couldn't even  setup the tracker! I finally was able to setup through my husband's fitbit account on his Windows PC and once it was setup, I was able to sync to an older android tablet. The online support for fitbit is absolutely terrible. No help what so ever.<br/><br/>I bought this for the heart rate and sleep monitoring. While it works for now, I'm afraid that with another software update, I will lose  the ability to sync and be left with a step counter that cost $125. There are many options on the market that do not have these issues. Once it stops syncing, I will be looking for another product.<br/><br/>Udate: I bought the "dongle" on the fitbit.com web site. It still does not sync. The application spins for a while then returns with an "Unknown Connection Error". My husbands older zip can no longer sync to his smart phone once it updated to Anroid Pie. Check the online forums, a TON of complaints about Android Pie for months but no solution provided. Again. DO NOT BUY.
 I have owned this Fitbit Alta HR for one week and the HR monitor has stopped working and the pink band has black wear showing on it. Extremely disappointed and returning. I owned the Fitbit Alta previous to this and never had any issues with it.
 The battery started draining after a few hours about a month after I bought this thing.  It went from holding its charge for a week to less than half a day.  This is the second fitbit I've owned.  The band on the first one kept falling apart so I had to throw that one away.  I'm done with fitbit.  This was the 2nd defective productive of theirs I have bought so I guess the shame is on me.
 I love the features of the Alta HR. The sleep tracking and heart rate monitor get graphed out in the app. It tracks steps just fine. It's super comfortable, easy to keep clean and dry, and I love that I can get different bands and easily swap them out.<br/><br/>I'm having the hardest time getting it to charge! I have to adjust it on its charger a dozen times to get it to begin charging, and set it down or release it very carefully to not stop the charge.<br/>This mignt not be the worst, but the other issue is that it doesn't hold a charge for more than 3 days. Even with bluetooth off on my phone. I was hoping for at least a 5 day charge.<br/><br/>Alas, the box got lost in my move so I'll be using this thing until it dies. It is comfortable and I like the actual function it provides.
 Got one for everyone in our family after we found out our pre-teen son has a heart condition.  Now our entire family is reminding each other to drink more water, watching how healthy our eating choices are with far greater care, and hopping up that last 10 minutes of the hour to walk around together. We love that you can use a phone app to track all this and more, and set alarms, how many steps you want to do in a day, how many days a week you want to work out, and so on.  It's a bit pricey for a glorified toy, but when it fits your lifestyle and you can buy so many cool colorful bands for it right here on Amazon and CHEAP, it's been a beneficial addition to our family's new changes and has helped keep us motivated and committed!
 This is the worst product. I had it less than 2 weeks and it wasn't working correctly. I talked with the Fitbit folks and we trouble shooter the device. I got a return code for the product and now since it is still not working, they say I need to deal with AMAZON but that is a nightmare because they just point you back to the manufacturer. This is $150 and not worth the endless syncing issues and non recording of data.
 In 2800+ reviews, I think it's all been said, except maybe this: I bought this as a gift for my wife, after reading the fine print in the manual she gave it to my daughter and I've ordered an Alta without the heatbeat monitor for my wife. Basically, it warns not to use if you are photosensitive or have one of several other ailments. Unfortunately, my wife is on a medication that makes her sensitive to the sun so she decided to heed the warning.<br/><br/>My daughter, on the other hand, loves it.
 Comfortable band, but I prefer my fancy options....tbuthis fitbit doesn't pick up casual walking while shopping. Note: walk firmly.
 The tracker and the app do not sync together.  Fitbit has told me they have been working on this for about 3 - 4 months.  After numerous updates still does not sync.  If you pay $149.00 for a product that says it has access to an app that will help you will motivate and help you with your workout, healthy eating and sleep and does none of these things.  Total waste of money, would not recommend anyone purchase any model because from reading reviews all have problems.  Fitbit should be ashamed of themselves.
 Buyer beware. The bands are cheap and start falling apart almost immediately. (Quick Google search will confirm this is common. Wish I had seen this prior to purchase.) Mine started tearing away within a month of purchase. Fitbit customer support will make you feel criminal when you contact them about it. And if you purchase anything other than the basic model, be prepared to shell out more money to replace their defective item. Fitbit has shameful business practices.
 What an absolute joke! If you work or live on an off-shift schedule, you are not allowed to use a FitBit. It will not allow you to set activity periods for data collection to times that don't fit into the 9-5 lifestyle. For example, the picture I have included. I am a night manager, and I get out of bed at 12pm every day, and stay up until 4-5 am, including on my days off. FitBit WILL NOT ALLOW YOU to set those times or anything near it. Numerous people with similar issues (night nurses, etc) have posted to the FitBit community forum about this issue and FitBit's official response is, repeatedly, "We have no plans to implement that feature". Feature? They've locked and excluded inputs of certain times of activity for absolutely no reason, and refuse to remove those limitations. Millions of people are automatically blocked from using this product properly, for no reason, and with no warning pre-purchase. This is utterly ridiculous and not warning people of this useless limitation pre-purchase is a deceptive trade practice. not only will I be returning this product, I will be filing a whatever formal complaint I can with Amazon regarding the seller, and contacting the FTC.
 Very disappointing!Worked for two days now won't sync. I've tried everything!
 I'm not a health nut.  I have a fairly sedentary job and get my exercise more from walking-gardening-and similar type activities. Therefore, I was not very concerned with how this device tracks during any specific type of workout, and I'm not tracking calories burned. I am interested in heart rate, sleep, steps per day, and the various reminder functions, so this review focuses more on those.<br/><br/>The main reason I got a Fitbit:  I wanted to keep track of my steps, and I very much needed a way to get silent alarms at work, as I don't carry my phone everywhere. Once I started wearing the Fitbit, I felt a lot better about how many steps I take in a day:  I have a good pedometer app on my phone, but that's not effective when you're moving around a lot without the phone in hand. For whatever reason, it doesn't track my flights of steps very well, but it does really well when I'm working in the yard (moving around erratically). I can't tell exactly what triggers it to count an activity as exercise:  some walks I take register as active minutes, whereas other activities do not. It would be nice if it counted things that get your heart rate up-- housework, heavy chores-- as active minutes.<br/><br/>It tracks heart rate well, a lot better than I expected. I've measured it against my pulse-ox, and it's most accurate between about 60-100. I do have tachycardia, and the Fitbit does not track high HR well (and frequently just reads "--"). This isn't intended to be a medical device, but I hope that future models improve in this area.<br/><br/>For me, the alarms are great for reminders during the day to get up and move (default settings) or to take meds (alarms I set myself). Be aware that there's just one vibration level, and it's not super-strong. The advertising mentions that you can use it as a morning alarm, but this wouldn't even make me twitch in my sleep (I am a sound sleeper). I also miss some of the hourly get-up-and-move alarms. While I'm awake, though, the ones I set for medication are impossible to ignore. If you need to stay on a strict schedule with anything and don't always have your phone with you, this is a good option. It's also silent, so it's not going to disrupt a meeting or attract attention.<br/><br/>I find the sleep tracking interesting. I don't know how accurate it is, because I don't really have any way to know that. You can view data (for the day or for a duration of time) via the app or the web interface. I use both, because neither one gives me all the information I want. I'm not crazy about the UX for the website, but the app is plenty user-friendly. There's no learning curve at all:  it's intuitive.<br/><br/>I got the small blue-gray band, as I didn't want it to be too obvious or to scream fitness tracker. That color is a good compromise between stark black and a bright color (if this is your style). I also have a silver tone Oitom band, which is what I wear to the office or to go out. For cleaning, gardening, walking, etc., I switch back to the original band. Swapping out bands is a breeze, so definitely invest in a spare band(s) if you're interested in changing up the look.<br/><br/>I have a small wrist, and the fitness tracker portion sort of looks like it's perched on top of the wrist. I would not want anything any larger! It's recommended to wear the band 2 finger-widths above your wrist bone during exercise, and that's where mine sits all the time. It hasn't gotten in the way of anything so far, but I haven't worn in through fall/winter (coats, gloves, sleeves . . .).<br/><br/>Tilting your wrist to see the time is about 50/50 for me. I've found that rotating my wrist slowly to see the time is more effective than quickly flicking the face over. Your mileage may vary. I do just give up and tap it sometimes ("tap" is the word the instructions use-- it's got to be a pretty solid thump, but call it what you will).<br/><br/>Overall:  HR monitoring could be improved on the higher end but works well for the most part. It tracks standard activities well but does not track some everyday activities as "active minutes." I wish you could adjust the strength of the vibrating reminders. I'm interested in the data it provides, and, between the app and the website, Fitbit explains how to interpret the data (which is helpful:  e.g., it gives you benchmarks for time spent in deep sleep). It's not perfect with sprinkles on top, but it rates a solid 4 stars for getting the job done and giving me an overall accurate picture of m day (and night).<br/><br/>FIVE-MONTH UPDATE:<br/><br/>PROS:  I haven't scarred up the face yet, in spite of crashing into things on a regular basis.  I'm surprised it's withstood the amount of hardship I inflict on it.  I'm very pleased with how long it holds a charge.  The app continues to sync well with the phone, though I don't have it running constantly in the background (to preserve phone battery life).  I haven't drenched it, but I have splashed it a fair amount, and that hasn't hurt it.<br/><br/>CONS:  HR tracking can be *way* off when my HR goes either very high or very low.  After I reach about 120 bpm, the accuracy goes out the window (I have tested that against a pulse/ox).  As others have mentioned, the step count is not 100% accurate, depending on your daily activities.  I know I reached my step goal one day while standing still and brushing my teeth-- it was the arm motion.  Typing will also skew your total steps higher.  Needless to say, if your days are pretty similar in structure, you can kind of guess how many steps to subtract from the total shown, but it's just something to be aware of.  This is still a solid 4 stars.
 This device does a reasonable job at most things it sets out to.  The heartrate monitoring gets a bit out of whack; on me, it gives a HR reading 50% higher than my actual heartrate (as measured with a stopwatch and pulse) about 20% of the time; I guess that either the device is dodgy or my veins aren't well-located for optical HR tracking.  The FB app has some of the best tracking for nutrition, with the exception of nutrient breakdown by grams -- you have to log onto the FB website to see that.<br/><br/>The major downfall of this device is for people who do any kind of resistance training.  The device basically stops giving any HR reading as soon as you start lifting.  Search "fitbit HR working out" to see the many, many threads about this.<br/><br/>Aside from this, the device is very hard to read in bright light.  See attached photo -- yep, that's it fully on.  You have to shield it with your hand to read it.
 This is more directed at Amazon specifically.<br/><br/>This FitBit was sold as "New".  A gift for my wife, when opened - no charging cable.  Certainly a spot for one in the extruded plastic.<br/><br/>Through Amazon, I was directed to contact FitBit.  Via the serial number, FitBit determined the the device had been previously registered.  They could do nothing for me because of such, and re-directed me back to Amazon.<br/><br/>The Amazon person insisted that the FitBit I purchased did not come with a charging cable (based on the Amazon listing). That I should contact FitBit to determine if it should.  Well the listing on the FitBit site does in fact list a cable.  (Plus FitBit has it for the same price, free shipping.)<br/><br/>I felt highly disappointed in Amazon and really irritated by the runaround I received.<br/><br/>Returning this FitBit to Amazon.  Purchasing directly from FitBit.
 I LOVED my fitbit at first. I was primarily using it to track my sleep and to let me know when I've got a text or call. I purchased July of 2018 and now in February of 2019 (just over 6 months later), it is no longer doing either very well. When I first purchased the battery would last well over a week, and would let me know when I needed to recharge. Now it dies within 3 days with no warning. I miss texts and calls, and my steps would count when I was clearly sitting at my desk (a weird way of finding out I hit 10,000 steps when I've been just typing).<br/><br/>For how much it costs, I would expect at least a year of life. Now I'm just sad.
 I just must be really unlucky.  Received my 1st Alta HR, worked w/ tech support but the read out was faulty~like it had a short in it.  Wld only display anything abt 20% of the time.  Because of such great reviews, exchanged it &amp; got a 2nd one. Works better but you practically have to beat the darn thing up to get a read out.  SUPER disappointed!!!
 I really believe that if you don't wear this a majority of the day, it won't function correctly. I really wanted it to help with my workouts, but it either doesn't read my heart rate at all or the number is suspiciously high or low. And it couldn't even track my walk correctly saying it was up to 2 miles longer than it was depending on the day. I know technology can be frustrating, but I have a lot of devices that work way better than this! What a waste of time, energy and MONEY!
 This was purchased for my wife. She enjoys it especially for running. All she wanted was a device to track her heart rate that was easy to see and wasn't a chest strap. I initially got her the Charge 2 but she didn't care for the aesthetics of that design (she thought it looked too manly). I kept that one for myself and then purchased the Alta HR. It does exactly what she wants and accurately enough for what she wants. The only problem is band sizing, the options were too small or too large. We opted for too large and have lots of extra strap instead of being on the last hole of the small strap. A medium size strap would be a big upgrade as well as the usual complaints about water proofing.
 Started with the Fitbit Alta and bought this for my sister.  She gave it back to me because it was not her thing.  I want to tell everyone that the extra $50 for the HR is worth paying because you get more detailed sleep reports and heart rate monitoring that helps with exercising.  I was happy with my Alta, but now with the HR I'm even more motivated while exercising (which incidentally, I hate doing).  Sleep is so important and the detailed reports also motivate me to get more quality sleep because although you may THINK you're getting 8 hours, you probably are not.
 I bought this product mid-June 2017.  It died mid-Sept.  This is the last time I will buy a Fitbit product.  This is the third time I've had one of their products fail within a year.
 I purchased this item in July of 2018 on Prime Day! Exactly nine months later, my device seemingly short circuited and would no longer charge, keep track of steps/sleep/etc, and would rapidly cycle through the various display screens without movement or being prompted.<br/><br/>Prior to this fatal malfunction, I really enjoyed the device overall. While it did not always seem to track my steps accurately, I enjoyed the metrics, integration with my Smart Scale (by FitIndex), and fertility tracking within the app. Prior to my Fitbit's tragic death, I would have certainly given it four stars. Nonetheless, I was satisfied with my device overall and assume that my device was unique in it's short lifespan.<br/><br/>*As a note - Fitbit honored the one-year warranty for this device and offered a replacement because it was purchased directly through Amazon.
 This would be a 5-star review if the device hadn't gone from having the charge lasting a week to roughly a day after ~9 months of daily use.<br/><br/>It's been a great insight to see my sleep patterns and resting heart rate and see how different factors change my resting heart rate and sleep from day to day. It's a great device, I've tried many other smart devices that were substandard to this one, but the battery issue here is a major concern.
 Let me start off by saying that my use case is probably not the same as most people for this device. I’m mostly interested in the HR feature, specifically during workouts. That being stated here is my review. I started off narrowing it down to 2 devices the Garmin Vivosmart HR+, and the FitBit Alta HR, on paper both had pros and cons, came down to the fact that I found a great deal on the Garmin so ordered that first. Spent a month with it and then got the Alta HR so I could make a fair comparison. Here is what I found.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Love the form factor, very comfortable to wear, much more so than the Garmin<br/>I like the fact that you can swap out the bands, or replace them. Can’t’ do that with the Garmin<br/>I like the LED interface better than the LCD on the Garmin. Much easier to see, especially in low light.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The tapping! Ugh….had this for about a week now and I still can’t get the tapping down. 90% of the time, I need to redo the double tap sequence at least 3 times to wake it up. Horrible.<br/><br/>The wake up feature with the wrist motion, is almost as bad as the tapping, probably works about 50% of the time.<br/><br/>No specific activity tracking. I know other FitBit models have this, and this is supposed to have a smart feature that “figures out” when you are working out. But in my experience, that doesn’t work very well.<br/><br/>The syncing with the app is horrible (I use Android).  Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn’t. No indication why. On the Garmin this just works.<br/><br/>Splash resistant, not waterproof. I knew this going in, but still it’s something the device lacks compared to the competition.<br/><br/>Based on all of this I’m going to return the FitBit. I really wanted to like this. It’s the form factor I’m looking for, and very comfortable. But the functionality compared to the Garmin is severely lacking.
 3 months after buying it, it stopped synching with my phone and whenever I'm exercising and my wrists get sweaty, it stops detecting my pulse. Not only that but I eventually realized that it doesn't actially count your steps but your arm movements. Try it for yourself. Sit down and start waving the arm you put your fitbit on for a while. After a minute check your steps. It's ridiculous. Basically it's just a useless watch now. If I wanted a watch I'd rather buy one for $10 from Walmart.
 i live on a budget. with money i got for Christmas i shopped until i felt like i really foud the perfect fitbit for me. when it came i was so covered up between working two jobs and studying that i didnt have the time to immediatley open it and set it up so i tucked it away and was truly excited  when  i found time to open it. i charged it and it said it was completly full then i take it off the charger and  it says it needs charged again. i am so extremely disappointed and now i come to return it and realizie i am 5 days past the date of return. i even paid for the service plan  so yeah i am heartbroken. thanks guys
 It does what it's supposed to do, but I've learned a lot about Fitbit since purchasing the Alta HR. There should be a full owner's manual that comes with these, like the length of a car manual. It typically only tracks your steps when your whole body is moving the way it would if you were walking. So for example, if you're pushing a shopping cart, it may not track your steps, since your wrist remains stationary. It fits well and doesn't slide around too much, and the app/website are both user friendly. The interchangeable bands that are sold for the Alta HR are all pretty great and fit really well, but the plastic bands including the ones that come stock with the device do get dirty very easily.<br/><br/>If you've had another Fitibit or tracker in the past, I'd recommend unpairing that from your Bluetooth, even if you no longer have the app installed. It can definitely cause some issues with your ability to sync the Fitbit. I ended up never using the app anyway because of all the syncing issues I had with this one. Finally, the most important thing... buy a screen protector and just be careful! The actual device where the screen is located sits up really high from your wrist, so it's very easy to naturally bump/scratch this tracker on literally everything. I had a few scuffs that came out relatively easily with some rubbing alcohol and a microfiber rag, but I've seen a lot of issues with other people having scratches on theirs that will not come out. The screen protector is important... put it on before you even use this thing for sure. And don't wear it while you do anything that you feel may potentially cause you to hit it against something.<br/><br/>With all this being said, Fitbit has created a great program and a good device. I'm giving it a 3-star just because of the fact that it does easily get scratched because of the shape of the device, but I do love Fitbit and am upgrading to the new Versa coming out!
 This version of the Fitbit is very attractive, but other than that, does not do much compared to the Fitbit Charge 2 that I had purchased twice but needed to return due to a design flaw where the flat screen buckled down the middle. Some internet research showed that this was a common problem so I opted for the Alta. It is very pretty, but compared to the Charge 2, does not do much. Additionally, due to it's smaller size, cannot show as much information on the screen. I just looked at the Fitbit website and saw that there is now a Fitbit Charge 3. I may check that one out to see if I like it better.
 I had back surgery and needed a way to monitor my “steps” progress as that’s how my surgeon has tasked me with my walking. I’m an overachiever so this helps stop me from overdoing it.<br/><br/>The black band was the cheapest and wasn’t doing it for me so I got on another reseller site we all know so well (starts with an E) and picked up a Fitbit brand “light pink” band with clasp at a fraction of the original cost.<br/><br/>The readout is all but impossible to see in bright light, much the way the old iPhone tech was lousey in bright light. It’s honestly very annoying.<br/><br/>The readout choices and order are customizable on the band and with a flick of the wrist I can get it started. It’s oddly helpful at night when I’m awake and wondering what time it is or what my Heart rate is.<br/><br/>If I choose, the logs on my phone will show all of one thing (whatever I choose) for as far back as day one and that’s helpful. Steps per day and the total for week. Mileage per day and week. Calories approximated per day and week and so forth. This has been helpful with surgical recovery and post-surgical appointments.<br/><br/>So far so good. My only real nemesis are the inability to read the display in bright light (the tech exists for this so it’s very annoying) and the lack of “medium” bands. There are small or large and if you get on their site apparently/supposedly an extra-large but I’m not sure if that is for all the Fitbit models available.
 Love it so much I bought stock in FITBIT !  Exchange name is FIT and it is only around seven dollars a share-which is on the high side.  With everybody I know wearing one I ignored what I felt was a "FAD" last year but it's not a fad when I am dawning one.  I became interested when it knew my resting heart rate and non-resting heart rate as well as sleep quality.  Sleep is everything.<br/><br/>The FitBit HR Alta told me how I slept last night, was very accurate as to what stages of sleep I was in.  Example a train came by and woke me up at 5:00 am it recorded I woke up out of REM.  This was True.  I had a great dream at 8 AM when alarm went off--so I slept in and it recorded I was back to REM in moments and for the next hour.   It was a great dream.]  I have been in many sleep studies because I am a kicker, (meaning I wake myself up kicking) and this was also true midnight and 2 AM.  They call it restless leg syndrome.  My official sleep study with probes all over my head proved this is why I used to feel drained every morning and not really getting any REM.  Because I was not getting any REM with all the kicking as I approached a deep sleep. So I deem it VERY accurate and now I can see what supplements help me not kick so much - since I can use the FitBit Alta HR as a guide to sleep quality.<br/><br/>Most people buy fitbit to monitor DAY activity.  This is the LAST reason I bought it for.  All my staff has one, even my bookkeeper so they tend to compete in their own little contests.  Now I can join them.  Like if I want to beat them at their 10,000 steps I can just attach it to my dog!  They laughed I am already trying to cheat the day time steps.  :)
 My husband bought this for me and so far so good. I am small with small wrists and hands and I thought this would be too chunky, but it actually is a great size. The band doesn't have to be tight to monitor your heart rate either. I actually have three holes to spare on my band. I did immediately notice it was over counting my steps, like I'd take 15 steps and it'd say 47! But I played around with it and figured out that you have to put in your walking stride length measurements, under advanced settings. And if you input that whichever wrist you wear it on as your dominant hand (even if it's not) then it works perfectly. Somehow the movement sensor is less sensitive to the listed dominant hand. Now my steps all seem to be measured accurately. I love the sleep tracker and the app is very easy to use and log your food and water intake if you choose to. I really like it. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is,.. I feel it should be waterproof. It is not waterproof, I have to be super careful when I wash my hands and remove it when I wash dishes or shower. I opted for the rose color, even though it was about $20 more. Mostly because it kind of blends in and doesn't stick out like a sore thumb . I think that is important, especially if you're wearing it to work in a professional setting.
 I purchased this in August and for  over a week now every morning it says 0 battery so I plug it in and I know its plugged in correctly the battery comes up as charging and then shows it is full until the next morning battery is empty again  totally frustrated !!<br/>I also cant find an email address to talk to someone about it
 Purchased a few weeks ago and have been wearing it every day since then. Shipped quickly as expected. Easy to set up/install.<br/><br/>Pros: Cute and slim. Looks exactly like the picture. It's accurate, the charge lasts for a whole week, and it can connect to other fitbit friends so you can compete for step counts with your siblings, coworkers, etc. Great for setting a silent alarm because it will just vibrate on your wrist. Integrates with text messages so your wrist buzzes when your phone buzzes (that could be a pro and a con, depending how you look at it).<br/><br/>Cons: Does NOT integrate with many of the health apps I already use!!! This is a big con for me as I assumed fitbit would automatically sync up with my sleep app and my food apps etc. It does track sleep if you manually enter in the start and stop time, but the sleep data is pretty basic and it's inconvenient to have to manually set each night and morning. The touch screen doesn't always work. Gets dirty fast.<br/><br/>Overall: I should've done more research before purchasing. If all you want is to track steps and heart rate, this is for you. If you want it to see a more accurate holistic health overview with data from other apps, skip it, or check to make sure your apps integrate with it before you buy.
 I had to buy this fitbit 3 times. First time it wouldn't work, second time it wouldn't calculate my heart rate while exercising. and the third one still doesn't calculate my heart rate while working out. My step are shown on this device are less than they actually are. When I count the steps myself and look at what is calculated, I usually get 75/150 steps accurate on the fitbit. imagine when you do 25,000 a day, that really adds up to being nowhere near how many you did. Also when I work out, every time my heart rate gets to it's max, the Fitbit can't register my heartbeat at all, and just has blank lines. Usually only says I worked out about 10 minutes when in reality I worked out hard for about 45. Very disappointed. Also, because I bought the product through amazon, I couldn't get a refund. Keep that one in mind!
 Me and my husband both have it. We’re happy with it. If you want to be on top of yourself, set goals, and have a pretty sleek watch this is for you. It gets frustrating only because you need to charge it of course, and it is not as sensitive to showing the time as I would like it to be. It’s supposed to show time basically every time your wrist moves toward you but it doesn’t.<br/><br/>If you are someone who works out every day and is already very healthy and wellness minded this might not be for you. I got it because I want to reach goals like: committing to working out several times a week and drinking a certain amount of water.<br/><br/>However my favorite feature is the silent alarm. I don’t bring my cell phone into my bed room and a regular alarm clock is too loud and wakes up my son. This is a nice vibrate with an automatic snooze - and records my sleeping patterns.
 This is the worst piece of junk EVER!! I wish there were negative star options but it would have to have negative 100 stars to really do it justice! The watch doesn't always show the time/turn on when you turn wrist like it's supposed to. Regardless of speed and exaggeration it takes 4 or 5 attempts to (maybe) work.<br/><br/>In addition the "tap" to switch to other items (i.e. heart rate, steps etc) works even less! It's frustrating and such a waste of money!!! I bought it because it was the closest design as the last Charge 2, but it doesn't have a button to push to turn on or switch between items so it's a crapshoot on whether or not you can see the time or switch between items. DON'T BUY THIS! Try ANYTHING else I assure you your blood pressure will be grateful.
 As a fitness tracker, the Alta HR seems perfectly fine. It's as accurate as any of the others (read: not very), looks nice and fits well, and gives you quick access to various statistics like steps taken and your heart rate.<br/><br/>The big problem here is that Fitbit seemingly does not care about the device synching with many Android phones. The last of the officially supported phones in Moto's G and X lines came out in 2014. Motorola -- not exactly a fly-by-night manufacturer --  has sold tens of millions of these things, and Fitbit does not support any of the models made in the past five years. Some people can get it to work, but if not, you're just out of luck. None of the provided work-arounds resolved the issue for me, and Fitbit support says their engineers are working on adding new phones all the time. I have to wonder what phones they're adding if not ones released more than a year ago by a major manufacturer.<br/><br/>So with no synching between my device and phone (an updated Moto G5 Plus), I can't make use of the app while exercising, and I don't receive notifications of calls or texts on my wrist like I should. So I have a $150 digital watch and pedometer that will synch with my laptop when I get home. (Hey, at least I caught it on a Cyber Monday sale for a little more than half price...) I of course can only blame myself for not researching phone compatibility first, but my recently-dead Fitbit Flex had no trouble working with my current phone, so I figured this would too. Oh well.<br/><br/>As I've already worn it for a few weeks now and it works as advertised, so I can't in good conscience return it Amazon. I'm going to use it until it breaks, and unless Fitbit starts showing a little more consideration to its Android customers, I'm done with their products.
 I am a small woman and have used other fitness trackers but this fits me the best. I don't have a problem with the fastener as some others have said. I like the size on my wrist, the lightness of it and it looks pretty inconspicuous. It is just a black bar until you wake it up. You turn your wrist as if looking at a watch and it turns on and displays the time day and date  or you can tap it twice to wake it up.Then you tap it once to access the other screens one at a time.  It measures heart beat, steps, miles,time of exercise you perform.I also like that it buzzes when I get a text, something you can turn on or off. I take it off when I sleep now but when I first got it I was fascinated by the sleep data. It really lasts a long time on a charge but notifies you when running low.
 I’ve had the Alta hr for close to 3 months now after having the charge hr for two years. Let’s just say I really miss my old watch. The Alta hr is supposed to automatically track workouts, but it more often then not looses the heartbeat and doesn’t even recognize the active minutes much less the actual workout. If you’re looking for a thin digital watch that you can change the band out on, go for it. Don’t expect much else from it though.
 I bought this more for motivation into moving and getting in a healthy lifestyle since I'm a very sedentary individual.<br/><br/>And yes. It does exactly what it does and YOU can modify it to work on HOW YOU are. Again... I'm not the "always on the move" person so this device is helping in ways I've never imagined.<br/><br/>So good, I got my mom one as well.<br/><br/>I have the wrist of a child so I got the small one. As as you can see... I have space to spare and no, its not tight enough to stop blood flow or injure me. I'm also not allergic to the band nor the band smelled funky as other plastics tend to smell.<br/><br/>It's accurate with heart rate and steps and I can even receive text messages and read them without my phone. Syncs fast and the battery lasts as described. I've been charging mine when I go to take a shower since this Fitbit is not waterproof so it lasts a bit longer.<br/><br/>This is a very good product that is not bulky and does what it does. I really like that the screen stays off when I'm not looking at it and I can see the time comfortably and quickly.<br/><br/>For 2 day shipping...I got it the next day so I was able to charge it, sync it with the app and use it.<br/><br/>Love it! Thank you for helping me move to a healthier pace!
 Had the charge, bought the new Alta HR.  Awesomely slim, great touch response to activate the screen.  Functionality with sleep tracking is nice and educational.  We'll see if the recommended behavioral changes make a difference in how I feel when I wake.  Only reason I give a 4 star....they really need to waterproof this already.
 I used mine for 14 months (replaced the original band twice). Then it stopped working entirely. Called the product support and their best offer is discount on other products! If these products are only good for such a short period, then either manufacturers should give the buyers heads up and other options before consumers buy, or offer it at lower cost so it's a replaceable.<br/><br/>This was my second fitbit with similar results. This is the end of my line with fitbit!
 Salut everybody.<br/>Got my S size Fitbit. This my 1st fitness tracker.<br/>Today unboxed it and totally in love.<br/>My wrist circumference is 16cm and was in doubt between S or L but decided to take the S one and am happy to order exactly this size. It looks awesome with my pandora bracelet(size 17).<br/>When I unboxed  it was discharged and  charging process took 2hrs l; paired with my iPhone 7 easily. I even trained in it today. Sometimes the display is not responsive maybe i have to get used to it. Let’s see.  my assessment for day one is 10 out of 10.<br/>Hope it will remain like this :)
 Does not support cycling as an application and does not get recognized by Strava as a simple heart rate monitor due to Fitbit's closed data ecosystem. Very inaccurate compared to a scosche hr monitor.
 I don't know why I decided to give Fitbit another try after I had to have my Charge HR 2 replaced 3 times in a year. But I was seduced by the design and the pink color of this model. Not even 2 months after I received it, the plastic parts of the wristband that hold the tracker in place started to break off. So, the tracker started popping off and became unwearable. For the nearly $200 that I paid (the pink was more expensive), this is unacceptable. That plastic should be much sturdier. But again, my experience with fitbit is that their products don't last and are not worth the price paid.  I'm going to try a different brand.
 I adore my FitBit Alta HR!<br/>I actually bought a Charge 2 last summer and my husband "stole" that one from me, which was actually fine as I found that one to be just a tad too bulky on my wrist.<br/>The Alta HR is perfection! It has all the features I am looking for such as tracking steps, tracking heart rate, and tracking sleep patterns! The accompanying app is wonderful and easy to use! If you choose to, you can even sync the My Fitness Pal app to your FitBit app and use the mutual data to help both apps! The FitBit app has many features available such as measuring water, calorie intake, and it even has a "female health" quadrant that with track menstruation cycles.<br/>You can use the FitBit Alta HR as much or as little as you want. If you want a simple pedometer and don't want all the hassle of tracking all that other stuff, it will work just fine. You don't even have to download the app and sync your data if you don't want to! But if you're like me and curious about heart rate, cardio fitness, miles walked, water drank, etc, then the FitBit can keep up with you too!<br/>I love it and highly recommend it to everyone!
 I purchased this FitBit and one of the sides of the wristband kept falling off. Amazon replaced it and after several months it started happening again. I bought third party wristbands thinking the problem was a defective wristband but I had trouble with the new wristbands. I finally realized that the post on one of the sides of the FitBit itself was crooked. The wristbands will never work and now I am stuck with a defective piece of equipment. Even more disappointing is the fact that the first FitBit I had must have had the same defect. What a waste of money.
 My Fitbit continuously falls open where the device meets the band. It's fallen off during hikes, lifting things, during runs. Fortunately I've been able to find it every time but it's incredibly frustrating and it bothers me that I am unable to get a new band because it falls outside of the return window. A company should stand behind their product, especially when it is faulty and I shouldn't have to spend more money to fix their mistake.
 I really like the HR functions of this tracker.  I didn't like the limited edition "rose gold" color, though.  I thought it would go well with the yellow gold jewelry, that I normally wear.  It really doesn't.  The rose gold color looks more like copper.  It doesn't have much of a pink tint.  I like changing the band's on my Alta and thought it would be great to use my bands on the Alta HR.  They fit well, but all the colors I have look strange with the rose gold/copper body.  Also, most silicone replacement bands have a silver/brushed nickel fastner.  It seems very difficult to find a band with a color or metal finish that actually looks good with this rose gold.  Even the dusty pink band that it came with looks kind of strange.  I returned it.  Waiting for my silver Alta HR to be delivered.
 Worked decently for the first three weeks before it stopped working.I bought this particular unFitbit to track my sleep patterns. After the first few days it finally "worked" as promised. It was not 100% accurate in tracking my sleep modes, When I was asleep it showed me to be awake and when I was awake it said I was restless or in REM (?) sleep.<br/><br/>Called unFitbit CS and was told to reset the band and if that did not work they would swap it out for me ASAP. When I called back with my case # I was told ASAP means 6-10 business days turn around time. With my deadline with Amazon to return this item only a few days away I decided to cut my loses and not trust the unFitbit CS department to make good on getting this situation resolved after my return period had expired.<br/><br/>Wish I had heeded the warnings of the one star reviews and stayed away. It may be good at tracking steps but after much research online it appears none of these devises can track sleep as promised.
 I like it. I REALLY like that I can super easily switch out the look by changing the bands. The battery life is strong. The app is very helpful, and I really appreciate the way it tracks my sleep. However, the app does not display my current heart rate for some reason (I have tried a number of things to get it to work, but to no avail). This is inconvenient when I'm in the middle of a workout and want to know my heart rate. I set it so the first thing that displays when I turn my wrist is my heart rate, but then that is inconvenient for the rest of the day when I want to know the time first. It's annoying to switch back and forth on the app,  so it would be much better if it would display my heart rate on the app.<br/><br/>Another downside is that you HAVE to turn your wrist for it to display anything, or tap it quite hard so that it shakes it and THINKS you have turned your wrist. It also doesn't always recognize that I have turned my wrist. It makes me feel like I didn't say "pretty please?" first.<br/><br/>I don't like that it's not waterproof. I wish I could wear it in the shower like I used to be able to do with my other fitness band,<br/><br/>Lastly, I used to have a Garmin VivoSmart HR, which I really liked. It was falling apart, and I was looking for an "upgrade" to a sleeker, more customizable fitness band. It was MUCH better at calculating my average resting heart rate, which is naturally low. I know it was more accurate because doctors have confirmed my naturally low resting heart rate. I believe this fitbit is still good at grasping increased heart rate, just not low heart rate.
 I love this thing. I had it for a few months now and it does hold me accountable.  I love knowing how well I'm sleeping and generally how active I am during the day so it's more than just a work out device for me.  I don't weigh myself but my clothes are looser and I do think its this little guy saying "Let's stroll" every hour (you can change it to remind you when you want.)  I'm going to try it out in combination with the treadmill today (I do a lot of beach walking) and compare accuracy. Since it monitors your heart rate and recovery time it analyzes your general cardio health which is your real report card... Although once it gave me 10 minute exercise credit during my struggle into my compression pants... I think I deserved that actually... Please don't break little Fitbit guy cause I need you! I love the rose gold color too.  I've bought additional bands since they do get dirty fast.  I'm trying to convince my husband I need a rose gold ring now to go with it...
 Purchased 6 months ago. Soon after purchase, charging has been a problem. After the first few times that the unit did not charge, I went out of my way to check the cable and verify the “clip” was correctly connected. Yet, a good quarter of the time, after a few hours, the unit will not take the charge (when it works it only takes about an hour). A week ago, one side of the wristband has simply fallen off. It no longer stays attached and I’ve purchased a replacement.  Overall, for what it does, it is overpriced. I would not recommend the Fitbit Alta.
 So I had been pondering the idea of getting a Fitbit, Apple watch, or some other similar wearable piece of technology for a while.  I did lots of research and was disheartened that every gadget has such a large share of negative reviews.  Also, I was skeptical about the accuracy of counting steps (my stride varies) and then translating them into miles.  That was the main feature I cared about.<br/><br/>Pro's<br/>-Accurate step count. No matter how long or short my stride, this thing nails it. It has biorhythmic sensors that know when you're doing stairs (climbing) or how far you've moved.<br/>-It sends you gentle pings to remind you to move every hour.<br/>-The battery life is insanely good.  I've had mine a month, and it lasts 7 days before it needs a full charge.<br/>-It lets you know when calls come through and who is dialing you.<br/>-It shows you the calories burned every day (and what your targets should be based on goals you set up.)<br/>-It's very user intuitive and easy to set up.<br/>-You can set multiple goals, like water consumption, sleeping, exercise.<br/>-It tracks your pulse and when your heart rate is up for periods of exercise.<br/>-It's sturdy.<br/>-I was going to buy a treadmill at home, but now don't feel the need.  I'll walk laps in the living room while watching TV because I know I can track the steps, miles, and calories I'm burning.<br/>-It's increased my water consumption since that's one of my goals.<br/>-It's increased my daily activity. It was eye-opening to me to see that on a normal "base" day the steps I put in. Post-baby, I hadn't taken off weight very quickly and didn't know why. I was stuck at a plateau. I've lost 4 pounds since wearing this.  Only thing I'm consciously doing differently is making sure to hit my daily step target.<br/><br/>Con's<br/>-I take mine off when I shampoo my hair (not daily) or go to the pool. I want to prolong its life.  That's a bit of a hassle.<br/>-I lost my Fitbit for a few days in the house and couldn't find. It's too bad there's not some mechanism for it to beep so you can find it.  (It was beneath a mountain of laundry.)<br/><br/>I wish I had bought this earlier!  If you're on the fence, just get one. It's very motivational to keep you moving.
 Buyer beware!  Best to review Fitbit site for common issues, in particular - syncing.  The device does not work with all phones.  Except you don't easily know that fact until you purchase the device, and then can't sync.  Fitbit's solution - get a new phone device.  You also can't rely on their list of "non-compatible" phone devices, as others report it is out of date.<br/><br/>Basically, I have now an expensive pedometer, as I can't track my data points beyond what is showing at the time.
 I came to this device from the Microsoft Band 2.0. So I was expecting a lack of functionality balanced by increased software support, community support and customization (bands).<br/><br/>This is a great minimal hardware design.  Really like it.  However software gates on cycling functionality (having to use your phone to start a “run” and convert it to a bike ride to see map data) are a bit annoying. If the user has turned on the connected GPS “feature,” why not just auto detect the bike ride AND show the map data when they're done?<br/><br/>The rotate wrist to turn on screen feature is accurate 50% of the time in real world usage.  When you’re sitting at a desk or standing it is more like 90% accurate.  When you are reclining on a couch, on your side, on your back, on your stomach, in bed, it does not work, at all.  Get used to ensuring both arms are free so you can double tap the screen.<br/><br/>I purchased a braided metal band and the styling is great!  I mean really nice compared to the Microsoft Band I owned previously.  Almost elegant...  I also like the professional look of the Alta HR with a black leather band.<br/><br/>After a week of use I would say that I probably should have purchased the Charge 2 HR or Charge 3 instead.  They are  also quite attractive, look good on a male wrist, and have significant additional functionality.  Well I guess I"ll wait until the Charge 4 and hope it adds a GPS and returns to a chrome/brushed metal design similar to the Charge 2 HR (I’m not a fan of the finish options of the Charge 3).<br/><br/>Recommended for bikers as an inexpensive tracker if you tend to always have your phone on you and don’t mind activating ride tracking on your phone as a ”run” and converting it to a “ride” at the end of your session via phone app menus.
 Before purchasing this, I only owned the very first Fitbit ever, the Flex. It was a good basic tracker but I was jealous of my husband's Blaze capabilities that included heart rate monitoring and the synced notifications from your phone; however, I didn't like how big it was. I was so excited when Fitbit upgraded their Alta because I was about to buy it before I saw it didn't offer heart rate monitoring. I'm not an exercise fanatic by any means, but I am trying to make conscious decisions regarding my health, and I really like how it'll buzz me every hour to get more steps in. I've gotten several compliments on it and people are impressed when I tell them what it's capable of doing. The only thing I can think of that's disappointing is the rose/pink band is already starting to look somewhat dirty, I've tried cleaning it and I actually bought another (black) band to swap if I anticipate sweating or working outside. Other than that, no regrets about this purchase!
 I have given this company so many chances ... my last one caused a skin allergy ... I have had different fit bits throughout the years ... something wrong seems to happen to all of them . Technical and cosmetic ... the costumer service is great though. The last I spoke with them they had sent me a check for a refund to the one that was causing skin allergies... I missed having a fit bit.. so soon after I used that refund to buy this hr one (hoping the hr bottom would be different and not cause a reaction like the previous Alta ... well it didn’t .. I was so happy... but then it just died...  first just the green light of the hr wouldn’t stop.. then the darn thing wouldn’t take any charge .. now it won’t turn on at all.. sad.. but I think I have finally given up.. I love the costumer service.. but it shows the quality of the products that I had to talk to them so much ! I do miss it though .. just so unreliable... I will have to find an alternate.
 Band was a bit uncomfortable but I got used to it after a couple weeks. Finally ordered a better band and it changed out easily. Snaps right on. Make sure u wear it above the wristbone. If it falls below the bone and touches your hand, the hr will skyrocket. Puts me in 105-115 range when I’m sitting still. Guess the blood flows much faster in the hands. Other than that, easy to use and i love it.
 I got this as a birthday gift for myself. I really like the slim design, more streamlined and sophisticated. I used to have the Charge HR (blue), which I found to be a little awkward/clunky.  Several days shy of a month of wearing it, the side of the screen had some kind of dent/cut, which I couldn't attribute it to anything as I'm careful not to knock it against things. I thought it would be sturdier. Fitbit replaced the screen because my warranty was still in effect (though it was close toward the end). My advice: before you start wearing this, please apply a screen protector on top AND the sides of the screen. I used the one from IQ Shield https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FENVYJ8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1
 I had been given a Fitbit Charge HR from a friend a few months ago, but then found the Alta HR a little later. I like it over the Charge 2 because I don't really need all the bells and whistles of that but wanted the in depth sleep info. I bought it during Black Friday sales, so it was a great price, I love the length of the battery, I can usually go about 6 days before charging. What I've found helps the battery length is changing the display stats, only show the ones on the device that you really care about. It noticeably added about double the battery time once I took the other stats off the Fitbit screen. I LOVE the step reminder...just wish when it showed the prompts that it would always tell the number of steps left...sometimes it just says something cute like, "Wanna take me for a stroll?" But I got screen protectors and different bands and plan to keep this baby nice for a LONG time!  Glad for the good price, and also the Square Trade protection too...got that just in case!  Enjoy!
 So I will preface this by saying that I owned the original Charge HR and upgraded to the Alta HR because I wanted something more sleek.<br/>Overall, I like the size and look and feel of the alta. It is very lightweight, comfortable, and having interchangeable bands is nice.<br/><br/>However, I have noticed that the HR monitor is far from ideal, especially when compared to my older fitbit! The charge HR had a really accurate HR monitor when compared to manually taking my HR and comparing. However, the Alta HR does NOT have accurate readings. If I go to a workout class (i.e. spin) or for a run, as soon as my wrist starts to sweat, the fitbit starts reading "- -" for heart rate. OR, it will be VERY off. Reading 70s when I am in peak cardio mode, and a manually determined HR of about 150 bpm.<br/><br/>I have tried re-adjusting it numerous times, wiping off when sweating, and wearing it at different tightnesses to no avail. It is just not a good heart rate monitor for work outs. It works most of the time when I am not working out, but what is the point of that? I want to know calories burned during a work out, and sadly this HR monitor is completely inaccurate for those purposes.<br/><br/>If you only care about counting steps/distance, and using the GPS or sleep mode, then this would be a product I recommend. However, it is not a good HR monitor product at all. Not sure why it was good in the older models and sucky in the new ones...
 Not at all happy with the purchase. It does not auto detect workouts, loses time and other settings frequently and is literally a pain to wear. It does not accurately count calories burned (it showed 126 calories for 70 minutes of HIIT!) which was my primary reason for the purchase. The band is super uncomfortable. I'm between small and large so went large based on other reviews, poor decision as it places awkward pressure on my wrist and I'm not only constantly aware I'm wearing it but fighting the desire to take it off and fling it across the room. The 2 stars are for the wakeup feature and reminder for this desk jockey to move around. Very, very disappointed. I've contacted support for the tech issues but none were resolved. Had it boxed up ready to return but missed my cutoff date.
 I lost my Garmin and decided to try out the Fitbit.  I am left scratching my head and wondering how Fitbit has become so popular when their product is so completely underwhelming.  While the product does have the basics, the functionality is intentionally crippled by Fitbit in what I can only guess is a misguided attempt to get to to upgrade?<br/><br/>For example, Fitbit relies on the device to automatically determine that you have been exercising to start tracking an activity, and it does not accurately sense weightlifting, yoga, and probably most any activity that does not involve a constantly elevated heart rate.  No issues so far, as I wouldn't expect the device to be able to determine all types of activities and so you would need to manually trigger some activity start and stop times..  However, you can only manually start and stop tracking an activity if it involves walking, running or hiking, and even then you have to do it from your phone and not the device itself.  Huh?  Yes, I said that right - if you want to manually start and stop tracking an activity on your Fitbit, you have to start and stop it ON YOUR PHONE!  And then it only works if it involves walking or running.  Since Fitbit requires you to use the app on your phone to manually track an activity, then why are they limiting the activities to walking, running or hiking and not allowing any other activity that you want to track?  No idea, and it is just plain dumb.  They have a workaround - they let you log previous activities that will essentially tag them to data that was previously recorded on the device covering the same time period.  But if Fitbit can allow you to go back in time and log an activity that occurred in the past, then why the heck don't they just let you say when to start and stop an activity so that it tracks it as you do it?  Again, no idea and so tracking any activity other than running or walking is a major pain in the butt.<br/><br/>This device will notify you when you get a call or text, but you had better look quickly.  The messages scroll on the screen one time and only one time and you cannot get them to replay.  Why not?  No idea.<br/><br/>I just don't understand why the functionality on this device is so poorly put together.  The device has touch and so starting and stopping an activity from the device should be easy to implement.  So should being able to replay calls or texts.  People who are considering this device - realize that other devices DO allow you to do these things from the device itself and don't get this one.  As it stands, the Alta HR is just a glorified step counter with built in heart rate and is a pretty poor fitness tracker.
 Speedy delivery! Product was as expected. The ALTA HR does not count stairs nor the stair climber at the gym and sometimes does not register certain types of exercises on the app when syncing. However, you are able to wear it while swimming and shower with one on. I rarely EVER take mine off since I recieved it in May of 2018. Sometimes when exercising, too much sweat on the sensors doesn’t allow it to register activity. It can be easily solved by drying the sensor off before continuing exercises. It does not track sleep patterns if under 3 hours of sleep. It will register if you nap and it will add onto your daily accumulated sleep times. Very slim like a ladies watch and light weight. Great for standard use with seniors and children. Battery life usually lasts me 3-4 days before it needs to be recharged. Best suggestion is to charge it while you are in the shower, commuting, driving or when you are doing as very little movement as possible for some time. It is also very durable with puppies during their chewing stages. LOL!
 I bought the fitbit Alta HR when it was on sale, I wanted the fitbit because it is close to accurate in terms of measuring calories burned, plus includes BMR, and thus I am trying to lose weight. I have done calculations on the websites with the BMR calculator and the calories burned calculator, and I will say it is pretty close to accuracy. So far I'm pretty impressed, the band itself is a little bit uncomfortable as I ordered the small, I ended up having to buy the large. I wish I had known about the sizing chart before I bought it. Another note about the bands, I wish there were so more options of color. I am a bit disappointed that the watch is not waterproof at this price point and activity range for at least washing dishes, and taking showers, as those 2 daily activities are big calorie burners. Though, so far I have done both no problems, still worries me however; hence the reason why the 4 star rating.
 I've been wanting to monitor my daily activity and also want to lose some weight, &amp; after a failed trial with another fitness tracker the "you get what you pay for" policy turned out to be very accurate in this case.<br/><br/>While the fancier FitBits are definitely pricier, mine seems to be well worth the money. It's easy to use (setting up, wearing, syncing, etc) and is accurate. The battery gets low after four or so days but only takes a few hours to charge so I can just plug it in when I'm sitting around reading a book or catching up on a show.<br/><br/>Learning how to navigate all of the various sections did take a few days, but like anything new, I just had to get used to what did what. If all else fails, the app provides helpful info and links if you don't understand a function/feature, &amp; THAT info is very helpful.<br/><br/>I ordered a small and did have to order a large band because I missed that the HR models need to be worn one to three fingers above the wrist bone, but that was an easy fix. Technically, I could wear the small band on the second to the last or last hole, but I prefer room to adjust, &amp; the band only fits at the one finger distance at that length anyway.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm very happy so far and look forward to seeing what my FitBit can help me do!
 Life changing tool!  I bought this to help monitor my health goals-- more exercise, better sleep, etc.  This exceeded my expectations!  I got the Alta HR because it is smaller-- I have tiny wrists.  I think the Charge has a couple more features, but what the Alta has works fine for my needs.  PLUS I discovered there are numerous bands here on Amazon by different manufacturers made to fit.  I'm loving the idea of having a watch that I change up look to match my mood/outfit on any given day.  And since it's a health tracker too-- BONUS.  One small thing I didn't know though-- buy a screen protector.  It didn't take me long to bang my hand on something and scuff the face.  I found a product called Polywatch that buffed out the scratches (mostly), and after adding a screen protector they aren't noticeable.
 I had the Fitbit Alta HR for less than three months before it stopped working properly. First it temporarily gliched out and stopped tracking anything. After I restarted it, and re-paired it with my phone, it started tracking again, but no longer notified me of texts and calls.  I went through all the trouble shooting items needed to get it to work again, but to no avail. I called the company and they will replace it, which is great. But, this some flimsy construction for an item that you're supposed to wear daily. This Alta HR was actually a replacement I had purchased because I lost my original Alta (regular one,not HR)  because the flimsy closure on the band broke (it was a snap-shut band, not one with a buckle like the HR has, and it started to randomly open within four months, until one time I didn't feel it fall off and lost it). So basically, at this point, this will be my third Fitbit in less than a year. It's not worth it. I should have bought an Apple iWatch at this rate.
 I really love my Fitbit. I've worn it every day for about six months, and now it feels weird when I don't have it on. It is sleek, though I do occasionally bump it on things and freak out that I might have cracked the screen. Not even a scratch. It still looks out-of-box.<br/><br/>The measurements are accurate (I've checked the heart rate against the machine my doctor uses and it's spot on). It tracks sleep to the minute, and the app has a very useful chart marking sleep stages. I'm pretty sedentary, so I have my step count set lower than most users, but I love when I reach my step goal and it buzzes on my wrist and has a little congratulations message. You can customize when you get alerts. I have one at 9:30 p.m., so I know when to turn off my screens and get ready for bed. You can wear it all time (minus swimming and showering), so I charge it while I'm showering and it's never died on me.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a great little machine that measures accurately and helps keep you on track with your health goals. I count this as a great purchase.
 Ordered this Fitbit to have a more detailed idea of my daily activity.  Im retired and not an excercise nut  but i dont want to let my health slide because i dont go to the gym and am not ‘buffed’.  I really think the quality is good.  I reviewed a lot of the different choices and prices of these items before choosing Fitbit.  The Fitbit Alta HR is a feminine size and with a replacement band looks very stylish on my wrist in place of a wrist watch.  It is comfortable to wear, doesnt pinch or slide around my wrist.  It has taken a couple of days to learn what it offers and what choices i have. I like that the time and date is lighted so its easy to see day or night.  I also like that the charge lasts about a week so that im not constantly worrying about the battery power.  Im hoping that this is just the thing to get me moving a little more because its encouraging to see how much you actually move around in a typical day and the calories you burn. Also shows me my heart rate, resting or in activities.<br/><br/>I was concerned that i may not be getting quality sleep (a health thing again) and really happy it automatically records my sleeping modes and shows whether or not you are sleeping well or tossing and turning.<br/><br/>Im very happy with my purchase and although some reviews said they were a few problems, everything works appropriately for me.  The charger snaps right on easy to see its working correctly.  Im happy i dont have a big awkward device on my wrist and that it is water resistant because i intend to wear it like a wristwatch continually.<br/><br/>Negative update:  bought this tracker in July 2018 in March 2019 it just stopped holding a charge, charge didn’t even last 4 hours.  The tracker is sealed I’m not able to replace the battery.  Not worth the cost since it didn’t run even 1 yr....used it everyday, loved it until now.
 I've had this device for just about 1 week and my initial impressions are that it does a pretty good job of detecting your heart rate as well as your sleep. However, tracking your daily steps and distance is ridiculous. I walk and hike quite a bit and wear the fitbit in conjunction with an Omron Tri-axis pedometer which works quite well. The fitbit is WAY OFF in it's counting compared to my Omron. Probably because the fitbit is secured to your wrist there is no way that it can accurately record your steps properly. I'll update this review when I have it a bit longer.
 I've had multiple Fitbit Flex(es) and a Charge 2 and never had any issues with them other than excessive band wear. Bought the Alta HR for my son as a Christmas gift and of course, despite multiple attempts at resetting, recharging, and troubleshooting, it didn't work. The only reason I'm giving this product 2 stars is because Fitbit customer service was able to verify that there was an issue with it and is sending a new one. Hopefully it will work and redeem the Alta. Otherwise, I'll get him an older Apple Watch and Fitbit will lose a customer.
 Probably my favorite of the Fitbits, as it's small enough to wear on one wrist if I want to wear a traditional watch on the other, but comes with heart rate and other key functionality of the larger Fitbits. The display is smaller than the others of course, but it's a reasonable trade-off. Great tool for fitness and health. Now, the heart rate monitoring, like other Fitbits I use, is not particularly accurate for me during aerobic exercise and is often 20 beats per minute or more lower than what I get from physically taking my pulse, or the reading from exercise machine grips. Usually physical pulse and grip measures are very similar, while Fitbit is substantially lower. The Fitbit pulse technology seems more accurate for non-aerobic activities though, and in any case overall it's a great help in fitness and health.
 I like this 'watch.' Besides the fitness tracker, it integrates with my phone and lets me know what calls, texts, and e-mails come in; I can check to see if what comes in is junk or not without being obvious about. It appears to be calling my steps accurately, especially when used with the Samsung Fit app on the phone (both keep track) However, and this is a big however, it doesn't count your steps as active walking time no matter how much walking you are doing unless you are *JUST* walking and swinging your arms. You could be working around the house for hours, cleaning, cooking or whatever, but unless you are freely swinging your arms it isn't counted as walking exercise. Yesterday I spent an hour cleaning up the kitchen and it said I had only had 7 minutes active time walking. The rest of the time it thinks I was sitting on my butt. (how you get 1100 steps sitting on your butt I don't know.)<br/><br/>From the horse's mouth: (Samsung). It only registers walking activity if you move outside the GPS circle of accuracy or you manually tell it you are walking. In other words, GPS will only locate you within 10-30 feet. If all your walking activity is within that circle, it won't register your walking as activity but it will register the steps. Also, you will need to re-boot it every couple of weeks as the quick access screens (swipe to the left) will freeze.  To maximize battery life turn OFF the wake-up watch function (twist of the wrist) and use the buttons. It comes on a LOT more than it needs to.  With all that said, I am satisfied with this product.
 I purchased July 2018 and six months later my band started detaching from the "pebble" in the middle. I figured out it was due to the plastic cracking so it wasn't staying tightly connected.  It started doing it too often so I contacted Fitbit for a replacement band.  They don't have any small (which I need). They offered me a large, but they only have lime and fuschia colors. They recommended other retail vendors (which I would have to purchase a band instead of a free replacement) but none of them have the bands either. I'd have to pay for an off-brand replacement bracelet.  The tracker works, but don't invest unless they stand behind replacing broken bracelets.
 The wristband fell apart. The plastic inside the band arm that connects to the fitbit itself has simply cracked and fallen apart. This might be a manufacturing defect - I live in the tropics - but I expected the band to last more than 9 months. See the photos - two pieces of plastic have come loose from the part of the band that connects to the fitbit itself. For a premium product priced at nearly $180, this is very disappointing. Update: I contacted Fitbit support, they sent me a replacement. The replacement failed similarly after about 3 months. That too was replaced as (just) under warranty. Update: The 3rd band has now failed exactly the same way after about 4 months. Fitbit support are aware of the design problem but seem to be happy to replace them until you are out of warranty after which your expensive device will require regular replacement of bands.
 This is a very unreliable tracker and a very poor-quality product.<br/><br/>Compared to other, more reliable devices:<br/>- The Fitbit Alta HR miscalculates the number of steps taken (for instance, it counts thousands of steps for an hour spent speaking while sitting, or for an hour driving on dirt roads)<br/>- The Fitbit Alta HR overestimates calories burned by 25-30% (even after discounting extra steps)<br/>- The Fitbit Alta HR’s heart rate tracking is completely off and, therefore, so is the sleep tracking &amp; the exercise tracking<br/>- The Fitbit Alta HR does not recognize many common forms of exercise (like most martial arts).<br/><br/>In addition, the Fitbit Alta HR is poorly built. The device I bought stopped working after 6 months.<br/><br/>Customer service is terrible:<br/>- replacement for products under warranty take weeks to arrive (minimum “5 to 10 business days”)<br/>- Fitbit replaces defective products not with brand new items, but with refurbished pebbles (which won’t last very long, given that even brand-new products break down after 6 months)<br/>- The warranty on the replacement items is only for the duration of the warranty left on the original product, rather than a new one-year warranty, which is standard practice for other companies. (this show the very poor confidence Fitbit employees have in their own products!)<br/>- It takes days to receive answers from customer support.<br/>- There is no compensation for customers who have to deal with defective products. Not even an apology.<br/>Overall, Fitbit’s policies are excellent at protecting themselves against the poor quality of their own products, but they are much less effective at protecting the rights of their customers.<br/><br/>The only good thing I can write about this product is that the Fitbit Alta HR is discreet and relatively elegant, and it gives the time accurately.<br/><br/>But given that that this tracker fails to perform appropriately all of the basic functions for which we may decide to buy it, including step tracking, heart rate tracking, and calorie tracking, we’re be better off with no device at all (more discreet), a standard watch (more elegant), or a tracker from another brand like Garmin or Omron (more accurate).
 Could have got a small. My wrist is 6.5". I only use the original band for workouts and it's tight enough for that since you move it up the arm some. Heartbeat doesn't always read. I get "--" often, especially in the middle of cardio. It doesn't accurately read "active minutes" because of this. I can do an hour of cardio and it'll catch 40 or 45 minutes of it. Not a big deal. Steps don't count accurately no matter how I finagle the wearing arm and all that. I don't care too much about that though. I really like the sleep monitoring feature, it shows you a time line of deep, REM, light and awake times. Battery is good. I pop it on the charger when I take a shower--it's NOT waterproof--and it is usually almost or fully charged when I put it back on.
 It took me a long time to get in the Fitbit craze. But I am so happy I bought this little bracelet. Monitors not only my steps, heartbeat, calories burned,etc., but more importantly tracks the phases of sleep. I have been sleeping way better now that I've identified certain things in my patterns and set goals for hours I want to sleep. You can set timers and reminders in the app. I am really enjoying challenges with friends, and seeing motivation in the groups. Easy to swap out the band and get pretty patterns on Amazon to match your clothes. Be sure to download the app and really explore it. There are several groups you can join inside the app for whatever interests you. I've definitely walked more, and used my exercise equipment more since I bought this. Well worth the money to invest in your health and wellbeing,
 I have had 3 Charge HR.. life expectancy is about a year.. not the best but I liked the function. This time I decided to switch to the smaller Alta HR. I didn't read any reviews.. I "assumed" the same ok performance... Took me 2 hours to sync to my phone.. reading the faq section to find the resolution.. Finally it worked and synced to my phone.. I was so excited.. had a few different features the charge didn't and so much more streamlined... less than 24 hours later.. completely non responsive.  Will not turn on.. No clock.. No sync to my phone.. idk what else to try after having it such a short time. Returning<br/>.. tho I hate to admit I will probably try another and hope I get a better one.<br/>Giving it 2 stars because I like the function.
 This tracker is not consisent.  The sleep tracking function does not capture all hours; for example last night I was asleep by 10:00p through 7:30 (what a luxury!) but the tracker only picked up 5.3 hrs.  This has happened several times.  At times, if I only get 3 hrs or less, the tracker tells you it won't log the hours, but yet it logged 1.54 hrs one night.  Additionally the HR function is limited.  If working out, you cannot set to see the HR immediately, you have to cycle through the time, steps, then HR.  If you are working to VO2 max, you probably won't see it, although I have a time or two. Also, if you log a workout activity and you know you expended 350 calories from the cycle monitor for example, the FitBit Alta does not let you adjust your calorie burn.  It assigns one for a specified activity. The activity list is incomplete and does not include activities such as snowshoeing, or kickboxing with the appropriate calorie burn rate.<br/> I just missed the return window so I'm stuck with this.  I thought I had 90 days - it's 30.  I do not recommend this product.
 The Fitbit Alta HR is a fantastic little fitness tracker for what it is. Notifications on it are small, but decent enough. Automated sleep tracking was great (coming from Fitbit flex). The band was also much improved from the flex in terms of materials except for one item. The part of the band that connects to the Alta HR is actually plastic. This part eventually will crack and then your Alta will fall apart. Your mileage may vary, but I've had 3 bands now and they broke after 1 year, 6 months, and then 4 months with my wife wearing it. Neither of us do anything crazy, and we definitely don't wear it too tight.<br/><br/>It's a nice fitness tracker, just beware the band will break. Always in the same spot (you can find some pictures in the reviews that show similar breaking).
 I was so excited to finally get a tracker, but this one is extremely disappointing. I ride my bike quite a lot and it is my favorite exercise, but this tracker does not register my bike rides. In addition, it does not even have the option to do it - it can only track walks, runs, and hikes. Piece of junk considering the price. Also, it is not waterproof (even those 15 dollar trackers are waterproof, but this one can't even do that) so taking it of and putting it on before and after every contact with water is a hassle. Again, NOT recommended.
 I have been very pleased with this fitness tracker, my first.  Early in it's life, the band broke, and was replaced under warranty.  Now I have had it 14 months, and it no longer works.  The display is dark.  It has a full charge.  Repeatedly resetting it does nothing.  Customer support said it was out of warranty (12 months only) and could not suggest any other remedies other than restarting.  They offered a coupon on a new one that brings it very close to the Black Friday price I paid over a year ago (given that the price of the tracker has dropped).<br/>VERY DISAPPOINTED and FRUSTRATED.  For this price, it should last longer!!  There are plenty of cheaper trackers on the market, if the more expensive trackers are only going to last this long.  So, in this case, I think you DO NOT get what you paid for!
 I have a VERY small wrist so when I was doing my research on fitness trackers I this one appealed to me because of it's size. I go it in and started wearing it immediately. It was comfortable, but it seemed to dig into my wrist no matter where it was placed on my arm. I also found it wasn't able to accurately track my HR all the time, especially when I was working out. I also didn't like that I couldn't track a workout to see how many calories I burned and what my average HR was. While the thin design is feminine, the small size makes it uncomfortable to wear and the sensor digs into my wrist and leaves a mark. It wasn't comfortable to sleep in either. I ended up returning and getting the Charge 2 and LOVE it (separate review on that). It works for what it is supposed to do, but I didn't find it comfortable after wearing it for long periods of time and ultimately didn't fit my need. If you are looking for something to just track steps and normal HR, this will probably work for you, otherwise go for the Charge 2.
 This Fitbit was a gift from Christmas 2018 and I was eager to learn it and use it. However after just two months the screen quit functioning while the unit still was able to sync with my computer. I called Fitbit customer service and after going through several steps the rep verified that the unit was not working properly and sent me a link to follow in order to return it and receive a replacement. The link took me to a web page that required me to give either my FB account password and all its information or my Google account password and access to my phone information. Thinking this could not be a legitimate request and retried two more times to follow the email link from Fitbit and each time arrived at the same site. At this point I cancelled any further connection with the return form. I phoned Amazon help who determined Amazon would give me a one time curtesy refund minus shipping if I return the product. I am back at square one and do not know which fitness tracker would be the most reliable one to purchase.
 I bought this for my Nana's 67th birthday. She's not very good with technology so I was a bit hesitant but she kept saying she wanted one (she walks a lot and exercises a lot too). I figured it was worth a shot and if anything I would just return it. This fitbit was perfect for her. It fits her perfectly and once her and I figured out how to use it, she's now a pro at it. Super easy. Battery life is fantastic, and it is pretty accurate. Would totally recommend for young and old alike!
 Just got it in the mail today. I plugged in the USB to charge it and sync it with my account and I keep getting an error message that the battery is not charged and can't update the Fitbit tracker. This is my first time using a tracker and I am already unhappy. Found out the charge cable is messed up. I started messing with it. The Fitbit would charge only if I held the cord at an extreme angle at the base so I tied it in a weird way with a pipe cleaner and coffee mug. That worked. Will be calling customer service in the morning.<br/><br/>So the next day I called Fitbit customer service and they are sending me a new charger. Hopefully that will take care of my issue. I will update next week. ... I do love the performance of the Alta HR. I can even read my texts on my wrist and know who's calling.<br/>Aug 2- got my replacement charger. No issues now! I love my fit bit.
 I've just received it and started tracking my exercise.  It really motivates me to get up and move with the hourly silent vibration alarms to get up and start walking.  There are many functions that I haven't started using yet but I will in time.  I have 3 complaints...  1) I cannot read it outside while I'm walking no matter how much I try to shield it from the sun, 2) the Fitbit company seems to keep having trouble with their program to automatically sync it with the app on my phone and 3) even though I have followed every instruction to the letter, it is not communicating with my Weight Watcher app to send my exercise report.
 This isn't my first Fitbit, and I actually went without one for about a year because the band on my old one kept breaking. I decided to give them another shot in July 2018. I actually haven't used it much and didn't wear it at all from September to December. About three weeks after I started wearing it again, the band would snap off of the battery pack. Looking online, this is not uncommon and usually happens at the 6 month mark.<br/><br/>While Fitbit is currently replacing mine (and customer service was very helpful, so this review isn't a response to them), they only replace the bands up to one year after purchase. What are the odds that the band they send me actually lasts? Very slim. But I'll be on my own to replace it.<br/><br/>They know this is an issue with the Alta HRs, as it's all over their message boards. Yet they don't have their engineers fix it. This will probably be my last Fitbit. I've been wanting a smart watch anyways. Why would I pay $130+ for something that breaks in a few months when I could pay $200 for something that 1) does more and 2) won't break. Don't waste your money if you're going to be reliant on this fitness tracker.
 My blood pressure runs exceptionally low and won't read on most monitors.  I also suffer from PTSD an anxiety attacks so after MUCH research  and searching I decided to give this fitbit a try do I could monitor my pulse for both BP reason and to monitor anxiety levels by my pulse as well (cueing me as to when to "just breathe").  I also figured that it would motivate me to get off my a...uum, couch a little more often.  So far its doing a great job witb my pulse rate.  The couch situation is yet to be determined.  All in all I like it's features and functionality and the fact that you can connect with other users for tips, support, and help with motivation.<br/>Set up was so easy I even managed to do it myself! ( I usually need my husband to help me with these things.  Every time I get a new phone or have trouble with mine I just hand it to him and say, "it's doing/not doing this.  Fix it.) Overall I'm very pleased with my Alta HR.  Will update if anything changes.
 Won't take an accurate heart rate when I'm working out, regardless of how tight the band is or where it is placed on my wrist.  It consistently shows 91-96 bpm but when I take it manually I'm at 130-140.<br/><br/>Update: I've been working with fitbit support.  We have restarted the device and turned off / on a few settings.  Device still won't read an accurate heart rate during cardio.  They won't refund it because I purchased through Amazon, the return window was a month through Amazon and that expired a few weeks ago, and fitbit does not have an exchange program.  They said they are escalating it but I'm not holding my breath.  Anyone interested in a (slightly used) $150 step tracker?
 My old Fitbit: Charge HD<br/><br/>I like the style of this slim Fitbit better than the one I had before. Since it is a touch screen I often have issues trying to scroll from screen to screen. You are suppose to be able to just double tap for the screen to pop up then single tap to scroll through the screens but I often find myself tapping more. I honestly like having the button more because at least it would properly work in that sense. Also, I feel like the heart rate may not be 100% accurate.. Or my older one was more off. When I'm working out I expect to see at least 150+ and that happens occasionally but more often than not its at 120 which then makes the Fitbit not register that I worked out. With my other Fitbit my heart rate was always much higher when I worked out. Lastly, I don't know if it's because this Fitbit has the ability to track deep, REM, and light sleep, but my other Fitbit couldn't and I was sleeping on average 4.5 hours a night with that one. On this Fitbit its registering an average of 6.5 hours of sleep. That's a big difference so it's hard for me to judge what's exactly accurate.<br/><br/>The color is a gray/purple/blue. It changes in different lighting which I really like. You are able to change the bands which is a fun feature. You can earn badges/trophies and participate in challenges.<br/><br/>All in all, I do still like the Fitbit because I can look at the app if I'm getting annoyed with the tapping to look at all my data. If you're just looking for basic data, this is a good fitness watch.
 I moved to the Alta HR last year from the Charge HR for the smaller form factor. I've really enjoyed it, and found that it accurately detects and records all my runs, which is my primary exercise. However, due to injury, I've been unable to run and have been doing weights/yoga/no-impact aerobic exercise. The Alta HR will frequently fail to automatically detect the exercise, but you can manually add an exercise in the app. I thought that would be fine, and it wouldn't matter if the Alta HR detected the exercise or not, if I could just add it when detection failed.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, when you manually add an exercise session, it uses generic data about the calorie burn instead of using the calorie burn it actually recorded during the time period of your exercise! Why, Fitbit? This makes no sense. Instead of having the accurate data from my tracker, I have a generic calorie burn number, making recording the exercise completely pointless.<br/><br/>I'm wearing a tracker because I want to track my calorie burn, not some generic number Fitbit shoehorns in! Honestly, I would have been happy forever with an Alta HR if I had only run for exercise, but now that I'm familiar with this terrible flaw rendering the tracker useless, I will never buy another Alta HR unless this issue is fixed.<br/><br/>If I continue to buy a Fitbit, it will be a Charge HR, so I can manually start and stop an exercise session from the tracker itself. I am going to consider trackers from other brands, something I never would have done before, because this issue has been brought to Fitbit's attention in several threads and suggestions from the community, and they've taken no action to correct it.
 For an item you are supposed to wear 24/7 it does not last. I bought 6 mths ago and two things have broken on it, the face cracked and the clasp that attaches to the unit. I called and I got a 25% off coupon to use on a new purchase, but I do not want to buy another one that will only last 6 mths. If I did not have to wear for our company healthy program I would not bother. It is clunky and not very attractive that takes the place of my nice watch. Lastly, one hint Do Not Wear To Bed! Forget about the sleep monitoring, if you move, breath, twist, basically any movement, the time display with light up your room like a 500 watt halogen flood light, Not cool.
 It was nice while it lasted.  It is sad that it only lasted 15 months, since I treated it like at regular watch.  I never took it in the shower or got it wet.  I took it off if I was doing any sort of harsh activity, like boxing.  I'll have to go back to using my regular wristwatch until I get a replacement.  It's still working after 4 years.<br/><br/>I was surprised how much I enjoyed the caller ID and messages on my fitbit.  It was nice not to have to dig my phone out of my purse to find out it wasn't a call I needed to answer right away.<br/><br/>The band is terrible.  It wasn't long before I bought a leather band with a buckle, like a real watch.  I enjoyed the fitbit much more after that.<br/><br/>I think my wrist is too small for the HR portion to work properly.  When fastened comfortably, the unit slides back and forth on my wrist a bit, but I am just outside of their range at 5.0" around.  There are times when I checked my heart rate and it was 0.  Good thing it does not auto alert any emergency services.  I did not take off any stars for this issue.<br/><br/>Overall I liked my fitbit.  I'm not sure if I will buy another - maybe the Alta without the HR part - or an iwatch.
 I read reviews about how good the HR monitor is and I got excited. I think it measures my resting heart beat pretty well, but is sometimes grossly wrong. I wear it on my ankle most of the time, but even in my wrist I get heart beats up in the 120s when I'm just walking around (my resting heart rate is about 60) so I know it's estimating it very high. It makes it seem like I'm burning a ton of calories everyday, when I know I'm not. Regardless, I really like the more in depth sleep profile it gives with the HR model, and how it's smaller than my old charge. The ability to swap out bands is key, because the band giving out was ultimately the demise of my old charge.
 Love, love love my new Fitbit. Had a charge2 and it was so big and bulky. Still wish that they would create a stylish piece of jewelry to accompany it, but for what you need it for. This is the best women's fitness bracelet I've had.
 I decided to finally buy a Fitbit - being able to track my running and heartbeat seemed great. I was excited for it to arrive in the mail and was disappointed immediately. The Fitbit I received was faulty right out of the package. The double tap aspect to activate the screen did not work - so the Fitbit made its journey back to Amazon. I also want to add that the Fitbit was very bulky and awkward feeling on my arm. It sticks off very high and even if it wasn't broken I most likely would have returned it. Can't say I recommend a product that doesn't work like it should right out of the box.
 Steps do not track correctly! Upon awakening &amp; already had 461 calories burned? I should be fit as a fiddle if just getting out of bed burns that many calories!  These companies overthink themselves right out of a product! The first “band” Fitbit I gt stated the time &amp; my steps.  Simple!! Good to go! Worked like a charm until the company out-timed the product to make you buy a new one.  Greed takes over again! On the search for a simple step counter.....,..period!
 I was contemplating between and Alta and Charge HR. I would say that I like the Alta’s size. I had the Blaze before but it was too big for me as I have a really small wrist. The Alta served its purpose for me which is to track my steps and time. I haven’t really used it up to it’s potential. We’ll get to that once I start training for my 1st half marathon. I would say that the only thing I didn’t like about the Alta is that the screen is not as responsive. It takes a few taps before it wakes up or switch screens. So I’m regretting that I should’ve picked the Charge HR instead because it has the button on the side to wake up the screen and switch screens.
 My review was 5 stars until this week when it up and died! No trauma, nothing unusual happened to it. It just stopped. Consumer help had me try all sorts of things, but nothing worked. Then they said too bad but the warranty is only good for one year. I had it for 13 1/2 months. The discount they offered brought the cost down to what  it is on Amazon anyway, once you factor in shipping and the $20 more expensive protection plan. Which you obviously need! I trust Amazon, but not Fitbit. They do not re expect their product to last more than a year.
 Previous fitbit charge owner, so slightly disappointed with this buy.<br/>ISSUES<br/>- This new alta hr did not work from the beginning it only displayed the setup link on the screen constantly after I fully charged it.<br/>- Tried to sync it with my system, and was not successful.<br/>- Considering it is slightly pricey opted to return rather than exchange it.<br/>I will just buy a simple step counter that may actually function, without the bells and whistles.
 Very disappointed with this product.  I've had it over a month and it does not work as it should.  I've done everything the instructions tell me to do, but it doesn't work as promised.  I have to tap the face several times to see the time and when I wear it to bed, it says that I haven't slept all night.  Will probably end up selling it at a yard sale or giving it to charity.  Would NOT recommend it to a friend.
 The heart rate monitor works less than 50% of the time and when it is reading a heart rate, it is incorrect. I tried adjusting the tightness and position, as well as trying different bands.<br/><br/>The screen is supposed to turn on when you turn the watch towards your body. This rarely worked. I ended up tapping excessively to get the screen to turn on.<br/><br/>As a size small, it is actually quite big on my wrist. It sticks out far on each side, despite trying different bands.<br/><br/>In order to charge, I had to connect/disconnect/reconnect numerous times for the watch to recognize the charger.<br/><br/>The pros: the distance walked/ran seemed fairly accurate.
 This is my first Fitbit. I’ve owned several cheap knock offs prior. The problem with buying knocks offs you get what you pay for. So I decided to splurge a bit and buy something for myself. Item arrived well packaged, instructions included, synced well with my iPhone 8.<br/><br/>This tracker counts steps, sleep, and many more options that I’ve yet to explore. Everyday I learn something new this device can do. I’m not tech savvy but this Fitbit software is easy to use.<br/><br/>If your looking for a Fitbit that works as a watch, count stepper, and motivation to keep moving for those 10,000 steps a day. I’d reccomend this product.<br/><br/>My wrist size was 6. So did purchase the large size which is working great for me!
 I love my Fitbit. I fought with myself for a year trying to decide if I wanted to spend that much on a glorified watch. I finallyade myself do it, thinking it would help me stay active. It do s that and so much more! I use it as a silent alarm so that I wake up in the mornings without waking the whole house. The bands can be switched out so that it goes with anything. You can connect with friends and do challeneges. It tracks your sleep patterns, your heart rate. You can get notifications to move or excersize. The thing even connects to your phone so that you know when you are getting text messages and calls without carrying your phone everywhere. This is worth the money for sure!
 Today is the 1st day that I cannot return my fitbit Ulta HR black and today is the day I had given it enough time to track my cardio &amp; intense exercise again BUT IT STOPPED 2 weeks ago. I loved it in every way until this
 Absolutely in love with this. I have had it for 4 months and I can't imagine my life without it :) baterry lasts almost a week- I try and charge it when in the shower (30mins 3-4x a week) but lately I've been showering at the gym so I only plug it in for less than an hour 2x a week and it hasn't died on me.<br/><br/>Step count seems to be accurate- but I put it on my non-dominant hand but told my app it was my dominate hand so it wouldn't be as sensitive.<br/><br/>Heart rate is accurate- as far as I can tell. It knows when I am walking vs when I am on the elliptical but still tracks steps for the elliptical (not a bike though).<br/><br/>I love how it fits, the size is great. I love how small it is, I didn't want a giant watch.<br/><br/>Water resistant- I've worn it into the shower and sauna a couple times, I realized within a couple minutes and took it off but it still works<br/><br/>Very easy to track/log exercise. It knows the difference between just a few steps and going on a hike/walk.
 Although I like to wear my traditional watches, I don't mind replacing my daily watch with the fitbit, as it is plenty useful and has a slim design. It really monitors my sleep in detail, telling me how much time I spend in each stage every night. That's my favorite feature, since I can now know exactly how much sleep I get and the details of it. Perfect for those who lose track of how much time they sleep and forget to sleep enough.
 Before this I had a fit bit surge.<br/>(I had better syncing and accuracy with the surge).  I decided to try the Alta HR because it is smaller.<br/>I have found putting mine and my mothers side by side on my wrist I will get different heart rates, this is frustrating for someone that’s trying to monitor my mothers pulse throughout the day.<br/> I know they are not to be used to replace medical instruments however, you think they would be more accurate than 10 BPM difference (&amp; fluctuates)<br/>I have never had a more difficult time syncing my band to the app then with Alta HR.<br/> Not sure how many times I have already reset both mine and my mothers.<br/>I like the style, size and features of the Alta HR but I am feeling very frustrated with it and I’ve had it for a while now and might replace it with something different…
 I was worried this would look and feel bulky, but it does not at all! The pink band does get dirty pretty easily, but I purchased for the device, not the band. The HR function is very helpful and I love how easy it is to customize the display through the app.<br/><br/>Shown with band: <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Oitom-For-Fitbit-Alta-HR-Accessory-Band-and-For-Fitbit-alta-Band-2-Size-Large-6-7-34-9-3-34-Small-5-1-34-6-7-34-8-Color-Silver-Black-Rose-Gold-Pink-Blue-Brown-Rainbow-Large-6-7-34-9-3-34-Rose-Gold/dp/B06XHCP54Q">Oitom For Fitbit Alta HR Accessory Band and For Fitbit alta Band, (2 Size) Large 6.7"-9.3" Small 5.1"-6.7" (8 Color) Silver Black Rose Gold Pink Blue Brown Rainbow(Large 6.7"-9.3" Rose Gold)</a>
 I feel completely ripped off.<br/>Packaging was torn up.<br/>The Fitbit it self looked to be in ok condition, but for the life of me I could not get it to sync. It took hours for it to initially connect to my phone and even with all day comment turned on I could sync it. I troubleshot it, turned bluetooth off and on again, exited the app, turned phone on and off, even unpaired it and added it again. I've had it for 24 hours and have talked to customer support THREE times. Each time running me through the same process, completely deleting it, and starting over. Only for it to sync once and them immediately stop again and not work. I can't track anything with this device.<br/>Hopefully it's just one faulty product. Couldn't keep a connection what's so ever.<br/>That being said, I plan on returning it and seeing it maybe another Fitbit would work for me. Super disappointed.
 Really inaccurate heart rate reading during exercise. Really dumb that you don't have the option to manually START your workouts. I've included a photo where the Alta logged less than half of my exercise times. Iworked out for 45 + minutes and two days it only tracked less than 20. WTH?  i'm returning this as they CHARGE HR which i had before has now upgraded with better features and you can manually start your training sessions. Iwant a heart rate tracker that accurately logs my workout sessions. Not accurate either on steps. I've even tinkered with the stride settings to see if it will more accurately track steps. Seems that didn't work either.  Oh well. Other than this it does great at tracking sleep.
 Buyer beware. This device will last a year at best. The battery will not withhold charge and when you contact support they will only offer you a discount to purchase a new device when its the defective battery causing the issue. Great device, but too much to pay for something that lasts a year at best.
 I really like the HR function and tracking my sleep. It fits pretty good too. I have found that it doesn't always count your steps if your holding something in your arm while walking or going thru a grocery store holding onto a shopping cart. I also have a One and with it on my waistband I generally have 500+ more steps on it after a trip to the store. I also find the One more accurate when going up a flight of stairs, especially if your holding something in the hand your Alta HR is on (like a cup of coffee). Overall, I like the Alta HR but I'm glad I have the One to count with when the Alta doesn't do an accurate job.
 My wife really enjoyed the FitBit Alta HR when it worked. It was great at keeping track of steps and sleep cycles. With the HR sensor it was really cool being able to see the detailed sleep cycles and heartrate usage. HOWEVER: The unit itself stopped holding a charge 3 months after the 1 year warranty expired. Talking with FitBit support, they said they would not fix it and only offered a small discount on a new one. I'd expect to get at least 2 years of use out of a device like this, and for it to last just barely 1 is unacceptable. I won't be purchasing anything by FitBit again.
 *Update* downgrading this a full star. Blue tooth is still unreliable. It's still days between syncing and I'm feeling like I spent way too much money on a product that doesn't fulfill it's promise.  Original review: Frustrated by Bluetooth connectivity issues. Apparently this is not uncommon but w/o that reliability I'm only giving 3 stars. I'm just a woman who wants to track her life better and this is doing that--just can't get the info when I want it. How does that encourage me to keep moving? It doesn't. I was expecting real time updates with all day syncing but it'll go hours, sometimes all day w/o having synced. Fits well, plastic doesn't feel sweaty underneath even after a good walk. Love that I can scan a foods UPC code and it almost always can automatically upload the info about that food. APP is great. Lasts just about 7 days between charges.
 I really like this product. Its my first Fitbit. I did my research and read a million reviews. I'm glad I did because this is perfect for my needs. The only bad part was I got the wrong size. I didn't measure my wrist so its my own fault. I bought replacement bands so it was an easy fix. I'm more aware of my fitness level with this device. I know when I'm not sleeping well and not drinking enough water. The only thing I really hate is that it doesn't track my steps when I'm pushed someone in a wheelchair which I do quite a lot at work. I have to put on the exercise tracker with my gps to get any steps with this issue. I also wish it tracked more types of exercise like yoga or things at the gym. Maybe an upgraded model does this now. I'm still happy with it.
 I bought this to replace the Charge HR that I had for nearly 2 years. I’m happy with it for the most part. The biggest pro to me is that it’s slimmer/lower profile than the Charge HR, while still tracking heart rate. The cons are that it doesn’t track stairs (and I just moved from a studio apartment to a townhouse so I am climbing stairs constantly!) and that it doesn’t have the button to signal when you’re starting a workout (it automatically knows when you’re doing cardio, but doesn’t pick up yoga). I like that I can switch out the band if I want to down the road. Overall, I think the look is worth the concessions from the Charge HR.
 I'm quite happy with my Fitbit Alta HR. I bought the HR as a replacement for my lost first gen Alta, and I'm glad I decided to upgrade. Easy to use interface both on wrist and on mobile, plus the small tracker that doesn't become obtrusive or a problem for moving around. The hourly movement reminders and incoming phone messages and phone calls are exceedingly helpful. Much like the Alta, switching bands is very easy and they are interchangeable with the original Alta bands. I like the clasp on this one a little better, as I think it's less likely to be accidentally loosened and fall off.<br/><br/>I would definitely repurchase this item in the event I also misplace this one.
 This product was accurate for the first 3 to 6 months, and was good for motivation, then it began miscalculating my heart rate. One year from purchase and it doesn't work anymore. It won't hold a charge, it does want to sync, and the display doesn't want to work sometimes even when it is fully charged, and the heart rate monitor does not work at all now. I would HIGHLY recommend purchasing a warranty and plan on replacing your fitbit between 6 and 9 months if you want to get your money's worth. My mom and dad also wear fitbits, and my dad's is starting to malfunction also. We probably won't be using fitbit anymore. I heard that t he way to go if you are serious is to purchase a HR tracking watch with a compatible chest strap H R monitor for the best and most reliable results. My fitbit  purchased does not even qualify as a fancy watch anymore. It's headed for the trash bin.
 Words cannot express how much I love this Fitbit. It has helped me to see in actual numbers and tangible evidence just how terrible my sleep is. It accurately tells me how many calories I’m burning at my extremely physical job. It teaches me to breathe when I am stressed out. I love the silent alarms.<br/>One thing that I had thought before getting this was that I wished the clock would be horizontal. I was willing to compromise on it, but I really didn’t want to. While setting it up, I learned that the clock is customizable. It can and is horizontal because I wanted it to be.
 Wife loves it.  I asked her if she can tell if she is wearing it.  She said she can but it doesn’t bother her at all.  She likes the color too.  My wife is pregnant and it is really nice to be able to monitor her sleep and heart rate.  She hasn’t been getting enough sleep.  And when she naps, it turns out that she only falls asleep sometimes.<br/><br/>I have an Apple Watch, but what I really need is something like this where it monitors my sleep and doesn’t need to be charged everyday.  I’m gonna buy one for myself today
 I switch from my Charge HR to this and I am very happy about it.<br/>First is its sleek design- I like how it's neither bulky nor thick; at a quick glance, it could be mistaken for a bracelet.<br/>Second is it has all features that the my old Charge HR has minus the stair count (which I don't miss, because it's inaccurate anyway). Oh, and I can check battery status directly on it instead of depending on the app to view it's battery status.<br/>Lastly, the band is replaceable! (replacement bands to be purchased separately). I can change it up when it gets worn out or if I just want to switch the color to match my outfit.<br/>Only downside I have with it is it's not waterproof, so just be careful not to submerge it in water, although it's been splashed with water and it's been ok.
 I bought the Alta HR Fitbit to replace my Charge HR Fitbit after it would no longer sync.  I had been pleased with the Alta HR so far but the band would no longer stay connected on one side after wearing it for only a few months.  I also had this problem with the Charge HR band but at least it lasted for almost a year.  I'm disappointed with the Fitbit bands since they do not last and will probably not buy another activity tracker from Fitbit.
 As has happened to many others, my fitbit Alta HR's battery went bad just a few days after the 1-year warranty period. For no apparent reason, it has suddenly lost the ability to hold a charge for more than 15 minutes. I've tried all the resets and cleanings, but nothing fixes it. This is a known issue with no resolution.<br/><br/>Customer support may offer a 25% off coupon, but since the Alta bands are now discontinued, it does not apply to those. Also, for whatever reason, the discount also does not apply to the Alta's replacement line (Inspire).<br/><br/>This is sad because I've loved having multiple fitbit bands over the years, but at this point, I can no longer trust that they'll last for more than a year.<br/><br/>**Update** Fitbit ended up offering me a free replacement. Not sure how long this one will last, but I do appreciate their effort.
 This is my second Fitbit. I has the old Alta, and wanted the newer one in gold since in Hawaii it’s popular to wear gold bangles on your wrist. I wanted something coordinating. I can fully charge my alta hr &amp; it literally stays on for 4 (max 5) days straight. My old one would stay charged for about 2 days. I love the slender look. It doesn’t get in the way when I’m typing like bulky watches that hit the back of my hand. I owned an apple watch and I didn’t like it. The notifications wasn’t that great, it’s bulky, and you can barely hear although there is audio. I ended up selling the apple. Very pleased so far &amp; I highly recommend this product for people who enjoy a more slender watch. I also love how there’s a party on your wrist when you meet your stepping daily goals.
 I wore my original Alta to death. It took a couple years and a lot of banging, but it finally died. The new Alta with HR is fantastic. Light weight and thin profile but all the bells and whistles. The original strap (a buckle) is much easier to fasten that I would have thought but I also got other straps and they are predictably like the original.
 Would've given it five stars if it was waterproof so I didn't have to take it off while showering and swimming, but it functions great for everything else. It's been really interesting tracking my sleep. The size is perfect as I don't care for the bigger one; this one does not take up as much room on the wrist.  I put an aftermarket stainless steel bracelet on it instead of the rubber one it comes with and it blends in perfectly with the rest of my accessories.
 About a year ago I purchased a fit bit charge because everyone said it was far superior to the alta. However, I could never get over how bulky it is (I’m a woman). There are some trade offs for the Alta (not quite as easy to read, for some reason I don’t always see my messages and this was never a problem with thit charge). Overall, I much prefer the Alta to the Charge.<br/>As a side note, I think the black band is the way to go. If it wasn’t so expensive I think the gunmetal is most classy. I had the teal band for h charge and it looked cheap.
 I have been a fairly loyal fitbit user, staying with them through the recall, rashes, etc. purchased this Alta last November and was hopeful the strap would be better. I have been very careful not to get it too wet, etc and dont wear it at night as not to wear it out. Just a month ago the strap started popping off (not at the clasp but at the link to tracker). I thought it would be OK so wore it still and of course, lot it when it popped off and I hadnt noticed. Its under warranty, but doubt they will cover it since I no longer have it to 'fix' it. I dont think I will try another fitbit.<br/>UPDATE: Contacted Fitbit customer service and they are sending me a new one! I went on the forums at Fitbit and this band issues is definitely a design flaw. Their customer service is great and has improved 100% since the recall days.I greatly appreciate their investment in brand loyalty.
 Like some other reviews, I really wanted to like this product. I reviewed all of the help online for issues relating to inaccurate heart rate and steps and activity -therefore wrong calories burned. I tried using the Alta HR for over a week and in the process moved the wrist band to various locations to see if the accuracy would be improved but to no avail. I was willing overlook the lack of water resistance but I can't overlook the basic ineffectiveness of this device. (oh, and it REALLY is virtually unusable outdoors... humph
 Like literally.  I love the alarm feature.  And can I say that NAMASTE fitbit you are so consciousness raising.  OOOOOH  THAT'S how much I'm sleeping / how I'm sleeping (when I'm dreaming!) / how hard I'm working out / my resting heartrate when that person I hate comes by (spike!) / how much more sedentary I am midweek / when my boyfriend pees at night / everything.  I was a stranger to myself before.  I am usually more of a qualitative non-tech kind of girl but that means I had that much more to learn!  This has made me #woke
 Beware!!!  You must have a certain required smartphone , a Windows 10 computer, or a Dongle in order to run setup. A Dongle is not included, which is ridiculous. They don't mention in advance these specific requirements in the product description.  Since I had an Android ZTE smartphone and a Windows Pro 7 OS and no dongle......my wife missed getting her birthday present. I googled, watched Youtubes, searched forums when setup said to insert dongle .....what ? My advice, avoid this product at all cost unless you have an iPhone, Windows 10, a dongle, buy coffee at Starbucks, eat only at bistros, use Uber, want driver-less cars, live on solar power only, are a snowflake, live on Facebook or Instagram and hate President Trump and follow everyone else like a herd of cattle. This product is worthless to me because I am apparently considered to be a dinosaur ! Today's technology could make this a much better product and let it operate as a "stand alone" device. I hated it .
 This would never receive phone notifications (calendar, text, phone call). Tried setting it up with two different Android phones. Samsung S7 and Samsung J3.<br/>Worked with Fitbit support for over an hour and we were never able to get it to work. I have two other Garmin devices that would work fine with notifications against these same phones ( Fenix 3 and Vivoactive 3 music ). Unfortunately it would never work with the Fitbit.<br/>Support was great they even sent me a new device to try, that failed as well. Not sure what the problem is.<br/>I'm very familiar with technology (15 years as a software developer)
 I bought one of these for myself, my sister and also as a gift to a friend. I should have purchased stock with fitbit since I have also been quite successful in convincing multiple others to buy one as well. I didnt keep it long (2 weeks actually) because i upgraded to a charge 3, so did my sister. So we gave them away to others. It does so much more than i thought it would and I'm happy with it.
 I am very satisfied with my Alta.  I did not need all the features offered on more expensive models.  I can still see time, steps, get text notifications, heart rate, calories and more.  I also like that you can get a clock face that shows the date.  Some other models didn't offer this feature. It is not over powering on my arm and is very comfortable.  I like the sleek look.  There are a lot of fashion bands for this.  I did change the band and love it.  It looks more like a really cool bracelet than a fitness band.  I am completely satisfied that I made the right choice.
 I purchased this as a gift for my wife.  She wanted to use it to kick-start her training for the summer.  She was very excited out of the box.  The set-up was fairly easy.  My 13 year old daughter did it.  There was some synching to her apple account and cell phone that weren't initially clear to either of us.  So you'll have to connect to a computer at some point to make those initial moves.  But after that, she has absolutely loved it!!! She gets texts to her Fitbit.  She gets alerts to walk and when she is walking she gets information on her progress.  Overall it was a great investment, and although she has only had it for two weeks she really likes it.  The only down side is that it has to be taken off in water (we think).  So she doesn't wear it into the shower or the pool.
 I had the Fitbit Charge HR and it quit working in less then a year, I then got the Fitbit Alta HR and I liked the Pulse reading, how many steps/miles I've walked a day and the phone call message that comes on the screen face when I have my phone in silent mode. I wish the screen face was a little bigger, but the battery life is much longer then the Charge HR. UPDATE !! I bought the Fitbit Alta HR in July 2017, it quit working May 3  2018. They are sending me a replacement, but if this one doesn't last a year I'M DONE WITH FITBIT !!
 I was so excited to purchase this after my research just find the reminder feature doesn't work no matter what I did. I restarted the alta HR and reset it. Cleared the app and reinstalled. Yet a turn of the wrist 1/2 the time produced no data. Tapping for results was never consistent. Sleep function was very nice. Received no notices or reminders even though everything was turned on and set up properly, cleared, recreated and still no Reminders to move, etc. I read on the fitbit website others are having the same issues. Seems to be a software issue that has been going on for over 6 months now. For the $$$ I don't want to try another.
 Quality issues. The screen cracked 6 months after purchase. Did nothing outside daily wear. FitBit will not replace it because they say that the crack voids the warranty. Will not buy another Fitbit due to poor warranty and support.
 I do like it but the larger version for about the same cost is way better! This version doesn't have a button like the larger version so getting the display to turn on is difficult (twisting my wrist rarely does it and it takes a few swipes of the screen to get it to work). Also, there's no stop watch like the other one and it does not do the breathing/meditation that the other one has. Why did I keep it? It fits my wrist a lot better, the other one even in small was too bulky for my wrist and uncomfortable under sweaters/coats. This one is a little bit more comfortable for me to wear and I do appreciate that it helps motivate me to walk more and sometimes it buzzes to let me know of important messages but it only works for some of my family members but not all, not sure why that is.
 Worked great for 6 months but then died. After spending $150 you would think that it would last longer then just 6 months. I always took care of it, never in any water. I ordered a new one as I do like the Alta HR. Hopefully this one last longer than 6 months.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The replacement only lasted 7.5 months when the HR function failed. Showed my heart rate being 250 BPM while sleeping and then would drop to 20 BPM when I was awake. This also messed up the sleep data. Basically it is nothing more than a basic watch now. Not worth it. This is the last Fitbit I will ever buy!
 Overall the product does its job well. One persistent nuisance you may have heard on the street: turning the wrist or tapping to activate the display oddly is not consistent. You find yourself flicking your wrist back and forth, angrily tapping the screen while your coworkers whisper among each other "Is he doing ok? Is everything alright at home? Are we close enough as friends to ask?" Which is not why I purchased this watch. Stylish, yes. The overall inexpensive replacement bands mean you get to match with your rugged I-workout-with-dark-brooding-clothing or your I-wear-plaid-to-breweries evening ensemble with ease. But the tapping? Not fun.
 Seems to work great. It sometimes can't be seen to sync on my PC. Google searches all talk about rebooting the Alta HR which for me doesn't work. To get it to be recognized when it won't sync I have to go into Bluetooth settings on the PC and make it forget the device and then re-pair the device with the PC, I can also reboot the PC and it will then be recognized. My husband's Surge has the exact same issue with her PC. Fitbit has some work to do on their Bluetooth implementation!
 5 stars because I haven't had any issues with this product and it does exactly what it says it does. I got it as a motivational item to keep me on track but I find it was an impulse buy and I don't use it as often as I had hoped. I could have just continued using free calorie counting apps and exercise trackers and saves the money. I wish it tracked bike rides (currently only tracks walks and runs.)
 I’ve only had this for about 3 weeks but I can already see the difference it’s making.<br/>I’ve never really been one for counting calories or keeping  tabs on how much water intake I’m getting but the Fitbit App keeps all those things and much more in one place and really makes tracking SO much more manageable. Just the accountability alone has made me slightly alter my habits. I’ve lost 5lbs so far as a result.<br/>I really enjoy having daily goals that you can see on the watch all day. It keeps me mindful of my choices.<br/>It’s comfortable to wear just like any watch and I haven’t so far had any problem with it coming undone.<br/>So I would recommend this product to anyone looking to make a change or even just keep a closer eye on their fitness.<br/>Will update review if anything changes.
 More subtle than the regular, silver version, so it can be worn on your other wrist if you want to wear a regular watch otherwise.  For me, the subtleness of a continuous black band is worth the extra $$.  It works great for auto-detecting exercises.  But I DO wish it would allow starting/stopping of exercises like the Charge 2.  It's basically a passive tracker, checking your HR, tracking your activity, counting your steps, and tracking your sleep.  But it's not a full-featured fitness band like the Garmin Vivosmart 3 (which I also have and love).
 It is great. I have worn it almost everyday since Christmas 2017. Just yesterday the plastic broke on the band and now it will not stay on. I have to order a whole new band. That is annoying because I only take it off to shower and it doesn't really get much wear or tear other than being taken off and on once a day. I think the bands are decently priced online but I don't know how long they will last either. For $150 I would expect it to last more than 7 months. The battery lasts a really long time which is great and it syncs to my phone throughout the day. It lets me know when I get calls and I can preview my texts but it drains my iPhone battery being connected via Bluetooth all day. And I have the new iPhone X which is supposed to have an improved battery. Overall it is awesome but I am really disappointed in the band. I mean without the band you cannot use the device at all. So now I have to research where to find a new band at a decent price, order, wait for shipping and hope it lasts longer than 7 months. I bought it because it was small which is nice but it isn't waterproof so I have to constantly remember when I take showers, do the dishes, or go swimming to take it off.
 I was never into Fitbit but decided to give it a try as I needed a push to exercise more. It has definitely changed my activity level (I've lost 1.5 lbs in 8 days!) and allows me to balance my love for sweets with exercise.<br/><br/>The app is what really drives my behavioural change. I can set goals and (being a competitive person) I'm driven to collect the stars and feel the buzz of my Fitbit when I reach those goals. I've been going to the gym and opting to walk more just to hit those 10k steps.<br/><br/>The device itself looks fine. I'm into analog watches so the look is definitely a change from my usual style, but I appreciate how slim it is (in the mirror, it looks a little like a bangle vs. a watch). Plus, I am so into the functionality that I've stopped caring if it doesn't match my outfit :)<br/><br/>Definitely happy I made the purchase!
 If you are looking to track normal low activity of your everyday life up to 120 bpm, then this is a great watch. However, if like me, you plan to use this to track exercise then this is not very accurate. I have tried placing it on both the outside and the inside of my wrist and various places and with various tightness, and it is still extremely inaccurate for anything above 120 BPM. I have heard many others with this complaint, and believe it is related to the sweat produced during exercise. This might cause the sweat to get in-between the heart rate monitor, or possibly caused the watch to slide around a little bit but it is a big issue.
 I'm a first time FitBit user, in the past I've used the Jawbone UP3 for a year but when that failed and the replacement failed as well I needed to find a replacement brand. I like to wear a watch on my left arm and prefer to have something discreet on my right arm rather than a full size computer display.<br/>The Alta HR fits my wrist comfortably and seems to pretty accurately count my steps and measures my heart rate in the zone that I expect, but I have not done a measurement comparison with a different product. I've also only used the Alta HR for a few days now.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- More comfortable than the Jawbone UP3 (doesn't need to be as tight)<br/>- Secure enough so that I don't have a fear of it coming off<br/>- Clear and easily readable display (not that I use it much)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Doesn't support 24H time display<br/>- Doesn't vibrate on alarms<br/>- Silent alarm times out too quickly
 I have only had it since Christmas and it has stopped syncing with my computer or phone.  Battery is charged and Bluetooth is on.  Product support doesn't work so I can't get help.  And now it is past deadline to return.
 I've lost weight in the last 6 weeks with a major help from this Fitbit and the app!  If you hold yourself accountable to calories, exercise, and steps, it is a great tool!  I've also found the sleep tracker to be incredibly accurate.  In fact, it has been FAR more accurate than the $2,000 one night sleep study I paid for.  It has helped me make some major lifestyle changes and I am feeling so much better!!
 I absolutely love this tracker. I upgraded from the Flex 2. However, I do not recommend getting the coral band. I have only had it since Monday and it's nasty and dirty already. I do not work a "dirty" job and have tried all the recommended solutions to clean it. I even bought a magic eraser which isn't working either. Very disappointed.
 Not worth the money, it broke after 2 months. The heart rate is inaccurate and drops in the middle of the workout.
 I have been using the Alta HR since Xmas 2017.  My charging cord stopped working 5 days ago.  Since it is less than a year old I called Fitbit customer service.  The woman I spoke with had such a thick accent I can hardly under most os what she said and needed numerous repeats on almost everything she said.  Then there is all the background noise from all the other representatives who must all be sitting side to side without any dividers.  It was so loud it drowned out and garbled what was already difficult to understand.  Then there was the whole issue of getting her to understand that the charger no longer worked but the Alta could charge on someone else cord and their Alta would no charge on my cord but would on there cord.  Seems pretty simple to me but she could not seem to get it!  Very frustrating and almost enough to make me think of a different band when I get a newer one down the road.  The Alta HR is basically a good tracker.  I do wish that it would show the number of times you are awake at night without having to count the red on the top.
 The Alta HR looks almost exactly like last year’s Alta, which means it’s more of a bracelet than an activity tracker. It’s modular, so the bands on either side of the plastic module in the middle can be easily swapped out. It has the same display as the Alta. It’s not touch sensitive, but requires a tap on either the face or side of the module if you want to cycle through your data. This can get annoying.<br/><br/>There is one noteworthy design change: the strap. Last year’s Fitbit Alta had a snap-in clasp (one I didn’t like very much), but this year’s has a more traditional railroad-style strap.Some people have asked me whether the Fitbit Alta HR is now a replacement for the Charge 2. My answer is: not really. They’re the same price and both have heart rate sensors. But you can stop and start exercises with the Charge 2, and you can’t do that at all with Fitbit Alta HR. The Fitbit Alta HR will automatically recognize if you go for a run, but it’s not something you can control, and it doesn’t display a timer during your activities.<br/><br/>So what can this Fitbit do? It does what a Fitbit does. It tracks your steps, your distance traveled (without GPS), your calories burned, and your sleep. It shows you notifications and incoming calls from your smartphone. What’s new about the Alta HR is that it has optical heart rate sensors built into the underside, so it records your heart rate throughout the day, and Fitbit will now show you more advanced sleep data in its app. This latter feature isn’t limited to just the Alta HR; it will work with any newer Fitbit that has heart rate sensors. I look at the Fitbit Alta HR’s heart rate data as something that is nice to have, data that I wouldn’t trust entirely but could still help to inform other activity decisions.<br/><br/>The same goes for distance tracking: since the Alta HR doesn’t have GPS, or even connected GPS through the phone, my expectations were low. After a five-plus-mile hike last Friday, the Fitbit app told me I had taken more than 19,000 steps total that day and had been active for 158 minutes, but I also noticed within the app that the activity was automatically recorded as just 4.97 miles.<br/>This is also the same with sleep tracking: unless you venture into a lab and have sleep sensors taped to your body and have that sort of data to compare it to, it’s hard to gauge the accuracy and efficiency of consumer trackers like Fitbit. But Fitbit is at least trying to give you more insights into what’s going on when you’re sleeping. More importantly, it’s trying to tell you what that means for your overall health.<br/><br/>Sleep sessions are now broken down into light sleep, deep sleep, REM stages, and time awake, with a breakdown of your overall sleep quality. There are sleep insights now, too; the app will say "You were 31% in REM sleep last night" or "Light sleep doesn’t mean weak sleep! Your body actually performs a number of important functions during this sleep stage." It’s all a little reminiscent of the insights that — dare I say it — Jawbone used to offer with its UP activity-tracking system. It’s good to see Fitbit catch up. All of this may seem like I’m feeling fairly non-committal toward the new Fitbit, when in truth I like what Fitbit has done holistically with this product. It’s still the same bracelet-like Fitbit from last year, but with one hardware addition and one new software feature that improve the overall experience. Its battery life lasted me nearly a week, from a Wednesday night to the following Wednesday, on a single charge. This is more impressive when you consider the added heart rate sensors. Over a week, I became a little addicted to Fitbit again, wanting to get my steps up, trying to pay attention to the move reminders, actually checking the app every now and then to see how I slept or what my resting heart rate was that morning. I did miss real exercise-tracking features while I was wearing it, and am still a lot more inclined to buy a wearable that has GPS and other advanced sport tracking.<br/><br/>But the new Fitbit Alta HR told me just a tiny bit more about my activity than what I knew before, and was just so easy to wear. And if we aren’t getting mind-blowing technology advances in wearables right now, then that’s probably the next best thing.
 I probably would have loved this if I could have gotten it working with my Galaxy 5 phone.  I downloaded the app no problem.  I kept getting "Update your application" when I went to add the device to my Fitbit account.  I waited two days to hear from Fitbit HELP only to find out that the Galaxy 5 won't work with an Alta HR.  It is considered an "old phone" and I was told to replace my phone, which I did not want to do, so I am returning the Alta HR.  I just wish with all the reading I did prior to ordering this on the Fitbit website that I would have seen somewhere this information.  It would have saved a lot of frustration.  Not Amazon's fault, just not real good info from Fitbit.
 As a petite lady, I was really looking forward to the Alta for it’s slim, more fashionable design. The Alta has no button for starting a workout and for checking the time/steps/heart rate/etc.  I thought I could do without it, but in reality it really sucked not being able to push the button to check the time or to log the finer-grained analyses of a workout.<br/><br/>Yes, the automatic exercise tracking function does pick up a workout; however, it only picks up the workout at a certain point in. So if you like a complete snapshot of your work out and like to control the time of your workout, you really want a model with the button. Yes, you can whollop it to check the time and other measurements; however, it’s a lot of wholloping at your wrist that feels random in displaying the data. Some whollops show data. Some whollops don’t. So you whollop away clumsily through the data points.<br/><br/>The Alta is fine for casual steppers. As an exerciser, try another model or even a cheaper brand (which are nowadays showing solid reviews!).
 1) The Alta HR is extremely uncomfortable to wear. It's very tight to the skin, and after all-day wear, I would have itchy red marks where the tracker rested. I notified FitBit about this issue, as I believe the device was actually burning me, and they promptly offered a refund and return. Google "FitBit Alta HR burns skin" and you'll see some scary pictures.<br/><br/>2) The heart rate information is rudimentary. I am a person whose heart rate is on the high side at baseline (usually between 100-110 bpm). But during sleep, it can dip down as low as mid-80s. Ok, so Alta determines that 86 is my "resting heart rate" and then proceeds to tell me that I am in the "fat burn zone" for 15 hours a day because my HR is 100-120s. This results in an astronomical amount of calculated calories burned per day. I know that this is not accurate. Thus, I question the accuracy of all the HR-based features, like sleep tracking. The vibrating alarm clock feature is the only thing I will miss about my FitBit.
 I am day five into owning/wearing my Fitbit and I love it!  This is my first one.  I like being able to keep track of my steps, heart rate and sleep pattern.  There is so much more it can do!  I need to start tracking my water and food intake.  I am motivated to walk more.  I do wear it to sleep and it is not at all uncomfortable.  I bought a few different straps to switch them out and I wear it along with my bracelets.  I delayed purchasing a Fitbit for quite some time due to the price, but finally decided my health is very worth it.
 It works - until the server goes down.  Be aware that you are not only paying for the device, but ongoing support from Fitbit.  I hadn't considered this when I shopped for tracking devices and now think I should have.  I purchased this item directly for the sleep stage information - health wise it has helped me immensely and I am grateful for this, when it works.  But apparently something is wrong with the server, the information is not available, and I am only delivered "classic sleep" information, which isn't helpful.  Fitbit acknowledged this problem, eventually, but still offers user troubleshooting advice, even though they know it is a problem with the server.  And, in reading the user posts regarding this disruption, which many, many people are experiencing, I also realize I have been lucky that for the most part my device/sync process works - for others it has not, and although they have purchased a somewhat expensive device with the goal of certain features, that fitbit markets, do not in fact get the benefit of these features.  One user reported that GPS has been down for some time (5+ months) on some models.  And this sleep thing is affecting many of their products, not just the Blaze, which they admitted.  So, if you are buying this for features that will need to use a fitbit server, know that it may not be reliably available.  And this is happening while they are unveiling new products with new features...and not adequately supporting the not-so-old products.  I purchased the relatively new Alta HR in July, and here I am now, not even two months later.<br/>_____________________________________<br/><br/>I am updating this after several days of no fix, and more evidence that the customer service is not taken seriously.  They have indicated that there is a problem with the server, and that is why there are no sleep stages, but they are trying to minimize this by stating it is only limited to one model, when all seem to be affected, and for some reason the customer service people have not been informed, so when customers call to see why their sleep stages are not working they are taken through all the usual stuff (reinstalling app, resetting item, etc.) which takes up time (often the people on the boards report at least an hour) and of course doesn't work because this is not the problem.  Given the long stretch that GPS hasn't been available for some users I admit I am not hopeful.
 I've been using Fitbits for almost ten years now, and have been loyal to their brand, but this is the worst model I've come across. It seems like in the arms race of fitness trackers, this company has gone to s*** and just keeps cranking out new models, regardless of their capabilities.<br/><br/>-There's no ability to tell the fitbit when you start exercising because it *supposedly* can tell on its own - fast forward to me spending 90 minutes at the gym doing HIIT, and the fitbit clocking me at 10 minutes of exercise for the day. If this had happened once, that might've been just attributed it to the circuit that I was doing, but this happened EACH TIME regardless of the exercises I did at the gym.<br/>-This not only happened to me while at the gym, but also at the yoga studio. 60 minutes of yoga apparently means 12 minutes of exercise to the Fitbit at MOST.<br/>-Multiple times this thing told me that I was asleep when I was clearly sitting on my sofa reading.<br/><br/>Such a POS model, don't waste your money.
 I'm 5 days in, and so far, I really like it! I haven't delved too deep into its capabilities yet, just used it thus far for tracking steps, calories burned, and the app to track my sleep patterns (that is FASCINATING to review each morning!).<br/>I had trouble getting it to start up when I first unboxed it and connected it to the charger -- the phone app was not syncing, and therefore the Fitbit would not truly turn on, until I went through a process of re-starting my phone, disabling and then re-enabling wifi and Bluetooth for 30 seconds each, then starting up the Fitbit app again (I read this solution on a Fitbit users' support blog). Hasn't given me any issues since! I'm glad I found that blog to help me, because I thought I'd just gotten a faulty unit.<br/>Hopefully this helps someone else who's having trouble getting started for the same reasons I did ;)
 This is my second fitbit and while it records everything I want it to, the display is quite small and the wristband is too small. I ordered the small wristband (my previous FitBit band was a small and it was a bit big), but the sizing seems to be different. I should have ordered a medium wristband. UPDATE: I ordered the large wristband and it's way too big. It seems the bands are either for children or men. Nothing for the average female. The display is not only too small, but you really have to hit it to get it to display. I would steer people away from this Fitbit.
 I’ve had the Fitbit Alta hr for approximately 3 weeks. I’ve had time to evaluate it for myself.<br/>Cons:  You can’t read it in the sunlight. Mine gives me faulty info once it reaches 50% battery. For example, from my bed to the bathroom, it is 17 steps, but at 50% power, it says 4 steps. A third negative is it doesn’t come with directions on what to do first; how long it needs to charge; or how to change out the bands. I can’t wear it on my wrist while pushing my buggy. It won’t count my steps when you hold on, so this also applies to my treadmill exercise. I’ve also noticed with my treadmill that if I put my Fitbit in my pocket, it may or may not recognize that I’m doing an exercise. It counts my steps, but it doesn’t give me exercise credit. The replacement bands work with this and are easy to swap out, but they are more challenging to get back on the Fitbit. My last negative is again at 50% battery life, it is harder to wake up.<br/>Pros:  It is great to have the heart rate info when accurate. It was easy to pair with my phone, but I had to figure out it wouldn’t pair until it was charged...again, not part of setup instructions. I like that I can move my dashboard so that it suits my preferences. I do wish I could delete the one that tracks the monthly cycle and fertility time. I don’t need it and don’t want to see it. My last positive is that it’s easy to log my foods, and it knows instantly the carbs, fats, and proteins.<br/>Would I buy it again? I would, but I might look for one that is waterproof.
 Good fitness tracker. Seems a bit low tech for the price but it's functional and the various long term tracking features like sleeping habits and resting heart rate is quite interesting.<br/><br/>The tapping function doesn't always work, and it takes a bit of research and practice to pinpoint the oddly specific spot to tap for the most responsiveness (on the bottom seam between the band and the screen).<br/><br/>Aesthetically speaking, I have no complaints. The gunmetal grey version is definitely more attractive in my opinion, and the device blends seamlessly into the band, making it look like a minimalistic black bracelet when the screen is inactive. The quick view function is also super useful as a watch.<br/><br/>Battery seems to last three to five days between charges, presumably affected by how often you check the display.
 Easy setup. Easy to use on the app with my phone. I like that it was able to sync to my Weight Watchers app. My one complaint is that it does not accurately record my steps as far as distance. I have repeatedly walked a measured amount of steps and the Fitbit does not record them properly always a little under. I can live with this as I'm not in training for anything but it would be nice if it work properly. I reached out to the manufacturer that I bought it from they said I had to deal with Amazon I have not gotten results from Amazon
 WARNING... Fitbit does not honor their warranty periods unless you purchase the item directly from FitBit.com.<br/><br/>Screens crack (due to heat according to the Fitbit forums).  The connection to the bands are poorly made and will break under regular use.
 I've had this fitbit for just over 1 month now. The tracking is good. I like it. The problem is that the face is badly scratched up. I work a desk job. I don't wear it when doing house work or gardening. I don't go to the gym. I walk, use it to track sleep patterns and my heart rate. I called Fitbit to get some information on warranty. Scratches and cracks are not covered. So this is now $150 toy for my 2 year old grandson. Poor quality. I will never purchase another Fitbit ever. Very disappointed. I gave it 2 stars because it works really well for what I need. But I can't see it through the scratches.
 I decided it was time for me to start getting in shape and walking has always been a good way for me to do this.  As my first time getting a fitness band, I wanted something both cheap and that could do a lot.  This pretty much covers that.  It tracks sleep and HR, and has a nice price.  I've been using it every day for about a month now, and the battery life is very good, and it also is very quick to recharge too.  The only thing I think I may change is to get a full water proof one, but for the most part I am not going to go swimming with this on so can get by with it.
 Although the functions of the Alta HR was made it a good “tracker” for our purposes, withing six months of purchase, one of the two LEDs facing the wrist failed. The “Active Minutes” metric started reporting wildly incorrect numbers. After some discussion, Fitbit Customer service replaced the module under warranty. Oddly, the Customer Service rep logged the failure as a “Battery Failure” although the battery was never mentioned and was performing just fine.<br/><br/>More aggravating, shortly after the replacement Alta HR module was received (with no band), the latch that holds the wristband to the module began failing. (Not the wristband buckle.) The Alta HR would fall off the wrist. When examined closely, it was easy to see that the soft wristband material had severely deteriorated where it mated with the metal module clasp. As the wristband material deteriorated, the joint tolerances opened up and the clasp could no longer secure the wristband. The Fitbit would fall off the wrist. (These wristbands are made to be changeable on the module.) After a discussion that elevated to a Fitbit Customer Service supervisor, this wristband was also replaced under warranty. The replacement wristband is now failing in the same manner.<br/><br/>This is a design failure and a lack of competent materials engineering. The semi-soft wristband material deteriorates and does not hold the tolerances required to secure the strap to the ridgid metal clasp on the module. It appears that Fitbit is still selling this same Alta HR wristband.<br/><br/>All-in-all, poor product design with poor reliability..
 This is the third time I've purchased a fit bit. This one was for my girlfriend. She loves it. It's small and doesn't effect how you work or in her case type. The heart rate function is better than the old ones and the sleep gauge is awesome. My only input would be to request tougher cases. They are getting better than the previous versions, but not tough enough to survive on my wrist, not yet atleast. Keep in mind I live a rugged lifestyle and few watches have survived it. So in conclusion it should survive most situations
 Great product and will the application updates, shows sleep pattern whether you have a light sleep or deep sleep, although not always accurate, but it’s usually 90% accurate. The workout tracker is good as well, as I said, not always accurate, but it gives you an idea of how much you have done and you can set goals for yourself. You have to keep in mind that all of these fitness trackers will never be 100% accurate, therefore, you have to give and take a little, but the point is you can track your progress to a certain extent (about 90%) and if you’re seeing results then it’s doing it’s job.
 I bought this because my Fitbit Charge had to be charged twice a day and was a hassle to sync. This model has a much better battery charger attachment, holds a charge for several days, and syncs immediately to my iPhone 6. The strap is very comfortable. The heart rate monitor seems to be reasonably accurate. I like the numerous choice of screen views.
 I am small and petite so I choose a small and fits great. It can also fit a medium wrist but the face would not feel right and it would be a tight fit so best do large. The with is not as noticeable and feels comfortable on my wrist in both locations that are used for work out and everyday use. I wore mine to bed first day and did not notice it. I did ware up above my wrist as it instructs and it felt just fine.  The readings are informative and clear and there are plenty of options on the app to support your health journey. I purchased the black simple look and the band does not irritate or itches just feels smooth and unnoticeable. It will take some time to get just to the feel of the slight pressure but with the charging and cleaning it wont feel as much as the first time. Once you are done with the set up as per instructions you will be able to use all the functions and thus far all work including the text and call ID which is nice not to have to take out the cell for call all the time. I would recommend this to a friend or purchase for a family member. I will check in at month 3 for and update.
 Very inaccurate. Pulse  usually reads 10-15 bpm slower than it actually is (I'm an RN, I know how to take a pulse.) Apparently only picks up an exercise session when it feels like it. I see on the website that a number of other Fitbit Alta HR owners have the same issue with it not tracking exercise and they're told to restart their fitbit then it works for a little while. Seriously? As much as these things cost they ought to do what they say they will do. Waste of money.
 It looks beautiful, very sleek. However I ended up returning it to amazon. The display would not light up easily, had to literally shake your arm. If you tapped the display, again had to tap hard. It would lose sync with the phone . very disappointed .
 This is my first Fitbit and I wanted to like it so much, but was disappointed that it does not track my steps accurately. I bought my children Trendy Pro (way cheaper) and it actually worked better when I compared the two. Sometimes double tapping the Alta does not turn the screen on. Heart rate was also in accurate.  I will never purchase another Fitbit.
 I purchased the Fitbit Charge HR about 18 months ago and wore it every day. Recently the band tore away from the joint where the band attaches to the display. I super-glued the band back on, but I decided I could justify purchasing a new tracker that has wrist bands that can be changed. I bought the Alta HR and have worn it for four days. I'm very happy with it so far.<br/><br/>Things I like: Besides the interchangeable wrist bands and slim design, I appreciate being able to see how much battery life I have left by tapping on the display. I don't think the Charge HR had that feature. After 4 days I have half battery left, which is better than my Charge HR. I like the fun nudges I get when I have been sedentary too long. I like the choice of vertical or horizontal display. I like the text notifications because I don't always hear my phone when I get a text. It does not track stairs which is okay with me. The tap feature to turn it on seems a little finicky. While I had no complaints about the Charge HR except for the band tearing, I think I'll enjoy the Alta HR much more.
 This Alta HR was purchased  in November 2017. It has stopped working as in dead. It will not charge or come on. If I do connect the charger it gets warm.  Fitbit customer support is very poor , i tried talking to them but it was hard understanding.  They were talking from central America .  I have a Fitbit Alta also it to is giving problems.
 I love the Fitbit itself. Step count is very helpful. Sleep statistics are helpful .  I like the fact it syncs with my Smartphone.  My chief complaint is that for the XL size band, the band cracks on the inside with the slightest pressure.  Once it cracks, the band may fall off at any time and you risk losing it.<br/>I have had the band crack four times in under a year.  Fitbit has honored their warranty each time.  But what am I to do when the warranty expires?  Replacement XL bands do not seem to be easily available. Several sellers say "out of stock." So I have ordered an extension and hope that will enable me to use a less expensive regular band.  The XL bands when listed are priced at around $30. I hope someone designs a more durable replacement band.  Metal parts instead of plastic would fix the problem.
 I love this Fitbit. Works well. Super motivating. I love seeing my heart rate data. Challenges with friends are really fun! Sleep data is great too. Ultimately, I had to return this because the band gives me a rash. I’m so sad because I love the exercise tracking. I tried another band or two from other retailers. They didn’t give me rashes but they didn’t work well either. If you don’t have a problem with skin irritation, you will love this product!
 So I bought this for my mom for Christmas and it's been working fine until a couple of weeks ago. It went dead and will not charge. We've tried all kinds of different plugs but nothing. It's very disappointing to have it go bad so quickly. it's not been exposed to water or heat. Is there a known problem with the charger?
 I took a star off because to sync to a desktop computer running Windows 7, you need a fitbit compatible usb dongle. You would think they would include one in the box but it doesn't and isn't mentioned in the description of the product that I could see.<br/> I purchased one of these<br/> <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Geniune-OEM-Authentic-Bluetooth-Dongle-Wireless-Sync-USB-for-Fitbit-Charge-HR-Smart-Wristband-Bulk-Packagng/dp/B01G7HYF3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Geniune OEM Authentic Bluetooth Dongle Wireless Sync USB for Fitbit Charge HR Smart Wristband -  Bulk Packagng</a>]<br/>I gave this fitbit to someone as a gift and now they have to wait a couple more days before they can sync to their computer. I was able to sync to a phone and a tablet and the features I'm still getting used to but it seems like a nice device.
 I love it! I wish they offered a purple one since I like the fitband brand bands better than all the off brand ones I found. The small size is perfect for me and there isn't a ton of extra band sticking out. I like how there is a tab that goes in the holes on the band to hold it in place better.  I like that the charger sort of clips in. This stays on better than the charge one I had. I also prefer the thinner size. It works great with my phone and the bands are easy to change.
 Overall I like the Alta HR, just a couple of minor issues. 1- the battery life is barely 6days vs. advertised duration of 7 days. 2- The watch is thicker than I expected, but it is narrow which I like. Other items, the notifications will disappear after you check them out, its slow to synchronize with my iPhone, and sometimes it won't synchronize up properly. Otherwise it does what I need it to.
 I knew I would be less likely to wear the wider band of the Charge 2 and was willing to give up the couple of capabilities to get the slender fit of the Alta HR. The summary screen gives me a quick view of my steps, exercise, water, sleep and pulse and it's very easy to use. I appreciate the extended guiding information on line as well. It is true that the pulse rate zeros out at times during my aerobics class and I wish it didn't and sometimes it drops some of my steps. But in general, it has put me on a much easier way to start into better health, track it and easily improve it in increments. I paired it with the pack of Konikit 10 color accessory bands which makes the Fit Bit much more like jewelry and less like sports equipment. The sleep tracking element was an eye opener to the amount and kind of sleep I get. I've only had it a month but I am very happy with it.
 I love it!  When I had my old Charge HR my one complaint was that I wished it was smaller.  The Alta HR is a sleeker upgrade and you have the ability to change the band out which is a great feature!  I would highly recommend this product.
 The fitbit and the app are good. My main complaint is about the wristband. It broke after only 6 momths of usage. And it broke the most terrible way possible, which would cost you a fitbit.. First the clip on the wristband connecting to the fitbit randomly went loss then it became impossible to attach. I was lucky that it went loss and fell off when I was taking off my coat at home. Otherwise I could have lost it somewhere outside. Actually this is my second fitbit; the first one got lost because of the same issue! Definitely a terrible design flaw. Also a side note, like the other reviews mentioned, it gets dirty very easily and there is no way to clean it up.
 I really want to love this Fitbit Alta HR. There are a lot of things going for it, continuous HR monitor, Sleep monitor/analysis but the one reason I bought it for, it failed miserably. That is the tracking workout. It supposed to AUTOMATICALLY track the workout but 1 out of 10 days I wore, only 1 day that it tracked it appropriately. The rest, it either not detect any workout or detect only partial section. It captured all the active time but i want to know the detail HR during the workout. ONLY IF there is a function that we can start and stop the workout tracking, this would be a perfect fitness band. If you care about that like I do, don't get it. I returned
 I've had this Fitbit for about a month, and I really do like it. I had the old Fitbit Charge without the HR for the past two years, so this is definitely a step-up. The HR is great and tracks everything. It knows every activity I do. It knows when I run, or just walk. I went on a stationary bike yesterday, and it didn't track anything, which bummed me out. But, all the other features are great. I also love the sleep tracking that shows me the different sleep stages. The Charge didn't do that, so I'm still intrigued with it every day that I wake up and see how I slept the night before. I would recommend.
 I am a hair stylist and this Fitbit counts my hand motions as "steps". When I found that out I was extremely disappointed, as I would have really wanted to keep track of my steps and reach for that daily 10,000 step goal. It's misleading and all over the place. I also had to buy another charger too because the one that came with it originally stopped charging. Now I'm using it, mainly just to track my sleep pattern. Would I buy this again? NO.
 It does count steps and track heart rate as expected. I’ve only had it for less than a year and the inner part of the wrist strap broke and the Fitbit fell off my wrist. Luckily it happened inside my sleeve and didn’t get lost but I don’t know why it would have broken. I’m expecting a higher quality for the price that you pay!  Upon inspection the plastic on the left side of the strap where it locks onto the Fitbit is broken. Disappointed!
 I purchased the Alta HR fitbit to replace an older clip-on model of Fitbit that no longer worked after approximately 3 years of use.  I wanted the additional capabilities included in the HR model that tracks heart rate and shows the time.  The heart rate tracking is beneficial and seems to track accurately.  The battery seems to require charging more often that the older model I owned.  It does not last more than 4-5 days.  Otherwise, I am happy with the Alta HR model so far.
 I've now gone through two of these devices.  Same problem with both of them.<br/><br/>The first, I was jogging and it started to rain.  I didn't think much of it, because I was only a few minutes from home.  Time in light rain: ~5 minutes. The screen began flashing between the time and battery screens.  I tried plugging it in overnight, the "rice trick", etc.  Nothing helped, dead device.  I called amazon and told them about it, and that I didn't submerge the thing, or even get that much water on it.  They were fantastic, and sent another right away.<br/><br/>The second one, I wore in a 10k on Tuesday.  It rained again, for probably less than a minute, but since I had the above experience, I took it off and placed it in my pocket the second it started raining.  But too late, apparently, because a few hours later the fitbit wouldn't turn on.<br/><br/>Now it's completely possible this is my own fault.  That I just need to never wear it when there is any possibility it will every get a drop of water on it.  I could also concede that maybe it wasn't the rain, but maybe it was the amount of sweat I was generating (it was in the 90s during the race).  But I can't help think that a fitness tracker should be more robust than this is.  If I can't track my HR while I run, the exact reason I wanted this version, then it's useless to me.
 Pink band turned black after about an hour. I guess color transfer. They sent me a new darker band but I wanted the pink.
 Bought this for my wife to replace her aging original FitBit.  She LOVES it.  The heart monitor is the big feature, along with the clock, which neither were on her old FitBit. Comes with a much better band, having improved over time. Looks more durable. The charger is ALOT different. It is a butterfly clamp that you place over the back of the FitBit when it is not being worn. Works well.
 The Fitbit Alta has been helping me achieve my weight loss and fitness goals! Things I like:<br/>- I can sync my activity to Myfitnesspal to keep track of daily calories.<br/>- Hourly reminders to move.<br/>- Sync with your phone to receive text messages to your Fitbit.<br/>- Heart rate monitor.<br/>- Monitors sleep quality.<br/>- Can set alarms for bed time and wake time.<br/>- Slim, sleek, modern design with interchangeable wrist bands to dress up or down.<br/><br/>There's really nothing about it that I don't like. My whole family has Fitbits now and we love them!
 Loving this Fitbit!  My kids encouraged me to get this.  I had previously used my phone to track steps but always found a reason to put it<br/>down or not have a pocket. I like the way that the FB  reminds me to get up and move!  I am getting used to the band and wish that I did not have to tap so many times on the face of the Fitbit to get the display to show.  I have successfully synced the device to my phone and an please with the "extras" that are in the app itself.  Just what I need to start the New Year.
 I purchased this Fitbit to replace an old one that had dies after a year of use. I wear it daily but I would say o am pretty easy on it. Had this product 3 months and it stopped working. The screen constantly flashes from battery to steps etc and is unresponsive to resetting it. Contacted Fitbit customer service to see if it can be replaced under warranty.  Supposedly they will replace it after I fill out a form they email me... should have saved up and gone w the iwatch.
 Gave this to my mother for Mother's day this year and she loved it!  Her first fitbit had stopped working so she really missed having one to keep up with her steps. She liked the slimmer part of the Alta although it's not as easy to read like the Charge 2 is.  I wish this model also had a push button on the side like the Charge 2 does as the tapping on the screen is not as easy to do as they say.  I did remember reading that on the reviews but my Mother wanted a smaller fitbit so this was the better option.
 I had a Charge HR before, and it stopped charging. So I decided to go with this one.<br/>Pros: I like the charger has a clip so it stays on better. A con that it is harder to see where the pins go in, probably will get used to that. The charging cord is also longer, maybe a foot or so. I swear the charging cord on the Charge HR was like 6 inches or less; it kept falling out.<br/>Con: No flight counter, which I miss a little but not a big deal.
 I was very disappointed.  First, the heart rate monitor is totally unreliable.  I compared Fitbits readout with an over-the-finger monitor and a chest monitor.  Fitbit was regularly inaccurate.  Often by more than 100 bpm.  Second, they failed to include a sensor on the unit to adjust the displays brightness with changes in light.  Apparently they think one brightness fits all.  Indoors, the display is easily readable, but outside the display is totally unreadable.  While in a darkened room, like a theater, prepare to have your wrist illuminate like a beacon.  So bottom line is that this unit is useable only in a moderately lit room.
 I previously had fitbit charge HR that lasted 2 years and broke.  I bought this as a replacement.  I like that the fitbit alta is thinner.  I bought the small and am on the third tightest hole.  With my previous small fitbit I was on the second largest hole, so there is some discrepency in sizing.  The touch screen doesn't always register when I tap to turn it on.  This is one reason I like the charge HR better.  It had a button so you didn't need to rely on tapping, which doesn't always work.  I also miss being able to time my workouts from my fitbit.  Now I have to go into the app to record them which requires me to remember exactly when I started and stopped my workout.  So overall I like the alta, but there could be improvements to it.
 I loved my Fitbit, up until today. I needed something under $100, and this fit the bill. I bought mine on July 10, 2018 and as of April 7,2019, it won’t charge or work. I noticed when I woke up today that there was a black line on top, going through the time, and on the bottom numbers of the time too. I checked the battery, I had half left, then ~ 2 hours later, it wouldn’t light up at all, but according to the app, it was still counting my steps. Some time in the hour after that The battery died completely and it won’t charge at all.
 Really like this Fitbit! I went from a Flex2 to this because I wanted the Heart Rate function, thus the HR in the name. I don't use it as my watch but just like my Fitbit and the battery lasts me a whole week. My only complaint was that the band it's not the best but found another one that I liked, the magnetic kind, and now it's perfect.
 I got this for my wife as a present, and she really likes it.  Her favorite feature is the sleep monitoring, and she also likes how it tells her who is calling on her phone, if the phone is not immediately close by.<br/>The 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes the fit bit doesn't charge.  I think this is because of the way the charger attaches, and it's easy to think you have it connected when you don't.  The charger works, you just have to be very careful when connecting it.
 I really like the new features on this fitbit, but the band started coming off regularly after 3 months and now (4 months in) it comes off at least 5 times a day.  NOT AT ALL DURABLE which is important for a fitness tracker!
 I was so excited to get this Fitbit having never had one.  I was most interested in tracking sleep and calorie burn.  Neither is accurate.  The sleep is interesting but some nights Fitbit missed hours.....like it tells me I only slept 4 and I slept somewhere around 7 or 8.  Also I do excercise classes and often it only shows 9 or 10 minutes of excercise .  One time I did a cardio class outdoors - we were sprinting for 30 minutes and it said 0 minutes.  If it’s not tracking that then the calorie burn it shows is useless.  Waste of money!
 I had a Charge 2 before this, but it died. I wanted to wait to get the Charge 3 but I was in a Stepbet and needed something sooner, so I got this. Overall I like this Fitbit, but I wish it had more features for tracking workouts like the charge. But at the end of the day it tracks my steps well and looks good, so i'm happy. Next time however, I will probably get a Charge 3 or a Versa, unless there's something new out by the time I need a new Fitbit again.
 I have owned three fitbits in the past, with the most recent being the fitbit Alta HR.  Oddly, every single one of them seems to malfunction and stop working altogether after ONE YEAR (conveniently for Fitbit, just after expiration of the one year warranty).  This pattern seems to be overwhelmingly attributable to many other consumers like myself.  Intent? possibly, but constructive intent to defraud consumers to purchase a product that is line to be defective after the warranty expires may very well be a legal cause of action, including  significant monetary damages down the road.<br/><br/>I'm sick of this and then pigeon holing me to purchase a new product at a discount is just absurd.<br/><br/>Don't know about you guys, but I'm reporting to consumer affairs.  Will I prep and file a lawsuit?  Maybe.  *thumbing through UCC and Business Codes.  Hope fitbit has strong trial attorneys, cause I go all the way.
 Lousy. Would not synch with my phone or my computer.
 For the price of this product it does not keep accurate information, especially the number of steps. I have had problems since I got it. I have tried the suggestions from the Fitbit  at community various times. It corrects for a few days then resumes with inaccurate  steps. I walk at 3.2 miles on my treadmill at 125 steps per minute, for 60 mins. Instead of 7500 steps my Fitbit reads 5239. I do not recommend this product.
 I like the constant heart rate monitor. The steps seem fairly accurate. The band is small enough that it doesn't bother me. (I don't like to wear bracelets.) Even when I type it doesn't get in the way like some of the other larger fitness watches.
 Haven't had this but a few days, but so far very impressed with it.  Appearance and comfort are both positives.  It isn't too big or chunky, which is something I figured would make me wear it less.  Seems to be very accurate on heart rate, based on rates I recall when monitoring with a polar or garmin strap.  Love all the other features such as entering food, breakdown of mets, etc.  And, of course, love seeing my steps and calories burned.  Handy to see messages and phone calls coming in and also good motivator.
 Great tracker. Tracks steps, distance, heart rate, sleep, automatically starts tracking (which is the reason I swapped to this over my old garmin) and water resistant  BUT it will count some arm movements that bump your arm for example...trying on clothes. I got 10,000 steps trying on clothes cleaning out my closet! I'm disappointed I did not want a cheating tracker! Otherwise I've been happy with it.
 I’ve had the FitBit Zip, Flex, Charge HR and now Alta HR. This is by far my favorite. I love that I can change the bands and that it alerts me to messages and calls. One thing I miss about the Charge is the button to track an exercise. The Alta isn’t great about tracking my circuit running so I don’t ever know full calorie burn for my entire workout unless I run OR walk the entire time.
 I love the continuous heart rate! But I can barely get the screen to turn on by tapping. Why isn't it touch sensitive like others? And seriously not waterproof?? It's sealed, waterproof it!<br/><br/>And the settings are weird. What's greeting? Why are some settings only on the web? I thought fitbit would be perfected by now, I can't imagine what the past years were like! I do love my aria tho and trusted fitbit with alta hr. I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Ps. You seriously make me pay $30 more for black sides? That's insane.
 I couldn't even set up the Fitbit every time I tried to update the firmware it would give me an error message half way though and do that for an hour before it gave up look for solutions all day couldn't find any fixes so I returned it very disappointed
 Arrived, I took it out of the box, plugged it in, and spent like 4 hours trying to set it up. I exhausted all troubleshooting options with Fitbit support, and the verdict was that my brand new Fitbit, fresh out of the box, was already somehow unfixably broken. The customer service rep told me I was in luck because it was still under warranty (yeah it's been under half a day, I should freaking hope so...) So I can get a replacement. Lol thanks. Hope the next one works and it's not another massive waste of my time.
 I really enjoy my Fitbit Alta HR. I like that it keeps track of my sleep most of all because I have sleep apnea and knowing how I sleep is important to me and will be to my doctor as well. I only wish it kept track of my oxygen levels as well because that is a concern as well. I can't walk as much as I should for other reasons but walking as much as I do is still important.
 Love the slim design and most features. However, the heart rate monitor portion is very inconsistent during workouts. Reads very low or stops working, even though I have the monitor strapped tightly to my wrist (as per the Fitbit instructions). Since the the HR feature was the main reason I purchased this, I have to return it.
 Terrible. The glass spontaneously developed a crack even though it was never damaged or abused. Many, many people have had the same issue and it seems like the glass used is poor quality. Fitbit themselves tells their customers "too bad" and refused to help at all. Its barely over two months old but Fitbit doesn't care.
 Bought it in September and it already broke. I bought several different chargers hoping that was the problem but nope. It’s not the charger, it’s just bad quality. $120 and it didn’t  even last 6 months... I’m so disappointed
 I bought this fitbit end of June 2017 so I had definitely enough time to make mind about this product. At first it was great and then the wristband broke after just a few months. Fitbit finally decided to send me a new one for free so I decided to continue my adventure with my fitbit. And then I could not update it anymore (from computer or mobiles phones). I tried all options even trying with device which were updating successfully other fitbits. No success. I was also not able to upload my statistics every week anymore but I was still able to check my steps number every day<br/>(bit expensive for a step counter would you say). Finally, the battery does not hold anymore. After trying everything possible, I finally contacted the fitbit support. All they could offer me is 25 % off a new fitbit... Why would someone spend that kind of money in products which clearly fail ? In conclusion, fitbit will be great the first three months and then you will regret every dollars you spent.
 1st off, I have been trying to lose weight for a while and have tried a lot of health methods but did not work. Did not know that it would be this hard for middle-aged people like me to lose wight. My weight used to come off like butter, not anymore. Fitbit helped me stayed in touch with my daily activities and made me more aware. I can monitor my steps easily and charge battery (NOT on a daily basis) easily. It even track my sleep! You know, if you are deprived of sleep you are more likely to eat more. So, all and all, I love it!
 I am using this all the time. I track my food, my sleep, my exercise.  It helps me to stay in line. I was surprised at the sleep part. That encourages me to sleep better.
 I bought the Fitbit Alta HR because it detects and records both heart rate and sleep patterns. Now it randomly does not record my sleep unless I reset several times. Also, when working out, even if I get the tiniest bit sweaty (normal, right?) the heart rate display doesn’t work. I have to wipe my wrist dry, then it works for a short while. Also, I hike a lot and the display is hard to see in bright light.<br/><br/>Pros: The app gives me lots of interesting information, esp. about my sleep patterns. It’s also nice to see the differences in my heart rate during different types of exercise. The step counter and reminders to move are great incentives for me.<br/><br/>Would I buy this knowing what I know now? Probably, it’s just frustrating dealing with technology sometimes!
 I originally had the Fitbit Charge I used for a couple of years even got a replacement from the company when mine had broke when I had emergency surgery. I debated for a long time if I wanted to get a Fitbit Alta HR or the Fitbit Charge 2. I am very happy I decided on the Fitbit Alta HR. It does everything I needed and more than I expected. It is slimmer and more comfortable than my Fitbit Charge.
 Really wanted this to work but I gave up when sleeps cycles only registered every other time. To make it work better, I read online that some would tie the wrist band a little tighter. I tried , it improved but not that much. Was definitely less confortable. I also did not find the band that comfortable.<br/>Used an UP2 for over a year (this worked well and was comfy but totally let down by the lack of durability of the wrist band). Happy to try a future/improved model if Fitbit looks for testers.
 I bought this over the Alta because I wanted a heart rate monitor on my wrist.  This looked like a good option and seemed to have good reviews.  The runner up was the Garmin Vivosmart 3.<br/><br/>Well, the heart rate monitor is highly inaccurate.  It would not go above 120 when I was really pushing cardio (I'm 53, my cardio rate should be at least 130-140 when I'm sweating).  This made me thing, huh, why again did I buy this over just a plain old Alta??<br/><br/>I went and also purchased a Garmin Vivosmart 3.  It's HR is not perfect, but it does accurately track my cardio workouts.  It's maybe a touch larger and doesn't have interchangeable bands.  But it works!<br/><br/>I've returned the Alta HR.
 I resisted the Alta. I had the Zip clip for years. Then I had a smart watch. I really disliked the large watch. I shouldn't have been so stubborn. The Alta is a much more functional tool than the Zip, provides time, steps, heart rate, sleep, etc. in a discreet package, unlike the watches. It can also tell you who is calling or texting. I thought I'd hate the "motivation" messages to move but I find them useful. Since I got this three weeks ago my steps have increased 30%.
 I like the band for the Alta HR. It seems more secure. I don't have the Alta to compare it to. You can adjust the setting to get alerts when you have calls and text messages. The text message will display only once when it was first received. If the message is long it won't display the whole message.
 I had my fitbit Alta HR for 10 months and all of the sudden it wouldn't sync with my phone or pc anymore.  I tried all the steps to fix it and finally gave up and called for tech support.  They listened to the problem and said I had done all the steps they would have recommended so instead of making me jump a million hoops, they are sending me a replacement!  No fuss or hassle!  Thank you so much!
 Only worked for 6 months. It will no longer sync or pair with any device. The only reason I picked Fitbit over over trackers is the ease of receiving notifications. Without it syncing that doesn't work. I now have a $100 paper weight. What waste.
 As a gift for my wife, who doesn't like too much fiddling with gadgets, this worked well. After some trial and error, she got the hang of it and how it responded to her activities. I did the presets with connecting to her phone via the app and some display settings, but that was about it. She's wowed by how many steps she takes in a day and that's a great motivational tool.
 I’m really bummed I had to send it back. I really use it to monitor my health rate and sleep. I hate that you can’t see more in details such as what you’re rate was at a specific time. It only gives you a line graph. What did it for me was that I’m a sweaty person and there were many times it was reading my heart rate. Very frustrating.<br/>Ideal for non-sweating people.<br/><br/>Yo I returned my item a long time ago and still haven’t gotten my refund and there’s no way to contact these people.
 I love my ALTA, I've had the Charge versions of the fitbit, but absolutely love the narrower band and the fact that they can be changed out.  I also like that I can read my text messages when they come in along with the caller ID.  Miss the floors option but not really a deal breaker for me.
 It didn't work.  I felt no vibration and saw no battery light, nothing at all.  I tried multiple USB ports, both direct to computer and to a power strip.  I wiggled it extensively to ensure the power connection mated properly with the watch.  From googling, I believe this problem is not uncommon.  Neither Fitbit nor Amazon offers to send me a replacement unit.  Fitbit offers to swap either the power cord or the band and then to swap the other if the first swap fails.  I don't want to spend a month troubleshooting this piecemeal, so I'll return it via UPS and accept Amazon's refund.  I'm researching "Fitbit alternatives."
 I kept losing my Fitbit One so I thought if I had something on my wrist, it’d be better off so purchased the Alta HR. I’ve since found my Fitbit One (for the second time!) &amp; was using both. The Alta HR seems to give me more steps than the FB One but the biggest bugaboo is that the Alta HR has twice stopped syncing with my phone which means it doesn’t record my steps in the app. I’ve had to call customer service twice &amp; go through all the gyrations to get it back on track. Needless to say, I’m back to just using my Fitbit One.
 I'm not aiming for steps in a day. I really was just looking for something to track my heart rate and calories expended. This does those things. I have had the frustration others experienced with the heart rate sometimes not registering during exercising. I've tried tighting and moving it, which only seems to make it worse. However, it's usually just a moment that it doesn't register and then it comes back. I love the silent alarm feature. I like that this also tracks my sleep - that has been enlightening for me.
 I have been contemplating getting a fitness tracker for about a year and I loved the look of the Fitbit Alta, but I really wanted a heart rate tracker. I was leaning more toward the Apple Watch 2 but the price scared me away. Then I happened up the Alta HR and I was ecstatic.<br/><br/>I have had my Fitbit for about 2 weeks now and I have enjoyed it a lot. It is comfortable and after wearing it for a day I hardly noticed it. The band has nice detailing and the blue/grey color is beautiful. The display is crisp, and through the easy-to-use app you can chose from a variety of displays.  Goals can be personalized and it is great to be able to easily track daily steps, heart rate, distance traveled, calories burned, sleep and exercise (or active minute). Battery life appears to last for 3-5 days, though I have only had it for 2 weeks so I will be observing this. Over all I am very happy with my purchase!
 I've had mine for several months now and I only take it off to shower and to clean it. I LOVE this thing. I have become more active since buying it, and I love the sleep tracking feature. I occasionally have issues with slow syncing and it connecting to my phone for calls and texts, but it only takes refreshing the app to sync it up again and it's as good as new. Honestly, this thing has been  one of my favorite purchases yet...I was so worried I'd regret it, but no way!
 Cannot see the numbers at all in bright daylight.  After I purchased the Fitbit, I read reviews that others have this same complaint.  When I called the company, they said they have not had any issues with the Fitbit numbers not being able to be seen in daylight and said mine must of been defective.  They also said the brightness cannot be adjusted.  They sent me another one but that one is exactly the same.  It is obviously a flaw with the Alta HR Fitbit.
 Does everything I wanted and more, and it just looks great!  It's comfortable to wear, the only time I take it off is every 5 days or so to charge it for a couple hours.  Knowing that I'm monitoring my steps has made me walk more as I look for every opportunity to increase my number of steps everyday.  The heart monitor works well and is very accurate as I tested it against my Polar chest strap heart monitor and the Altra HR readings were within 2-5 beats of the chest strap monitor.  No more chest strap for me!!  And the Fitbit Ap is great!  I've joined several of my friends on the Ap and we are able to see each others daily steps so it creates a little fun competition, all leading to more steps and more calories burned!
 I'm happy with my purchase. I had tried a much cheaper fitness tracker and decided to upgrade and am glad I did. The device seems to be accurate, and the app is user friendly and syncs with pretty much everything. The band is comfortable and it is easy to charge. My wrist measured right on the line between medium and large. I bought the large and it fits well, I wear it on the third notch, the medium probably would have worked too but I'm happy with the large.
 haven't had any problems so far.  Works well.  Battery lasts about a week slim fit on my wrist and comfortable to wear all day and night while sleeping.  Interesting to have the stats, I've been enjoying the sleep stats
 When the customer purchases A Fitbit no matter which model, There should be A box to check for English or Spanish or French etc. Because there is to much different Languages on the Package and it's VERY confusing to read through. So by Selecting the right Language would make more sense. Also there should be A USB PLUGIN FOR HOME OUTLET. OTHER THAN THAT IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT.
 Don’t waste your time. I bought this in August 2018 and by December the active minutes and calories functionality had stopped working. Customer service can’t help because it’s a product bug their engineering team is trying to fix (they won’t share any other details or timeline). They also wouldn’t send me a replacement. I’ll be switching to the Apple Watch unfortunately. I had enjoyed FitBit until now but I can’t just “make it work” while they figure out a solution to their problems (what CS told me to do). What a shame
 Pros:  Battery seems to go for about a week, the app keeps meticulous notes when the device syncs, and you can easily read texts at work (I'm teaching, so I generally can't just whip my phone out!) or see who's calling even on silent mode.  Reads you as you sleep to estimate your levels of sleep!<br/><br/>Cons:  It's an accelerometer, not a touch screen -- you have to tap the thing like you're bonking it to switch screens (which becomes second nature.)  The move-every-hour thing can be really annoying until you squelch it.  It doesn't play with Apple Health without third party apps, if you want that.  Some activities that don't move the device or cause a lot of jolts will misread on the device for steps.  (Like walking with a cart in a grocery store)
 This is my second fitbit.  The first was a Flex and I used it for 3 years; until it failed to hold a battery charge. I've only had this one 3 days so maybe a review is premature, but to this point I LOVE IT!  Like the other one, I use it for accountability in meeting my health goals, but this one adds in a lot of "fun" with it's little subtle reminders, like "feed me 153 steps", "easy peasy", etc.  The text message and phone call notifications are a bonus!  I've not owned another brand of this nature to compare it to; there was never a need!
 Incredibly inconsistent with heart rate. I bought this to know when I am in my peak zone during steady state cardio and it is extemely inaccurate, saying that I am in resting heart rate below 100 bpm when I know that I am well into the 170bpm from checking my pulse. Not accurate for sleep either in that it often says I am asleep when I have been lying awake in bed. Pedometer seems decent but how can I trust it when the other functions are so inaccurate? Fix your product, Fitbit, or at least offer a chest strap add on so athletes are not reliable on your inaccurate readings. Do not buy.
 I've had multiple fitbits.. this one is my favorite so far.. great color nice size for a girl
 The product does everything it says it does however it did not always read my heart rate and it left a good divet in my arm I have not worn it for two months now and the debit is still there and I’m afraid that it is permanent I’m not really sure who to contact for help I’ve tried calling the fit bit company to return this item but it seems like nobody can help me so I’m stuck with an item I cannot use
 I love the look of this tracker and all of the updated features.  The only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars is the silent alarm.  I'm used the the alarm vibration on my old Fitbit Charge actually waking me up when it goes off in the morning.  The Alta HR doesn't wake me up at all.  It vibrates so softly, it doesn't wake me up and I can even barely feel it when I'm awake.  I hope Fitbit fixes that either with a firmware update or in the next generation of device.
 I love the look but don’t find this, or the software, as accurate as my prior $25 activity tracker. If you move your arm a lot it counts steps but if you step a lot without moving your arm (holding something) is doesn’t count steps and doesn’t seem to count bicycling either. If I get up during the night it thinks I’ve ended my sleep cycle so I rarely get accurate sleep readings, which is a primary concern for me.
 I loved this Fitbit! I bought it in March and used it every chance I could. I would remove it before doing dishes or taking a shower. During workouts I would pause to dry it from sweat, then remove it after the workout to dry completely. Well it’s now August and my Fitbit died. I’m so upset because I’m gearing up for a half marathon without my tool. It was fun while it lasted.
 I love the fitbit but the sizing seems off.  I'm on the border of small/large so I ordered the large, the band is so big, I use all but two of the holes in the band.  If your wrist is on the higher size of small, I would recommend ordering the small and see if it fits.  The large is definitely too big.
 If you wear this device for fitness mainly, it is probably ok. If you have a chronic illness or sleep disorder and need it for sleep tracking, don't buy this one. I have had the Fitbit flex, the Fitbit charge HR and now the Alta. The Charge HR doesn't have details on the stages of sleep, but at least it knows when you are awake. The Alta keeps recording me asleep in light or R.E.M. stages when I am awake and even out of bed and walking. Adjustments to settings and wearing tighter on my wrist as suggested was not helpful. Technical support then suggested keeping my phone near my Fitbit at night. I don't keep my phone on, much less in my bedroom at night, and there is no way that is going to happen. Fitbit did not allow an exchange, even though the Charge HR is less expensive. The best they could do was offer 50% off on a new Fitbit. Needless to say that Alta was the last Fitbit I will ever own, and I tell everyone I know not to buy their products.
 Love it. It's easy to use and keeps track of my steps and sleep. It was a little hard to get used to sleeping in, but it only took a little over a week to get over that. It connects fine with my Samsung S7, although I wish it worked with the Samsung Health app as well. I love the color but plan on getting other bands to go with anything.
 Update: I have to change my review I bought this in May and the straps for some reason will not remain attached  to my screen. It was five months in that it happened. I can not wear my Fitbit any more. I tried buying new straps thinking that may be the issue  but it keeps unclasping.<br/><br/>So it works great and with my small wrist I love that it doesn't take up half my arm but still tell the time. Don't do this I think I was lucky And it was an accident, but i accidentally tossed it in the wash and dryer with a load and it still works perfectly! Talk about durable.
 I bought this as a gift for my mom, and she absolutely loves it. She was having heart palpitations for a few months, wasn't feeling great on medicine, hated having to go to the Dr for monitoring, but now that she has her own way to mostly monitor what they see with their monitor, she's more aware of why she's not feeling great that day, or if she just needs to be more active. It took some time to get used to how far off the wrist it sits, but when there aren't sleeves to wear, it's perfect.
 I have previously owned the Fitbit Zip which worked perfectly for years.  When it finally died, I decided to upgrade to the Alta HR because it includes a heart rate monitor.  The Alta HR has been a big disappointment.  You need to tap it to get the display to turn on.  Mine is unresponsive a good deal of the time--it takes numerous taps to get it going.  Once the display is on, you need to tap it again to get through the various readings (heart rate, steps walked, miles, etc.)  Again, it is difficult to get it to work.  Also, the display is not visible in sunlight.  The major problem, however, is that the heart rate readings are totally off.  For example, it has given me a rate of 105, but when I take my pulse at the same time it is actually 67!  This was not just a fluke--the readings have been wrong most of the time.
 I can't help but love my Alta HR! It looks great and I feel like it works great too. Sometimes when I am grocery shopping and holding on to the shopping cart it doesn't track my steps correctly. Otherwise I am thrilled with it and Fitbit customer service deserves high praise! I had an issue with the band of my Fitbit a few months after I purchased it and the rep was SO friendly and replaced it immediately. Amazing company that has me as a loyal customer.
 I like this tracker. It has a lot of functionality and the battery lasts for a long time! I bought it over the summer but like other reviews say, the plastic band is so unbelieveably cheap. The plastic connection to the hardware to the top end of the device basically disintegrated and chipped off in little pieces within a week of wearing it. I contacted Amazon and they told me to send back the entire device for a replacement. It arrived quickly however, it didn't solve the issue of the poor quality band as it broke AGAIN in the same place within a week of wear. I bought a third party plastic replacement band which also broke so I finally got one of the mesh magnetic bands for $9 and it's stayed on for the past month without any issues. I hope Fitbit fixes this issue for other buyers out there.
 The product was great!  Tracked steps well, lasted 5-7 days on a charge<br/><br/>Then at the 15 month mark, just out of warranty... the battery would no longer take a charge.<br/>And of course if you're out of warranty too bad for you, buy something else.  Here's a discount on stuff, but not our new stuff, only our old stuff.<br/><br/>Seriously?<br/><br/>My old flex 2 is still working fine.  Maybe fitbit should get some better quality testing in place.
 Had a heart incident, and though the heartrate monitor was important. It is reasonably  accurate, enough to let me know I need to go to the ER. The monitor is pretty neat too. I love that it does a dance on my wrist almost every day. I also love having the sleep monitor confirm that I really did (or didn't) get a good night's sleep.
 I cannot describe how much I love my Alta HR.  It has saved me when I had dizzy spells during my bouts with Hypothyroidism.  I really like the heart rate feature and the reminders.  The battery lasts long too.  My Alta HR requires charging once a week, usually on Sundays.  I highly recommend this Fitbit!
 I bought this Fitbit Alta HR to replace my pedometer to keep track of my steps after reading a review that it does not count arm movements. That is totally wrong! It actually does. I became suspicious when the steps logged were a lot more that my previous pedometer, so I experimented. I stood in one place and waved my arm where I had the Fitbit and sure enough all those arm movements were registered as steps. So now I put it in my pocket  to get an accurate reading of steps. It became for me an expensive pedometer.
 The step counter is wildly inaccurate.  I compared it to my pedometer (which I know is accurate).  This morning in 30 minutes my pedometer registered 750 while the Fitbit had 430, and had been used longer.  It causes one to doubt the other functions. I am returning it immediately.
 I just got an Alta HR and was really excited to track my exercises and calories. However, it has been a huge disappointment so far.<br/><br/>I do around 6 hours of Gym every week and the Alta HR cannot detect automatically and there is no option to manually initiate an activity.<br/>After the exercise I can manually log my in the app, but it gives a flat estimation of the calories burned (based on average data of the population of my gender and age), ignoring the data that was generated when I was wearing the tracker. So regardless of whether I did a quick and heart racing circuit training or a slow training, the amount of calories burned is exactly the same. This is ridiculous! If I just want the generic estimation without considering my steps count or heart rate, I could have just written something down on a piece of paper with a pen.<br/><br/>And if I don't manually log the activities, the app reflects that I have not done any exercise all week. I feel like this is a major design fault, and I sincerely hope something can be done to improve this.
 I am getting used to the idea of tracking my health, however, I can't figure out how to convert from steps to cycling. Also the rose gold / pink band is easily stained by denim or anything you are wearing. I have not figured out how to clean it or get the rubbed on colors off.
 I've used this Fitbit Alta HR for over a year now.  Bluetooth connectivity has always been unreliable. I frequently have to stop and restart Bluetooth on my tablet, and all too often I have to remove it from the Fitbit software and let the software re-discover the device.  Also, at 14 months, two months out of warranty the strap started coming loose and I frequently have to re-attach it.  I'll probably live with these problems until the thing quits altogether, but I won't buy another.
 The only feature I was happy with in the step counter.  I've had the fit bit about a year.  It never recorded my sleep pattern  accurately.  That wasn't important, so I let it go Then it started to fall off my wrist after I had it 9 months.  The band would come off the fit bit face.  I suppose I should have done something about it sooner, foolishly I thought it would stop.
 The only things I don't like are the fact that you have to tap the thing or flick your wrist to view the time.  It rarely shows the time when you raise your wrist the first time.  I also wish there was a way either with the Fitbit app or directly with the device to manually start tracking a workout.  It seems like it only begins to recognize a workout when your heart rate elevates.  I am somewhat fit and work out 4 to 5 times a week it takes a little bit to get my heart rate elevated (especially when lifting weights).  I also wonder about the calorie burn number.  It says I burn between 2700 and 3000 calories a day.  However, I only eat about 1800 to 2000 calories a day (I keep track of my calorie intake via My Fitness Pal).  If that were correct, it would seem that I would have a lot less body fat.
 Love my fitbit! The app is so user friendly, and I love checking my stats every day. The Alta HR is so slim, doesn't bother me at all to wear and sleep in. I like the hourly reminders to get my steps in, and I actually really like the phone notifications. I leave my phone on silent all the time, so this helps to ensure I don't miss (as many) texts or phone calls.
 Heart rate monitor was inaccurate.<br/>Didn't maintain syncing very well.<br/>Wouldn't consistently collect data, was very intermittent even after fixing the settings to "always on".<br/>Disabled the alarm and synced it, but the alarm continued to go off.<br/><br/>I was looking for something I could just slap on and have it  start monitoring my vitals. This would require too much messing with the settings for me.
 this thing is great. apparently I burn 5500 calories a day doing my job. the smartphone app is great for a lot of reasons, primarily I like it for tracking my sleep patterns. I don't use it for all of its benefits, I prefer to keep track of my calorie intake myself and don't feel like entering in every single meal, same with water. but the fact that it reads off your text messages, alerts you for phonecalls, measures your heart rate, tracks your footsteps, tracks your sleeping patterns (including phases of sleep), AND is a slim profile watch is very useful. hard recommend if you're trying to do anything with your health.
 stay on It is more girlly but  to tell the time you have to flip your wrist because the light doesn't stay on like  in the Charge HR.  Also it is hard to get to  get to the heart rate and steps taken.
 I'm very happy with this product! It has tracked steps and exercise really well and has a comfortable feel.  I was nervous that the face would be too bulky for my little wrist but, that is not the case.  I would definitely recommend this product!
 I really like the Alta HR. As I've seen in other reviews, swiping/tapping through the screen readout is a little difficult, but I've gotten used to it. The only real CON I've noted is viewing the display while walking outside on a bright day (too little of a contrast with a black screen and white lettering). The Fitbit app is great. All the app features are accurate and useful. I especially like the calorie/food search and tracker, GPS Exercise tracking, Heart Rate monitor, Hourly Activity monitor, and Sleep monitor.
 If you're buying it for the fancy sleep stage reporting, keep looking. Mine worked for the first few weeks, then stopped. Still getting sleep tracking, just not the stages. It tracks hear rate all night as expected just doesn't get the sleep stages. For the minimal sleep tracking, there are cheaper options, even with Fitbit.<br/><br/>Otherwise, it's just fine. Good build quality, easy to wear all day/night, good battery life.
 Love love love!! Stays charged for 7-10 days. Simple charging hookup. Love that it wears like a watch not a bracelet. I prefer not to wear in shower only because I believe anything adds to the life of the watch. Prefer this over Fitbit because if display on band.
 I like it a lot. I think ratings are accurate.  I used a couple of fitness trackers before and I like this one more than others.  The only complaint I have is that the bracelets are very heavy and the rubber one is inflexible and feels too harsh against the wrist.  I prefer softer and lighter materials, especially if I have to wear it day and night.
 It seems premature to write a review, since I've only had my Alta HR for 3 days. However, so far I love it. I purchased my first Fitbit in 2012; it was a Fitbit One. I recently lost it, so decided to upgrade to this model. The fit is very comfortable, and I especially love the subtle blue gray. There are a couple of extra features in this model that I enjoy having, such as the HR monitor and the reminder to move every hour. That helps me tremendously! If you're like me, no matter which Fitbit you choose, you will get very competitive with yourself to increase your daily steps. I'm much more conscious now of my daily movements, which is important for someone who sits behind a computer all day! And logging my meals on the app keeps me in check. Invest in your health!
 I loved my Fitbit Alta HR for 2 months. The  steps no longer sync to my app. After 3 hours with Fitbit Support they told me it would not syn. till app maintenance was complete two months out.<br/><br/>I would recommend a garmin's product.
 I got this Fitbit about 6 months ago. The battery life is supposed to last 7 to 10 days, but lately it hasn't even lasted 2 days. It no longer notifies me when I get phone calls when my phone is on silent. And the app keeps logging me out of the app on my phone so I have to constantly log back in to sync, so it never syncs on its own. Also, why cant I sync this with google play? All other fitness trackers let me... Was good while it was working but the last few months have been disappointing for all the hype. Switching away from FitBit, sorry.
 I bought these as I wanted to integrate more exercise to my lifestyle and needed to track what I’m doing. It helped me realize how little I moved and less calories I was burning when I thought I was pushing my limits. It’s a good motivation to walk and sleep better. The design is very small and light that I mostly forget that I’m wearing it.
 Was able to get it work, except could not receive phone calls or texts on it. Unpaired Fitbit and rebooted phone, now Fitbit will not pair after several attempts.  Tried all suggestions found online and on fitbit help community....would not pair.  Not worth the trouble...returned
 I bought this to replace my husband's old Fitbit and he LOVES this one! Easy to fit, easy to see vital stats with taps on the face too. It's picking up his steps and sleep time very accurately. He likes the thin band and how light it is too. No rashes, no sweating under the band either (he has the recommended fingertip of slack between band and skin).
 This is my 3rd Fitbit, and my absolute favorite!  It has some glitches, like the tap to see the time and such doesn't work as well, but that's a small sacrifice for the ability to swap bands for something way more comfortable and/or trendy.  Plus the slim shape is much more flattering on a woman than other Fitbit products!
 I really like my new fit bit.  Only reason for the four stars, is I think there might be some inconsistency on the step count. If my arm is not moving, if I'm holding my daughter for example, I don't think it gives an accurate step count. Nonetheless I really love the motivation it gives me and the sleep tracker feature is awesome. Got to go get my steps in :)
 I am VERY disappointed with my Alta HR. The wrist band is discolored - looks like the pink has rubbed off and is graying.  What an embarrassment!  I am very reluctant to buy any interchangeable bands.  Why should I have to spend money to fix a bad product?  And the battery does not last nearly as long as claims made.
 My purple Charge HR band was beginning to come apart at the seam so after having worn it for 2 1/2 years I decided to upgrade. I am so happy with my new Alta HR! I love the slim silhouette and I have adjusted to the screen orientation that comes with the slimmer size. I am enjoying the new features such as text message alert and the little encouraging messages to get up and move are good too. I purchased the silver metal color band to switch out when I want to dress it up a bit. So glad I upgraded! The only downside is I thought I would be able to wear my old one when I am playing tennis and sweating and be able to then switch over to the Alta and have the steps etc. be counted, but it doesn't seem to work that way. Other than that I am very satisfied and would highly recommend the Alta!
 When I purchased the Fitbit no where in the description did it mention that it is not compatible with A LOT of phones. It has been 4 days since it has synced to my phone and I can't get any of my calls or texts through it. I could have bought a cheap version if all I wanted was to count steps 😡
 I really like a lot of things about this device, but the first one I got did not track heart rates above 120 beats when exercising and I needed to reset at the charger on most morning because it was failing to sync automatically.  Fitbit sent me a new one by snail mail, but that one's screen was entirely dead.  Fitbit refused to send a replacement until I sent back the dead one.....they unfortunately do not include a box to return the old one when they send you a new one....so a real hassle to send back.  Have been waiting now for about 3 weeks with a failing device.  I think the sleep analysis is really useful and would buy this device again for just that function
 The product pretty much works as advertised, and I don't have a compelling case against the technology (although the comments about the difficulty getting truly accurate HR readings are valid).  That said, I have big wrists and have broken every watch band I have ever owned... which is why I typically don't wear watches... and this was no exception.  The big difference was that despite the relative interchangeability of bands for the S and L sizes, Fitbit does not make replacement XL bands and they are not sold by any 3rd party vendors.  My band broke after less than 3 months of use and has been sitting on my nightstand for 3 months since then because I can't get a replacement product.  This is really disappointing, especially for the price.
 Won’t buy it again. I wish it would charge properly but it doesn’t. I have only had it for about three weeks and when I put it to charge it shows battery charging but it really doesn’t charge well. Also I wish the steps would show on the display in real time  (example) it only reads 11K when you are at 11,258 so the number is not exact, bummer.
 I love my Fitbit. I wear it every day. I know I should like it for the fitness tracker which is nice but I really like that it gets all my texts/phone calls. When my phone is on silent and gets a call/text I can easily look at my wrist and decide if its important or not. Also I wore the salmon band that came with it for a while then bought a set of bands for really cheap that changed the entire look of the Fitbit
 Pros:<br/>-lightweight, comfortable, small<br/>-auto tracker for sleep and exercise work really well<br/>-interchangeable bands<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-cannot manually start exercise like you can with other fitbits<br/>-charger cord is WAY TOO short!!!<br/>-does not track stairs (which does not bother me, but it might to others)<br/><br/>Overall, I love it :)
 I love this fit bit!! I wanted to start living healthier and this fit bit is so motivating! It makes it easy to count calories and see how hard I’m working at the gym. It’s also thin enough that it doesn’t get in my way. I love the design. I also love seeing how I am sleeping at night with the sleep analysis. The battery lasts a long time and if it does get low it only takes a couple hours to charge again! If you want to live a healthier life and need a little extra motivation to get you going, buy this!
 This is the Fitbit I've enjoyed the absolute most of out of all other versions I've had: One, Flex, Blaze. First off, as a smart fitness watch, I use it daily. I count my calories online, I track my steps and my workouts. I think most people have a hard time deciding between Blaze and Alta 2 HR. If you're ok losing a color lcd screen, altimeter and setting up various custom workouts, you'll love the size and weight of Alta HR. It's the first one i use to sleep in because it's so light and the screen doesn't keep flashing on at night. I bought the gold version because it complements my skin tone very nicely and i tend to wear more gold than silver jewelry. Would highly recommend it.
 As a step counter, it is wonderful. Also, it seems to be accurately measuring resting heart rate and sleep cycles. I like the functionality of the app, and I find that it communicates well with MyFitnessPal and WeightGurus. The reminders to move are also very helpful throughout the day. It connects well with my iPhone, and I think the text and call alerts are useful.<br/><br/>As a heart rate monitor during the day and during workouts, it is pretty bad. Has trouble reading at higher hear rates and seems wildly inaccurate when it is able to take a reading.<br/><br/>Advertising its functionality as a calorie counter is borderline criminal. There is absolutely no way I am expending the 4.5k calories that this device claims. I don't understand how anyone could think this was a feature they needed to include or advertise for this product.
 I couldn't get this Alta HR to connect with my Honor 6x, Samsung Galaxy, or Windows 10 Laptop.  Fitbit's customer support said that it was defective so I returned it and got another one.  This one also didn't work.  I wasted two evening troubleshooting with them trying to get it to work.  I'm incredibly disappointed.
 i would give five stars for performance and product itself, no doubts that Fitbit is the pioneer in fitness and health tracking watch, but I would like to have a water/swimming proof one, (not full watch)
 I LOVE IT!! It's slim and light weight, I have smaller wrists and the small band is great. There are ALOT of people saying the band changed colors and that was deterring me from ordering this one but I wanted the rose gold to match my rose gold ring. I've had this for a few weeks now and there is no color change to the band. *i don't wear a lot of dark colors though, and I know it can rub off onto the band... so I dk.<br/>I like the fit bit app, its easy to read and use. Calculates my sleep great! And workouts and steps.
 I bought this product when it was on a price reduction just to give it a go and test out if the heart rate monitoring was good enough to help with heart rate tracking during a workout. The heart rate monitoring works great and was just what I was looking for. The heart rate monitoring lags about 30 seconds in my informal testing due to the nature of the reading from the wrist and averaging readings over time but is usually within 10 bpm to the treadmill palm readings. Beyond the heart rate monitoring the sleep monitoring and calorie estimates are really useful. Very easy to review collected data on the fitbit website. Overall a great buy with tons of cool information that is collected.
 Tracks my data extremely well, and even my sleep. It’s a great fitness tracker. Even displays notifications which is nice.<br/><br/>Sometimes doesn’t register my touch, but it’s pretty rare.
 THIS IS MY THIRD FITBIT, THE FIRST ONE QUIET AFTER 8 MONTHS, AND IT WAS REPALCED FREE OF CHARGE. I LOST THE SECOND ONE. BUT MY PROBLEM WITH THE THIRD ONE IS THAT I HAVE TO RECHARGE IT EVERY THREE OF 4 DAYS MAX. MY OTHER TWO WOULD GO A WEEK BEFORE RECHARGING. SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHATS GOING ON. EVERYTHING LOOKS THE SAME, I THINK THEY ARE JUST MAKING THEM CHEAPER AND SELLING FOR MORE. ANYONE ELSE HAVE THIS PROBLEM??
 This one was a gift but I have the same Fitbit for myself. It was easy to set up on my iphone, it runs for several days on one battery charge, and it really does encourage me to keep moving. Love the little fireworks display when I reach 10,000 steps in a day. My only criticism is that it's hard to read in bright sunlight.
 I got this to replace my old Flex that finally stopped working after several years.  And I have to say that Fitbits have come a long way since the original ones.  The step count, heart rate and distance all seem to be pretty accurate (the calorie count may or may not be, I have no idea).  Having this information available definitely motivates me to be more active.  Also, the detailed sleep information is very helpful.  I highly recommend this product!
 I had bought one for myself and liked the features so i bought my daughter one too. I like that it will wake me up on the morning and that I can see my text messages on it  The only thing I don’t really like is if you are outdoors and you have sunglasses on and you eant to see something on the face of the Alta you can’t see anything. You need to take off the sunglasses
 This product worked great for tracking haw many steps I took in a day but the features like the heart rate monitor I had to manually do it ever time through my phone and the sleep track did not work. I was using an android phone with this product. It did not work well for me.
 Suddenly this piece of junk quit keeping track of my sleep.  I usually go to bed around 9 or 9:30 and am asleep pretty soon thereafter.  This piece of junk reports that I go to sleep at 11:00 or later every night.  Called product support one time, couldn't understand half of what the person on the phone was saying, he got an attitude with me.  Now I can't even return this junk because the "return window has closed"  Pure junk
 I really love this, and the many features. It was the right size, but lost one star for the design; I’ve found sometimes it twists to the side and puts bruising pressure on my wrist bone because the Fitbit itself is slightly too wide. This has no change from the band size, so no matter which size you order, it may do this. I had to get used to wearing it tighter than I usually prefer wrist bands to be.
 I really like my Fitbit Alta HR. It keeps me in touch with the world via text, call, and email notifications, and really helps me track and improve my health. The Fitbit app is amazing too. The only thing I don't love is that it's difficult sometimes to wake the screen up sometimes. You have to tap it firmly or twist your wrist to wake it up and sometimes it does not respond..It's not a smartwatch. So, if that's what you're looking for, I'd get something else.
 I bought this product to start tracking my activity and complemented it with the fitbit app to record my meals. It turned out very good, though the calorie count says I'm loosing about 15.000 a week (working out 5 times a week) but still seems a bit overboard.<br/><br/>The battery lasts for about 3 days, the bpm monitor sometimes gets some readings off, but I asume that's because of my hairy arm or sweat and sometimes when I wake up it says that I've already taken like 60 steps (maybe I'm sleepwalking? I don't know).<br/><br/>Be careful to take off the wristband while you engage sexy time or it will count it as a workout.
 The points at which the band attaches to the Fitbit has broken in less than 8 months of use and the other end is loose and will not stay tightly attached to the Fitbit.  The watchband closure still works but the Fitbit has fallen off onto the floor or in sleeves of clothing.  I have now lost 2 different types of Fitbits and on my way to losing a 3rd!<br/>I am unsure what type of band to purchase so that I WILL NOT lose my FITBIT.  Any suggestions?
 Love my Fitbit Alta HR. I like all the tracking categories and the notifications option. I purchased this model for the additional heart rate feature. I really like the sleep tracker. I've learned a lot about my sleeping patterns.<br/><br/>Being able to track my calorie intake and what I consume is so useful for my diet plan.There are so many features. Another plus is being able to switch out different bracelets.
 I love my Fitbit! It fits well and works awesome! I have contests with my family to see who "works" the hardest during the day and week. I win daily challenges but my sister beats me in every weekend challenge. Dangit.<br/>I am in love with this Fitbit and I wish I got it sooner. I have looked at several Fitbits over the years and never took the plunge. I am happy with the one I chose.
 Totally disappointed with this product. After one year my square went blank. It was never worn in the shower, because it isn't waterproof.  It's wasn't dropped, or banged around.  I took out a two year warranty, after it stopped working I sent it back to Square Trade for repairs, I was informed there was internal damage, and that wasn't covered by the warranty.  I don't think I'd buy another,  Something that is designed  to track fitness, doesn't hold up to activity.
 Looks nice and does what its suposed to but ibe had it for less than a month and it has a scratch/dent on the face... i work in an office and im gentle with it so i have no idea what its from. My only reasoning is tge face is a poor quality plastic. Maybe the other fitbits are better than the alta hr or just maybe buy an apple or samsung with glass instead of plastic.
 This small device has gotten me up and around a lot more. The reminder to get up and do steps which is my primary goal is very good for me since I tend to sit in the same spot for too long. I also like the heart rate monitor on this version that measure my resting heart rate as well as the rate during movement.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this model.
 Counts steps thats about it. Display doesnt work. Doesnt connect with website. Doesnt receive updates. The battery charge doesnt last long and the more active you are the faster it wears out. The charging cable is cumbersome.  My next purchase will go back to using the FtBit Zip, more user friendly and versatile, months long battery life, and way less expensive.
 Racking up steps and heart rate on my dog clippers.... Returned it because I believe the HR monitor is just a formula for the pace of your steps - feels a bit gimmicky​.  Getting $50 back and getting the basic Alta.
 I ordrerd this some time back, have used it regularly, and never once regretted the purchase or had any frustration using it. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. Super easy to set up, and the app offers more than I originally anticipated.<br/><br/>Personally, I dont like the included rubber wristband. It's not that it's poor quality, it's that my skin reacts poorly to a non-breathable band. Luckily, the designers made it easy to change out the band so a quick search on Amazon, and $9 later, my one minor issue has been solved.
 I ordered this because I need the heart monitor, I compared it to my cardiologist blood pressure and monitor device and it is 100% accurate, I am impressed. I only give it a 3 because you cannot see the digital display outside in the light. You need to go in doors to read it. other than that, It is awesome
 After trying out several Jawbone fitness trackers, I finally switched to Fitbit. The Alta HR is exactly what I hoped it would be. It provides a good incentive to move more. I work at a desk job and even though I don't often get all of my active hours in, I know I stand up and move around far more than before I used the Fitbit. I also like the sleep and heart rate monitoring.
 I got my new Fitbit Alta HR last week, and I love it!  I had the "Fitbit One" and loved it as well.  I ended up running it through the wash by mistake, so I got this one.  WAY more fun to use!  Thank you, fast prompt and as promised!!
 Love the Fitbit Alta HR. It links with MyFitnessPal which gives an amazingly easy way to track calories. The sleep tracker works very well for me, it is helping me to evaluate my sleep habits. HATE, HATE the coral colored plastic band. Became very dirty looking in a couple weeks. Tried all the suggested cleaning methods I could find on Google  and Fitbit site...nothing worked. I purchased this new as my only band choice with my Alta. At the Fitbit site, instead of admitting the bands are defective, they say that the light colored bands should not be worn when you are going to sweat (a fitness band???). They say you shouldn't wear them to sleep in (maybe they should have thought about the fact the watch has a sleep tracker). I believe these light bands should only be offered as a free choice along with a standard issue dark band. Shame on Fitbit for offering such a terrible band on an expensive watch. A free replacement should be offered, guess they want you to have to buy another band from them. I have ordered a set of bands (not original Fitbits) with color choices thru Amazon. I will now wear the darker colors on a daily basis and have color choices  to match outfits when going out. Should not have to buy these with wearing my Alta for less than a month. FITBIT COMPANY WAKE UP, treat your consumers fairly. Advise them up front the pretty light colored bands should not be ordered with the watch as the main band...they will look terrible within days.
 Love how slim it is. I really wanted to track heart rate and sleep. It tracks your heart rate every 5 minutes and graphs it! Love that! I have sleep problems and I needed more information, so I love the sensitive sleep setting. It's very helpful with a 30 day average too. BUT  I do really miss the stairs!! I wish it was there but it is not included on the Alta HR. So, if you really like to know the number of flights of stairs you've done, this won't do it for you! Overall, a good product.
 I love this product. Just a few things I could be picky about: I wish it would actually show the full number on steps, etc. (i.e. 2,000 instead of 2k) and I wish there was a way to view battery life on the band instead of having to go to my app.
 I've used my fitbit continuosly during 6 months and I really like it but I have to wear it with generic straps because the original one gives me a rash.<br/>These are the ones that I wear and so far haven't had problems with them<br/>https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07221985F/ref=oh_aui_i_d_old_o0_img?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1
 I used be ware Jawbone UP3 but switched Fitbit Alta HR one month ago because UP3 break the band every year. Spent first week it shows aound 30% more steps than last several weeks though I don't change my life. 2nd week I ware Fitbit Alta HR, Jawbone UP3, Withings Steel, Garmin Fenix3 both hand to compare step counting, off course change position everyday. Result was, UP3, Steel, Fenix 3 were within 5% on 7 days average but only Alta HR counted 34% more than the average. It count already 1000 steps until I leave house for work in the morning. And I found around 500 steps  counting at brushing teeth.... So it count every arm move without walking. Then I aware I loved UP3.
 I like this one so much better than the Charge 2. Fits the wrist well. X-Large must be for the Incredible Hulk's wrists, most should be ok with a Large or smaller. Seems fairly accurate. Great water resistance and battery life.
 UPDATE 9/29:  I've learned to hate this thing.  I am constantly slamming the thing with my knuckle to activate the screen.  Whoever thought this would be a good activation method was....special.  I've also come to loath the band on this thing.  Its either too tight or too loose.  On my Pebble I had a magnetic band that could be adjusted.  I've gone through 3 of these bands and all have only small and large "large fits my wrist, but can't get around my hand,  resulting in needing to sit there for 2 minutes sliding the band through the loop.  (Apparently these bands are designed in Asia where everyone doesn't have bulkier hands.<br/>It wouldn't be a big deal as with my Pebble I only took the thing off once a week, but as this thing is not water resistant and can't take a shower.  I would have to remove it at least once or twice a day.  Its beyond annoying.  Save your money and get something else. The software doesn't make up for the crap hardware design.<br/><br/>So once upon a time, I had a Fitbit.  I then went to a Pebble (Which I loved BTW, and was looking forward to the heart rate monitor version)  After the writing was on the wall I went to a Samsung Gear fit 2 (Worse software ever BTW.)  And now I'm back to a Fitbit.  What is frustrating is all the annoyances that were present several years ago and then some<br/><br/>Bluetooth connectivity issues....check.  (I've upgraded the firmware BTW, and am on a new phone.  Galaxy S8+)<br/>lacking water resistance for showers.....check.<br/>crappy connector to charge....check  (No really it's almost worse this time around.  The "clip"  that you use is hit or miss.  I'm usually futzing around with it.  Last night I thought I had it connected.  Went I went to bed looking at the charge state.....nope.<br/>Crappy battery status with low, med, full.....check (I want to know if I'm at 20% or 10%...)<br/><br/>But wait.  They have made it worse in some ways.<br/><br/>Now lacking a touch screen or a button.  The tapping on the screen is read by the accelerometer.  Which sounds great until you are smashing your finger into the screen over and over to try and trigger it, resulting in rolling past the state you want.  Worse still is a lack of a button.  How do you reset the watch if you are having connectivity issues?  Oh with the charge cable that has a button.  So if you are out and about and need to do a reset, you are SOL.<br/>Now both of these changes I could see if the watch was swim and shower resistant.  But without that feature, this just smacks of Fitbit being cheap.<br/><br/>Why did I get this if I'm so unhappy with the hardware?  Because of the reverse reason why I dropped my Samsung Fit 2.  Samsung makes great hardware, but crap software.  Fitbit, on the other hand, has bland, almost inferior hardware.  But their software, especially their sleep tracking, makes up for it.....mostly.  It is why it loses only 2 stars.<br/><br/>Now I've been seeing people complain that the sleep stages tracking isn't accurate.  I can't speak to that, but I can say the overall time the system sees me asleep looks to be spot on.  And when it sees me awake also looks to be accurate as the last hour before I actually get up where I'm hitting snooze it sees me as awake between the 20 minutes I'm sleeping.  I can't speak to light, deep, and REM sleep without taking a sleep disorder test.  But the feel I'm getting is that it's pretty solid.<br/>The steps also seems to be solid.  The miscount as I'm working away on the keyboard at work get up and walk for a bit seems to be spot on.  It doesn't see me moving at my desk with the steps per hour feature, which is a good thing.<br/>I've only had this thing for a week.  The battery life appears to be OK.  Nothing fantastic.  Certainly, nothing that matches the Pebble which is the gold standard for battery life. (I was getting close to 10 days on that thing.)  But then again it didn't have a heart rate monitor on it.  So battery life could be considered excellent with that feature set running all the time.  The problem is it's difficult to tell with no actual percentage meter.  Most likely a method for Fitbit to mask actual battery life.<br/>The watch band is, like everything else, OK.  The ring that keeps the extra section of the band from flailing around has something that fits into the notch on the band.  The problem is moving this back and forth as you take the watch off to shower or swim is annoying.  Thankfully the bands are stupidly simple to replace.<br/><br/>Overall I'd consider the Fitbit Alta HR an OK device.  It's missing key hardware features that should have been included by now.  I believe this speaks to Fitbit tightening its belt as they aren't doing financially well. They may have justicaition for this, it doesn't make for a good device though.
 Doing well so far. But, if it follows the path of my other Alta, it'll only be good a year which will be unfortunate. The Fitbit app has improved dramatically, and the step counter and heart rate monitor has gotten better.  It doesn't count stairs well. I wish it was waterproof as its barely water resistant.
 Great for counting steps, horrible at reading heart rate. The heart rate is only accurate when at rest. As soon as I start moving, the hr is either drastically lower than when I check my pulse- about 30 beats lower- or the hr monitor stops recording completely. Extremely frustrating! I ordered this specifically as a hr monitor and it doesn’t do that. A terrible WASTE OF MONEY on a fancy looking, expensive pedometer. Junk!
 After having a few low end fitness trackers, this one is leaps and bounds above anything I expected. Haven't 'tested' the heart rate tracker but my nurse hubby says he thinks it is pretty accurate. The sleep feature is spot on although getting me to wear it while I sleep is a challenge in general. Also, you need to wear it on your non dominate hand to get accuracy with the activity and steps (doh!) which a friend had to tell me. I will say that cut my steps down by about 30%. I really do just love this  tracker. I'd buy again in a heartbeat.
 Love it!  Got it same day with Amazon Prime.  This is my second fitbit and I am loving having a heart rate monitor now and being able to see my texts/phone calls from it. Purchased lots of different bands for it as well, making it go with every outfit.
 The small size is what sold me.  I've used it for 6 months and so far no problems at all.  I did set it to my exact stride, and that seemed to improve the accuracy, but mainly I am using it for my own self-motivation to MOVE!  The 10,000 step goal is a push some days, but very doable.
 The tracker itself is really good and worth the money but the design is heavily flawed. I've had this for 4months and I have never once removed the brackelt from the tracker, but all of a sudden it has become loose and falls off multiple times a day. I've almost lost it in many occasions because if falls off all of the time.
 I've on this daily since receiving it. It is durable and the app is easy to use. I am quite pleased at the ease of changing bands to complement whatever I am wearing. As the instructions indicate, water resistant, not waterproof - do not wear while bathing or in the shower.
 Having yielded to the tyranny of the Fitbit, I find myself walking more, burning more calories.  I got this model to monitor my heart rate while working out, with the desire of hitting the fat burn zone.  I am glad that I made this purchase.... need to talk my husband into one now!
 I kept bouncing all over trying to find the perfect fit watch. Some reason I come back to this one. The size and features are perfect for me. I feel like those bulky, fancy looking ones just do not function for what you pay for. This one does what it's supposed to do with no issues.
 Wow -- as a night nurse, this Fitbit's analysis of my Light, Deep and REM sleep is very helpful in making sure I am getting the desired amount of each - instead of just sleep duration. I like the "Benchmark" feature to help me with the analysis for men in my age range. Also -- much better charging system on this Fitbit -- my earlier version's charging arrangement was flimsy and fell apart -- and the charge lasts days! Better wrist band too.....
 We aren't best friends yet but I'm sure we'll get there.  I am enjoying my Fitbit Alta HR, easy to read display and not difficult to set up.  Right now I'm a bit bewildered with the syncing to other apps and bringing in my exercise to adjust calories but I'm sure I'll get there.  The blogs online are helpful.  I would definitely recommend this item.  I opted for the skinnier Alta as opposed to a wider version so it would be less conspicuous on my wrist.  It was a good choice for me.
 The Fitbit is to be supplied with a Dongle with monitoring device and charging cable. As the stock shipped by this supplier, did not include the Dongle we were unable to complete setup or syncronize the device. Phoned Fitbit help line and they are to ship the Dongle in a week or so.
 I bought the Fitbit Alta HR back in August, my main problem with it is that it will not accurately register your heart rate. It doesn't matter how tight the band is or how far up on your wrist you wear it. Multiple software resets didn't help either. Sometimes it will record 2/3 of your workout, sometimes none at all. The other features are good, but you can get a pedometer and a basic fitness app for a lot less money,
 No problems with the vendor I purchased from, however I am extremely displeased with the product.  It does not accurately measure my heart rate, active minutes, calories burned or sleep.  For instance, according to my fitbit, I had five MINUTES of sleep one night, my heart rate is over 200, and I burn over 5000 calories per day.  I was MUCH happier with my old fitbit charge.
 Each day I learn more and more about this watch.  It has lots of possibilities, and I'm just beginning to get acquainted with it right now and put it to use.  Also, it is quite easy to change wristbands to another option if you choose.
 I've bought two of these since last year.  The wristband started to break away on the first one and I kept reconnecting it thinking I did not attach properly.  Eventually, the tracker fell off without me noticing and I lost it. Since I really like the color and tracker features, I bought another one.  I used it two or three days per week only. After less than four months the wristband started to fail again.  It is a NOTORIOUS problem with the Alta HR and has been going on for a few years. There is all kinds of discussion about it in the community forum on the Fitbit site. I think it's terrible they still sell this product knowing about this defect.
 Super easy to add to my tracking program to replace my old Charge HR. Loving the more streamlined, smaller unit and ability to easily change bands. Band is stiff and a bit difficult to put on when new, but should soften with time. (Charge HR band can't be changed, and mine got very worn out after 3 years of continuous wear, causing me to replace unit.) Love the display's brighter/larger characters so I can read it without my glasses (unlike my old Charge HR).
 Product did not work as advertised, did not sync to phone (had a Moto Z Force) or tablet (Galaxy Tab) consistently.  Would sync then stop then drain battery trying to sync again.  Very unreliable for price.  Not a wide enough market share to be a worthy purchase.
 Nice as a watch but I bought this especially for the constant HR monitor and the HR monitor is horribly inaccurate.  Ive tried everything, read the help section on Fitbit's website and read blogs.  I played around with the distance from my wrist bone, tightness of the watch, etc.  One minute it shows a HR of 73, the next minute 83, then 52 while I am not doing anything different, even keeping my wrist relatively still.  I compared it with my 3 year old Samsung GearFit and the Samsung was consistent.  I am returning this item.  Very disappointing.
 This is the only Fitbit that doesn't make me feel like I'm wearing a LoJack on my wrist. I'm glad they finally added heart rate monitoring to the Alta line. The pulse sensor does seem to be ever so slightly more finicky than the Charge HR, but the smaller profile makes up for it.
 I love this product. I had a Garmin device before. The one downfall is the Garmin was better at alerting about text and calls, with the Fitbit you almost have to be in the same room as your phone to get an alert. It is easy to set up and lg to a smartphone.
 Got it for my wife...she likes it i guess but is disappointed that it doesn't show or graph heart rate over a 24 hr period.  It does for periods of exercise, but not a 24 hr aggregate. She is petite so she needed something that works for her small wrists.  As far as that goes, its OK...but again, she wanted something to show HR over a 24 hr period.
 Love fitbit.  Durable.  Long lasting.  Connects just fine with Samsung galaxy s9 despite other reviews.  Just google how to connect for text and calls.  Love the silent alarm feature to wake up early without warning others in the room (especially my 1yr old).  HR is just a resting rate.
 Had trouble with first one not tracking REM sleep so after 3 calls to manufacturer they sent me another one.  The new one doesnt work either.  If the device doesnt work as the advertise then they shouldnt be selling it.  Im beyond frustrated.
 I received this as a Christmas present and for the first couple hours, I WAS IN LOVE! Unfortunately, that all changed due to the beautiful band turning a weird grey/ black color not even after wearing it for a full day! I do not wear dark colors and I was not doing any activities that would cause this so I don't know how to prevent this happening to someone else. The gold on the actual fit bit is really beautiful but just beware that the band stains and changes color VERY easily. My advice is to just save that extra 20 bucks and do the regular silver fitbit.
 I upgraded from the Fitbit flex and glad I did. The Alta HR is more secure on my wrist, easier to charge. I like that I can check my steps from the Fitbit itself..I love the setting that lets me know it’s time to move as I sit at a desk for work.
 Check the device compatibility list before purchasing.  I had trouble setting up my Fitbit and called the help line.  I had to use my house phone, my computer, my cell phone, and my husband's cell phone to trouble shoot with customer service.  An hour later it was established that my phone was not compatible even though it met the operating system requirements.  Make sure to check the list of devices by manufacturer and model before purchasing.  I was told they are adding models periodically and I will probably repurchase once mine shows up on the list.
 LOVE MY ALTA! Never realized I was getting so little sleep and drinking so much water! Love the adventures and challenges. Graduated from 10,000 steps in May to 23,000 in June. Several friends were convinced it would help improve the quality of their lifestyle and all purchased one from AMAZON of course. Enjoy turning my friends onto the great deals at Amazon. My favorite place to shop for everything!!!
 This is great, I really love it. It's got a much slimmer profile than the Charge HR that I upgraded from, which is something that I really wanted. It's responsive, charges fine and seems pretty accurate. The *only* thing that I would change is that once you get over 1k steps, it doesn't tell you the exact number of steps. It just says 1.1k, etc. I just liked being able to see my exact number of steps, but it's not an annoyance that would make me take away a star. I also like that it reminds me to move every hour with different messages.
 I love this thing! I think the calorie tracker is really accurate as well. I prefer to set the sleep function to sensitive for a better sleep report. All in all, I like it. It just took me a couple days to figure it all out. Great buy! Also the light grey/blue color is really nice and the bracelet fits my petite wrist well. I where it 2nd to the tightest notch.
 I'm afraid to give Fitbit a 5 star as I had to return the first &amp; 2nd one I ordered. They both died before expiration return date!!!! This one seems to be working but I "baby" it! Be sure &amp; order the face protectors as screen face scratches very easily. You can not see the face when out in the sun.
 Really liked the product. It was slim and easy to wear.<br/>The problem is trying to track sleep, which was one of the main reasons I purchased it. It is so thick that it would get stuck on the covers and pillow and wake me up. I thought the problem would go away after I got used to it but after several weeks the problem is still persisting.
 The first one that arrived had a broken screen. Tried figuring it out with FitBit over the phone with no success. Contacted Amazon for a replacement, came within a couple of days. Sent back the broken one easy peasy.<br/>I love tracking my steps &amp; especially my sleep: it has made me realize habits I didn't know I had. It's not as bulky as others so I can wear it close to my hand and not up my arm without any restrictions.
 Switched from older model to this one, happy so far, accuracy is ok, app somethimes is lagging but nothing crazy. I really like their small format. Battery holds up whole week
 This is my 3rd or 4th Fitbit. Best one yet. My last one still worked but had gotten beaten up pretty badly in a fall while running. This is a great replacement. Impressed by the battery life so far. It says up to 7 days and it does go at least 6.5 - 7. I charge it on Friday nights usually.
 I have had two other fitbit models and really like this one! I love the slim design and the look! However, compared to my previous charge HR, I have noticed some differences and in my opinion, some shortfalls of the Alta HR. For example, it doesn't include staircases climbed and I really loved that feature! Additionally, it doesn't have a button on the side, like the Charge does, that allows you to notify it of beginning and ending exercise. Overall it is a great product!
 Ended up returning as the activity monitor was not accurate whatsoever which in turn made me question the accuracy of the HR monitor and everything in-between. Also, the band which was beautiful day one, became darkened and was getting black even though I really didn't ever see how it could have been Getting dirty. It was pretty unappealing after a week and a half, and for how expensive this is, I decided it wasn't  worth it. The idea and look are awesome, but only for day one.
 I loved it and it worked perfectly. I even forgot to take it off a couple of times before swimming and showering and it was not affected at all, thankfully! But just this week the strap broke off, right near where you disconnect it to change out the bands. I'll just have to get a new band but device itself still works fine.
 Love this and wish I had gotten one years ago rather than using a cheaper alternative. It has really helped me to be more mindful of my behaviors and as a result I have lost 7 pounds in the two months that I have owned this. I don’t believe that it is 100% accurate but it’s close enough.
 I was excited to receive my Fitbit and it’s been working great, however, after a week it no longer make a connection to the charger. I have tried cleaning the charger prongs as indicated in the tips, but no success. Trying alternate outlets has not helped. I sent a message to the seller a few days ago and no response. Super bummed, but will have to return as the battery will die in the next few days.
 Product works very well but there are no instructions on how to set it up. YouTube videos were not exactly helpful. I would never have got it set up without calling customer support. There are a few things that need to be known that you will not find mentioned anywhere.
 Bought this as a gift. She loved her first one so much she wore it out and could wait for another. Never goes without it!
 I like it - even the color of the band was flesh enough that it wasn't offensive to wear in public.  It seems to tolerate an occasional splash of water well, and it's still working so far.  The band does get dirty pretty quickly.  I've wound up replacing it with a gold, more bracelet-looking one, but I was going to do that anyway.
 This is my favorite fitness tracker so far. It is slim lined, works with interchangeable bands, integrates easily with MyFItnessPal and Weight Watchers Apps, and holds a charge for about a week. The free FITBIT App is easy to understand and provides clear feedback about my workouts, sleep and steps. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a straightforward, non-bulky, long-lasting charge tracker.
 I really like the functionality of this fitbit and it has given me incentive to get my steps in every day. Even the heartrate monitor works well, which I was worried about because often exercise handheld monitors don't catch my heart rate.<br/><br/>The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is twofold:1. It is hard to see the display in sunlight. I am unable to check my heart rate when I am out for a run on sunny days. They need to fix this problem.  2. the pretty mauve band is already looking worn after less than 2 weeks wear (graying around the edges) and I'm not playing in the dirt.  I'm an office worker.  I will be purchasing another darker colored band to use in the future.
 This is my second Fitbit Altra - my first band did not have a secure fit and I lost it after a year - love this band because it is like a watch - this tool makes me conscious of how many steps I take a day along with other health benefits like tracking my sleep patterns - would not be without one.
 The product works fine.  This is my 2nd Fitbit.  I also have a Flex.  I wanted the Alta HR to be able to read my heart rate when working out.  Problem is that the font is tiny and dimly lit.  Fitbit really should make a larger font for this size wristband.  Also, you can't see it in the sunlight, with or without sunglasses.
 I have already been using Fitbit Charge 2 HR and bought Alta HR for my wife on her b'day. She was quite excited with the sleek look. But after using for a month, we realize that it does not give correct count for footsteps. We walk together and count in Alta HR is always 10% higher side againt Charge 2. Apart from this, with no side button, it becomes difficult to navigate between different mode as sensors are not sensitive enough. Overall, I am disappointed.
 The device on it's own seems to work well and is comfortable on wrist. Battery life is about a week. All in all, I'm happy with the device. But, am not happy with the support for android phones. Support seems limited for older models, including Samsung. It is supported with iPhone 8 models.  I wasn't aware of this when I purchased the device. Synch within the first 3 months was great. Now, 4 months later, not so much. The reports generated with their app are helpful to keep track of progress. I can't recommend this device if you are interested in synching and are an android user. Either that or buy an iPhone.
 Very pretty! I like that the Alta HR is slimmer than my old charge HR Fitbit. (My only regret is that I miss the stopwatch function of the charge HR more than I thought I would).<br/><br/>I have very small wrists and this is so comfortable I forget I'm wearing it. I also love love love the blush/gold combo. It could double as a fashion piece in addition to being a fitness accessory
 I bought the Fitbit Alta HR about a year ago and I was in love with it from the start. If you are looking to get serious about tracking steps, heart rate, work-outs, calories, and weight, this is for you. It was a great workout companion and I grew addicted to checking my steps every day and even competing with friends for steps.<br/><br/>BUT...and here is the big but...about 2 months ago, I noticed some irritation on my arm where the battery port sat. I didn't think much of it, just that I had maybe been tightening the band too much. I wore it every day, but took it off to shower and about every other night to charge. The only water it came in contact with was maybe when I was washing my hands and when I sweat working out.<br/><br/>The irritation did not go away. In fact, the closer I looked at it, it appeared that the battery port had BURNED my arm and was beginning to scar. I googled this issue and it seems many people have in fact had this problem. I contacted Fitbit's customer service, who would not comment on the burn (although I had sent them a photo) but would refund my total amount paid if I would return the Fitbit to them. They also could not guarantee that another Fitbit (a Charge 2 HR for example) wouldn't burn me.<br/><br/>TLDR; short story is, the battery port burned my arm and I would not recommend buying this unless you are prepared to accept that eventually the same would happen to you. I'll be buying an Apple Watch as a replacement. No battery ports to burn you on those.
 Really love my Fitbit. I previously had the Alta without the HR tracker and never had any issues with it...just bought this one because I loved the color and wanted the monitor! Unfortunately, it dropped the other day off of the dresser onto the hardwood floor and it cracked across the front screen. I'm worried to use it again now. I didn't have it that long either so I'm a bit disappointed. Wish it was a bit more durable. But other than that, I recommend it.
 I’m so upset with myself for purchasing this Fitbit, for all I wanted to do was to give myself some motivation for getting active again. After the excitement of its arrival today on a holiday (President’s Day) I attempted to get it set up this evening in order to wear it tomorrow and get the week off to a good start.<br/><br/>I followed the directions, or lack thereof, and charged the device in my wall outlet (Apple iPhone outlet). The battery on the Fitbit did fully charge but it would not sync with my iPhone 6. I checked the website and it said that my phone was indeed compatible. I reset my cell, turn off Bluetooth then turn it back on like the troubleshooting suggests. Finally, I go online and google for alternative ways to get t to sync &amp; I read on Fitbit’s community that someone said you should only charge on the computer, not a wall outlet.<br/><br/>So I get my MacBook Pro which has 70% battery left, I plug in the Fitbit USB charger into my laptop and poof-everything goes black! I didn’t even have the Fitbit plugged in, just the charger. I then attempt to get my laptop back on...nothing...so I plug the laptop up to its charger, still nothing! I put my laptop charger in a different outlet, still nothing.<br/><br/>I think that the Fitbit charger has blown a fuse (or something) inside of my laptop. Did Amazon send me a defective Fitbit/charger? I’m so sad because I NEED my computer working! I can’t even print the return label from my email because I now have a non-working laptop.<br/><br/>I completely wasted my time and money. I even had to call the Square Trade warranty to cancel that as well. Has anyone else experienced this? I wish that I had listened to the poor reviews and never bothered purchasing this item. I had a Jawbone for many years and loved it. I’ll never by another Fitbit &amp; if anyone from Fitbit or Amazon is reading this, your company owes me money in order to get my MacBook Pro repaired.<br/><br/>Thank you kindly.
 Had it a few months and it started having to be charged every 2 or 3 days and now won't charge at all. Very disappointed and won't buy again or recommend this fitbit.
 I love the Gunmetal black edition- well worth the extra money if you are not a fan of the silver edging. I got an extender for the band and I've taken to wearing my Alta around my ankle. I still get a heart rate read, and a more accurate step count. I've had it for about a month and I really like it! It's gotten me up and moving more.
 The band on this doesn’t hold up, has gotten black marks that you can’t remove. Disappointed.
 I owned a flex for a year and decided two years ago to upgrade to the Alta. After two years of constant  wear it started not holding charge and dreezing up so I upgraded to the Alta HR Love the heart beat feature and all my bands I used on my Alta fit perfectly
 I bought this for my mom for Mother's Day and it is absolutely great. The thin band is not too bulky and doesn't get in the way. It's light weight and is a great upgrade from the Fitbit Charge 2. My mom is really happy with it and wears it every day. This is a really great product!
 I love my fit bit Alta HR so much I think it is great and looks very chic and sleep on my hand.  The only negative thing about this is that it rubs on any of your dark clothing and will take off the color and it will not come off of the fit bit band. If anyone knows how to get dark colors that wash off from your jeans or  shirts from the fit bit please let me know
 Fairly happy with my Alta Fitbit. I wish it would track my sleep better. If I get up in the middle of the night it seems to stop tracking. I have read several forums and posts. But haven't found anything that has made any improvements.
 I like my Alta. It is thin, reliable, and there are many accessories on Amazon for it. The only pet peeve I have with the Alta is that I usually have to tilt my hand like crazy so that the screen will flash the time. Other than that, it is a perfect and sleek fitness tracker.
 After ONE week wearing it
 Product doesn’t do as advertised. Sleep tracking is dubious and doesn’t track heart rate at night. The product is also extremely cheap. Rather invest in a Apple watch
 I love it. Reminds me of my first one I<br/>Ever got. Has all the basics plus let’s me know if someone is texting or calling me.  I paid a $100 over cyber Monday. Not sure I would pay full price.
 A fit bit watch that doesn't make my wrist itchy. Its how I lost my old one. This doesn't bother me at all. And for me, it does help to lose weight. The sleep tracker is quite informative
 My wife’s cardiologist asked my wife to get and wear this HR fitbit as another diagnostic tool for my wife’s heart. My wife just loves the 10,000 step congratulations, the gentle reminders to get moving and other features as well. We now think of her Fitbit as her fitness coach!
 can't get the fitbit set up loaded onto my PC.  First couple nights their website was down.  Still not set up and not able to use.  I'm sure it'll be OK once I get it set up but OMG never thought I would have this many issues just getting it to work.  If I knew now what I know I would have purchased a cheaper device and would probably be happier with it.
 I like the sleep tracking and heart rate monitoring.  The steps and calories burned is wildly inaccurate.  I pretty much ignore everything but the heart monitor and sleep tracking.  The sleep tracking may not be super accurate, but it is pretty close, and the heart rates are accurate verified with a pulsox.  the steps may be more accurate with the drive app thing that lets you subtract driving which it seems to confuse for steps.  I mostly wanted the heart and sleep tracking anyway, so it's good for that.
 I want to love this tracker.  It looks amazing and has such great options....unfortunately, after wearing it the first day for only a few hours, my wrist had a deep ache by the charge site on the back.  It also has 2 green lights on the backside that freaked my eyes out if I looked at the bracelet.  When I first put it on, it seemed kinda heavy.  I am not a petite lady.  I am 5'9 with big wrists and "man hands", so it's not that it was too big for my structure.  I didn't have the band on too tight either.  After developing the ache after just a few hours I googled "wrist pain with alta HR" and it turns out that it is not an uncommon occurrence with this tracker.  I have the flex2 and LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  I haven't had ANY issues with it and no pain of any kind.  I was wanting to add the HR monitor and watch feature, but now I'm worried that it would be the same with any of the HR versions.  SO...I'll stick with my flex2.
 I love it!😊 Its nice to get a notification when someone is calling you in your cellphone or someone texted you. You can read the text from the fitbit. The battery was awesome I think my fitbit battery lasted for  4 days or 5 ?not sure but its awesome. Its looks cute. I like how small it is. Its worth it!👍👍
 It's very nice tells me my heart rate, number of steps, how many miles and kilometers I have walked during the day and how many calories I have burned off.  A very good thing for anyone who wants to keep fit!
 I loved the size of it having switched from a Fitbit Charge 2 but it was not tracking exercise or biking and after several attempts I was not able to restart it per the instructions. Returning and going back to Charge 2.
 I love my Fitbit and I use it daily. But I always seem to experience technical difficulties after around month 6. I tried to reboot in hopes that it will continue to work as expected. I notice with this version, it does not track stair climbing but it act wracking and the tracking get way off if I take the stairs at work. Very frustrating.
 I love my Fitbit! If you are thinking about getting one I highly recommend it. You won’t regret it. I do suggest getting some aftermarket replacement bands because their fastening is better in my opinion than the manufacturer standard (plus having extra colors is fun).
 This is what my wife asked for at Christmas and she is very happy with the product. I have a Charge 2 and it is also great. You will like the phone app. There are many YouTube reviews that will give you all the features. Check them out.
 I love my Fitbit! I got this as an upgrade from the Charge HR the only thing I miss on this Alta HR that my Charge has is the ability to start and stop the workout mode, if you not doing heavy cardio it doesn’t track it.
 Not sure I would recommend this model.  I get inconsistent heart rate readings.  I take it off to shower and come back to it registering a heart rate of 190!  I dropped it and it did the same.  This is what it figures in one my overall readings.  Crazy!
 Arrived on time. Working okay. It is a little slow to display time upon raising my arm, a feature I really wanted.
 Very thick...It sticks up WAY to far. Coats and sleeves get hung up making it feel cumbersome. It's an expensive pedometer.  Not good for serious cycling. Example: if you go on a 30 mile ride you have to put it up on your forearm and then it breaks the ride into 3 or 4 segments or only gets half of it. I can enter it manually but but that defeats the whole wearable thing.  If you're a runner or walker it will record fine. The app is good.
 Gift for my mom and now she never wants to take it off. She is always showing me her stats in the app on her phone and loves seeing how well (or not) that she’s sleeping, along with all the other features of the Fitbit
 I upgraded to an Alta HR from a One and definitely love the heart rate features. If you use your device regularly and enjoy getting personal information about your health stats, it's worth the purchase. I used to use the clip with my One and was really hesitant about switching to a wrist device with the Alta HR. I do wish there was more flexibility on where you could wear the Alta since I wear my device pretty much 24/7, but the wrist band is innocuous enough.
 Does not always charge and doesn't always track my sleep. I like my Fitbit One much better. It is also not very comfortable to wear. Band is very stiff. If you are not swinging your arms you don't get the steps. Like when pushing a grocery cart.
 I like my Fitbit. It constantly nags me to get moving. But somedays, it doesn't sync (start over at 0 steps at midnight) and that's annoying.<br/>This is a common complaint.<br/><br/>This size is nice for my small wrists.
 Love the Fitbit Alta HR.  I like all of the fun bands that are available.  Makes it more like a fun piece of jewelry instead of a step counter.  Sometimes the heart rate doesn't always show but that isn't that important to me.  I put a screen cover on it right away just to help protect it.
 Pros: counts steps accurately, is comfortable, accurately track normal heart rate, and is inconspicuous for daily activity.<br/>Cons: cannot track heart rate accurately during activities. I am a cyclist, and planned to use this for heart rate during off season lifts. Unfortunately it basically will never read over 110 bpm, and usually stays around 80, even when near max exertion. That renders this fitbit essentially useless to me, although it is nice to see my resting heart rate as a measure of training stress.
 This Fitbit is simply incapable of keeping track of your heart rate during exercise (which, of course is when you need it most). I returned one Fitbit already because, after troubleshooting with the Fitbit company, it still did not track my heart rate when I was working out. It would lose track of my heart for 75% of my workout! I was so annoyed. I got a new one and have the same problem. It works fine until I start exercising. It’s too late for me to return this one ☹️
 This is an upgrade from the original Flex (I keep things until they die) This is such an improvement, I'm fascinated with the sleep monitoring, it's easy to change the band, and I'm very happy with my purchase so far.
 I like the Fitbit, but the cheap plastic band that came with it broke within a few months.  I thought it had a 1 year warranty.  No help from Fitbit after 2 chat sessions &amp; 2 emails.  I bought GBht my own replacement band.
 This is the 2nd fitbit product I've purchased and while I was pleased with the tracker, the band broke on this one.  I am 2 months out of the 1 year warranty period, so my only option was to purchase another band.  I purchased this in April of 2017, and the band came apart in June of 2018.  Pretty sad these products aren't made to last more than a year.  The first one I purchased was the Charge HR.  It broke within the first 6 months and was replaced by fitbit.  Apparently fitbit products are only meant to last 12 months.  Sad.
 If you are using this for Go365 then look elsewhere. You only get points for steps. Not heart rate or calories burned. They fail to tell you that fitbit is in a legal battle due to the inaccuracies of both.<br/>Ive also realized that my fitbit will disconnect from bluetooth every few days and force me to plug it in to the charger and reset the device. I lose a week of activity at random which defeats the purpose of purchasing a fitness tracker. Im giving it 2 stars since when it does actually work it tracks my steps.
 Sad. I Like my Fitbit Alta HR it works great. I do wish I would have known about the tap touch to change screens. The tap doesn't always work in the same spot and it's a little annoying. The main problem I have is with the band.<br/>It looks brand new except for the metal piece that connects to the Fitbit, It has a crack. I can no longer wear it because it doesn't fit.  I will be looking for a new band i guess.
 Would not sinc to my Apple phone. Gave it to my daughter, she had trouble getting it to sinc to her Samsung. Finally did some research and got it to work.
 No instructions came with the device. A booklet that states “safety Instructions and limited Warranty” came with the device but was useless. We bought this for our 11 year old daughter who plays soccer and is into health and fitness. She was so excited when she opened the gift but we are still struggling with how to set it up for her. It’s all a guessing game.  It would be nice if the device came with clear instructions. How long does it take to be charged. How do you know when it’s fully charged. Do we need to charge device before we set-up device?
 I bought mine less than 3 months ago, and liked it, but mine had a band that kept coming loose from the actual tracker component (the clasp worked fine, but the connection to the top of the electronic tracker component wasn't any good).  It finally fell off without me noticing yesterday, and now it's gone.  They need to make the bands more secure.  Not cool :(
 My FitBit worked great for about a week. Then it stopped monitoring heart rate and sleep. Other features work fine. After following directions to reset it (3 times) I talked with FitBit on an online chat. We finally got heart rate working but I found out the next morning that it still was not recording sleep. Reset it again a few times. Monitoring sleep came back for 1 night then either didn’t record anything or recorded 1-4 hours of sleep.  Since I have fibromyalgia, monitoring sleep is an important feature for me. I will try another one
 I have only had my Fitbit for four months now and it has already stopped working. I was so careful to not get it wet or even too sweaty for that matter when I worked out. I am so distraught over the fact that I paid that much for something that only lasted such a short amount of time.
 It does all its says... but beware that time setting does not work well if you travel a lot.  It is not well programmed to change time zone settings, even if synced with your phone and you go into the app and play with the time zone settings.  Took two days to reset when traveling from US to New Zealand and has not shown proper time time upon return despite following all the instructions regarding settings.
 I don't sleep with the fitbit on.  Not interested.  Nevertheless, the counter showed 800+ calories already burned when I put it on to work out each morning.  Also after 1000 calories, the counter only goes up by hundreds.  Not accurate.  It also often doesn't pick up my heart rate at all.  Would not recommend nor buy again
 I purchase this in July and no returns by August. The band has decided to keep coming loose and the fit bit falls on the ground. While I’m exercising mind you. Not happy with that. Other than the band problem, the product preforms as advertised.
 Love this, I wanted to track my sleep, steps, water, food...it does it all. You can even get text messages, and know when your cell is ringing if the person is in your contacts! One drawback is that it is difficult to read in the sun. Not a color display, but the slim design it super. Amazon has replacement wristbands in many color's very reasonably priced! PS, if you are a Weight Watchers member online you can pair with their app for your water intake and steps!
 I had my Fitbit Alta HR for less than three weeks when the display screen popped off  - I was making my bed when my wrist tapped lightly against the adjacent night stand.  Naturally, I assumed the display would pop back on with the ease with which it popped off.  Ha ha ha. The display screen does not just pop back on.  It doesn't go back on at all  - the watch is a complete loss.  The display could pop back on easily with a very minor design change but for some reason Fitbit chose to total the watch rather than include the ability to reattach the display screen.<br/><br/>A request for help to Customer Service yielded me an email with a link to instructions for caring for the watch and a comment that warranty "does not include replacement for damage due to normal wear."  Fortunately, I had paid the extra $10.00 for a protection plan.  Nope.  The warranty offered at the time for purchase specifically does not include coverage for accidental damage.<br/><br/> Fitbit sold me a very poorly made, seriously overpriced item, one that broke during normal wear within 3 weeks after purchase, and it seems there is no way for me to get it repaired, replaced or my money refunded.<br/><br/>I will say that I was very happy with it for the three weeks that it was operational.<br/>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>EDIT: Amazon has come through, offering a full refund.
 I really love my fitbit. I have had no issues with it so far (I've had it for almost three months). I really enjoy customizing the setting and goals which encourages me to get more exercise. Some of the similar products have more bells and whistles but I'm satisfied with what this has to offer.
 A gift for my daughter, who wanted grey, which isn't all that easy to find in this model.  Very pleased.
 Absolutely love my Fitbit period came in exactly as described and fast shipment. Highly recommended. Love the way it tells me when I'm receiving a phone call or getting a text message period definitely worth the money.

 When I measured my wrist using the guide provided by Fitbit, I was on the line between small and large and, based on what I read, it suggested buying the larger size.  I received my Fitbit today, and I should have ordered the Small.  Since I also ordered some extra bands in the Large size, I'm going to have to return them.
 I love it and the app. Why did I wait so long to get one???
 Terrible support for Fitbit - 14 months and the band broke for my Mom's (gift) Alta HR fitbit...Not even a discount offered ...Just sorry 12 months is up...After being a prime member for years, and my 2nd purchase of a fit bit I am very disappointed and will never purchase another one...Terrible customer service from Amazon now too
 I liked my Fitbit, but noticed immediately the metal started to tarnish, the bands barely lasted a month before the paint started chipping and/or they looked overly dirty, and then finally the screen suddenly cracked and now the entire thing doesn't work. and it's been only a year. really poor quality, and now I'm told it's too late to get a refund.
 Great service on a great product for regular price. I should have waited a week and I would have saved some money but my wife was in a hurry to replace the FITBIT Alta that she had accidentally left at her sister's house in Texas.
 I didn't realize that it didn't track floors walked up. That's the only thing I DON'T like about it. It's small and feminine which is what I didn't like about the Charge 2.
 I wear this on my ankle, which is more accurate &amp; more comfortable than wearing it on my wrist. My Fitbit Charge 2 was too bulky but this one is perfect with a matching silicone extender band.
 My wife loves her fitbit sense she put it on, Keeps count of physical fitness. Heart rate, calories, step count, etc.<br/>works well with the health and wellness app. The adjustable wristband fits perfectly.
 I hate Fitbit. They are a joke. Already sold mine to a friend
 This is exactly what I was looking for. It is slim, light weight and helps me keep track of my steps, exercise, sleep, calorie intake and even lets me know my heart rate and when I am burning calories. It also displays when i receive a text message.
 I love this, its helped me understand what I need to do to get myself moving, the app counts calories and you can see your macros, its a great tool for weight loss.  I am really enjoying it.
 This is the second Fitbit product I've purchased that has become defective just after passing the 1 year warranty mark. The wrist strap now pulls apart from the screen and has fallen off while running on multiple occasions. I never swapped out the bands and only wore my Fitbit during the day. These products should withstand normal daily wear, and yet the straps are not durable. Had the same issue with the Charge HR and now the Alta HR, won't be purchasing Fitbit products in the future.
 My brand new fitbit was a returned item, the plastic bag with the charger was open/cut, the paper holder with the little booklet was torn!!!!<br/>I want a brand new item!!!!!!!!!
 Keeps track of my sleep steps and heart rate at the gym that's all I need it for and it does a great job. An added bonus it tells me who i just got a text message from or a phone call so I don't have to dig my phone out of my pocket if I don't want to.
 I have had it for 5months so far and I love it. At first I bought it for the steps, but now I love tracking the quality of sleep I get. I also noticed the sleep tracking is a lot more accurate on the Alta hr than the regular Alta.
 I am thinking to return this item......have tried charging it both electrically and with my computer and it never responds.  VERY FRUSTRATED.  Advice?
 I had the charge hr and decided to upgrade. Glad I did, the design of the Alta hr is much sleeker and I love love the rose gold/ pink color combo. I also feel like I am racking up steps quicker with the Alta which makes me think the charge wasn't catching all my steps, but I could be wrong.
 I got my wife this for Christmas, and she's over the moon. She loves the sleep tracking, because it helps her understand how she gets the best rest, and when she wakes up. It also helps her set goals for herself. When she gets her daily 10,000 steps, fireworks go off on the watch, and she seems to like that a lot. Heart monitor is great, too.
 I like everything about this. Nice size screen and display. Smaller would not be as good.  Sometimes it doesn’t turn on the display when I turn my wrist like it should but not a huge deal
 Yeah, they fixed the clasp! I lost two altas in two years because of that magnetic button thing. It's bigger then I expected but it doesn't feel bulky on. The battery charge also seems  to last longer. I walk as often as I can and it's nice incentive to keep me motivated. Customer service is also super helpful. Love that.
 I absolutely love my Alta HR but I HATE the band. I purchased this FitBit after I lost my Alta due to the band breaking where it connects to the FitBit and falling off. Since then, I have had the same problem happen twice. A tiny piece of the band breaks off where it clips onto the FitBit itself. I wear my Alta HR everyday, I take it off to shower, clean it regularly, do everything that I should be doing to keep it in good condition, however these bands just don't hold up. I have begun buying bands from other sellers on Amazon and have had much more luck.
 I love this but sometimes it's a bit finicky when charging. For example, I can wear it for about 4-5 days straight and then I'll plug it in. No big deal, but occasionally it'll die the next day after taking it off the charger. I don't know if it's a product or user error, that's just my experience with it. Other than, it's fab.
 This has taught me so much about my actual sleep time and exercise time that I never really knew before.  Tracking food, tracking steps, tracking weight, tracking water intake, tracking heart rate - this does it all.  I highly recommend this Alta HR
 Buying a fitbit through Amazon saves a few bucks and it works just as well. I've been using this for over a month now with no issues and am enjoying all its little gadges (bpm monitor, step counter, sleep analyzer, etc)! 10/10 recommend.
 Awesome product gave this to my daughter for her birthday she is a very active kid as it is but this motivates her to move a little bit more has a wake up alarm buzzer and you can also receive text messages with it from the iPhone pretty cool bought a second one as a gift for her cousin
 Excellent!
 I bought Fitbit Alta HR early october this year and I liked it and works well but the wristband kept unlocking and falling off until it finally fell off while running errands and I could not find it. Feel very disappointed as this is a very expensive item and only had it for 1.5 months. If you buy it, buy a different wristband!!!
 I needed a watch that would sync quickly to a different time zone as I'm a flight attendant and a watch is a must.  I also wanted the Fitbit to track my steps.  Steps were fine, but syncing time was a struggle. I thought being the latest Fitbit it would work better than my last for syncing the time.  I was very disappointed and returned it
 I spent many hours, with two agents, in FitBit chat room trying to pair with their app. After which the two agents suggested I return the tracker as it would not reboot or be paired with FitBit app.  The tracker is advertised to work with computer with Windows 10, which is what I was using.  It does not do what FitBit advertises
 I never was able to complete the setup.  I had to pay extra for a dongle, and still the FitBit Alta HR was never able to find my computer (Dell Windows 7).  This product wasted a lot of my time, so I had to return it.
 I have only had my fitbit for 3 months and the heart rate monitor does not work at all and when it did it would have heart rates so high that if it was accurate I would drop dead of a heart attack.  While the customer support at fitbit was very helpful in trouble shooting and very polite, I think their policies for product upgrades are horrible.  They offered to replace the product for free or let me upgrade for 50% off a new and different model.  I think that is absolutely ridiculous.  Why can't they credit it me for the cost of the fitbit alta HR that I just purchased and let me pay the difference for the Charge 2.  The fitbit stopped working after only 3 months and never offered any accurate readings.  I did a ton of research on this product and it seemed like it offered everything I wanted - mostly tracking my workouts.  It did track my workouts in the beginning and would tell me how many calories I burned and whether it was fat burning and/or cardio.  That stopped working after less than a month.  I searched review boards for assistance and had no luck coming up with a solution.  I WOULD NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN OR ANY OTHER FITBIT PRODUCT.  My hands are tied because it would cost me over a $150 to move over to the Garmin products which anyone I talk to is very satisfied with their products.  So now I am stuck with already spending $130 for the Fitbit Alta HR and now I will have to spend another $75 to upgrade to the Fitbit Charge 2.  I will now spend a total of $205 in just 3 months for a fitness tracker!!!!  Very dissatisfied and extremely unhappy!  Fitbit you have lost a customer for life (BTW this was my third Fitbit product that I have purchased because I was always so happy with your products).  I will also let everyone I know that is in the market for a fitness tracker to never deal with Fitbit!!!
 This is my second "step counter" and I like it so much better than the last one. It is easy to see what and how you are doing, and seems very accurate. Also, being able to track friends is a great motivator!
 I don't like to where things on my wrist because they annoy me, but this is very comfortable and I am hardly aware that it is there. I like the data it provides to me and I really like the reminders to get up and move.
 The first 2 weeks the Fitbit was working great, i’ve purchased the blaze before and loved it but I wanted something thinner. But now it won’t even connect to the Bluetooth on my Fitbit app... I’ve reinstalled the app multiple times on my phone and even updated my phone to the newest software. STILL not working. Waste of money. And I can’t even return it now. I just want my money back.
 I love this Fitbit! It works well and the rose gold is a classy touch! It has gotten a little scratched up, but it’s worn every day and I’m a little rough on it.
 My Fitbit Alta HR was purchased May 31, 2017 and I can't keep it on my wrist. The strap keeps coming apart from its base. Its defective and I a contacting customer service about it.
 i guess this product is ok. I like that it gently vibrates when there's text message notification. however, the connection between the band and the digital part is very fragile. I am usually a very careful person when it comes with electronics, but this one just not do it for me. I wear it to do some gentle exercise and cannot totally avoid minor scratch etc. the band felt off after 4 months. I could order a replacement band, but not super convenience and cheap.
 Recent convert from Jawbone. I need a reliable tracker for my health insurance's requirements. I think this is a decently solid product.  Unfortunately, since I'm used to the Jawbone software, I have had time to grow to favor it. Then there's the fact that you can't shower with this tracker on. I'm sure if you're starting out fresh with the Alta HR, you'll probably love it.
 I ordered this a few months ago and waited awhile to review it. Works perfectly, although I don't know if I believe the sleep part. According to the Fitbit, I only sleep around 5-6 hours a night! Whaaaaaaattttt??
 Sitting on my computer for an hour or two and the device logs in hundreds of steps. This upsets as it may affect calorie counting and become an inaccurate source. The sleep monitor and heartrate features are good. I also appreciate the notifications  the watch gives when receiving a text or call. The main purpose for me was the calorie counter and sleep, seeing as one is not consistent enough I am not very happy with my overall experience.
 Product warning. THERE WAS NO FITBIT ALTA in the box. It was sealed from Fitbit in the external bag and the product box. Instructions and charging cable included, but the molded depression had no wristband or Alta. Purchased as a Christmas present for youngest son. Only opportunity to open was 12/23. NO PRESENT! Very disappointing. I want to stress that this was not a Amazon problem, since the package was sealed and Amazon offered a replacement. Replacement won't be here until two days after Christmas.<br/>A warning for other purchasers especially if going to be given as a gift. Open the sealed bag and check the box before gifting. Avoid my problem.
 Bought my husband the fitbit Charge 2 which is very nifty - I would have bought one for myself but the form factor is too big.  So I was really looking forward to getting all of the Charge 2's functionality in the smaller Alta HR.  Alas, it's just not for me.  For starters, it doesn't actually have all of the functionality of the Charge 2.  Can't set it up for treadmill or elliptical, for example.  And although I did get the correct size (small) for my wrist, the Alta HR is really uncomfortable for me.  Even though it's definitely smaller than the Charge 2, it's just as thick, and the tracker part is wide enough that it presses down in a very annoying way -- doesn't matter how tight (or not) I make the band; doesn't matter if I rotate it so the tracker's on the inside of my wrist.  So if you covet one of these, as I did, probably want to try one on before buying.
 I love my Fitbit Alta HR...the only drawback is that it's hard to read when outside and that you have to tap it several times for it to show up.  It's great!
 I'm reviewing this product after 1 year and I'm very happy with it! May be time to upgrade, but it has served its purpose. The steps are pretty accurate, sometimes "active time" can be off , but that's not big deal. HR isn't always right, but that's bond to happen once in awhile. Recommend to buyers!
 Arrived functioning and in good shape.  I’ve worn my product all the time, day and night, except when charging it for two hours, every 5 or 6 days.  So far it has held up pretty well!  Love the Fitbit combined with the app.  Helps me keep track of my daily fitness goals as promised!
 I started 5 years ago with the pocket FB tracker and have upgraded every so many years. This is my favorite as it is not so large, I where on dominate wrist as I still like my watches. Good accuracy on HR monitor and the all black is very nice.
 love the size,color and design - it functions well<br/>but i dont like tapping to get display. It works eventually,<br/>but it's not like a touch screen- you have to tap hard
 I love fitbit but this one is only mediocre. I’ve had so many issues with syncing. My iPhone XS has no problem connecting with any other device. Wish i had spent extra and got an Apple watch.
 Wish it was waterproof. I keep jumping in the pool with it but it still works. The tapping is annoying and does not work well but I don't tend to look at it much except what is on the main screen which shows up on the twist of the wrist. I bought a better band than the one it comes with because it is clunky.
 I bought this for one of my daughters and she never takes it off.  She does a lot of walking at work and keeps my up on how many miles she walks.  She also loves that it is a watch and receives her text msgs.
 Once the novelty wore I off I didn't end up liking it.  Stuck too far out from my wrist and didn't give me enough motivation to be worth the price.  I ended up giving it away.  The only thing I did like was that is synced to the WW app.
 Got it for wife and she loves it.  Uses it all the time to track distance walked and exercise at gym.  Very good battery life.  Easy to link with phone app.  She likes the app too.
 Even with technical support I cannot get it to connect to my computer or my phone.
 I’ve ordered three different Fitbit watches and have trouble with all of them. This one, I can hardier ever get the screen to come on. I bought a knock off that works better
 Not recommended. It doesn't sync with Apple Health App and the developer refuses to add the funcionality even when hundreds of people are asking for it.  I returned mine for a refund and i am ordering one that shares data with Health app.
 This thing changed my life.  The weird thing is I just started taking the reminders seriously and it works! Don't mock yourself. When it says you owe 200 steps, get up and walk it out. I'm recovering from back surgery, and 3 months later I am walking miles every day.
 My old Fitbit died after less than 2 months of use. So I ordered this one. It came dead on arrival. Fitbit told me to send it back and they would send me a new one. I had to pay for the packaging to return it. Just got the “replacement” today. All it included was the face, no band and no charger. It’s comepletely unusable. If I want to even gamble that this one will actually work, I’ll have to order a band and charger separately to replace the ones they told me to mail back! I’ll never order another Fitbit.
 DISPLAY IS NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH and barely readable with my 20/20 vision.  I researched this issue and FITBIT lists it as a known issue they are doing NOTHING ABOUT.  Well....I will be doing nothing much with this but returning it.
 The watch looks beautiful but the band opens up for no reason and the watch falls off.  This happens multiple times per day so it's just a matter of time before it's lost.  Don't bother unless you want to replace weekly.  Gets expensive.
 I love this fitbit!! The color is great and I get tons of compliments. It is comfortable enough to sleep in. Charge lasts 5 days for me!
 If love my Fitbit ! At one point I had to resend but have since learned how to track my weight/ strength days and best yet, I can sync to mycigna and get points for staying active. I guess it's like an affirmation that I am doing something great for myself. And I love that I don't need a watch and a fitness tracker so it's practical to wear all the time. I'm also learning about the importance of learn rate too. I highly recommend the sleek fit if the Fitbit hr Alta - I absolutely love it!!
 Good tool to have. Does what it should do. But touchscreen is finicky and not responsive at times. Also this bad does not auto detect exersize periods.
 Very difficult to set up. Once I set up it worked great for about a week. Then it began to count steps incorrectly, wouldn't sync, wouldn't start working and displaying until about 11 am. Such a overpriced item with zero reliability. I do not recommend this product.
 love my altar!!
 While it worked it performed as promised but at 11 months it would not hold a charge and Fitbit refused to honor the year warranty!
 Got one of these and loved it until it was time to charge it for the first time and I noticed the charging cord was damaged and wouldn’t work. I am waiting for a replacement. Also the pedometer is a little disappointing but other functions are quite interesting.
 The Alta HR has what I needed and works great. Heart rate monitor is right on or within 2 of my Orion blood pressure cuff. It does have a high profile which tends to catch on things easily, so would consider the Charge 3 due to its thinner profile if I had a do over.
 I had 2 fitbits prior to this one and they lasted for years. This purchase lasted 4 months. It suddenly stopped charging. Perhaps it was a lemon of the bunch, but it certainly did not last long.
 Bought my Fitbit Alta HR  not long ago through Amazon and 7 months later, it’s no longer working.  The screen turned black (off) and will<br/>NOT turn on. The battery is fully charged .  So don’t know what went wrong.
 I love this Fitbit! This is the 4th style of Fitbit I have had so far and it is by far my favorite. I had the flex &amp; flex 2 (loved them both but they broke) &amp; I had the one that resembles an Apple Watch. I liked the features but it was too big... the Alta is the best of both worlds. Gives text notifications and is still nice and small!!
 Got this for my wife for Christmas.  She likes the reminders to go do something, and she enjoys the little fireworks.  She also likes that it monitors your sleep profile.
 The fitbit was interesting, but it never held a charge for more than a few days and after less than a month it stopped charging altogether. I contacted the company and they agreed to replace it. It took 1 1/2 weeks for the replacement to come and then it was only a partial replacement. If I had known they were going to take so long and not replace the whole thing, I would have returned it to Amazon for a total refund.
 The heart rate monitor isn't accurate when working out, which is the main purpose I ordered this. Unfortunately, I missed the return window by a couple of days. I tried to give this a chance, but it was a huge waste of money.
 I have to tap it MULTIPLE times in order to get the screen info to appear. This is a big hassle. Sometimes nothing shows up at all despite battery being charged. It does NOT turn on when you raise your wrist. So finding out the time is a task, not something that should be easy to see.
 Was weighing an a Fitbit Alta HR vs an Apple Watch 3, and for me the deciding factor was indeed weight. I wasn't looking for an all-purpose computer on my wrist; I wanted a device to help me focus on my fitness goals. The slimmer profile and lighter weight of the Alta HR made it the winner.
 I ordered this to replace my much-loved and well-worn Charge HR.  It finally died, and I thought now that the Alta had HR capability, it would make sense to try a smaller profile.<br/>Found the Alta display to be awkward - the horizontal option required a turn of the wrist to view, and the vertical which I chose was truncated and annoying.  Worse was the fact that to light up the display, I often had to tap repeatedly.  Returning and ordering the Blaze.
 Overall, really nice. The part where the straps connect to the watch became loose fairly quick and eventually fell off. Luckily you can buy a whole pack of replacement straps in all colors for really cheap and it fixes the problem.
 Only after 8 months Fitbit Alta HR does not work.  Cannot charge battery.  Very disappointed.  What is the warranty policy on this item?  I should receive a replacement free of charge.  Please advise who I can contact to get a replacement.<br/>A very disappointed consumer - Patricia Jones
 My fitbit and I are now best buds.  We go everywhere together and it tells me when to get off my hind end and move. I like to see how many steps I've taken and to sync it with my Weight Watchers app and scale. It's what technology is supposed to do for us humans.
 I got this for my mom since i got the charge 3 for myself.i love my charge 3 but this one gave me a struggle to setup then i cant get the notifications to work.i refused to pair woth the phone.i have tried everything suggested.very dosappointing and frustrating
 I had a Samsung gearfit 2 pro before this and I am much happier with this Alta hr. It serves my needs better and the battery life is days longer than the Samsung.
 And it's a watch too, which is super convenient.
 This was a Christmas present for my daughter. The charger was missing from the box so it cannot be used until we receive a replacement. Very disappointing.
 This is a great dainty Fitbit.  The only drawback is that I miss knowing how many flights of stairs I've climbed.  The heart rate monitor is good, I like the improved sleep monitoring and I LOVE that I can change the band.
 The fitbit itself is fine, but the band keeps popping off of the device.  I'm on my second band now, and it started again.  Fitbit replaced the first band because it came off during the warranty period, but when the replacement band had the same problem a few months later, they refused to replace it again.  Beware that if you buy this product, you may have to shell out $30 a year to buy a new band.  I'm not sure whether there is a design defect with the device or band.
 Won't hold a charge.
 Worked well for the first year and a half. Now I have to charge it twice a day and that's with all the toggles off to save battery. Disappointing.
 LOVE my Fitbit. Helping me reach my fitness and weight loss goals. I didn't even realize how good the calorie counter element of this app would be, but it's awesome. I also use the Coaching app that syncs with this for indoor workouts.
 I bought this about 2 months ago and so far so good. I find most of the basic activity tracking is accurate but occasionally I'll have to delete erroneous activity logs or adjust them, particularly for non-cardio based workouts such as lifting.<br/><br/>The sleep tracking/insights and heart rate monitor are what drew me to this product and both work fabulously. I hope with future software updates Fitbit will expand some of the functionality/tracking available for these features.
 This band was more expensive than the one sold on the website, I found out later, and within six months the band became loose and  came off. I switched the bands but the problems persists. nothing seems damaged apparently.
 she loves it
 I found the readout too small for my taste. Difficult to read outdoors, even when in the shade. All the features are nice but not a good fit for these old eyes. A larger model my be the answer.
 So wish I could say that I was happy with the product, but my second Fitbit just broke at the year and 2 week mark making it AGAIN out of the warranty.  First one was as Alta and the second the Alta HR. Think it is it time to look at better quality merchandise.
 Paid the extra money for the pretty pink but the color rubbed off quickly and has a bluish hue.  Looks dingy now :(
 This is PERFECT!  It fits well and is sturdy in construction.  The Fitbit is a very motivational tool for me as it reminds me to get off my but and get to WALKING!!  :)
 Love it. Wear it every day.
 Not only did the straps break after a few months of use but Fitbit customer service as gone way downhill. They required a handwritten note and a picture of the damage and still wouldn't replace it. Ill be looking for a better fitness tracker.
 I was in love with my fitbit until I began to excruciating pain from it. My wrist has a mark on it like it has been burned and the pain in my wrist was unbearable.  i had to take something for the pain and not where it for a few days for the pain to stop.  Please let me know why this has happened and what can be done about it.  I have a LOVE/HATE relationship with my FitBit.  HELP!
 This device causes a rash and is generally uncomfortable when I wear it. I wanted to return this product but apparently if it is purchased through Amazon, fitbit’s 45-day return window does not apply. Pretty deceiving imo since I bought the product through fitbit’s amazon account that the company created themselves. Very unsatisfied, will never purchase a Fitbit product again, and I will be telling my friends and family to do the same.
 I *really* wanted to like the Fitbit Alta HR, it has some really cool features (love the sleep feature)!  However, the main reason I bought it was for how many calories I burned while exercising.  Which is where this Fitbit falls short.  *I am aware that no fitness tracker is 100% accurate and is to be used as a guide.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>1) Sleep tracker is really cool! (Again, not 100% accurate but still useful)<br/>2) Heart rate monitor seems to be pretty accurate--I tried it with multiple machines at my gym and they were within 1 digit of each other (ex: 129/130)<br/>3) Fitbit Community Forum is helpful!<br/>4) Still connects to my phone even at work, I am usually between 30-50 feet away from it.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>1) Tracking (real time) exercises only gives 3 options: walking, running, and hiking. Any other exercises you'll need to use auto-tracking.<br/>2) Auto-tracking exercises works about 60% of the time.  You need to have a consistent heart rate for at least 15 min (you can adjust it to 10) but it will sometimes only save part of your exercises *after* you hit that 10/15 min mark.  For the times it doesn't auto-track you have to manually enter your exercises.<br/>3) When manually entering exercises, the "calories burned" are *not based off of your own data* it is based on a population average. (found this out from fitbit community) I noticed that it was saying I burned way more calories for some exercises than what was possible, (ex: said I burned over 600 calories for jogging 30 min on a treadmill).  The amount of calories burned was the main reason why I bought it, and I was so angry when I found out it was based off an estimate rather than my own data.  Seriously? Did I pay over $100 for an estimate? I can do that crap myself for FREE.<br/><br/>*Again, I am aware that no fitness tracker is 100% accurate, and should be used as a guide, but again if it's based off an estimate and not my data then it's useless to me.<br/>I tried different suggestions from the Fitbit community to hopefully fix my issues, but unfortunately, nothing worked. (if you have an android you might have a chance)<br/><br/>After this I decided to return my Alta HR in exchange for a Charge 2 HR. I have a friend who uses it and says it'll do exactly what I'm looking for.
 you get messages and phone call alerts but your phone has to be near you. if not you won't get notified, I also wish the clock would be displayed at all times instead of having to twist my wrist. I'm keeping my Fitbit though its simple and motivates me.
 My wife LOVES this fitbit. It is something she wears constantly and she loves all of the features this one provides. It is small so she only takes it off to charge.
 These are ok. Colors are nice too but I prefer the original Fitbit metal clasps. They are much easier to put on and off on a daily basis.
 I wpuld give 5 stars but was recently on a camping trip and took this off to go in the water and the sun totally zapped the battery even though I had charged it completely just the day before.  Other than that it's great!
 Since I got this, I've found that the charger is very finicky to get to connect and start charging. I consistently clean the elements, but still have issues with getting it to charge. As of the last month, It doesn't seem to link to charge at all. I've only had this for a couple months now. Very disappointed.
 Love it.  Don't think about it.  Just get it. Sizing is trouble free.  Even a or will fit a small wrist because there are so many holes. Easy set up.  I just YouTube's it. I was all set in about five minutes
 My Fitbit initially worked well but the band became a problem. The band constantly popped opened. Unfortunately, I ended up losing my Fitbit at the Atlanta airport nearly a year ago.
 Awesome, lightweight watch! I love my FitBit Alta HR. It tracks my steps, distance, heart rate, sleep patterns, and exercise. Setting the watch up to Bluetooth on my phone is a plus as I can view messages on my screen. If you want to know just the basics of your overall movement/fitness level I suggest this watch!
 After owning the Nike fuelband and the Jawbone Up4, this is my least favorite workout band, and this band device wears horribly.  It's not worth the price, and as of today, it's come unloose three times this morning, so basically I'm at risk for losing an overprice workout band.  Don't waste your money.
 This has saved me. So I work as a secretary and I have lots of injury due to a car accident. It was advised that I be more active which is hard to do in my work place. But the Fitbit is extremely helpful. It gives me reminders to get up and move. The app helps me with my calorie count. And it made me realize I do not sleep enough. I adore it.
 I do like the smaller size of the face, Wish it were flatter to be more comfortable. It just doesn’t record the time I go to sleep accurately. At least once a week it records I fell asleep hours later than I did. Last night, I went to sleep about 11:45, this morning FitBit said I went to sleep at 4:23 am. One of the biggest reasons I bought the thing is to record my sleep cycles, but so far not happy with it. It does keep steps pretty well. But wish it were more accurate with sleep.
 I love this Fitbit So Much!  I love that it tells me if I am getting a call or a text.  It's easy to read and the battery stays charged for several days.  Its very easy to change the band color.
 Works perfectly and I’ve had it for months now! Read the description- TRUE to stated description. This is a cool gadget to have and I prefer it over Apple Watch. It’s simplicity is what I love most!
 I like it.  Lightweight.  Just seems like I have to tap it quite a few times to get the screen on.  But other than that, works good.  I also like all the features it has when it's synced to your phone.
 Gift for the wife and she loves it she had a Charge HR 2 and which was a little bulkier than she liked so when the Alta HR came out I treated her to a Slimer model. She adores it
 Easy to use. Keeps me motivated because I'm reminded to move and get those 10,000 steps. I check the app on my iPhone multiple times a day. The best part is it doesn't scream "I have a fitness tracker on my wrist!". I ordered the black and gray version, but wish I would've purchased the black band instead. I think it would be even more discrete if it was monochromatic.
 I am so glad I decided to buy a fit bit!! I was between the Alta HR and the Charge 2. I decided on the Alta HR because it is smaller and it would fit on my wrist better and now that I wear it everyday I am glad I chose the smaller of the two. I just wish the Alta HR counted the flights of stairs I walked everyday.
 I had wanted the Fitbit Alta HR for a long time, I had open heart surgery and it had all the features I wanted in a small package. Now the only time I take it off is when I shower or it needs charging. I Love it because it tracks everything from sleep and exercise to heart rate. It was a great choice for me.
 I received my Fitbit Alta HR the following day!  I love the Alta HR - it will remind me to get up and challenge me to complete 100-200 steps.  I love the heart rate and sleep monitor.  This is a great device.
 I use this everyday and it does the job. This Fitbit does a great job at tracking everyday movement and my CrossFit workouts. I do wish that it was easier to read text messages on.
 Heavy drain on phone battery. Only way I can use the Alta HR is to turn off Bluetooth and log out of the Fitbit app then turn back on once a day to sync. Would not buy again.
 I love my Fitbit Alta HR. It has totally motivated me to get active! I love the little notifications it gives me to remind me to MOVE. Like "Wanna Stroll?", then rewards me when I do with... "Nailed It!" Battery lasts me a week &amp; recharges in less than an hour. Gives the time &amp; date, number to daily steps, Heart rate, Calories burned, Daily miles &amp; Active Minutes. Nice, slim and comfortable. I have had it since January 2108 and I would highly recommend this product.
 I have used Fitbit for years and last 2 has issues after 15 months but with 2 years warranty , that was quickly replaced with a new one. However they changed the warranty to one year only and then again major issue after 15 months . All they said is they can not fix it, I just have to buy another new one ! Who spend more than 130 for a fitness tracker and only last for a bit more than a year ! Shame that it's a design but the quality does not match up !
 The heart rate and sleep monorting feature make this a great health companion. The app is very user friendly! Lightweight design. The blue/gray color is very nutural and wears well with most clothing.
 This is a terrible product. It spends more time on the charger than on my wrist. I have had it only a month and the strap just broke. Buy something else. This one is terrible.
 There is a bit of a learning curve adding and learning the tricks for a new Fitbit device but the additional feedback is well worth the effort!  Like the smaller sized face.
 Awesome!! Helps me manage my daily schedule and keeps me motivated.
 I just unboxed and started using about 2 weeks ago. Last couple days fitbit stopped taking a charge when plugged in.
 I've purchased a Charge HR, Charge 2, and Alta HR in the last two years, for my girlfriend. There were tracking issues with both the Charge HR and Charge 2, but there are so many issues with the Alta HR that she refuses to wear it and went back to her Charge 2.<br/><br/>I missed the 30 day Amazon return policy by 4 days. I then contacted Fitbit, as they have a 45 day satisfaction guarantee. It turns out that is only if you purchase the product from their site.<br/><br/>I don't plan on purchasing another product from them.
 I love love love my Alta HR in Rose. It works and does everything it says. Two cons not being waterproof and scratch resistant. I did scratch it getting out of my car. It's a small scratch not noticeable but I see it. So I recommend purchasing the shield protection with the watch right away so that you can put it on the watch before wearing it. Besides that l love the product i hope they do come out with a newer Alta Hr but waterproof.
 It's my third Fitbit, and first two started to malfunction within a year of use, but I've read reviews about improved quality of Alta hr and decided to give it a try.<br/>Very well made, and very accurate, with a sturdy feel.<br/>But after only two months of use heart rate monitor just died.<br/>The most annoying part is that Fitbit support refuses to send the replacement to my country, while they were able to send one that I bought here without any questions. So buy that on your own risk.
 I bought the Fitbit Alta HR in July 2018. I loved the way this Fitbit analyzed my sleep. The only problem was the band would disconnect at the face of the watch. I would reconnect it, by snapping it back down in place. Unfortunately, the last time this happened, I was not aware, so I no longer have my Fitbit Alta HR. I would not recommend buying this product, since I’d be afraid to lose it again.
 I love this so much. I previously had the Fitbit change HR and while I loved it for most of the same reasons, I really wanted a smaller band. So now that the Alta has heart rate I knew I had to give it a go. I’m not sure if I sync this one more than I did the other but it does seem to need to be charged a lot. That’s the only complaint I have.
 Incorrect statistics!<br/>Called Fitbit and rep claimed this sometimes occurs and to just reset the statistics.<br/>Seller never responded to return request.
 Broke had fitbit send replacement and after 2 weeks that one broke as well... Stay away from this!
 I bought one of these watches when it came out.  My mom ended up using it one day and she loved it I had to buy her one!<br/><br/>Easy to set up with the app, tracks heart rate accurately, and has so many useful features.  It isn't bulky or uncomfortable to wear, sometimes I fall asleep with it on forgetting it's there.<br/><br/>Overall, great watch, comfortable, and durable.
 I would please like to know who to speak to about replacing my Fitbit
 Bought as a gift. I have one myself that I got as a gift and love the heart rate and sleep information. Now we can compare.
 Love this!! It shows everything possible and I've lost 30lbs already by trying to beat my friends in our weekly competitions!!
 Be warned. It is not compatible with every phone. I spent 2 hours trying to get it to connect and never did get it connected even after following all of their troubleshooting ideas. I finally found an article online that states that not all phones are compatible including the one that I own. I'm sending it back.
 Why do they only offer a 45-day warranty? I'm on #3 Charge and its already having issues within 69 days.<br/>DO NOT BUY!
 Bought for my mom. She absolutely loves it. She prefers its slimmer design that the Charge 2. Only wish it was waterproof.
 used it for a while, and it sure is a well made device and nicely small. after half a year or so it got boring though to track myself
 I'm very sensitive about jewelry - I rarely wear it. But this is so light (and doesn't shift around) that I don't even notice it. App is intuitive to use. The sleep tracking is with the cost of admission. I'm enjoying this process very much.
 I have really small wrists and am not used to wearing watches. With its small size it was easy to get used to. I wear it everyday and love that accuracy of steps, heart rate, and sleep tracking. Just wish it was waterproof.
 Good quality and works excellent
 Bought originally to track sleep and heart rate, knowing that it isn’t 100% accurate but the functions are neat. The only thing that leaves me wanting something else is a reminder to drink water and a way to turn the fit bit off when you aren’t wearing it. All in all worth it!
 This Fitbit worked great for a few months. Within 3 months, it stopped tracking my heartrate and sleep. I learned these two functions work together. I tried all the troubleshooting recommendations on the Fitbit site and none worked.  Fitbit replaced my damaged one with a new one - no charge. So far, so good with the new one!
 I love this fit bit it tells my heart rate incoming calls and texts,time,date and then I can check my phone for all my exercise info
 Definitely purchase the warranty. Screen is so fragile- especially for being a fitness tracker. I cracked mine in 30 days while I was washing a glass pitcher and hit the glass- not even hard. Lesson learnt.
 Wasn’t sure I’d like going from a watch to this but I love it. Best part is the sleep analysis. Battery lasts long too
 It's interesting to see my heart rate, sleep patterns, steps, exercise, etc.  However, it gets confused when I ride my motorcycle and thinks I'm walking..???  Sometimes it loses sleep data....  But, overall, it's a fun way to challenge yourself to be more active and get better rest!
 Great for a few weeks and stopped working properly. Known issue with this model/batch not resetting with each day. Support unwilling to exchange and told us to wait until their engineers figure it out. It's been a week so far.... the market is flooded with more affordable trackers, I chose Fitbit because they're established and I thought, reliable.  With this kind of issue, should have chosen one of the new companies.
 I had the Charge HR and switched to Alta HR for a sleeker look. Now I am still wearing my charge HR to the gym because the Alta is not accurately capturing my heart rate during workouts. I read online that both watches use the same heart rate technology so I’m not sure what is wrong with my Alta. I would return but threw away the box upon opening it as I’ve purchased fitbits before and never had a problem.
 I had the Fitbit for a few months now and for tracking it’s great however my band broke off.  I’ll be contacting Amazon first and then FitBit as they have another deficiency in the design.  My first Fitbit that I bought at Staples 3 years ago the battery wouldn’t hold a charge and the strap broke off then too.  Not sure if I’ll buy another after this latest experience.
 So far so good! No syncing issues. I have figured out the tapping- tap two times(normal touch) and it works perfectly! I am little nervous about the band where it holds on the Fitbit itself, it’s a little loose but I will take it somewhere to have it looked at or check one in stores to see if it does it too! Other than that, it’s been great! And it’s PERFECT for little wrist people:)
 I have 2 manufacturing damages on the wristband in less than one year. The first one was replaced, but the second one (with less than 8 months of replacement) was not changed because of the policies. On a world of customer experience, I had higher expectations from Fitbit, but I'll definitely switch to another brand. I'm very deceived. I wouldn't recommend at all to buy such expensive wearable with so bad customer support
 Good quality and build. Step count isn't as accurate as I thought it would but it's expected being lower model. Mainly used for sleep tracking. Band is a bit stiff and gets a bit sticky when hot.
 awesome thing, if you are on edge S / L size better take Large you will have room for future. I was waiting for 1.5h of full charging after unboxing.<br/>For notifications from phone uses Bluetooth enabled all the time, which drains Alta/phone battery fast.<br/>Track sleep unexpectedly good (even for bad, mostly sleepless night its automatically detected all phases).<br/>Not shower-proof is a disappointment for me, but they call this out in specs so read twice before you buy :)
 The fitbit keeps losing the connection to my phone. I have had to unpair it and do the pairing process again. I have had to call the company help line twice so far and they have you uninstall and reinstall the app. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Then they do something and it stops working again. This is not worth the hassle.
 Wish I could give it negative stars...nothing like giving someone a gift that doesn’t work! Would not sync also you must tap the hell out of it for the display...probably why so many break within a few months
 I love my new Fitbit Alta HR! The coral wristband fits nicely and love the cool color!<br/>The order arrived very promptly.<br/>Thank you.<br/>Kathie
 This fitbit has been a hit. Love the color and that it's been so reliable. Had it on for months with no issues.
 i've had nothing but problems with this fitbit since i got it. Either completely inaccurate tracking sleep, heart rate, distance, length of workout, a work out or doesn't track at all. I've reset multiple times and still horrible. DO NOT BUY!!!!
 This is my 2nd Fitbit and last one.  I've had this a little over a year and the battery is shot - Fitbit support will not replace it.  I'm lucky if a full charge lasts 8-10 hours anymore.  Sorry Fitbit but I'm not going to spend $140 every year.
 Very good at keeping track of how I’m doing so I can accomplish my weight loss goals. I wouldn’t recommend for a serious athlete due to lack of more advanced features.
 When I bought my Fitbit, I was worried that I would use it for a month or two and then move on and forget about it. Not the case at all! I’ve had my Fitbit for a nearly six months and wear it every day. I really like the reminders to move, and this definitely motivates me to be more active. I haven’t had any issues at all.
 Purchased shortly after the device release (my band is grey) - generally like the wearable, however the step count is inconsistent when other movements can tick off a step and the biggest error is the Heart Rate - my device read 174 HR (70 yr old female) when I was walking on a treadmill at my health club - hmmmm, the treadmill read 105HR.  I'll believe the treadmill as my chest wasn't exploding.
 Fits true to size! Second fitbit I've owned. Wish it had the stopwatch like my old HR, but guess if I can upgrade later on. Works awesome! Ordered a small.
 I love my Fitbit watch. I use it every day and rarely take it off. I don’t shower with it. It tracks my sleep very well
 OMG. I love this. It's cute and fits my arm nicely, and it keeps track of everything. It helps me to keep in. My target heart range when I'm working out and helps me keep account of my activity so I know when I need to get up and move. Love it!
 Just what she wanted for Christmas.  My teen bikes and walks all over town and goes to the gym as well.  She didn't wait to get it on her wrist.  I saw her checking it throughout the day.  Good gift.
 Not terribly responsive. I need to tap it quite aggressively to wake it and change screens. Tracks steps and heart rate relatively well. Setting alarms is cumbersome and unreliable. My Fitbit has yet to notify me of texts and calls. Meh... It is wearable on my small wrist. Fit bit trainer app is gimmicky. I might spend more and get an I-watch...
 Opened the box and to my surprise the band was turned on, stickers removed from the face and placed on the bottom of the box, and rh and band had obvious signs of use on it. You know, that gunk that builds up on watches/bracelets/things of that nature from sweat and various cosmetic buildup. Super disappointing.
 Charge seems to go in less than one day, only works intermittently. Started malfunctioning immediately upon the end of the Amazon return period.
 Purchased for my wife. She loves the thin look/design. Good item for keeping yourself motivated to move around and track your activities.
 Love my Fit Bit , but it came with no paperwork so I don't know how to contact anyone if I have trouble with the product.  No information about a warranty or anything.  Wish I bought it somewhere else
 It seemed like a tad over-size box when it arrived, and it "rattled."  Easy to see why when I opened the box.  ZERO packing for the item.  Not very cool to see with any electronic device...  :-(
 expected it to be compatible with my LG G6, but it wasn't. though seller did refund my purchase price minus shipping cost once they received the product back.
 Love it and love the black color!<br/>This is one great activity tracker the you can wear on one wrist and wear your regular analog watch on your other.. it works as a sleek bracelet, and a great activity tracker. No to mention that the sleep monitor is very good in conjunction with the hr continuous monitor.
 My kid wanted one of these for their birthday and it was a Black Friday deal so it was a win/win situation!
 She loves it. Had one before but it didn't show heart rate. It lasted several years before it stopped holding a charge. Hopefully this one lasts as long or longer.
 Unit would not pair up upon initial setup. Will have to utilize the warranty I guess. Disappointed in this
 Overall it works well. Battery is still lasting over 5 days, but I should say I'm a very basic user - no automated/continuos sync. H<br/><br/>After about 9 months I had to replace the wrist band that broke despite of cautious use. Replaced with a large size just like the original size I purchased, and it is much bigger than the original.
 New fitbit is working just fine! The battery is lasting about 6 days which is wonderful! Not sure that the pulse meter is correct, but I'm well pleased with everything else.
 Love my Fitbit. Simple set up and navigation. Keeps accurate step and so much more. App is awesome and informative. Band has held up after a month of daily use slight darkening but nothing too noticeable. You can always buy a replacement band from the wide selection on amazon
 It  looked used and was missing the charger and instructions  and the box did  not factory seal and it  also had finger prints on the sceen poor quality control ...
 The one star is not for the Fitbit itself but the fact that I paid full price for this Fitbit, a new Fitbit, and when I opened the box everything had already been opened, there's dog hair in it, and the Fitbit is dirty. I am NOT HAPPY. I should have just bought it straight from Fitbit so I would be guaranteed a new product, since that's what I paid for. Also, the user manual is missing.
 I'm so glad I purchased the HR Alta! I went back and forth among several of the Fitbit styles before deciding on this one for my second tracker. Previously I had the clip-on Zip, but I wanted to upgrade, and I'm quite happy with this one!!<br/><br/>One of the big reasons I decided on this particular style was that it had the HR monitor but it wasn't bulky. I really like the streamlined look of the Alta. It looks more like a watch than a fitness device.<br/><br/>Also, with the HR feature, I now use sleep tracking, heart rate zones and resting daily heart rate to make my fitness goals a little more well rounded instead of solely focusing on getting in my steps for the day. I think the HR feature also gives a more accurate calorie burning calculator too.<br/><br/>The one downfall is that the automatic exercise recognition is not as good as I was hoping it would be. Many times it does not recognize my workouts. For instance, if I'm on the treadmill with the incline really high...my heart rate is borderline cardio/peak, but since I'm holding onto the bars instead of swinging my arms, the tracker doesn't recognize that I am working out. Really?? I would think the elevated heart rate would be enough for recognition, but apparently not. I have to manually enter many of my workouts, but as long as I keep careful track of the times, the readouts still match up pretty well.<br/><br/>Besides the drawback of automatic exercise recognition, I am very pleased with the purchase. It's cute, not obnoxious looking like some of the bigger fitness trackers, and it's making me more conscious of other areas of my health besides just my movement alone.
 The best sleep tracker but interacting with the software and connecting with blutooth is weird and clunky
 It does what it says it does, and it's small enough that I can still wear my watch on the other hand.
 Product was opened and the charger was missing
 This is a great tracker, and I like it much better than the Charge HR that I owned previously. The charging mechanism seems much more sturdy than the one for the Charge. My only complaint is that the band has already broken after only about 9 months of use. It's easy to order replacements; I just expected the original band to hold up a bit longer than that.
 My girlfriend loves this. Perfect Christmas present. Easy to set up and charge. App is easy to use, android version.
 Meh! It's quite literally unreadable in bright sunlight. You can't set anything but the time to a large font. The Android App periodically freezes and hangs (App v2.49 on Nougat 7.1.1). The App can't seem to figure out average pace length by distance traveled (GPS) divided by steps taken. The traveled distance reported by the App can often vary significantly from GPS or odometer sources. The tracker is clueless to alpine or telemark skiing activity. Bluetooth sync fails and must be reattempted about 1 of 4 tries. Maybe that's the Nexus6 phone? But there aren't similar sync probs with Fitbit One or AndroidWear devices. After 2 months consistent use, I have Fitbit regrets. Craigslist, eBay - maybe a hand-me-down to the kids - this won't be on my wrist much longer. But let me end on a positive note: With a huge variety of fashionable bands, this is currently among the most stylish lifestyle fitness trackers available. "It's better to loook mahvelous than to be mahvelous!"
 This was a gift for my daughter and she LOVES it! So far everything is working flawlessly. It really helps her be more aware of her daily steps and encourages her to move.
 Fits well and works well. I just have not been able to keep it from lighting up in the middle of night. I have read on it and tried all suggestions but it still wakes me. Also , unable to see it in daylight.
 I appreciate knowing how little I'm walking each day  and I appreciate being able to see my texts and calls. Unfortunately I feel that the bands are fragile. My bands started falling off less than 6 months in. It's disconcerting to have your fitbit pop off while running. Its the connection between the band and the device that warped really fast so I"m afraid replacement bands will have the same issue.
 I got this Fitbit and am returning it and getting another charge HR. I don’t like that you can’t manually set it to workout mode and it doesn’t display workout info on the screen during exercise. I like to be able to see my heart rate and calories burned during my workout. I love the look of the Alta HR because it’s so thin, but the trade off is not worth it to me.
 I love this fitbit. I have had two others but this one is much more accurate, and I can tell because tracking my calories burn out and in are so easy now I already lost weight with in the 1st week, and I have been struggling for a while with that! The band isn't as comfortable as the last fitbit I had, I may need to invest in a different one for my personal taste but other than that this works great!
 Does what is intended to do and looks good. It struggles to recognize taps sometimes and it over-estimates the calories burned each day.
 Comfortable and easy to read. Fits well with my other bracelets on the same wrist!
 It only tracked my heart rate when I was walking or on a treadmill, otherwise I would get a blank line or a heart rate that was 20-60 lower(I compared it various times with other heart rate equipment, plus if you’re winded and according to Fitbit your heart rate is 70, something is wrong). I tried all the trouble-shooting ideas on Fitbit.com. And worst, I apparently missed the Amazon return window.
 Product broke in less than 6 months. I thought this was for active use. I guess not.
 My wife loves it and wears it daily.  She loves seeing how it tracks her steps and sleep!  Definitely a big help in getting healthy!
 Works great - -first one I've had so I can't compare it to others. I almost DON'T  want to know how badly I'm sleeping...:)
 After a couple weeks i think the fitbit isby far worth the purchase this thing is amazing and if you use the app with it youll be on the track to fitness in no time.
 This is by far my favorite Fitbit. I like the streamlined look, and find the features more than adequate. Easily syncs to my Android, too. Planning in purchasing another as a gift for a family member who is currently wearing my old Charge HR.
 I am not prone to laudatory reviews but I am compelled to share my total and complete delight with this product.  I was previously a Fitbit charge HR user and while great for downtime it felt terribly clunky and unattractive for professional activities.  The size and the ability to exchange bands in seconds has made it a joy to use.  I am not training for the Olympics so the amount of information I receive is more than sufficient.  I<br/>purchased two metal bands and a set of multi-colored bands.  That pretty much sets me for everything.  Kudos to the designer!
 Once again fitbit products fail to hold up to their name. Every single fitbit i have owned, almost 10 now, has failed. This one was no exception. The unit is defective wouldnt connect to the phone out of the box. I called fitbit support and now i have to send it in and wait who knows how long for another subpar replacement. I cant believe they can still charge top dollar for the crap they sell.
 Can wear a traditional watch on one wrist and the Alta on the other that looks like a bracelet
 It is amazing, will never disappoint you.
 So far this is an amazing fitbit! I recently had to replace my old fitbit of 4 years, and this one is fantastic. I love the features, and the fact that you can read your texts on it. And the color is so pretty!!
 I am 68 years old and not very technology savvy  The instructions were so confusing to me.  I have not yet been able to use it because all it does is tell me the time.  I think getting a new phone might have something to do with it.  There were no instructions on how to charge the fitbit.  My 10 yr old granddaughter showed me just a couple weeks ago.  I would like to return it because it is too complicated for me but I see it is past the return date allowed.  I am on a fixed budget and can't afford to pay over a hundred dollars for something I can't use.  I get confusd easiy and leaning new things is hard if not impossible.  So my advice is this:  if you are older and want to try this, make sure you have someone there who can help you through the set up if you are like me and don't do well with technology.  I think I'll try to sell it online.
 The color of the band is discolored and dirty within the first week of a daily use. Disappointed with the color.
 Love, love, love my fitbit! Very accurate! Beware the light bands, they stain easily. Especially the pink ones. I wear black for work and my clothes stained the band black. Fitbit was great though and sent me a new one. I just don’t use that band unless I am wearing light clothing now.
 it got a bit confused with time zone changes....but got sorted in the end. light and small. does what it says. would be better if properly water proof, but i just charge it when i take it off to shower.
 I'm so done. After the pain I went through Amazon to get the money back for the original one I had returned in order to get the HR instead of the reg Alta, now the new one won't even work and I have tried EVERYTHING! Restart both device, and phone, and computer, and bluetooth, over and over again, different times, uninstalled, reinstalled, etc. I'm done.
 keeps me motivated to walk a little more each day. thanks for a super product. excellent shipping time.
 Wife had old one and now seems to like new one better
 Three months in and the wife loves it. Bigger screen than her last. Favorite feature is the one that buzzes at you every hour if you don't move around. Love / hate relationship.
 With new Fitbit Alta HR, I walk around more even in my office because it give notification on my wrist. The perfect exercise tracker to person who need some kind of notification to move like me !
 I love that this fitbit is helping me stay active but my band is getting dirty and Ive tried the recommendations of trying to get it clean. Not really working. I don't usually comment on things I've bought because they usually work out but I am disappointed that I have to feel self-concious about having to hide how dirty it looks after only a few days. Cleaning it with water or trying alcohol had no effect. I hate that I had to pay a little more to have the pink color too. Might as well have gotten the black band..Help?
 I think it tracks good but I don't like that it will show I have active minutes and then takes them away when I track that I was working out. Working out should count as active minutes
 This was a gift for my mother in law. Her old one broke. She loved it. Easy to set up and pretty color.
 Puts my effort into numbers I can understand and organize.  Nice assistance in getting healthy.
 Love this Fitbit! It helps me stay on track and has been helping me with my fitness goals. Color is gorgeous too! I am so happy I upgraded from my smaller clip on model.
 The fitbit alta package arrived in good shape with no broken seals. When unboxed, it was missing the dongle that plugs into a computer's USB port to allow wireless syncing with a PC.  The charge  cable was in a sealed package.  I have not charged nor registered the fitbit. Am I going to receive the missing part or will I have to return the package?
 Purchased for a gift and they love it, so far so good
 No option to have the the watch always display the time. And the display only lasts 3 seconds then auto turns off with no way to increase the duration. Be warned.
 I love checking out the number of steps I take a day.  It gives a lot of other information too.
 I've only worn this for less than 2 months and it is already tearing. I am not an athlete, and walking, vinyasa yoga and light pilates are the only exercises that I do regularly. I do not recommend this Fitbit band.
 Love my fitbit.
 Wonderful watch. Wear it everyday and every night. Keeps up with my a fib and keeps me updated. Love it.
 This is a great help in reminding me to get out of my chair at work more frequently - and since I'm also wearing it at night to monitor my sleep, the alarm feature comes in very handy.  Very happy with this purchase!
 Bought less than 2 years ago and it had died
 I feel bad leaving 2 stars, but after only 2 weeks, my Fitbit is broken and I cannot figure out why. I have not gotten it wet or anything, and according to the device I have paired it with it has a full battery. The display is completely black and will not turn on, even when I put it on the charging port. This is probably just a defect and I plan on returning it to get another one, but this was not a good first experience to have with this companies products.
 Great for tracking your sleep and heart rate. Had no problems so far, ad I use it every day.
 Too many "glitches" and "bugs." Number thrown up for heart rate are bs; they're just guessing. Sleep, what a joke.  Will be checking out competitors. Oh, and band only lasted 5 months. POS, will buy apple now. Would not reccommend.
 Love this Fitbit!! Everything I was looking for in a fitness tracker. The challenges with friends are great to keep you motivated as well As the reminders to move every hour. I was nervous about using the wake up feature but it is really nice.
 Honestly, I expected more... it records real-time only 3 types activities: run, walk, hike, no cycling, no spinning, no workouts, these need to be inputted afterwards. The screen scratches quite easily and it is totally UNREADABLE in the sun, which doesn't really go well with an outdoor sports tracker... On the other hand, the app is OK, and measuring of heart rate is quite accurate.
 I ended up returning the fitbit. It would count every single hand movement as a step- despite the dominant hand setting. I would wake up in the morning with a step count of over 200... um,  no!
 This works well except for tracking my sleep which was one of the reasons I got it. I have been dealing with sleep issues and wanted to track as I was working on improving my sleep. Most nights it doesn’t even show I slept.
 I love my Fitbit! It really has helped encourage me to get more exercise! And I love being able to track my sleep (and lack thereof). I am very happy with my purchase!
 My wife wears it all the time and says she loves it.  She's had other Fitbit activity trackers but says this is her favorite.  Like the size and feature...especially the HR monitor.
 I love my fitbit alta hr, it's been great up until today when it just died. One month, in fact, after the warranty ended so fitbit couldn't do anything about it except offer 25% off of a new fitbit product.<br/><br/>Otherwise it's a GREAT product, just be weary of that one year mark because, based on their support forum, it looks like this is happening to a lot of people
 I love my Fitbit. It’s easy to use and has all the features I need. I especially like the heart rate and sleep monitoring. The only con would be the coral band. It always looks dirty.
 Awesome, super and perfect. did not face any of the glitches others have mentioned. the belt is also great and durable. Also, the syncing is perfect and no lagging in step counts.
 i really liked this Fitbit..until only 6 months after owning it it randomly died....it starting vibrating all the time and then just died...i thought maybe it needed to be charged and when i charged it for a while it got super hot but didnt come back on.....im glad i didnt burn my house down!! Of course i didnt get the warranty on it...i will not be buying another one!! waste of my money!!
 Absolutely love my Fitbit Alta. Can’t go a day without wearing it. I’m totally addicted.
 sometimes it takes a few taps to make time appear, otherwise, very comfortable.
 Bought this for my mom and she absolutely loves it. Don't forget to check out all the custom bands they make for these as well
 I love it but feel it's too big  too long and too wide] for my tiny wrist.  Should have gotten the tiny one instead but not sure it had all the tiles I wanted on it.  I am going to get a different band for it because the rubber/hard plastic is so hard to work with putting it on and off when recharging it.
 This product does not track steps correctly. My steps are about 25 steps short for everyone hundred steps I take. Will be returning for an exchange.
 I've had the Alta HR a little over a month now, and it's wonderful. Coupled with the app, it's given me the motivation to stick with my commitment to a more fit lifestyle. My favorite feature is the sleep tracker. It's interesting to see how much time I spend in each sleep stage. There have been a couple instances of it not syncing with the app. But a quick restart of the phone and/or Fitbit takes care of that. The battery life is pretty good. Very satisfied with it so far.
 I received the rose gold Fitbit Alta HR today. It looks exactly like the picture if not a bit more muted in person which I think is great. I will give it 4 stars for now. I also ordered the gold and black Fitbit Alta and will be returning it. It was uncomfortable to wear and much heavier than the HR model. Also the band was very difficult to get on. The HR model is more expensive but spring for the extra cost. It is well worth it!
 I bought this for my wife and she loves it. It's light, carries a charge for days, and looks good. She loves getting info about her sleeping patterns.<br/>I'd say the main thing for her has been as a motivator. She checks her activity information a lot and it's helped to motivate her to do a lot more. She goes to the gym a lot more than before.<br/>My battery is dying si I have to stop, but I really recommend this.
 I would not be without my Fitbit to count my steps. This is my second one I upgraded myself to the ulta from the charge and so happy I did.  This is nice and thin and looks so nice and works get on counting my 10,000 steps a day.
 Just over a year since I purchased the fitbit alta hr and the screen has completed quite working. Fitbit costomer service offers a coupon for towards a replacement. I doubt that I will spend my money on another fitbit  product.
 Don’t purchase any Fitbit products! I purchased the fitbit Alta HR and they make watches that don’t last!! Bands will break within 6 months and FITBIT REPRESENTATIVES can’t do anything about it!!! It’s best to just invest in an Apple iWatch!
 Love!!!!! Perfect fit, beautiful color. Works great!!! Very impressed.
 I love this! Excited to wear it to work today &amp; see how many steps I get running around the pharmacy. I ordered the small &amp; the fit is perfect. I love that it tracks my sleep stages &amp; the app is easy to use, very straightforward.
 The display had a broken display so it had a weird pixel line going through the middle of the screen. :( Will be returning this product.
 I bought this fit bit for my mom who has never had one.  Mom loves it.
 This is very light weight and fits very well. This is helpful because it monitors your sleep along with all the other qualities of the FIT BIT
 My wife has fallen in love with her fitbit. It's making her realize so many things about herself that she wasn't aware of such as HR, sleep, pulse and activity levels
 Great  product. I love the sleep tracking and heart rate functions.
 BOUGHT A CHEAP KNOCK OFF FOR MY MOM LAST YEAR.  THIS YER I'M TREATING HER TO THE REAL THING.  SHE WILL LOVE IT
 I wasn't sure if I'd like this more than the Flex 2 but it has definitely kept me more active than ever!! It is a little bulky but the heart rate monitoring is worth it. During my workouts I get a much better sense of how active I am and I also love being able to see who is calling/texting!
 The new wristband is much more secure with the buckle, and it seems to give more data bout sleep and exercise. The green lights against my wrist sometimes distracts me when I'm trying to get to sleep, so I'll do without on restless nights but it is comfortable and unobtrusive for the most part
 Bought it for my wife and she love it.  I may buy one for me too.
 Long battery life. As a bonus, texts are received on the unit too. I did not know this when I purchased it, but I am very happy with the feature.
 I had the Charge for over a year.  I love this more streamlined band and the ability to check the battery and turn wrist to see time and heart rate.<br/>I ordered a new band and much prefer the magnetic catch on the metallic band I received.
 A pretty good and elegant piece. I bough it for my for my girlfriend. It is a bit less then the charge 2 so it is disappointing that both of these has got the same price tag.<br/>This one does not follow elevation as I saw and since it does not have any buttons the touch screen can be a bit frustrating sometimes as the actual display is very small.<br/>I would recommend the charge two instead of this but it all depends on your needs.
 This was a replacement for my old Fitbit that died. It works fine. It’s a bit more difficult to fasten to my wrist. Also, I ordered the smallest (youth) size for my small (ladies) wrist and I need to close it in tightest position.
 Put off getting a "smart watch" and I don't know why after buying this!! Would recommend to anyone trying to up their steps.
 Very happy with my purchase. Just wish it recognized yoga. That’s literally my only complaint.
 I originally had the Fitbit Versa and LOVED it! Unfortunately, it was stolen from me after a month. I decided to buy the Alta since it was cheaper and am NOT a fan. It doesn’t accurately track my workouts or steps (which is the main reason I wanted a Fitbit). The strap also has worn super quick and the Fitbit falls off my wrist all day. Super disappointed.
 I bought this for my great niece and it working great. Doctors are using this for her sleepwalking and heart issues issues.
 Love this Fitbit. First one, having so much fun with my new little techno friend!
 I like that this is smaller than the other watches I've had. But I can't say I'm completely in love. My older fit bit always had something sweet to say when I would take it off the charger and this one doesn't. idk...maybe I've turned a setting off or something.
 A little uncomfortable to wear, quite thick. but all in all I do like it.
 I expected this to be amazing but I've only had it for a few weeks and the wristband is already super dingy. The Fitbit itself is great and I love the HR stuff but I paid extra for the special rose gold edition and I wish I hadn't bothered. I live a pretty stay at home life and I can't see why it would be this gross this fast!!??
 First time buying a calorie tracker. Amazed. I love it how it tracks sleeping routine and heart rate all the time. Very easy to use and i wear em all the tjme
 Use it daily and I love the options it offers in setting it up.
 Perfect fit! This is my first Fitbit and I love it so much. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks and I can’t go without it anymore. It’s really helped me to get out and go get my steps.
 Love my new FitBit! I'm prepping for a bikini competition so tracking my heart rate during workouts as well as my sleep has been really helpful. Makes it super easy to maximize my results! It's really comfortable to wear, charges quickly (and one charge lasts me about 3 days), and seems to give pretty accurate info.
 Less than a year old and it is not working properly.  I loved my Fitbit Alta HR the first six months, then it stopped picking up my heart rate and then it stopped doing the detailed sleep pattern.  Now a charge will only last 8 hours.
 Band broke bought another .. broke again now lost .. waste of money
 it works ok, I think, I was expecting more, the thing that bothers me the most is that I need to syncronize this at least 3 or 4 times a day if I want to receive notifications on it, like messages o calls. I am not happy with it.
 The watch does not respond as it is supposed to to a tap on the screen, so the only way I can see the screen is to put my arm down and raise it back up. The screen also looks "used" for a brand new watch. I'm not really very impressed. I have worn a Garmin Vivo watch for years, much better product, sorry I didn't go that route again.
 Too bad they couldn't include the stair climbing feature. Seems odd, but there you have it.
 Works perfectly.  So glad I purchased it. Wish I had purchased one years ago. I like the fact I can compete against my friends. Keeps me motivated.
 Battery doesn’t charge easily and to get the screen to turn on is not as easy as the other Fitbits.
 I found the heart rate monitor and step counter both to not be accurate.  It gave me way more steps than I was walking.
 This does not work well.  It does not count steos well at all.  I can walk for an hour and register just as many steps as when I sit for 50 minutes and walk for 10.  Loved my previous fitbit that lasted 3 years. Really dislike this one.
 I could've gotten the small but it would've been really tight in my wrist so I'm glad I got the large to be safe and it fits great. Battery lasts me like 3-4 days
 Love it! It tracks every movement I make and I personally enjoy the reminders to move and/or go to sleep as I can often lose track of time! Gave me a better understanding of my health and it helped me see how important it is for my body to get a good night of sleep.
 I did not know if I would like the fitness tracker but I love. So much so that I bought one for each of my daughters. If you are looking to track fitness I would recommend any of the Fitbit products.
 I like the style but two days in it is not accurately recording my exercise or HR. Going to try repositioning it and making it tighter during workouts. At one point it was 30 bpm off.  If it still won't work after adjusting I may return it.
 LIKE THE EASY SETUP ON MY ANDROIT DEVICES. WORKS AS DESCRIBED.
 Love my new Alta HR... i had the Charge 2 and love it also however this is more slim and sleek so this is my new favorite!
 Battery doesn't last even 5 days and I have continual sync turned off. Doesn't have my favourite feature of my jawbone, which was the alarm that would gently wake you. Wouldn't recommend.
 I love my fitbit, however, I would not have chosen this band color. After just a couple of days of wearing it, the band took on a discolored black color around the edges of the band. I tried the recommended cleaning products including rubbing alcohol, and still the discoloration remains. The band appears as if it is dirty when it actually isn't  :/ very disappointing.
 Great for checking your sleep, however the accuracy is questionable, and it fails to work most of the time when working out.
 I really like my fitbit but my wrists keep breaking out in a rash. It has done this since I got it. I switch wrists constantly.  Very aggravating. I have even tried to loosen the nand. Would return if I could. Pictures are of each wrist, currently.
 My first one lasted 8 months  before quit charging.  Got a second one as a gift, it charged the first time then couldn't get it to charge again. Called company, they said they would send a new one.  The sent only the face in an envelope.  It won't charge at all.
 The Fitbit alta was not compatible with the person's phone. We called Fitbit and they suggested complicated fixes and suggested my husband get a new phone. I was not happy with their customer service and returned the item
 I like how the entire thing is sleek, but I do wish the screen was more reactive when you touch it, you kind of have to tab it with a little effort. It definitely does the job with counting steps, calories, and heart rate.
 The second fitbit that has failed within one year. Poor quality. Period. Worked great WHEN IT WORKED.
 Love this Fitbit.  Easy to use, &amp; I like that it is smaller &amp; less bulky than some devices.
 Love it!  Especially how it seamlessly syncs with my Weight Watchers app for Fit Points. This has made me mindful of my poor sleep habits and they are improving too. Also like how I can track my water consumption with the Fit Bit app.
 Bought the coral color one and the band is discolored after two months.
 This is my third Fitbit, and while I like the tracker and wear it daily, I’m unhappy with the band. In about seven months, the band has broken.
 This is a great product. I like the idea of changing bracelets to make my clothes, too. It is interesting to see sleep patterns that can help us hopefully get into better and more healthy habits.
 I really like the band with clasp feature. Also I like the heart rate feature. Is comfortable.
 The fitbit package came used (seal was broken, missing instruction manual, cable not packaged) and the watch was defective.
 I’ve had it for 3 weeks now and it’s helped me keep track of my exercise and eating habits along with my sleep pattern. Very helpful.
 I’m sure not all of these arrive in the same shape!  This one didn’t work correctly from the box!!  Wouldn’t turn on, charged it fir hours and then it died after 30 minutes on.  The charged over night then it died after 2 hours in my wrist.  I returned it the next day.  So sad because I wanted it to work!!
 extremely inaccurate reading of HR. The higher the HR goes, the lower accurate it gets...<br/>I had to return the product back.
 I really like my fitbit.  I use it mostly to track my sleep, but also for steps.  I like that I can get my text messages.
 I like that the Fitbit is small.  I used to have a Charge, and that was too big.  The display in clean looking, but after you do your first 1,000 steps, it only updates every 100.  I don't like the charging station.  It is too easy to put it in incorrectly and there is nothing to tell you you did it right.
 I wish I purchased this earlier! I track my sleep, exercise and weight daily and it's a great motivator. I should use for water consumption and food log but I'm not there yet. I would have given it 5 stars but I can't sync with my S Health app
 This Fitbit is exactly what I needed to inspire me to exercise more. I realized after using this that I hadn't been walking enough, drinking enough water, and just how badly I was sleeping. Wow! I am just starting out on my quest to get healthier, and I think this will help me a lot.
 So disappointed! I only had the Fitbit for 8 months and only used it for 6 months and it broke! One day it just feel off my wrist. For something that cost so much I thought I wold have at least gotten a year out of it. I'm giving it two stars because it arrived on time and it did work and I did like it, until it broke.
 Count mine as yet another Fitbit Alta HR that was completely dead on arrival.  The help community on the company's website had posts suggesting that others had the same problem -- the unit was completely blank and unresponsive, and the charger had no effect whatsoever.  I decided to try their live chat, and after waiting a while for customer support, I had to describe the problem multiple times, confirm that I'd downloaded the app, and supply my account information and country information (annoying, as I had to supply all that information and more just to activate the chat -- why ask me twice?) before finally being told to return the item to Amazon or send it to the company for a replacement.  This was my first and last time dealing with Fitbit products.  Wish I'd listened to the other negative reviews -- don't waste your time or money.
 I loved my Fitbit until it started skipping sleep analysis nights rather randomly. I wear it snug so I’m not sure if there’s a problem or not, but I don’t see where there are any settings to select specific nights. I bought it in July 2018. Anyone else have this problem?
 Just kidding... It's for me.<br/>Just what I was looking for. Great battery life. Definitely more of an activity tracker than a smart watch. Looking for notifications and gps look elsewhere.
 My FitBit Alta HR stopped working after 2 weeks. Unfortunately, I can't return it because the Amazon return period has expired (I was travelling, so didn't start using the FitBit until after I'd had it for a month). Pretty upset by both the FitBit failure and the fact that I can't return it to Amazon.
 I love mine!!  I got this one for my daughter who also loves it. I feel the best part of fitbit is the community that it builds upon.  Connect with all your friends and compete and support each other!
 This is my third Fitbit and sadly maybe my last. I have had it since August and the wristband has started to fall off.. that is, it is easily detaching from where the band meets the device. If I want to reorder from fit bit, it is $30 plus shipping. I think that is too too much considering I hVe had it for 5 months
 Love this fitbit but the only draw back that it doesn't keep track of the stair climb.
 This was for my wife to replace an aging Flex, but providing her more information.  She loves it.  I like that the bands are so easily replaceable; the Alta HR becomes a fashion accessory.
 Love this Fitbit. It’s not bulky, works wonders !
 I have liked the product. Design, color size and function. I've had it 5 months now..almost and the band is coming off, constantly. Not sure why it started doing this. Anyone else having this issue. Now, I have to try and figure out what to fo about it. Trying to contact the seller seems to be difficult.
 I bought this for my mother in law and she loved the color; we set it up in the car on our way to dinner and before we ate she was wearing it and so excited to track her heart rate, sleep and steps. It’s the perfect size for small wrists and looks fun - I bought the fuschia.
 Great device to keep you motivated.  The band is hard to set.  Great link to my phone for texts &amp; emails.<br/><br/>Could never get the custom greeting to work?
 Works well, but is very difficult to fasten.
 First one didn't work right as it counted steps when it was in a jacket. They replaced it quickly and this one works great with zero issues
 New to FitBit, but works great for me without looking like I have a 1980s calculator watch on my arm.
 I've had my Fitbit for a month.  Now it will not charge.  I noticed early on that it was not as responsive to the "taps" as I thought it should be.  I've used the tips offered on their website and I can't get it to work.  I enjoyed the time I had it!
 I just got mine this week and LOVE it! Very accurate especially with heart rate and sleep. Love that is tracks my sleep! Light weight on the arm and functions great. Best 150 bucks I have ever spent!
 I love the color and the strap is very good quality. The band is very comfortable to wear. I got the large size for a 7 inch wrist and it would fit an 8 inch wrist.
 Needed a small Fitbit for my grandmother. This was perfect for her. Does everything needed without being a full size watch.
 Completely inaccurate on steps. Sleeping it said i was over400 steps. Then after not wearing to bed put on in am only taken 4 steps said I was at 52.
 Love my Fitbit. Get it - your health will improve. Bought mine - then  a week later got my husband the Charge2 and Fitbit scale. It helps you measure things that matter - sleep, activity and weight.
 This is the second one I have bought and lost because they do not stay on!!  There is a defect in the design.  DO NOT BUY
 Love it.  Motivates me to move a little bit more than I was. Though I'm nowhere near the 10,000  steps that are recommended yet. I like tracking my sleep and seeing the stages of sleep.  I haven't had it long but the battery seems to last the week and I have no arm pain or discomfort from the band.
 My package never arrived even though it was "delivered" about 48 hrs ago. I'm not sure how the package was lost or who's at fault, but Amazon has been pretty good about it and issued me a full refund. Anyways, I don't recommend buying from this seller.<br/><br/>So, I ended up going to a known electronics store and buying it there. So far, I like the Fitbit Alta HR very much. Though I'm still getting use to all the features. My favorite features so far are the sleep tracker and silent alarm.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you're between sizes, definitely go with the Small. I printed out Fitbit's size chart and I was a little over the line, but after talking with an employee, I decided to go with a Small and it fits great! I'm on the fourth notch from the end, so plenty of room there. All in all, my new Fitbit is great and I'm excited to explore all the features! I give my Fitbit 5/5 stars!
 Bought for Christmas for my mom. She loves it.
 Box came a bit damaged. And the fit bit itself is alot more bulky than i imagined it to be. Im sure the product is wonderful though, I bought it for my dad for christmas and he doesnt wear jewelry but he has been keeping up with his health alot lately. I just hope he likes it.
 Love it, fits great, accurate. I can get texts and know who is calling. Very easy to link to my phone as well.  Motivating buzz can be annoying but does remind me to get moving
 I love this, works well, looks great, you can wear bracelets with this, since it's not the big one
 Needs a ton of improvements; I can be in bed but the fitbit counts like 300 steps...
 The Alta HR is great and this one works fine.
 My second Fit Bit in 2 years and this one is dead as well. I tried resetting per instructions without success. I have to wonder of these are now made to be tossed away after less than a year of use?  If so, save the landfills and look for another fitness tracker.
 I got this back in July of 2018 and I absolutely loved everything about it. Problem is that I haven’t even had it for a year and the band just keeps falling apart on one side. I read some reviews and found that that is a common problem with these.
 I like that is has a small band as i am a small framed person. I like that it has the heart rate and it tells me when to get up and get walking. I like the app to monitor sleep/water intake.
 My fitbit no longer comes on but it still charges. Makes me sad.
 I purchased a little over a year ago band is Falling apart I called fit bit they said sorry one year warranty up cant help you. get a  extended warranty.
 I like this because I have tiny wrists and it doesn't feel huge.  Good device with easy to use app.
 I needed something to track heartrate, steps, distance and sleep quality. This does all that and it has a battery that lasts a week. I also have a small wrist and this fits better than others that I have tried. It is working fine so far and syncs well with my iPhone.
 Great price for the quality product I was looking for.
 Love it! I spent a little extra for the rose gold and it was worth it. It likes more like jewelry than a fit bit and I am back to my excersize routine for the new year.
 My mother has a bad heart and I wanted to give her something she could monitor it with. The problem is she doesn’t have any instructions that came with the watch and she’s a little old to be familiar with how to set it up on the Internet. Unfortunately it still Isn’t being used. Paper instructions with new devices should have come with!
 I love my Fitbit Alta HR. It lasts forever on battery it tracks when I’m exercising my heart rate and my calorie count. I even bought a weight scale and my Fitbit app interacts with the weight scales app. It has helped motivate me to exercise and stay healthy!
 I purchased 2 Fitbit Alta HR as Christmas gifts. It is much better than they expected. It's lightweight, the battery last a long time. The Cardio fitness is set up age appropriate and accurate and it will automatically recognize if you go for a run. It tracks your steps, calories burned, records you heart rate throughout the day and tracks  your sleep.
 I am very pleased with my new fitbit. It does a great job reading my activity and sleep patterns. My only complaint is the size. I have small wrists and this is heavy and sits up higher than I believed it would.
 I like the color.  I got the coral one and it's not as bright as the picture (which I find to be a good thing).  I am a new mom and wanted this to track my steps with a stroller, which it definitely does not do, despite the manufacturer saying it does.  This is very very disappointing.
 This frame that is different than the original one that came with the fit bit don’t like it as much as the original
 I like this one a lot more than the older fitbit I had.  It tracks your heartrate and sleep very well.  Also reminds you to move once per hour.  It seems to hold a charge very well; it lasts for several days.
 This device is getting me to be more active. I originally purchased it because of a health scare and am now working out everyday!
 Best purchase I've ever made. Imo actually better than an apple watch. Looking to upgrade to the Iconic one day.
 I love my new Fitbit! Great upgrade from the flex I have been wearing the last four years. Would recommend!
 Fits great, works well, looks good
 Wife loves this item! It was packaged well and delivered on time.
 This is my favorite fitbit yet! Love how slim it is, how easy it is to charge and change the bands, and it's overall functionality!
 Well constructed. Holds up to daily use without signs of wear a year later.
 She loves it for tracking sleep.
 Worked awesome good long battery
 Biggest gripe is that the "tap" function doesn't work very well, I find myself smacking it over and over until it registers
 No big thrill measures heart rate but the display is smaller then the alta i will be switching back<br/>Ok it the heart rate is all you want
 Bought this for the wife before Christmas this year and she hasn't had any issues about 5 months later!
 Pros- Flashiest Fitbit fitness tracker, Relatively light<br/>Cons- Not durable, Not waterproof.<br/><br/>Personal experience- Screen stopped working after I dropped it on concrete, however the tracker would still record my steps and heartbeat . The display didn't work anymore so I couldn't complete a simple task such as tracking time.
 This device works great, it counts my steps way better then my phone has and it is pretty easy to use. The best part is how it detects my sleep pattern.<br/>The only bad this is that the vibration for the alarm could be stronger and you should be able to pick different vibration patterns but that is just my option
 absolutely worthless - heart rate readings are often non-exisatant as my wrist becomes warm with running  bike riding<br/><br/>I'd gladly give to anyone - waste of my $$$
 didn't even last 6 months until it started flipping trough the different screens then the hr lights went solid and an hour later it died and became unresponsive glad I bought it on amazon day, full price would have been too much for this
 HOW CAN I GET A BIGGER WRISTBAND
 I went from a flex to the Alta HR.  Didn't think I would like the notifications and display but it's great when your phone is in your purse to see who is calling or texting.  Also, I use it mainly for the heart rate monitoring since I'm just starting to run.  I modify my workouts based on the summary of my previous workout.
 It is not comfortable. I could never wear it at while sleeping for the sleep functions. The display is not bright enough and is useless outdoors. I wanted to return it, but was one day too late! It does keep track of my steps.
 I really like my Alta, it is slimmer than my last one, love the reminders. Really like the band it's more like a regular watch band and stays fastened. I just love everything about the Alta.
 My wife uses this - it's thin enough for her wrist and is a good tool to keep track of daily activity. She has a small wrist so the "small" size is a good fit.
 worked great for exactly two months and then screen went blank.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is defective!!! No returns and no warranty from Fitbit! Seriously! Run! But not with this tracker!
 Excellent product. Great value. I am using the Alta for 1 month now. I hope it continues to perform for at least 2 years.
 Wow so I don’t review much but the Fitbit.....I wear an Apple Watch as well and really wanted to like the Fitbit. It has a few annoying things like not recognizing workouts in the gym as exercise but the most annoying is the clips. The band is constantly unclipping and falling to the ground in various flung positions, especially when exercising. It’s now resting on my night table.
 I love fitbit, my fitbit would not sync any more and after a short online chat with customer service they are sending me anew one
 This is an awesome watch! I love that I can see my heart rate at anytime. The screen is very clear and durable.
 I love this thing so damn much. I was using a Fitbit Flex, but wanted to upgrade to something with the heart rate feature. The only time this thing is off me is when I shower. 😝 Worth every penny! It also syncs seamlessly to my Aria 2 scale.
 Broke after 3 weeks. Inaccurate, and at least for me, not worth the money.
 Display gone within 8 months of usage.... sleep stats and steps aren’t accurate.... waste if tym and money.... still in warranty trying to run behind them for service.... please research well before buying, bad experience....
 It’s so easy to use and set up.  Lots of information is provided on exercise, steps, reminders, sleep, heart rate, food intake daily.  I love it.
 Great unit don’t try to save a few bucks you will send the off brand thing back and end up with this
 I'm having difficulty getting the time to display, and the sleep readings  are NOT accurate.  Have no idea if this can be adjusted, or if my Fitbit is defective.
 I bought this Fitbit as a way to help me lose weight and in the few months that I’ve had it, I’ve lost 15 pounds! It hasn’t been easy but the Fitbit definitely helped. Sometimes it fails to read my heart rate but I attribute that to my excessive sweating during workouts. Other than that, I love it!
 No problems at all and hold a charge well.  I do recommend a screen protector though because I got a scratch on my screen in the first couple of days!
 Much needed to track steps and sleep.  The app is great too. Thanks.
 Not a good product
 Upgraded from flex 2 to alta HR hoping for the convenience to see details on the screen rather than having the check the app on smartphone.  Also love the sleek design.  Very disappointed that the screen on the device is so weak, making it very hard to see anything outdoor during daytime. It's not a problem at night or indoor.  I'm returning this.
 I am sure it is more than ok, but my husband's computer will not support the app.
 I had a Fitbit Alta and wanted to track my heart rate so got this one. Love it so far. Been using for a week. Like the band too.
 After a few months it turned off and now won't turn back on. Was decent when it worked but it's not worth to buy for only a few months worse of proper use.
 Been wanting a Fitbit for forever and this one is awesome, the grey goes with anything and the band itself has enough notches to fit my small wrist which doesn’t happen very often. Battery life lasts around a week which is great and having everything connected to the app is super convienent.
 Love this thing! Much more wearable than other "smart" watches/trackers for a smaller wrist. Does everything need it to do.
 Gift for my daughter and she loves it. Not too large for a small wrist. The features are great and easy to use.
 It was perfect, works good, just slow on syncing with phone, but other than that works perfect. I can say that i have become more active since i got this.
 I like all the stats that it gives you when you tap on it as it tell you how close you are to your set goals.  I wear it from morning to night. The only problem that I've had is that is that it will not charge if I plug it into an electrical outlet (with adapter) and will only charge when I plug it into the electronic device.
 It’s a Fitbit it does what it says is going to do I haven’t had any issues with it it arrived on time I’m very pleased
 Poor quality.  The wrist band fell apart after 6 months of use.
 Never works right sleep cycles not working does not sync to phone am alarm only works 1/4 time not worth money Fitbit says fixing app over week
 I loved my Alta Fitbit so this year I splurged for the Alta HR and I love it! Works great and I love the sleep cycles feature, very interesting!
 No stairs. Erratic sleep measurement.  HR adds some value, but I preferred my One.
 Yes it's thin, but it's just as thick as it is wide. It's still bulky and unattractive. But all the features are great and I love the heart rate information.
 It stopped charging. I had it for a month and it stopped working. Very frustrating!
 Ended up returning this because there are better alternatives for less money. Touching the screen to change what was displayed didn't work or half of the time and the wake display on lifting your wrist almost never worked.<br/><br/>However, despite all of that, the step and heart rate tracking seemed very accurate. My gripe is about usability not about accuracy.
 Very hard to get it to respond when I tap it and with force. Goes in km...I wanted # of steps on the Fitbit not only on computer
 It was defective and didn't work.  I spent an hour on the phone with Fitbit to no avail.  After a lost day, I decided to return my Fitbit to the actual company and forego returning it to the amazon seller. I wonder if there is a difference between those fitbits sold by Fitbit itself or generic sellers of the product.
 So fun. Really keeps me motivated. The heartbeat tracker though, is AWFUL.
 It works well as expected. I like that I can read my new incoming  text on my Fitbit.  I also like that I can change the wristband too.
 So far I like it and feel it's an eye opener but I did think I wouldn't have to be on the app so much.  You can only see info on the watch not enter anything.  Also I ordered blue gray and received the black one.  I just ordered more bands.
 I love this device. It's great for tracking exercise, steps per day and tracking water intake. I highly recommend it.
 My Fitbit delivered everything promised and everything I wanted.
 I am not satisfied with the performance of this equipment. I have only had it 8 months and already it is malfunctioning. I would like to believe that I could have gotten at least 2 years from the product but I am sorely disappointed
 Really enjoying my Fitbit
 I absolutely love my Alta HR it has been my workout best friend since day 1. I initially just planned it to be my gym watch and switch to my fancy watch at work lol but it’s so sleek that it goes with every outfit.I love how accurate it is and how it syncs to my gym’s MindBody app.
 Just as advertised
 good as advertised
 Love the fitbit itself but the coral color got a frey dirty look on the edges after only wearing it for a couple hours! I expected the color to show wear after a few weeks but not one day. Very disapointed in that.
 I am so happy I bought this! It has helped me improve my fitness, sleep and overall health!
 I love the newer option with HR
 Works exactly as promised. Great looking. Holds its charge for 7-9 days. Excellent product.
 Perfect shipping. Timely delivery. Functions as designed. Perfect fit. I am very satisfied!
 Love it!! Tried the garmin watch but it was so big it bruised my wrist at night. Love the small size of the fitbit alta and the fact that it does heart rate now. Love it even more.
 My fitbit went dead after 2 months. Couldn't charge it and it won't turn on.
 I absolutely loved my Fitbit. However, 9 months later, the battery won’t hold a charge more than one day. Really not sure why. My boyfriend got one around the same time and his seems to be doing fine though... but I guess we’ll see.<br/>Up until now it worked wonderfully, not a single problem.
 This product does not record accurate data.  I walked on treadmill 3.5 miles and for the entire day this Fitbit Alta recorded 2.5 miles.  Either this device is faulty and I should have returned it promptly or it is just full of flaws.  I will contact Fitbit directly on this issue.  By the way, I had the old Flex and it worked beautifully.
 Pleased with this item.
 Love my fitbit!
 makes me work out more, i want to see those numbers go up ...love it
 Compared to a smart watch This Fitbit so slow to react to the user inputs.<br/>The band got awfully dirty after 30 days of use, my band was a grey/ blue isn’t a color looks dirty after a month use.<br/>I work a desk job.<br/>I just wore this to the work and gym.
 I've had multiple fitbit's over the past few years (multiple zips, Charge, HR) and now the Alta HR.  This is by far my favorite.  I love the slimmer size of it.  It works great just like my past trackers.
 I had high hopes for this tracker. The heart rate monitor, no matter how tight or loose I had it on my wrist the count was always 25-30 BPM higher than it should be.<br/><br/>The sleep tracker was no more accurate than having my phone in the night stand running Sleep as Android.
 VERY inaccurate step count. I walked half a mile (which I know for a fact was only half a mile) and it registered it as me walking 2 miles. My job requires me to sit or stand in one spot most of the day yet it said I was around 10,000 steps each day. I do like that it fits my small wrist nicely but other than that, I am returning this overpriced gadget.
 My son in law absolutely loves his fitbit.  Brought him and my daughter the same.
 Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. She likes tracking het steps and monitoring her sleep cycle. Plus she shares this with her friends, and they compete with each other. Nothing wrong with more activity.
 really great product. Small size and easy to use
 From a tech expert, this product is overpriced. It's good, but it's a simply overpriced product.
 Fantastic Item!!!
 Gets the job done, charge lasts a long time depending on how much you have the screen light up throughout the day.
 The screen doesn’t work well when I want to check time
 love it. does everything I expected. this is my second fitbit.Also have a waterproof one for swimming.
 Great product
 Bought this for my wife; she is very pleased; says it motivates her.  Hard to tell how accurate it is - but who cares if it's a bit off?
 I gave this as a Christmas gift to a friend and she likes it and all the features included. She said she is encouraged to do her daily walking exercise because of this.
 Best replacement band ever. Love the color and it was so easy to change.
 Wife loves it. I woulda bought the charge 3 if it was me.
 steps and mileage did not work. I returned it.
 I really like the style of this fit-bit and wear it daily to track my activity.  I have it synced to my computer and cell phone.  it is a good motivator!
 Finally jumped on the Fitbit wagon and happy I did. I love that I can track my sleeping, calories and etc. Definitely helps motivate me to get up from my desk job during the day and get those steps in.  Only had it a few weeks but have already lost a few pounds and I'm making better choices.
 Love it. Only problem was I had one before and I thought my old charger would work but it doesn’t. Disappointed with that.
 Works well
 I had researched several types of step trackers. Top contenders were the Apple Watch or the Fitbit. A family member has the Apple Watch and after viewing I felt it was too bulky with too many bells and whistles when I was just looking for primarily a fitness tracker. I like the sleek design of the Fitbit Alta HR and the option for interchangeable bands. The screen face is very basic but crisp. It can be customized to display time, heart rate, or both. Face lights up only if you tilt the band towards you or if you double-tap the screen. This model is not waterproof and should not be used in say a swimming pool, but is said to be water resistant. Lastly, this device is compatible with other phone models besides just an iPhone unlike the Apple Watch. You can also receive text/phone notifications on screen.<br/><br/>Summary: For someone looking primarily for a fitness tracker instead of a phone in a watch form. The Fitbit Alta HR is a budget-friendly sleek alternative.
 easy to set up and use. short charging time, love it!
 Don't waste your money. The thing will not work if you don't have the newest phone or laptop to set it up and they don't even provide the dongle. Waste of money and sent it back.
 Walk, it tells me, drink more water, your sleep was not good last night, don't eat that too many calories.  I even got Hubby one.
 I love the product.  I did not want a large screen on my wrist that is why I went with the Alta HR.  I love all the information that I have in the app.  I am one my way to a healthier me!
 I received this as a Christmas gift and love it. It is so easy to use and really motivates me to take extra steps through the day and be more active. It does take a little getting used to wearing at night, but the sleep tracking is so cool.
 I absolutely LOVE my fitbit Alta HR! I got the Coral one and people have said NOT to get it as the color wore out and gets dingy quick. After a full week of wear and I work in a factory for 10+ hours a day, I'm happy to say my fitbit still looks like new.
 Will usually guesses what kind of workout I am doing, if it is cardio. Pretty water resistant, use it canoeing, but can't swim with it.
 My daughter loves this and it fits her small arm well.
 Keeping track of activity, useful tool and good watch.
 Absolutely, love this product! It does wobdwrs for me, I am more in tune with my movements throughout the day!
 5+ days battery life. I ditched my Apple Watch for this.
 I do like the Fitbit Alta HR however it's loose fitting so I should of gotten the Medium band. It doesn't always light up when I turn my wrist however that could be being loose fitting.
 seems to work well. app is good
 I’ve enjoyed the function of the Alta. However, I’m so disappointed that it has many scratches on it - after only a week I have not dropped it or scraped it against anything. For anyone else looking for a fitness tracker w HR monitoring, I may recommend saving up for an iwatch w much better scratch resistance not to mention many more features
 How did I live without you my love!  Thank you for your help in inspiring and tracking my workouts!
 So disappointed in the Fitbit Alta.  Only holds a charge for 2 days at the most.  Then I have difficulty re-charging it. I have a charging station that I use to charge my phone but the Fitbit Alta will not charge on this.  Only way to charge is by turning on  my laptop and letting it charge.
 The tracker is great until the band magnet comes lose from the tracker and you lost your $148 tracker. In the picture you see a regular watch band clasp and you can’t tell it’s magnetic at the tracker itself.
 Sleep tracking is eerily precise.  Heart rate tracking is fine up to 120 but never above.
 Love this. Keeps track of all my workouts and steps.  Tracks my sleep and heart rate. Great fitness accessorie.
 I wish I could give it 5 stars but....I really like my Fitbit Alta HR BUT why isn't it waterproof????  There are lots of other similar brands and some are waterproof.<br/>Hey, Fitbit work on this please.
 Wife is continually checking her steps, etc. Some problem with online updates
 I love my fitbit, the color looks really nice and goes with a lot since it isnt a screaming bright color plus shouldnt get too hot in Texas heat since its not a black band. This is my first fitbit, I love the way it tracks my heart rate and if you choose the flower clock it starts out as a bud and blooms into a flower with petals and leaves as you move so its a reminder when you haven't moved very much.
 Love this thing! Has done and tells me so much. I like how convenient it is. Definitely have been using it more than i thought i would.
 Perfect as described
 Bought this for my wife and she loves it.
 I had the Fitbit HR for 2 years but the band started falling apart and you can't replace it so I purchased the Fitbit Alta HR.  I like the fact that you can change the bands and that the face is smaller.  I have very small wrists so this works better for me.  I have only had it for a few weeks but so far it has met my expectations.  I like how interactive it is.  It sends reminders to get up and move!!
 Love it! I had an Fitbit alta but the HR is great!
 Bing nice fit
 This is the best fitbit. I bought it for steps and to track my sleep.
 I've only had this for a little more than a week and already I'm up 10000 steps a day... Great for keeping me accountable... love all the other tracking features as well... Like sleep, foods you eat and water drinking
 I like it fine but the battery does not last very long. I have to charge it every three days, I have reduced the things I monitor with the fitbit and I'm going to try it for a couple more days and decide whether to return it.
 Fun to wear, will make sure I move my arse off my furniture.
 Had this product for about 5 weeks, product doesn't work as expected, doesn't charge, heartbeat monitory and work out tracker do not work at all. Please contact me and let me know how to return this product immediately.
 Makes me move more often
 I love my fitbit which a received as a Christmas gift last year and use it every day.  Very practical to keep me walking as I check all the time how many steps I do each day.
 I liked it very much.
 Really like the sleep analysis!  Great product
 This was a gift for my husband. He loves it except it's hard to get it to sync.
 Very unpleased, bought it for my fiance, and it worked great. Right around the time i couldnt return it. It started not reading steps, charging, ect... So now im just out $ and a fitbit.
 Got this for my wife. She loves it! Good price has the functions she uses and needs. Very satisfied.
 Was exactly what was described.
 I love the fit bit and was so excited to try it out. I wanted it primarily for work and was very upset when it cracked the first time i wore it to work. I was taking out the garbage and knocked it lightly on the trash bin causing it to crack. Very upset. Otherwise great device.
 It helps  you stay at track
 I really loved using my Alta hr. It made it so rewarding to work out and watch my progress. Unfortunately, the band it came with broke just a short while after I got it. Buying the replacement bands in store get be pretty expensive. So bummed to be without it right now.
 I like that the battery lasts all week long. I think it picks up random movements as "steps", though.
 Unreadable outside and no altimeter unlike my previous fitbit. My husband bought me an Apple Watch. I now wear them both bec they are synched. I use my Apple Watch during my workouts bec the numbers etc are bigger and readable.
 I bought this Jan 18.  They replaced it in Sept 18.  It stopped working again Feb 19 but it was out of the 1 year warranty.  No help from Fitbit.  I will never buy anything else from Fitbit!  The replacement only lasted long enough to get me past the warranty!
 I love the added heart rate feature. The Fitbit keeps me motivated &amp; I love that it's small. So easy to use and the App is great!
 The pedometer responds without your arms moving, such as when pushing a grocery cart or holding a clipboard while walking. The battery stays charged for over 3 days. The app was easy to install on my phone &amp; easy to understand.
 The band broke and fell off and we lost the Fitbit, it wasn't even three months and fitbit wouldn't replace it.... poor product
 This Fitbit grossly underestimates steps/miles walked. I've tried using problem solving methods shared online, but I found no improvement. Very disappointed.
 The loves it and wears it and uses it constantly
 Bands break easy
 My first one had a pixel issue where it showed a line on the display. The second one would not sync consistently so had to get a different Fitbit.
 Love the functionality!  I also wear a chest strap heart rate monitor and compared the two results. The Alta isn't quite as accurate but it's pretty close. The bad does get dirty fast so keep that in mind. Overall - fits my needs very well.
 Love it, very accurate except tracks lying quietly in bed as sleeping, that’s the only thing I found wrong with it, otherwise, love it.
 This is a review for the Fitbit I got for my birthday. (The one I bought was for my brother's birthday.) Maybe because I'm a measurement freak, but the Fitbit was a great gift as it has changed my life. I'm getting more sleep and getting regular exercise and I've lost 10 pounds. The features and app for my phone are fun and suitable for my needs.
 My husband gave me this for my birthday along with 10 multicolor exchangeable bands. I love this thing. It's shown me how much I'm lacking in physical activity and sleep. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.
 Worked good for 1 year and 1 month.  Of course the warranty is only for 1 year! The vibrating for texts and calls stopped working at about 8 months old.
 I think the Fitbit works great for what I want but the pink band, after one day is dirty. I regret getting pink.
 This keeps me on track . Very comfortable.
 keeps track of active lifestyle and will help me stay on track
 I have tried other step trackers and nothing compares
 My fibit broke so i called amazon they sent me a new one the next day and it was on a sunday!  i love this little guy i rely on it
 Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas. She really enjoys it.
 Great
 Very Nice
 After two years of 'I want one, no I don't', I finally ordered this Fitbit for her for Christmas. Two hours after it was delivered, she called me to say she had won an Apple watch at a conference she attended. She still has the Fitbit, I have the watch.
 I recently ordered this to track my steps, and sync with certain apps to help with my diabetes. Honestly I am kind of disappointed. Battery life sucks. My Garmin has more info on the screen, including weather and notifications from a few different apps. So far. I would say buy Garmin.
 I love the product. Worth the price ( got it on Black Friday) . The silent alarm clock is an awesome feature and most useful one. All other features are obviously good. Overall a good product to keep track of your fitness.
 Bought this for my daughter and she loves it and has had no complaints (and she's a teenager so believe me if she had any I would know it lol).
 This was put on a deal day after I bought it. Will I get a credit on my account.
 She likes it and I like that.
 I'm amazed at what this can do. If you're health conscious at all, I highly recommend getting one of these.
 I love my fit bit, however, it is of no use to me since it falls off several times a day.  One day, I will not be able to find the fit bit and I will be out 100 dollars .  This is a frustrating attribute to an otherwise fabulous product.
 Delivered very quickly and I love it so far, excited to start tracking things!
 Love it. Much nicer to have something not so bulky as the Charge HR, and love the rosegold color. Just beautiful.
 I LOVE MY FITBIT! It's so amazing. I love knowing how much sleep I'm getting and how much deep sleep! It encourages me to get my steps in!! I love it. I just wish it was waterproof. I've had it for about 3 months and I've messed up 3 times! Luckily, it's still alive.
 I have fun with my fitbit. I bought it in July, and now in November, it loses its charge within 24 hours. Just got off the chat system with someone whose first language is not English, and they are sending me a coupon via email for a replacement. I'll update with that situation if it resolves, or even if it doesn't. Especially if it doesn't.
 Best thing I have purchased for myself in a long while, so glad I finally purchased this.  It has helped me jumpstart my activity level!
 overall great tool, especially for accountability purposes...
 Love this unit.  Does all the things I wanted it to do and then some.
 Really wanted to like this, but I found most of the information inaccurate.
 I can not get it to work. When it is plugged in the. Fitbit icon comes on ,the code comes for an instant and then it goes off. Doesn't seem to be charging
 Love it.
 This was a mother's day gift but my mom preferred the Charge 2 HR instead....
 Not real happy with the alta. I had the charge before this and while I hated how bulky it was- it was a better product. The alta cheats me out of steps and I have to bang on it to get it to respond as it ignores my taps. It also doesn't count stairs. It also seems to be off on the sleep tracking- it'll say I slept 14 hours when I was only in the bed for 7. Wish I would have gone with the charge again- it never failed me.<br/>Update: I am returning this one to Amazon in hopes that mine is defective and a new one will working according to the other reviews. I will update my review if it works. If it doesn't I am going to get a refund and buy the charge.<br/>Update: the new one doesn't keep accurate track of steps either. I'm returning it and going back to the charge.
 working well - I do wish it gave me number of flights of stairs climbed like my Charge HR did
 Great product!
 Slim and comfortable. Does just what its supposed to do. Thank you!
 Perfect for fitness
 The Alta was just what I was lookIng for.  The Blaze Fitbit face and bands were too large on my arm and even though I bought additional leather and sport bands but still did not like the size of the Blaze. The Alta was much smaller and had everything I was looking for.
 Just what my wife wanted
 Love the size of the Alta HR but as with all of them, the plastic band sucks!  Plan on buying a different band.
 I needed help to set up the Fitbit on my i-Mac as I had had a earlier model fitbit.<br/><br/>Otherwise,  once it was set up, it has been great....very inspirational  and making me get out to walk outside in good weather, in addition to my hour at the gym early in the morning.
 Works fairly well, doesn’t track all of my exercise correctly. The band doesn’t fit my wrist well, it is always to loose or to tight.  I do like the heart rate monitor that is the reason I bought this one and it is accurate.
 This fitbit is low in quality. Bought it in August and won't sync and now display won't even work. Tried everything that gave me hope on line, but nothing works. Worse $145 I ever spent.
 Works great
 its great
 I like it but I wish it would have come with directions.  I would get so much more out of it.  Each time I talk to someone who has one I learn more features.
 Heart rate is off. I even tried changing arms and making sure there was good contact, but rate was way too low. Also, the sleep pattern is off. If I was reading or watching a movie, it detected me as sleeping.
 It's a great toll to remind me to keep moving!  and I like that I can see not only how many calories I have burned up during the day, but also how many hours I've slept at night.
 Christmas present for me daughter IT is the 3rd one I have bought ( different name brand) Hopefully this one will last longer thatn a year
 Love the Fitbit.  I sometimes have trouble getting the display to come on but it could just be me needing to get more used to it
 Encourages active lifestyle!
 My fitbit is only a month or so old.  It no longer charges.  I plug it in and nothing happens, the fitbit does not light up, either a bad charger or bad fitbit!
 Lo que buscaba.
 These are nice sturdy bands and work well with my Fitbit.
 So far I really like my Fitbit. I have it programmed to my cell phone and it works well. I really like the thinner strap.
 Awesome little tracker.  Compact, lightweight ... you don't even know that you are wearing it.  Keeps great track of your steps, stairs, etc.  My favorite tracker by Fitbit.
 Bought it for my wife. She loves all the features it has. Plus the sleep is alot more detailed than her last one. Its pretty awsome all around. I did alot of research before purchasing this one. And it pretty much does everything you want. Aside from getting it wet. Then you'll have to get the next version up
 I like the color of it and that's it . I hate that it won't sync to my phone ever and it won't track how many flights of stairs I've walked.
 I love my Alta Fitbit. I previously had a Fitbit Flex, which was not very accurate and had lots of glitches at times. However, I love my new Alta and have had no issues with it whatsoever! It will sync easily &amp; automatically with motivational exercise programs that my employer invites us to participate in at work as well. I love it!
 Love Love Love it!  It has changed my life and has made me more excited about my activities.
 Works great. Easy to set up and loves to bug me if I sit to long and encourage me to get up. Love it.
 It's a great band though I'm not too fond of the hook style (like a watch) rather than the pop in style.
 Love it with one big exception..<br/>It doesn't track stairs!  Very disappointed in that.<br/>Would have reconsidererd if I had picked up on that fact prior to ourchase.
 I love this thing! Works great I love all of the features!
 Size small was still huge on my wrist. With the band as tight As it would get I could still stick fingers through the sides because of how wide the face is.
 Bought this as a gift.Loved the features. Especially being able to monitor heart rate. Recipienr loes beign ale to monitor
 I have owned many Fitbit products and I like the sleek use. The only draw back is it has a shorter battery life that the Fitbit charge.
 My wife loves this replacement strap for her Fitbit! It is so much easier to put on because it has a buckle! The original strap had those awful "push type buttons" that you had to attach to the holes and were very hard to use!
 Nice sleek look.  Wish it had a stair count.  Sleep mode is kind of baffling.  Not sure if it captures the entire night.  Still learning all the functions.  Helpful tips available.  I did get a new wristband.  I didn't like the clasp.  I purchased a magnetic band which I love. So far, overall, I am happy with my purchase.
 Absolutely love my new fit bit! Love the sleek design!
 Great first week using this Fitbit
 I love the Fitbit Alta HR. I had the Fitbit charge years ago and gave it my little brother. Been using a garmin vivofit since. I am amazed at how light it is! I've missed the silent alarms all these years as well! The only drawback is it's not waterproof!
 I love the slim style of this Fitbit Alta HR and the color. The gray is very soft color and goes with many of my clothes.  It has all the features I wanted. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
 Came fast love it
 Love it, it keeps me motivated to move!
 I received the Fitbit Alta HR on 7/31/17. It was very easy to download the Fitbit app &amp; set up on my iPhone.<br/><br/>I'm enjoying using the Fitbit especially to track how many steps &amp; miles I walk &amp; how long I sleep &amp; the kinds of sleep patterns<br/><br/>I'd recommend this Fitbit to anyone who is trying to monitor their heart rate.
 If you’re buying this Fitbit for the HR feature DONT. I had the blaze previously and loved it because the HR feature was super accurate! The HR feature on the Alta HR doesn’t work at all, especially when working out. Otherwise it’s a nice device and I like the customizeable options and how slim it is on my wrist.
 I am using this FitBit to up my training when I apply for the US Air Force in the fall. This has helped me keep on track with everything. I am in love with this FitBit and would recommend this to anyone!
 Fit perfectly 👍
 LOVE THIS ITEM. perfect size. I just wish it counted stairs like my old one.
 I actually had to send back the Xtra large and get a large.  Been wearing it for two days now, and love it.
 Works great.  It's a big motivator.
 I’ve had this band since July 2018.<br/>The snap connector on the right side fell out somewhere today. Thank goodness I had on a long sleeve sweatshirt or I would have lost my Fitbit Alta! Not happy with product.<br/>Will be contacting company.
 Smaller version that is comfortable to wear.
 This is a replacement I was looking for, exactly what I wanted..... great !
 Easy to setup. I enjoy this very much. The only drawback is there are two lights under the band the is on. It too some time to get use to. Yes I highly recommend this fitness band.
 Especially the resting bpm us very accurate and a good proxy of how good I feel<br/>edit: down to 3 stars: the wristband is now very loose and open by itself almost everyday
 Fast shipping no complaints about the purchase
 I love that it's slim &amp; sleek, plus this color way is very soft &amp; femme. The major downside is it's not water resistant in terms of showering.
 love my Fitbit I just wish that it had some of the functions of other fit-bits.
 Only had my Fitbit since September now it's not tracking my sleep and it's not charging.
 First one I bought stopped working after a couple months.  Customer service was great and got me a replacement quickly.
 Purchased as a gift for my husband. He's enjoying it. Has great features and is small for all that it does.
 I love my Fitbit Hr! Don’t care for the band that came with it.
 Beware. Stopped charging after a year. They offer a three yr insure warranty. Read well before purchase.
 Good but I wish the sleep part worked more accurately. Sometimes it defaults to the basic sleep results.
 Unfortunately, the strap keeps popping off the face of the Fitbit and falling off my wrist. Beware, why pay for something that won't stay on. I don't want to pay for another strap and I'm past my Amazon return date. :(
 This slim fitbit is elegant. Very feminine. I got several bands to jazz it up. Ive received several compliments.
 I had the Charge HR and it was too big for my petite wrist. This fits much better and I like that I can change the band.
 I noted that the heart rate indicator did not work well while exercising.  Also the information flashed on the screen for just a few seconds and also could not read it outside very well due to sunlight.
 My third Fitbit. I love that it gives you a tidbit of an incoming text since I don't like always holding or digging for my phone. Simply wearing it reminds me to move more.
 I bought the rose gold leather band for $10 Dec 2017. It’s May 4, 2018 and I’m ordering a gold one today because the leather is losing its color along the edges.  It’s comfortable and pretty and the price is great!
 One of my best purchases. I keep tack of my exercise and burned calories. This is a great product if you are taking care of your health. Very recommendable.
 My son asked for this fitbit when he started work. He absolutely loves it! Very good investment.
 Love my fitbit, like that the band is changeable unlike the charge fitbit i had before.
 I had to send the first one back (it would't charge) but the second one worked perfectly!  It was a gift and my mom loves it!
 Bought it for my mom and she loves it!
 My favorite gift I've gotten for myself in a long time.
 Works great and the black color is very sleek. Easy to use and pair with iPhone 7.
 purchased for the wife, she used it for a little while, just a pain to charge
 My Fitbit helps me stay motivated to stay active.
 I really like this bracelet. I like to bring my watch. This is the bracelet that I can accept the most. The function displayed by the watch is a sub-item for me. The second time I purchased this model, the previous ALTA HR took 3 months a year.
 This product is awful. It doesn't register steps unless you over exaggerate moving your arms as you walk and the band is either always too tight and cutting off circulation or it is too loose and works worse than normal. Don't waste your money!
 I am so pleased with the quality and fit of this band. Oh and it's priced fairly too!
 Bought as a gift for the g/f and she loves it.
 I love to keep track with my steps through the day. It prompts me to get up and walk when I have been sitting too long. I also like the silent alarm so that I can wake up without waking up my husband. I also like to track the quality of my sleep. I just wish it were a little smaller.
 Bought this as a gift and the charger was missing. I ordered a charger and it still did it work. It never charged
 I got it for my mom for Christmas and she loves it!
 Nice, better than UP.
 Have found the Alta HR works and tracks HR consistently on the inside or outside of my wrist or inside of my ankle. I am not a runner, so not sure how well it would keep up in the 'alternate' use areas with very strenuous exercise. I bought this to track my heart rate throughout the day and night as I have a form of dysautonomia  and needed a way to track HR regardless of what I am doing. The Fitbit app (that this works with) shows highest and lowest HR of the day, and you can fairly well determine the timing of peaks and lows. I also like the smaller size, smallest HR wrist monitor than anything else I have found. The bands are easily changeable, which is nice. The only reason I took away a star is because this really doesn't have any kind of water resistance at all, and the instructions say to remove until your arm and the fitbit are completely dry. Considering sweating during activity and washing hands throughout the day, this seems like a missed opportunity, especially considering that other Fitbit products are more water resistant or even water proof.
 My daughter loves it. (It was a birthday present.) She thinks it represents a big leap forward from her old Fitbit.
 I like the watch but the software to sync with my phone is VERY INCONSISTENT. I'm heading to bed for the night and my phone still thinks I have taken 0 steps for the day.
 My wife loves it, and it looks great!  Plus all the different bands you can buy for it
 A great fitness and diet motivator, have lost 10 lbs since I got it a month ago.
 Love it
 I love the reminders it provides as well as the notifications of text messages.
 Love it! I hardly ever have it off
 I'm in love with this cute useful product
 Bought this as a gift for my wife and she loves it.
 This tool is well worth the money. I upgraded from the Fitbit One. The best features for me is the reminders to get up and move and the heart rate monitor. Since i work a desk job, I find that hours can go by without me moving a step. The fitbit Alta helps with all that! I have the motivation I need to get moving around my wrist.
 Love it! Just as described and the order was processed promptly!
 Elderly mother thought she would like it but it did not work for her. Return was wonderfully easy. I have my own fitbit and I love it. Would recommend this watch.
 It's keeping me on track
 good design, lighter and smaller than Charge 2.<br/>I bought it for my wife , but Actually I found charge 2 is better as it has more option and you can use stop watch and start training intervals using the button. whereas Alta doesn't have button so you lose the feature of stop watch and training intervals start button.
 Had to return it within a week because the screen showed no display and wouldn't sync with my phone. Dealt with Fitbit support...Took over 2 weeks to replace an item I had owned for about 4 days originally...And I had pre-ordered it as a brand new release item.<br/><br/>They sent me a new Fitbit, but the Alta HR doesn't have the option of recording a workout. It will record a walk or run or elliptical in real-time if you select the option to do so, and it automatically detects these activities also. However, since I do mostly weights and calisthenics, I can't tell the Fitbit to record it. If I add it as a workout activity after the fact within the app, it will delete any data from that period of time...Sooooooo bye bye calories burned and steps taken during a workout. They need to improve the app functionality so that there is an option to begin tracking activities beyond those involving a GPS distance, and if it's after the event, to categorize correctly without deleting collected data. Sadly, I'm beyond the return eligibility timeframe, otherwise I'd be doing that and selecting a different device.
 Works as advertised; would buy again.
 Much better than the Charge HR, easy to use, shipped fast
 I absolutely love this! It has really helped me in a plateau stage of my fitness. One thing about the alta though is that it does not track weight lifting as exercise.
 I love it! I think I could’ve gotten the small but I got the large just to be safe. I love that it’s not too big, I went from the old school flex to the Alta Hr.
 Works great, as advertised
 battery lasts 6 days in depth sleep results recommend to use the app
 Weork great......better band than the regular Alta.....which fell off n I lost
 I love it!!! Bands are easy to change and the being able to see your heartrate and steps instantly is great. I love the little encouraging messages to "move" too.
 Love that the band is detachable. That was the issue I had with their old model. Although, the screen scratches easily-makes sense why they sell screen protectors.
 love it
 Unfortunately, not working properly. I take my fit bit off at night and when I woke up and put it on  it said 4,000 steps already. Doesn't make any sense. Wish I could return.
 great
 It had changed my way of keeping track of not only my diet and exercise,but water and sleep as well.Life changing!
 Purchased in March now in October the battery isn't holding a charge
 I love how well it tracks my sleep. Wish it was waterproof though. All in all, a good working exercise &amp; health minder.
 Love my fit bit
 Love my new Fitbit Alta hr. Easy to use.
 Was loving the Alta but I have had it for 2 weeks... Yes 2 weeks... and the strap broke already, it is constantly falling off my wrist now. Pretty cheap quality for what you pay for it, I'd like it replaced for free.<br/><br/>Not sure I would recommend this to anyone looking at Fitbit.
 Arrived quickly.  Works as expected.  Definitely needs a screen protector.
 Got 2 of them no issues battery lasts a while and stays connected to my phone.
 The heart rate feature is the reason why I moved to this model.  It is very helpful.
 Being a big guy I was a little worried it wouldn’t fit - was very pleased to find that it fit well with plenty of extra room.<br/><br/>Set up was easy and app interface is user friendly.<br/><br/>Battery lasts pretty much as advertised.<br/><br/>Very happy.
 I love this bad boy.
 Love! Favorite fitbit I've owned so far.
 The best fitbit I've owned.  It is my ultimate motivator to move towards better health.
 Gift
 It was a little tedious to get it to pair with my iPhone but once its paired it stays that way. I use it every day and I love it!
 Bought as gift for husband - he was very happy to find it fits even his extremely large wrist.  Has worn it daily for over a month and works perfectly.
 Fits my husband who is 300 lbs.
 works great
 Great product. I thought I would need the XL band since I'm a little over weight. But it actually was big. Overall everything else was perfect. I suggest trying on different bans sizes at the store before purchasing online.
 Great product! Only wish it arrived the first time!<br/>Finally got one...
 I LOVE it!!
 For my husband.  Really helping with his exercising.
 I love this tracker and use it daily.
 Love the sleep tracking.  Always gives me a little more insight, and I'm able to change small things about my sleeping habits here and there to see the effect over a span of time
 I've had the Fitbit Alta HR now for a few months and overall I'm very happy with it. However there are a few things that could be improved upon including:<br/>- Screen scratches easily. This doesn't bother me a lot but if it would bother you definitely buy a screen protector before you start wearing it<br/>- Screen can be hard to see outside in certain light<br/>- HR function sometimes doesn't read during very intense exercise. I admit this really disappointed me when I first got it but it picks up HR enough during exercise that I decided to go ahead and keep it.<br/>- The battery has never lasted longer than about 3-4 days for me and this is with cell phone alerts off.<br/>- Warning that if you ride a motorcycle it will log it as "Cycling" exercise automatically. I haven't found a way to fix this except to just manually delete it after it logs it.<br/><br/>These few issues haven't prevented me from enjoying my new Alta. I wear it every day and really enjoy the hourly reminders to move and the constant logging of my HR. The band is comfortable and easy to clean. I don't use the sleep function because I don't like to sleep with the Fitbit on but that feature also is useful for the right people. I think it was worth the money and overall I'm very happy with it.
 The Fitbit was for my personal use. Amazon was very accommodating in sending the Fitbit to me. I received on the exact date they promised. I am enjoying the Fitbit.  I love the information it provides me with.
 Gift for my mom she loves it
 Love it. xl fits my wrist. im just under 8 ½ inchs
 I do like it....thanks
 Love the Alta HR. Had a Charge that I really liked, too, but it was time to step up (pun intended)
 I like it very much, It keeps me going and as soon as I can follow my progress in my iPhone, Ill be very pleased with it.<br/>It keeps me aware of my heart and I even wear it while sleeping to check how much the heart slows down.
 love my watch
 Just plain love it
 It is quite comfortable to wear.  I use it to monitor my steps, heart rate as well as my sleeping pattern.  I would recommend this to other interested individuals.
 Upgrade from the Fitbit Alta!! Still love it!! Easy to sync and tracks info well.
 Love my fitbit! Keeps track of my steps, heart rate and sleep.
 I moved from the Fitbit Blaze to this pink Alta and I am very pleased! It has everything I want. Plus it's very sleek looking!
 I purchased the fuschia color in small. It's much lighter and thinner than the Charge HR I was using and I really enjoy the in depth sleep analysis.
 Arrived on time and my wife loves it.
 the battery lasts for days!
 purchased  April 16 for mothers day, now it's not working. Started having trouble last week. The time was off by one hour and a half, and then the heart rate quit-no flashing lights. Then no screen but it charged up full, and I felt the vibration for an alarm I set for 7pm. Now it's a big disappointment, haven't even had it a year!
 Works great and looks great too.
 The fitbit heart rate is a bit off. and very uncomfortable to wear, wrist hurts after half day wearing it. no gps function in the fitbit.
 Loved everything tell the screen stopped working
 Perfect replacement for the lost one.
 My original Alta HR would not install the firmware update when I took it out of the package.  After several days with tech support at Fitbit, they elevated it to the "upper levels" of support, with still no luck.  Finally I was instructed to send the product back to them with a mailing label they sent to me.  The problem was, it was going to take 5-7 days to get to them, then 5-7 days to verify that is was defective, and then 5-7 days to get me a replacement!!!  This seemed ridiculous, especially since it was defective right out of the box.  After several email exchanges, they talked to a supervisor and told me that after I put the defective tracker in the mail, they would send me a replacement right away, and I got it within 3 days.  This seemed like a fairer solution than waiting 15-21 days!!  Since I received the replacement, it has been working as expected, and I'm extremely happy with it.  The customer service was good, although I shouldn't have had to work quite so hard to get them to send me a replacement. In the end they did the right thing!!!
 Very good but it should be waterproof
 First one was dead out of the box. Won't turn on, won't light up, won't charge.I know a lot of people with fitbit's that have just up and died for no reason. I was hoping that the newer ones had better reliability. Things aren't looking too good since this brand new model was dead on arrival. Doing a quick Google searched revealed fitbit forums with the same issue from other Alta HR buyers. Dead out of the box. A replacement is on the way...maybe I should get an extended warranty on it...<br/><br/>Updated<br/>10/14/17<br/>The replacement is still working with no problems. Goes in the sauna at the gym and everything.
 Love it! Giftee was very happy. :)
 The heart rate monitor is a little unreliable, reads a bit high, and that's why I bought it but overall nice product.
 Still learning how to use the Fitbit and love it!  Great neutral color.
 The strap started just detaching on its own after less than 6 months. Now i can’t wear it because I’m afraid I’ll lose it
 Very disappointed in the product. Didn't cause any damage to it, but within two weeks, one morning it just stopped displaying anything. Plan to return to fitbit
 Good for keeping me moving
 great product, better then my original Fitbit
 100% Love this Fitbit!  The slimmer band feels so much better on my wrist.
 Great product, but I do think it overestimates the steps a bit. I tried to re-calibrate the stride length, but it still over counts.
 worksd great, easy to set up, and simple to maintain,,,
 This thing is awesome
 Love, love, love!!
 I love it! It is the perfect size and light weight.
 AWESOME FITNESS TRACKER...
 Love them
 I love it and plan on buying different kinds of bands,
 Got it for my girlfriend.  She loves it!
 Great ,worth the price. Makes me get up and walk
 The fitbit was as described but it's very responsive..I sometimes flips my hand to see the time or tap n it to activate the screen but it doesn't always respond immediately.. overall it's ok for basic activity insights
 I had a fit bit one since 2012 and loved it. My daughter convinced me to "upgrade" to the Alta hr. I was hesistent but I am so happy I did. Love the added features (heart rate, sleep tracking, text notifications)  I was concerned about accuracy with treadmill etc but it has been spot on.
 Delivered as advertised.
 Great seller. Quick and product is flawless.
 another wife christmas gift, hasnt stopped talking about it, very helpful for her.
 This Fitbit Alta HR is almost perfect for my lifestyle requirements. I am not a super athlete but I like to keep track of my activities and sleep patterns, as well as set targets. It is stylish and comfy to wear.<br/>Biggest negative, not being able to wear it swimming. If fully waterproof I would give it full stars.<br/>Basic, stylish &amp; functional.
 9 year old son loves it. We use it for sleep tracking
 This fitbit is exactly what I needed! Love that I can monitor my heart rate and sleeping patterns. Also very convenient to be able to read my text messages and never miss a call.
 I love it.  It would not sync with my MacBook Pro; however, it managed to sync to my IPhone, which miraculously transfers the information over the Cloud to my MacBook, so it worked out.
 Fantastic product.  Addicted to heart rate monitor, knowing when I reach calorie burn.  Motivates to keep going.
 Love my new fitbit!  Arrived on a Sunday, just as promised!
 Bought this for my sister inlaw, and she loves it!
 My wife is very happy with the fitbit.
 Love Fitbit Alta and now the Fitbit Alta HR
 Love my Fitbit!!
 I love that it tells me when I have texts or calls!  Calendar alerts too!  Fits comfortably and arrived as described!
 Great idea to help get me moving!
 Beware short lifespan on the band
 Like the heart rate function
 This was Christmas gift for my wife and she is very very very pleased with the gift.
 Love the slender design and new sleep stats. Fitbit keeps getting better and better!
 Heart monitor is good but not accurate when you are sweaty.<br/>I mainly use this Fitbit to track activities. Had to put in my pocket when on elliptical machine. When it is on my arm the step count is not correct, thus heart rate cannot be monitored.<br/>Over all it is much better than the old charge..
 Bought this  piece of tech last July, and recently the battery won't last a day before needing to be recharged.<br/><br/>No replacement parts available, will just have to buy a different one.
 A gift for my wife, and she loves it
 Nice clean look and long lasting battery. Love this unit
 my wife loves it.
 LOVE this item.  So much better than the charge HR i had prior to this one.  Love that the bands can be changed out.  Works great.
 Good Product new
 Fitbit works great and I like how you can change the bands, however, after 6 months, it started to stink. No amount of alcohol wiping, washing was getting it out. I think the watch has too many creases that trap dirt/oils.
 Fits well, functions well, only needs to be charged once per week.
 Best fitbit yet. Love fitbit. Highly additive.
 fits  works great
 Just like many reviews were  written, my Fitbit Alta HR wrist band had a short life of 7 months as well.<br/>The quality is not as sound as Fitbit's brand name.
 I am so late to the Fitbit game, love it! Great battery life!
 I love the Alta HR. It does exactly what I want it to do. The sleep tracker is great.<br/>I switched the bands and the Alta is very sleek and modern looking.
 I had the Charge 2 and loved it but it was too bulky for my small wrist. So, when the Alta HR was released I ordered it right away. I give it two stars for its slim profile which definitely looks much better and is more comfortable on a small wrist, as well as for accurate tracking of steps. However, it is awful for tracking exercise if you do any exercise other than the ones automatically recognized. It gets long walks without a problem but when I do my regular workout (Daily Burn,) it rarely gets it, and if it does it is inaccurate. Some examples - I did a particularly vigorous workout the other day and it recognized 0 active minutes. Today, another vigorous 40 minute workout, including a ton of burpees and it gave me 23 active minutes. When I manually add the workout I get no information on calories burned. I have been following the conversation on the Fitbit community message boards (this seems to be a common problem,) and tried all of the recommendations from Fitbit to no avail (resetting it multiple times, deleting the app and downloading it again, etc etc.) It's basically useless to me for what I need it to do. Very very disappointed after the Charge 2 and it seems my only option is to toss this $150 piece of junk and spend yet another $130 or so on the Charge 2.
 very good product
 Excellent she loves it
 Easy to use works flawlessly. Wish they didn't have proprietary charger. Has a outstanding battery life.
 Have had this for a day. Paid extra for rose gold band and it’s already stained black on the edges. Nothing removes the stains. Like fitbit but HATE that the band could not be cleaned after 1 DAY of use.
 Great price. Love that it is a watch plus a heart rate. Lets me keep track of my movements.
 Bought for my daughter. She abousolutely loves it.  No one had the rose in stok but Amazon. Thank god, she hates waiting
 I LOVE IT
 When I got it I had a few issues and  called and was sent a replacement. Works great now&gt;
 Bought as a gift, daughter loves it
 &lt;3
 My mom loves it.
 Love my new fit bit!  It is wonderful!
 It's a Fitbit.  Gotta love a Fitbit.
 Does everything I expected as it well
 Sleek, stylish, and comfortable. I have no complaints at all.
 So many features packed into this small device.  I love the sleep analysis, and that it displays information on texts and phone calls.  I haven't used a fraction of the features yet but I plan to.
 bought it as a gift.  this color is awesome! (rose gold)
 I bought the Alta before mainly because of its display as I could use it to keep track of time.<br/>Bought the Alta HR and was not disappointed, still using it mainly as a watch.<br/>Wish it was swimproof though.
 love the sleep app
 Love my Fitbit...got the mesh bracelets to jazz up the look a bit :)
 Big improvement over the charge hr (not sure about charge 2 I haven't had one). Bigger screen, thinner, detachable band, Better sleep stage monitoring. I love it.
 Works great. I've been waiting for a product like this all my life.
 Perfect
 Love this product!  It has motivated me to get healthy.
 Bought as a present for my wife.  I have a Blaze, she loves her Alta.
 My husband love it.
 Love my new Alta Fitbit.
 Love My new fit bit Alta HR
 it was a gift, they liked it
 .much better than Jawbone Up from previous years. Love it.
 Fitbit HR was a replacement for one that would not charge. It arrived the morning after I requested a replacement, and is working perfectly. I wear it daily and love it. Amazons return procedure is the worlds best by far, online and off. It leaves one with no reservations regarding doing ALL of their shopping on amazon.
 love it wear it everyday
 Works great
 Did not live up to the hype
 Perfect for my tiny wrist.. love it...
 I love it. Works just as I expected
 Our daughter loves it.
 Having issues with the battery.
 Haven't used yet, but sure I will like it.
 We got this for my daughter for Xmas. The charger does not work.
 I love this Fitbit. It tracks my steps pretty accurately. It also sends me little reminders encouraging me to keep walking.
 I Love my fitbit, but my band keeps opening on one side. I've come close to losing it several times. It snaps into place but it keeps coming loose. 🙄
 I've had it for a couple of weeks now and I've really enjoyed it. It's not too big so I can wear it when I sleep to measure my sleeping patterns, too!
 Love the sleeping and heart rate tracking.
 I love it! Nice, easy to use, helpful tips and information!
 thank you
 It was working great for about 2 1/2 months then quit syncing and no matter what I do it will not pair and sync. Checking on warranty at this point.
 Color as expected, works great, as expected.
 Excellent.
 This is my second Fitbit and my first as a band! Great product!
 Defective product. The face plate just fell off without cause. Don't expect this product to last more than 12 months if you waste your money on it!!
 Love it.  I'm data driven, and this exceeds my expectations!
 Received Fitbit Alta HR obviously been used and damaged.  box had been opened, charger as well.  watch itself has scratches on the screen and chips on the side.
 My wife loves it!!!
 Great! Love that it reminds me to get up and move every hour!
 My 10 yr old daughter loves it. It’s the perfect size for her wrist. This is our 2nd Alta to buy. The first one was purchased elsewhere and had to be returned.
 Love this new Fitbit.  The hourly reminders are helpful to keep me on track with my steps.
 Set up easily. Fits well.  Perfect upgrade for a FitBit user.
 My mother loves her new Alta HR. Got it for her as a Christmas gift.
 Disappointed that the band broke within months of owning the product.
 I very much enjoyed the feature of heart rate, distance. steps, and availability of the day time and date. Very disappointed with the band separating from device. Super glue held it back on for 1 week.
 Lov lov my fit bit. The watch make its so much more functional
 Wife wears it daily
 Grate, love it!!!
 Love the features!  Seems very durable.
 Like the new fitbit.  It will keep me on track.
 Great product great price and speedy delivery.
 STILL LEARNING HOW TO USE IT
 Just as expected.
 Great product.  Easy to use/read. Works really well in a variety of workout types.
 I love it! I love that it tells me what my heart rate is. I use this every day, even in my sleep bc it tracks my sleeping stages.
 Was purchased as a gift. The person I gave this to loves it!
 I am obsessed. I love my new fitbit
 I upgraded to this from the original flex and I absolutely love it! It's comfortable and does not feel any bigger than the flex. Easy to find replacement bands for this model, too.<br/><br/>I don't understand people complaining of it not tracking your floors climbed- it was never intended to do that!<br/><br/>Anyway, one of the things I love about having the HR function is the more accurate calorie count. It has definitely given me some much needed perspective!<br/><br/>Bottom line- if you're thinking of upgrading from the original flex but you don't want to lose the slim design with a heart rate function, get the Alta HR.
 Was a little misleading when trying to set up but I love it.
 This product is amazing, it shipped quickly and the quality was amazing. This Fitbit was a Christmas gift and the receiver was really happy with her gift.  I would buy from here again.
 Well worth the price
 Great product
 Yes I like it very Much. It's comfortable to wear both day and for sleeping. The only thing I don't like about it is how I usually have to turn my wrist at least at least twice to see the time.
 Received just as described. Happy with delivery and product.
 Love love love! The only thing that would be nice to have is a timer. I'm a trainer and like to time my own workouts lot. Otherwise the app is awesome and I love that it syncs up to MyFitnessPal and Record by underarmour!
 Doesnt always display when I want it to. Touchy to switch screens, sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's not. The band is started to get loose. Otherwise highly satisfied.
 I love my Fitbit Alta HR.  I has all the functions I wanted and isn't too bulky.  My husband liked it too and bought himself a Fitbit Charge 2.
 I'm not sure the heart rate counter is correct and it seems a bit bulky for me.
 That it was a constant reminder that I needed to move; least favorite was that it informed, or at least kept track, when I did not meet my goal.
 The fitbit worked great, but the band was very unreliable and fell off several times.  It last fell off at an airport, never to be found.  Very unreliable latch between the band and device.  I would not purchase again and am out $150.
 Awesome! Great Bluetooth range. Very responsive. Good battery life. Highly recommend for people who need to see notifications but don't want to look at phone all day.
 This is my first Fitbit and it’s fabulous. I decided however that I should get the Charge 2 since it’s a little bigger and easier to read without my reading glasses. I love Amazons return policy which makes this easier to do.
 Works as advertised
 Works as advertised.
 Purchased for both myself and a gift for my mom. We love them so much! We wear them everyday! Love love love my FitBit Alta!
 The watch does not keep good time. The band, continuously pop off. I have the replacement warranty. I want to send it back.
 Excellent
 Overall I am happy with it but I do miss some of the features that my Charge HR had that this one does not.
 Bought this for a Christmas gift have heard no complaints priced reasonable
 I had to replace my last fit bit over battery issues and now this one is not charging as well...
 It reminds me when to get up. Love the feature of email coming in on it
 Wife loves it. No buttons. Takes a few minutes to figure out.
 I love this FitBit! My only wish would be a button on the app to tell it if I'm sick or traveling so she wouldn't yell at me about my steps.
 I LOVE IT ,  IT KEEPS ME WALKING 10,000 STEPS A DAY.  IT'S A FABULOUS MOTIVATOR.<br/>DANYA
 Works great!
 Perfect fitbit! this new design rocks!
 This product is good at tracking my sleep stages whereas it could not predict my periods very well hence deduct one star
 Great product!!
 Only lasted 5 months before breaking
 I've only had this Fitbit for a few days, but so far I enjoy it.<br/><br/>PROs:<br/>- Helps track steps.<br/>-Tracks sleep well.<br/>- I like that it has a community feature so that you can compete/ stay motivated.<br/><br/>CONs:<br/>-Hard to sleep with. I guess this depends on how you sleep, but I personally toss and turn all night long and usually have my arm under the pillow. Makes it pretty uncomfortable.<br/>-I'm not entirely sure that it tracks the steps that well. I usually wake up in the morning already having some steps in. I'm not sure if this is bc I've been sleep walking (which is possible, I used to sleep walk a lot as a kid) Or if it's just too sensitive to my movement in my sleep<br/><br/>I think its a great product and i'm hoping the steps start tracking better. But I think I'll see more in the weeks to come.
 WOW.  Love it.
 I like it a lot.
 It was a gift for my daughter, she loved it, easy to set it up and easy to use it
 I am disappointed because the strap does not stay attached to the FITBIT.  I lost it once but fortunately it was found for me.  How can I keep the strap attached?
 Love this version! I love the added heart rate feature!  Great way to get active and stay active! You feel held accountable!
 good quality product, has proved robust, reliable and i find it very useful, fast and efficient delivery
 Gift allot of fun
 Who does not love their Fitbit...grin.
 so far so good
 good
 like it
 Battery life really good
 perfect for my work out
 Very functional but the strap gets dirty so easily so I will get a darker colour
 My favorite Fitbit!
 Great product.....just as advertised.
 Stopped working after 5 months of use.  Thankfully it was under warranty so I was able to replace it. I upgraded to the versa. Hopefully it’s better quality.
 Good quality small wallet with money clip.
 I absolutely love my Alta Fitbit. Have worn it for two years now. I am really dedicated to my exercise routine, so the Fitbit keeps me on track, disciplined, competitive with myself and excited when those stars bounce around on my arm!
 Wear it everyday.
 Easy to use. I'm enjoying my Fitbit Alta.
 Have enjoyed changing them out frequently.
 My fitbit is great! Can be a bit testy to set up but once it is set up you are good to go
 I purchased this watch in the blue/grey as a gift for my mother durring the black friday deals. She absolutely loves it its small enough for her tiny wrists and does not look bulky.
 I got this updated Alta to replace the Charge HR.  I've been wearing it now for 2 weeks and I am not impressed. Truthfully, I am disappointed. It rarely syncs. I have had to delete and re-add the Alta to the app 12 times.  Yes,  you read that read that right. Twelve times as of Friday,  9 June.  I never had these issues with my Charge HR. I'm sorry I changed,  but I wanted a smaller,  more versatile version that I could change bands on.  I am very unhappy with this Fitbit.  Friends who had the original Alta gave great reviews which made me feel confident to get the newer version. Big Mistake!!
 Daughter LOVES it.
 Love my Fitbit!!!
 Perfect as described. Would buy again
 So far, I dig.
 It was a gift and my daughter likes it.
 My girlfriend loves it.
 The product was exactly as described.  Bonus, I received it the next day thanks to Prime!
 I have both Alta HR and Blaze, but I like this better because I can also wear a watch.
 I've had my Fitbit for a few weeks, and I really love it, even more than I thought I would. It really gives me an incentive to work out. I hardly ever worked out before I got it, but being able to set goals for how many days I should be working out a week, and seeing those days go up as I work out is a simple, but almost crazily effective incentive. I've worked out more in the past three weeks than I had probably the whole rest of the year. I love seeing stats about the exercise I've been doing, even if I'm not entirely convinced that the calories are correct, it still gives me something to compare other exercise days to. I love the heartrate fuction, and seeing it rise and fall depending on what kind of exercise you're doing, and my bpm has steadily fallen as I've done more exercise, which is encouraging to see.<br/><br/>I do wish that it would count stairs, but I don't really miss it, and it's not a terribly important feature, just a small thing. It counts your steps on the stairs, just not the floors of stairs you walk up, and the steps are really the most important part. One other thing I wish was slightly better is the battery. I feel like I have to charge it every couple of days, even though the package says that it should work for a full week without needing another charge. Either way, it's not a huge problem, just something I think could be improved upon.<br/><br/>It looks great, it works well. and it provides a simple incentive to work out more and to make the active choice throughout your day. What more could a person ask for?
 I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and so far she is loving it.  I got one for myself also and we have a little competition going.
 i love it
 Totally terrific. Glad I waited for the Special Edition (all black) to go on sale.  Works exactly as expected.
 Very nice product! Works great!
 Bought this as a gift for my wife on her birthday and she loved it! It was a perfect size for her petite wrist!
 After two weeks, the band clip broke and now I’m in the process of getting them to replace it. Love the product but VERY DISAPPOINTED the band clip broke so now I can’t wear it...
 Very nice! Exactly as pictured. Occasional sends a cute message letting me know that I have not moved for hours (at work). The instructions are clear.
 If your worst if small or you don’t like big dials. This is the best I would recommend which even provides notifications.
 Love, love, love this!
 Wife loves it
 Love all fitbit products
 I got this for a steal of amazon! Does exactly what I need it to do!
 Gifted and it was very appreciated. Helps keep you on program.
 I like that it gives me all the information I was looking for and looks nice at the same time.
 Love everything about this fitbit except it's not waterproof, but chose this over a larger fitbit because of size and price. Easy to read, easy to sync, gives all the information I want.
 I LOVE my Fitbit Alta HR, BUT I've only had it for 3 months and the screen cracked badly and I don't remember bumping it on anything! This is very disappointing because I used it every day
 good product
 I liked it very much, specially the heary rate meter and that my workouts are recorded...
 Love it, keeps me accountable
 Mine does not calculate the miles walked properly to the amount of steps taken. ie: 10,000 steps states 2 miles which should be 5 miles.
 I love the tracker, but my battery has gone completely dead twice.  I'm in the process of replacing the tracker for the 2nd time.  Very frustrating.
 I wear it everyday. I love that I can see who is calling even if my phone is on my desk. Reminds me to get up and move.
 I LOVE my fitbit. Has all the features I need and want. I like the slim look to it and the heartbeat tracker.
 After about a little over a month, the band starting coming loose and falling off on one side. I would expect it to last longer than that.
 Love it, great that you can change bands
 my daughter loves it
 works great! when pairing, i ended up having to restart my phone for it to pair. good product though.
 great
 Perfect size. Works great. No problems.
 very good but golden body should also be available.  all the three body should be available
 love it. I upgraded from the first generation FitBit. Love the clock and the HB matches my rate on various cardio machines.
 Everything is great so far!
 Excellent replacement for my Fitbit Surge.  By the way, I loved the Surge but the band snapped after 2 years.  Who would engineer a watch that was molded into the band, making it unwearable once the band snaps?  Stupid.
 So excited!!  Love the Sleep Monitor. Very user friendly. Would highly recommend
 Awesome product
 I love my Fitbit so far. The battery life is long, it's stood up to plenty of water and hard impact, and it's comfortable to wear. This is a must-have if you run or go on long walks.
 Gives me the info I need and is comfortable for everyday wear. Although, I don't put much stock in the sleep cycle information.
 Beautiful color!
 I gave this to my daughter for Christmas, after opening the box , the plug in was missing for her to charge it. the cord was there only . How do I get the plug in to the outlet? Please let me know.  Thank you in advance
 Love it.  Not too large
 Loving it
 Works great!
 This product didn’t even last a year. It corroded on the back when charging. I tried contacting the company and got no response. Very disappointed.
 Wife loves it
 I love the Alta better than my Charge HR. Like how it looks and fits, more compact, nice color + can get emails on the device!
 Great price.  Helps me keep track of my  calories intake and my physical activity.
 I love what fitbit can do, but the screen stays on for too short of a period and it's not too sensitive to touch (hard to turn on).
 fun to see accomplishments but frustrating when I cannot get moving, (a constant reminder to get up and move).
 I love my Alta HR! Exactly as described! Arrived on time
 after typical wear and tear the screen now only partially works and the sensor is totally busted. For the price, I would not buy again.
 Love the heart rate and sleep tracking functions, they work great!
 Love the it fits and feels. Very lightweight. Does everything I wanted!
 Comfortable, easy to read, accurate.
 Good and light
 Wonderful product!
 Everything I expected
 Works well!  Much better than UP!
 it's really an amazing product which tracks every single step in my day, and I am surprised with the sleep tracking and stages of sleep
 It was a Christmas present and the person who received it was very pleased!
 I love it!
 Great except you can't add extra steps from sports.
 A great little device. Takes a little getting used to with the narrow “sideways” display.  Battery life is every bit as good as advertised.  A much better charging mechanism than earlier Fitbit products!
 I love this product really like the heart rate monitor
 My wife loves this.
 Great buy
 The fastener will not stay closed and the battery doesn't last a full week.
 It works great as a reminder to move. I notice that the heart rate monitor is not always acurate, but hey it's on a moving body.
 I use this product to remind me to stay fit
 This is truly a awesome product. Only set back is the band is easy to get dirty. It's hard to clean and you can't really get it clean. She is not a outdoor woman so everything she does is inside but her walks. It looks like she played in the mud with it.
 Nice
 great product. my wife loves it as her anniversary gift. Thanks
 Works great. My wife loves it
 Love it !!!
 I love my Fitbit keeps me on my feet💪🏽
 Love it
 Love my Fitbit! I especially love seeing how I slept at night. Seems to be very accurate.
 Love it!!!!
 Perfect size. Very comfortable fit
 I Got this for my gf and she says loves it. She says it fits with most of her outfits.
 Bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves it!
 I bought it for my daughter for Christmas, and she loves it.
 LOVE it!  wish it was waterproof.
 Love it! Had the original Fitbit, but I like this way better. Thinner wristband looks sleeker and feels less invasive. Holds a charge for 5 days. Highly recommended.
 I enjoy using the watch to keep me moving.  It reminds me to get up and move if I sit for a period of time.  I dislike the fact that it cannot be read in sunlight.
 Great product. It arrived on time and I started using it the same day. You may want to change the sensitivity for a more accurate step count.
 Great product.
 Good watch l. Love the heart rate tracker and sleep watcher!
 Love it, it reminds me to move and keeps me motivated.  I like all the features and find the sleep mode very beneficial.  Wearing it comfortably took a few. days, it seemed huge and bulky on my very slender wrist.  Fortunately I adjusted and it feels fine.
 Grand daughter loves it!
 Of course I changed the band
 This product was a gift. The fit bits arrived on time and were appreciated by the recipients. I presume that they are working and being used.
 Love it
 so far so good! it works. the only thing is that the battery didnt last 1 week, more like 5 days
 Be aware that the fitbit alta hr doe not track a stationary bike or treadmill.
 Best fitbit thus far
 Doesn’t really snyc with my phone
 This was great while it lasted. But it just stopped working after 10 months.
 Love it!
 Great product. Ordered three of them for my kids. They arrived quickly in good packaging. My kids easily set them up and love having them.
 Love that with this product I am now able to track my fitness routine &amp; it was within my budget!
 The blue grey is a great color almost looks purple which is fine for me, this was an upgrade from my charge HR and the size in comparison is perfect. The charge is bulky in comparison.
 The Fitbit came with issue!!! It didn’t work at all.
 Love the changeable band.  I had the fitbit charger HR in black and was limited to what you could do with band.  Love, love, love the Alta!!!
 Jacob got this for my birthday. Love it.
 Sometimes Misses sleep details even when worn as directed. Step count based on arm movement.
 Very comfortable to wear. I love having the time and being able to customize the display.
 Work offered a $250 fitness reimbursement and I thought what better way to use it than to get some new bling!  I had a Fitbit Blaze previously and I liked the display on it a little better but love how this isn't so big and bulky.
 My wife is having fun with it and has multiple bands for it.
 Love it! I love trying to beat my steps and meet my workout goals!!
 Liking the special edition gun metal color and band.
 I love my Fitbit Alta.  I had the Charge HR which I liked, but I love the slimmer design of the Alta.  I do miss the altimeter, but it was worth it for the slimmer size.  I love the hourly step reminders, but wish they would consistently tell me how many steps are left or if there was a quick way to look up that information.  I also love the ability to switch out bands.  I have only had the Alta for about two weeks so far, so I can attest to its durability, but so far I am very happy with this purchase.
 After 6 months the battery was not holding the power.
 Small size makes is a great fit on my arm. Together with app delivers useful health insights.
 I love the idea of this watch. Small comfortable but you can’t see the face or any functions when your outside !?!?
 So far this is great! Looking forward to exploring all of the great features. Fits perfectly. I was right between small and large. After reading other reviews I ordered the large and I'm glad I did.
 Christmas present
 It work well the  The battery  Stays  for a long time
 Gave it to my sister for her birthday and she loves it and the changeable bands.
 comfortable
 My daughter love her Fitbit
 It is great!  I love the step reminder and the sleep log.
 not always accurate
 This is replacing my Gear S2 smart watch as my primary fitness tracker, and I already love it! I play basketball a few times a week, and I am able to wear this while playing, while I wasn't able to wear the S2 since it was so bulky on my wrist.
 Love this product - Fantastic
 Very good as expected
 Love it
 Was looking all over for this particular color. Glad they had it on here. I am loving my Alta Hr. Really great product and gets you motivated to move.
 Bought this for my wife for Mother's Day.  As a Fitbit HR user, this Alta HR looked ideal for her.  Well..if you plan on using it while outside exercising or just telling the time you will be returning it.  You cannot view the screens at all outside.  Inside is fine.  And oh by the way, my Fitbit HR is perfectly visible outside.  So....unless they can flash a firmware fix soon, returns will commence.
 I've really like all of the app features that go along with this fitbit. It's small which I really like. I previously used a fitbit charge, but I much prefer the slim design of the alta. The HR feature is really enlightening to my nightly sleep habits. I wish it would tell me how to get more deep sleep, but I think it's more of a trial and error based on what I do during the day and evening. I've definitely become more active as a result of wearing it because of the "get moving" alerts. AND when I fall just short of goal, I pace around the house in the evening so I can hit 10,000 steps. The band is great for working out, but I've purchased a more stylish band for wearing throughout the day and at work. Like I said, I've tried the fitbit charge which was ok and I've bought $30 trackers that were pretty awful because their app was really difficult and their step tracking wasn't accurate. I'd highly recommend spending the extra bucks on this fitness tracker. It has the best app and it's stylish.
 Love the functionality and performs as described.
 Bought it for my husband. He loves it. Not sure the sleep function is very accurate but really like the other features.
 Works beautifully and is a really great tool for getting and staying fit
 Well this was pretty awesome up until the face plate disappeared- i guess it fell off somewhere today. Owned it less than a year, not too sure I want to get another one 😠😱🤭
 Sold my Fitbit Alta to get the Fitbit Alta HR and I love that I can monitor my heart rate now. I also love the design of this one.
 I love it! The size is just right.<br/>If it had all the features of the Charge HR, it would be perfect.
 the all black is very nice and sleek
 Good but not even a year old and band constantly comes loose.
 This is perfect for my teenage son, or for anyone just embarking into the FitBit world.
 One of the watchband sides wont stay latched onto the Fitbit. This happened within 2 months of wearing it. How do I get a refund?
 This was a great purchase that my husband is still enjoying months later.
 I wasn't sure if wearing the Fitbit would actually make me move more, but it has!  I am loving everything about it.  Fits comfortably, even to sleep in.  Money well spent.
 The band gets easily discolored
 Works great
 I’ve had this for a few months and so far very happy with it!
 I have NO complaints! This is the best thing I could have ever bought for myself. Love how it shows me my sleep pattern.
 Wear it every day.  Battery life lasts about a week.
 This is beautiful and holds a charge really well!
 Great
 I have used Fitbit products since 2013,  I am a loyal user and really like this one.
 This fits my small wrist well, keep an accurate step count, provides bumps to let me know when I need to get up and walk.  I am very happy with it.
 I got this for my husband.  He loves it!  He doesn't like anything flashy and the gunmetal edition was just the right one!
 I had the Fitbit HR Charge a couple of years ago and ordered the Alta version and absolutely luv it. The smaller size I prefer much better. It looks more like a watch or accessory than the HR Charge larger version and I like the hourly motivators/reminders.
 Love this, helps when I’m at the gym! My trainer recommended one of these so I know that I am burning calories. Worth what I paid for so far.
 The HR is replacing my Alta and so far I love the new graphs with heart rate and calorie burn. Time will tell how accurate they are, but I find them motivating to keep me moving.
 This new Fitbit is such an improvement over my original one.  It is attractive and so easy to change bands.  It has really motivated me to increase my steps every day!!!
 Let me start by first saying the I'm somewhat of a minimalist, yet a gadget freak at the same time, so I had to give it a lot of thought before I bought it.<br/><br/>I bought the first Fitbit Flex in 2013. I found it useful both for sleep tracking and setting step goals. I've also owned a series of Garmin GPS watches I use for running.<br/><br/>I was torn with the idea of getting an Apple watch - do it all on one device, but ultimately decided against it as I'm not looking for the extra distraction, and I've been actually trying to without a watch (part of the minimalism exercise).<br/><br/>I found the Alta HR the perfect compromise - it is minimal as you can make it, and the HR function has really been a game changer for me. It's so light and thin, you hardly know its there, and provides minimal distractions. I really love their iPhone app - sync is seamless and the reports are excellent.<br/><br/>Overall, the Alta HR is the best low-cost solution for satisfying the basic needs of a health tracker in a very simple format.
 Very happy with it. Does everything I need,
 We have only been using the Fitbit for a couple of days, but I love all the features so far! Steps, heart rate, and sleep functions are really cool!
 My Fitbit didnt work at all, tried to reach the seller to see how to proceed and didnt hear back from him, very dissappointed
 Working out well
 It worked adequately; tracking steps, activity, etc.  However the HR function just isn’t that great, in part to the fact that the HR location is taken on the wrist. Gave it away after about 3 weeks.
 Great item arrived on time and as described
 Just got the Alta HR to replace my charge 2 and I love the look and feel. Hopefully the features are the same, but so far so good!
 Wife loves the Fitbit and all it can do.  It seems to be all she talks about now. Woot woot someone's else's sleep patterns, kinda like her dreams
 Happy with purchase.  So far performing as described.
 Love it. Wish I had the one with stair steps too. But I love it.
 Doesn't stay charged more than 2 days
 Cant manually log exercise.  That alone is an incredibly stupid design.  Basically useless for stationary biking and similar exercises, although their marketing makes sure to not tell you that outright.  2 stars because it is slim.
 My wife loves the Fitbit. It works well and is easy to setup.
 Completely satisfied with my Fitbit.  It has met all my expectations.
 Missing wireless dongle and wouldn't sink with tablet
 Nice
 i HAVE TO SENT IT BACK BECAUSE IT DID NOT WORK
 There was an imperfection on the screen of the “new” Fitbit. When it lights up, there is a horizontal line always displayed that looks like a tiny crack. Otherwise looks like new.
 Great product
 Great product
 I haven't receive any support.  My tracker is not even turn it on, let me know what to do or how can I return it
 Love it! Does everything I expected it to do.  Very accurate and is helping me get fit!
 I lke all the features.
 Love it!
 Very pleased with my Fitbit.
 I love my FitBit! It helps keep me active throughout the day, wakes me up gently every morning, and helps me sleep better. I'm so glad I invested in one, I am learning more about my health every day!
 The Fitbit Alta it self is great!  Love it! However the band is disappointing.  Within the first 30 days my band started to turn blue on the edges.  Disappointed in the band itself.
 Excelent product, easy to set up, app very good
 Perfect for all day use ... small form factor .
 It works as advertised and I am happy with the reports and explanations. Long battery life.
 I love it
 Love my Fitbit. Very motivating. Love all the messages that pop up throughout the day.
 Great for tracking exercise
 I was under the impression that an additional band was included with purchase of the fitbit at no additional cost.
 Top of my expectations
 It wakes me up randomly at night with a message saying “Go Go Go!”  Horrible product!
 The handle on the side of the fit bit fell off. What happened to it I just bought it about seven months ago, please help
 Bought this for my mom and she absolutely loves it. No problems so far!
 Best fitness tracker I've purchased. I love the heart rate monitor, and how it calculates your calories burned by using it. Very accurate!
 Doesn’t log workouts well
 Does everything as advertised!  Slim design is very attractive.
 Love this watch
 Love this updated Alta.  Like that I can close band like a watch and not having to press or snap shut.
 Love My New Fitbit Alta HR !
 It was a replacement so I already liked it.
 love my fitbit,
 Love it, other than when sleeping, the green light taking my pulse wakes me up.
 happy with my fitbit
 I really love it
 My wife loved it. She has it linked to her phone and she can read her text and see how is calling without looking at her phone. A great product
 Very disappointed with the Alta HR. I purchased because of the reviews, the fact that it had a small profile and the features. Particularly, I was looking forward to the notifications to move, the step counting and the sleep tracking. Of those three features, one has delivered. The steps and mileage are completely off, even after adjusting and refining my gait specifications. The sleep tracking logs me as asleep when I read - not necessarily the end of the world, but when coupled with the poor quality statistics on the other features, it makes for an disappointing product.
 have had other fitbits in the past, but this one had features I wanted, such as the heart and sleep monitor.<br/>Had to adjust stride for steps to be accurate, but wear it all of the time.
 Great item!  Quick delivery
 Replaced my Charge HR with the Alta HR...and love it! It's sleeker and does everything better. I even got a reminder to move, while sitting in a meeting.
 The product came when expected and the packaging wasnt damaged. I've been using it for a few days now and no issuez to report.
 GIFT.SHE LOVED IT
 Fit and fabulous! Glad I finally go on board with this.
 Best investment I ever made in myself.  Keeps me motivated and moving.  Always thought I was very active but learned where I have been slacking off!
 Love this product. Easy set up, durable and most accurate. Bought a large band to wear on my ankle when I can't wear on my wrist.
 Not always accurate on tracking my heart rate unless I wear it really tight, but otherwise it's pretty good.
 Love all the functions - they all work very well.
 Does everything I need without being bulky.  My favorite features are the clock, seeing steps without app, and battery life feature.
 graduated to this after my charge hr fell apart (it still works but the mechanics separated from the band.  love that i can switch bands on this and that it is smaller....that said, it's not the easiest to read
 Great product. Appreciate that it works for days before needing to be charged.
 Great device! Slim and works perfectly. Would definately recomend if you're someone who would like to know your daily fitness stats, but are not a professional athlete.
 This is a very light and comfortable watch. It is accurate and hasn't froze it quit working.
 love that it tracks my sleep.
 Works well; love it!
 Have the basic fit bit, this is one great to monitor heart rate
 Beautiful
 Had to tap very hard on the screen to get it to work. Stopped working after 2 months.
 My wife loves her fitbit. I also purchased a different band and it looks great!
 FITBIT is easy to use and track.  Only thing I would like is for the apartus to be less cumbersome -- even though I use the last hole of a small Fitbit, its really too large -- I still love it!
 Perfect for me!  Just what I needed to stay motivated!
 Product was used to improve health.
 Very nice.
 I love this Fitbit.  It has everything I need.  It even tracks my sleep—how much REM, deep and light sleep I get.
 Fantastic product. I love how it tracks virtually everything I do.
 Love it
 The Fitbit Alta HR does all that it claims to do.
 Love this product, but it doesn't always respond easily to tapping the screen.
 Love it
 I bought this one and it doesn't work anymore the screen doesn't lit up from day1<br/><br/>Need to go for a replacement or refund. I suggest to order directly from fibit.com
 Had this Fitbit for less than 2 months and it fell off due to a faulty connection and is lost. What can I do?
 Did not track steps accurately.
 Happy with Fitbit Alta HR so far. No problems and has worked well.. Got for my wife for birthday. She likes being able to see how well she sleep each night as well as steps per day.
 Works great.  Love the color!
 I have always loved Fitbit products. I went from the blaze to the Alta HR. And I love it! I like how it's smaller than the blaze but also includes great benefits of tracking my exercise and steps.
 Excellent product. I would strongly recommend it.
 Works great, arrived early. It was the cheapest price after doing a ton of searching. The pink band is kinda ugly, I bought a magnetic rose gold one and it looks awesome and works wonderfully.
 Love it! Fit perfectly, works great, battery lasts days!
 Could not pair with Bluetooth. Tried numerous times with absolutely no luck at all.
 didn't like want to return it. Don't use it at all. Not what I thought it was, not helpful at all
 I purchased this for my mom and she says that the Fitbit can't charge. Really disappointed with this product.
 Difficult to pair...could not get it to show texts..Very unresponsive to tapping...very unresponsive to wrist turn..The strap broke  on my Fit Bit Charge so I thought I would upgrade to the Alta..no bueno...returning tomorrow.  Ordered Fit Bit Charge 2...hopefully, will have better luck!
 I like everything about except I wish I could my text meesages on my screen. The size is perfect since is not bulky.
 Was never able to sync it to my compatible phone after hours of tech support and stuff. Returned and will likely never buy fitbit again.
 Hardware is nice, software sucks
 Just as described.
 Good investment
 This was a present for my wife, and provides her with all of the data that she was looking for to help her maintain a healthy lifestyle.
 My mom loves it
 Love it!
 Works amazing. Got it for the wife for Christmas and has enjoyed every minute she has it. Enough said
 Love it!  works great!
 Great color.  Fits and works excellent.
 Slim design and lots of information available on wrist and on app.
 Good product!
 Product isn’t brand new. Obvious signs of use. Very disappointed.
 Wife loves it!
 Got this as a gift for my mother and she loves it
 I like the fact that I can switch out the band. I love that I can see how much battery power is left on my Fitbit. It's a great tracker.
 Great proce great product! Thank you!
 I love the size of this fitbit.  It was easy to set up and get started.  I also love the color.  Very pleased.
 I used the Fitbit One for almost 3 years and enjoyed it very much.  I decided to upgrade to the Fitbit Alta HR since it was easier to track sleep and could distinguish different levels of sleep.  This feature is working well on the Alta HR.  I would give the Alta HR a 5-star rating, but it falls short in measuring steps.  Recently while at the grocery store, the Alta HR only gave me about 50 steps while pushing a buggy up and down many isles of the large store.  I also noted that using a treadmill while holding the bars short changes me by about 40% of the steps that I would get with the Fitbit One doing the same treadmill routine.  One day before starting my standard treadmill routine, I took the Alta HR off of my wrist and put it in my gym pants.  The number of steps was almost exactly what I was expecting based on my Fitbit One experience.  In conclusion, I am somewhat disappointed that the new Fitbit doesn't always count steps when the arm is not in motion.  The counter is accurate if I wear it in my pocket, however.<br/><br/>Update:  After using the Alta HR for about a month, I have changed my rating from 3 to 2 stars.  The sleep tracking is the best, most accurate function.  Steps are not counted correctly unless the device is in my pocket when pushing a buggy or holding on to a treadmill while walking.  Of course, when I place it in my pocket I loose an accurate heart rate.  The heart rate then tends to jump to very high levels and the Alta then thinks that I'm very active and largely over counts my active minutes.  Overall, I am now disappointed and wish that I would have stayed with my old Fitbit One.
 Works great
 I was so excited to get this only to open it up and have the wrong size. I ordered a large and got a small. Now I have to order a seperate band.
 Does what I expected it to do. Difficult to read in sunlight.
 Excellent gift to my daughter!!!  She always uses!!  Thanks!!
 The screen stopped working and my return window closed :(
 Loved that it arrived on time!  Love the Fitbit!
 Easy to set up and get staryed
 my daughter loves this fitbit watch
 Bought it for the girlfriend, it works like a charm!
 Had to return it.
 Love my Fitbit Alta! Being able to read text messages and receive call alerts is wonderful. Enjoying the longer battery life and option to replace wristband as well!
 Good - just don't love the double-stacked time.  But it looks nice!  And the battery life is great.
 The functions are nice, but the display panel sometimes does not work well.
 Gift for my wife she enjoys it very much
 Works as expected
 Love it. It has helped keep me on track on all levels.
 Slim and comfortable
 I like the smaller size and the features of the Fitbit Alta.
 Was nice when it worked but 4 months later it no longer charges, quite a waste of $120 when my Garmin is 2 years old and still works.
 I love the gunmetal, it goes with everything. The width is perfect, especially for a woman with smaller wrists.
 Love it
 I like everything about this product!!!!
 Easy to set up.  Encourages you to get up if you’ve been sitting too long.  Love tracking my sleep.
 Gift for my daughter - she really likes it.
 It has a band like a watch , which is good and improvement on the charger with a longer cord. So far so good!
 I would like to know how to return it-band broke and face has small crack.  I bought extended warranty-please advise
 I love it,  I used to have the surge but wish the watch (time) stayed lit up like on the surge.
 The Fitbit Alta works great.  No complaints.
 Looking to track sleep, plus exercise.. band keep falling apart.<br/>Will try getting new band.. just stopped wearing ..
 So happy the XL fits. It is so hard for me to find watches that fit
 Thin and very useful
 Had to return because it never worked. The battery never charged even after 12 hours of being plugged in. Could never set up! Very disappointed.
 Loving my Fitbit Alta HR....Super easy to setup. Being a "senior" I already needed customer support....very polite and patient! Easy to get to also....All around a great experience!!
 Shipping was super fast, product came brand new in the box and I absolutely love it!
 Just what i ordered. Husband set it up for me and it is way better than my phone.
 my brother use it everyday
 It doesn't track all your steps of your arms aren't moving and then if you stand in one place moving your arms it tracks as steps
 I love my fit bit
 It keeps you moving and aware that you need to be moving. I also like how it tracks water consumption, and sleep pattern. Wonderful item.
 I really like my new Fibit and especially the more detailed breakdown of sleep patterns.
 I didn’t get charged in the box.
 very nice.
 The fit bit ordered from amazon stoped working after 6 weeks of use, very unhappy
 Bought in September. .. does not charge anymore...
 I love it!
 Nice one! My wife liked it.
 Works great.
 Best b-day present for myself.
 Keeping active monitoring heart rate during exercise
 It works perfect! helped my girlfriend to know how she sleeps and keeps her motivated with the achievements
 I like it but wish it counted flights of steps like my old one.
 I like the ease of use. The activity tracker is accurate. And the sleep tracker capability has me checking my sleep patterns daily.
 I loved this watch until it completely died less than a year after I bought it.
 I really like my Fitbit Alta HR.  First off I have a small wrist and this fits me really well.  It shows the time and date, my steps, distance traveled, calories burned, Heart beat, how many minutes I dedicated to focused exercise and battery life.  It also links up to my Android phone and I can see my sleep quality and pattern, as well as track my weight and a few other things.  I am in Weight Watchers and it also syncs to my Weight Watchers app and logs my exercise points.  I work at a desk in an office all day and I can get really busy working on my tasks and forget to get up and move around.  I have my Fitbit set to give me gentle vibrations on my wrist each hour reminding me to get a few steps in and stretch.  This has really helped with my back problems I get from droning on at my desk all day.  Bottom line..I love it, it is a useful tool in my overall journey to better health.
 Exceeded my expectations.
 Charger included does not work. Luckily, i have another hr charger that works.
 So far so good!
 Loved the colors, but received a defective tracker and charger so I had to contact fitbit's customer support to get a new one.
 Only wish it was water proof!
 Love it
 This does not allow you to track your exercise manually.  It failed to detect 2 out of 3 workout sessions.  Returned it.  Too bad they ruined a good thing.
 I love this product!!  Well worth the money!  Very comfortable, stylish looking on the arm and not too heavy!!
 Bought as a gift for a friend for her birthday.  She opened it and screen has  a large crack.  Five days past return window.  DO NOT BUY CHEAP
 Loved it
 It does what it is supposed to do!
 Everything went as expected. Just another perfect Amazon Prime transaction.
 Unboxed and everything looks good. Works great!
 Band keeps popping open
 Thank you!
 Love it! So far so good. Bought this for myself and my boyfriend (he got the black one). It looks good on our wrists and syncs perfectly to the app and iPhone.
 Would have been perfect if my screen didnt come with a few scratches.
 light wrist bands color-transfer on the first day with dark clothes. Consider buying dark color wrist bands
 I enjoy the product. I see an improvement in my workout reports with the Alta HR compared to the original Alta. It's small and not too bulky.
 Gorgeous
 I like it monitor sleep as well as exercise
 Absolutely love the Fitbit Alta HR.  Like having a watch and the Heart rate monitor is great.  Upgraded from a Flex and so glad I did.
 Just small size! No floors display, Bundled wristband not good, No 24 hour format display.
 Love my fitbit alta but having a hard time getting it to connect for charging.
 I am enjoying the new Fitbit Alta. It gives me all the info I need, is a slim band on the arm and the battery lasts pretty long too.
 LOVE IT that is all I can say
 LOVE IT!!!
 Not high tech but very durable!! 5 stars
 Zero stars, display does not work.  Very disappointed!!!
 Comfortable and I love it!
 I have been enjoying my fitbit. it is working phenomenally. I ahvent really had a problem with it.
 Alta HR does everything it says and more.  I love it.  The heart rate monitor works great and it syncs up with my fitness pal app which makes it even easier to keep track of food, exercise, etc.
 My gf loves this fitness tracker.  It's very accurate as far as fitness tracking and the app is a joy to navigate.  Great job fitbit!
 I like the Fitbit Alta HR but I wish it had a stair counter.  Otherwise, it's an okay product.
 Won’t hold a charge for more than 3 hours after charging all night
 Clasp did not work and no instructions.
 I love it.. it motivates me to walk more and challenge myself more.
 Awesome!! I love my Fitbit Alta HR!! It is a motivator and just what I needed!! 😊♥️😍
 Everything works exactly as it should. The band is more of a purple than pink, which I am very happy with.
 No issues so far. Fully charged will last around 4 days not 8.
 I wish I had known the latch connection to the watch was rigged to fail soon after the warranty was over.
 This has so much potential but for the price I paid it just didn't last long enough and replacement parts are not available. My particular issue is simply that the top popped off somewhere while I was walking. It's just gone. This is apparently not covered under their warranty or guarantees and they won't even sell me a replacement screen -- truly it's just the plastic screen that covers the workings. I was offered 10% off a new one but, seriously, $19 off just doesn't work for me -- especially after only 4 months. I will "make-do" with this (which is still working, just exposed to the elements) until I can get a Garmin. Seriously FitBit.....This was my 3rd Fitbit and I've been a customer since 2014.
 This is a great product that tracks sleep, steps, and heart rate very well. It's ideal for anyone who doesn't want the larger models.
 Hard to view outside especially if you want to view hr while exercising outdoors
 Love it !
 I love the tracking system, but wished that it had a longer battery life.  It has made me more aware of moving and meeting my daily goal of 10,000.00 steps.
 Love my Fitbit. Just as described and does the job keeping my health under control
 I bought this in September and 5 months in it stopped working.
 love it
 I love this. I have a Fitbit surge. But it’s to big. So I got this one and I wear it all the time.
 Love it
 Love my new Fitbit. It has actually made me more active:)
 LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!
 This is a piece of crap.  First the Strap broke now not even one year old and it won't keep a charge or work.  I am Pissed off.
 Love my new fitbit
 I AM IN LOVE. It was worth the money.
 love it!
 Never worked, had to return it. Wouldn’t charge or turn on.
 Item arrived with no damage and in 100% full working order.
 works great!
 Charger cable was broken in two pieces. Looks like wire was cut.
 So literally I had my Fitbit less than a week before it started having issues. I wasn't getting forwarded messages from my cell (which I was told was an easy fix) but then the band kept loosening on me. SO instead of going thru Amazon (which I definitely should've), I messaged Fitbit support (I believe I did this because they kept emailing me anyhow). Their support is helpful, but you get a different person everytime in the same email thread which meant, I had to provide the same information sometimes, I had to follow up because I didn't receive a response, etc. Then, after doing everything they needed, I shipped out the defective Fitbit to find out it would take almost a month to get a new one ! If I did this thru Amazon, I knew they would've handled my issue quickly. I explained this to Fitbit and they were able to expedite my Fitbit. I still haven't received as I am typing this. I should be by tomorrow or the next day I believe. I'm frustrated because I was so excited to use the product in itself but then had to go thru all of this. For the short time I did use the product, it was really cool ! I'm not sure how accurate the heart was, and I'm kinda bummed it doesn't calculate the flights like the Charge does but oh well. Also, if you like to log your exercise, this isn't the one for you.
 love it, but need to return because of fog/moisture under the screen from a simple hand wash, definitely not rain resistant , or splash resistant. The watch barely got wet, and boom the next day there is moisture under the screen, this must be improved in the next model....
 What I like most is that it gets me motivated to walk.  What I like least is that the display is smaller than I expected.
 The product stopped working after only 10 months...
 Battery life not as long as described. Enjoy tracking runs, steps and sleep.
 Works well only drawback is that you need the Internet to sync it
 I am beyond happy with my fitbit alta HR. It has been helping me out with motivation to hit my set goals.
 This product is defective. I contacted Fitbit who are sending a replacement.
 Love this version. Battery life is amazing.
 Shipped fast and works great!
 wife loves it shes 125 lb
 Use it daily to help keep me motivated. I keep challenging myself to take an increased number of steps every day.
 my fit bit won't sync.  very frustrating.  I want a new one. May I have a replacement.<br/><br/>thanks<br/><br/>lori
 Doesn't track sleep or HR while exercising (so also doesn't track calories burned accurately). Returned.
 Wrist band dropped off easily after 6 months - but Fitbit promptly replaced it at no charge.
 Junk. Save for the Samsung.
 not reliable sync/connection with iphoneX,
 Wonderful to keep track of everything
 Works well for heart rate
 Great fit and I like seeing my hr, sleep, steps daily
 Works great
 I love it!  It’s everything I expected it would be.
 Love it. You can change the way the display if you so desire. It's small, but I can't see myself getting anything bigger. It would look way too bulky on my wrists.
 Love it! Its durable and does everything I was looking for!
 Had the samsung gear and it stopped working after a year.  This fit bit is great and I like their app much better as well.
 It nice and helpful but the pande is uncomfortable
 Flexibility to customize goals and workouts.  Library of health information is very helpful.
 It don't track right when I'm on the treadmill. It dosen't  give me credit for the distance that I walk.
 I love my FitBit! I rely on it to get all my steps in per day, and monitor my sleep patterns. I'm sad when I accidentally forget it!
 Love the looks and fit
 Like the color. Hate having to tap thru stuff.
 Love it. Comfortable and not too large
 Kind of useless if it won't talk to Apple Health.
 I love this fit bit. The accuracy seems to be better than previous ones I've owned. My favorite feature is the sleep tracker.
 Great product! Defiantly worth it
 Love it!  Has gotten me up and moving more!
 I enjoy the ease of tracking my activity and the way my Fit Bit emails me my progress. The battery life is great as well.
 Love it. Tracks everything, HR monitor works perfectly. Great insight into how my body burns and consumes calories. Life changing!
 Purchased for my wife. She is very pleased with this Fitbit.
 Helps with tracking my sleep and heart rate
 Love it
 I love how it keeps track of heart rate an how many miles I walk each day.
 As described 100%
 Liking it so far.
 Its perfect for what I need :)
 My wife loves everything
 Love it!
 Unable to turn on this device.  I will be returning this produce since I cannot use it.
 I've previously owned 3 fitbit charges, all of which have fallen apart sooner than I'd like. I bought the Alta hoping it was like a slimmer charge HR and it seemed like it was... until my resting heart rate went up 10 bpm upon wearing it and I realized I can't track exercise before I start it. Today doing a tabata weights/cardio exercise, apparently I was only in the fat burning zone when my asthma was kicking in, sweating like crazy, etc. I tried adjusting my Fitbit's position on my wrist during my workout several times to no avail. Thus the calorie count was totally off for my workout, which is one of my favorite features!<br/><br/>I think ever since they increased the size of the screen, it's harder to properly position the Fitbit on your wrist to get an accurate heart rate count.<br/><br/>Overall this alta is better looking but lacking an accurate heart rate counter and features for tracking exercise. Wish I had known before I bought it!
 Love it!  Color was represented perfectly .. works great.  Love the slimmer design vs the Charge 2.
 Awesome product, brand new pristine condition. Motivates you to exercise!
 Wife loves it!
 This device regularly overstates heart rate.
 I'd been on the fence for several months now about buying a Fitbit, but I'm so glad I waited for the Alta HR release. I love the slim design, watch band style strap, and the amazing battery life (7+ days)! The app is fantastic and I am so happy with my purchase.
 Great device!
 10/10 would recommend. Great quality, packaging and ship time. Just as described!
 Love it!
 Showed up dead on arrival.
 Love it, still haven't explored all the features but I love it.
 Works good. Does not coutn times up stairs. Had one incident in which it stopped syncing. Took a couple of days to get to how  fix. Otherwise it is great.
 Love the new HR!  The app is great, and so easy to use!
 Loved it fits well
 Works great!
 Best price on the market!<br/>It was a gift for my daughter.<br/>She absolutely loves it!!!<br/>- Kim
 Great product. I love it
 just had it for a few days but so far I love it it is the perfect size for me.
 good for friends
 Love it, fast shipping!
 This is a great Fitbit product! All of the features are great. Especially the HR feature, learning more about my sleep patterns has been interesting!
 I was skeptical at first but I love my new Fitbit.  Very comfortable to wear even when sleeping. Interfaces with my phone easily.  Definitely glad I purchased it.
 Great product for helping me set and keep goals for running
 Love it
 Love the color very comfortable
 Love the look and fit
 Does everything it says it will. Great way to track your fitness.
 I love it
 Stopped working less than 6 weeks :(
 Not as nice as the Fit bit charge 2 I had . Seems to be less accurate
 It works great. Just wish my wife would use it once in a while..
 I received three instead of one.
 Great,got it for my Mom.Pinkj and Gold band is great.It' s a real motivator to walk/ work out!!
 Really like the size, weight and style. Fitbit..bring back the stairs!
 Effective, comfortable and battery is long lasting, I'm very happy with it.
 Love this Fitbit
 Love my Fitbit Alta HR. Wanted something special to celebrate my 60th birthday,  so I went for the rose gold.
 Awesome product! Only down side is the coral band gets dirty very quickly. I would recommend a dark color of band.
 My Fitbit will not charge
 Piece of junk. I can't even fathom what development team could possibly think this was ready for release. It might be fine for sitting at your desk but the minute you start to move the heart rate monitor cuts in &amp; out. Wow, really? A fitness product that doesn't do it's job when.....gasp....you actually exercise. Bad enough FitBit is a generation behind w/ water resistance but when you can't even get the basic functionality to operate consistently it's a problem. Buy a Polar or Garmin or pretty much any other brand. I would write this off as a one time bad product but I had a charge 2 - did the exact same thing.
 Good
 After just 3 weeks it froze up and quit working. Very disappointing!
 my fitbit didn't come with sync tab.
 Love it. Helps me keep a close eye on my sleep patterns, calories, and has some fun activities to challenge yourself.
 THanks came in brand new gracias.
 Broke at work. Kinda sad only lasted two months.
 Fast shipping. Works great!
 I am very disappointed. The heart rate monitor function is sporadic at best. It has become an expensive pedometer.
 Christmas gift for my daughter and she loves it, especially the color.
 Is my second fitbit i purchase. Pity still not water proof and can not follow other excercise like bicycle, swimming... Otherwise, i am happy with my fitbit.
 Just what I expected
 Love it; it has turned my life around and I have lost 12-1/2 lbs and counting!
 Love the device, hate the awful rubber wristband. Hence the 4 star rating.
 Works great
 Looks amazing
 Great features, like the reminders for activity, messages.  Lightweight and nice.
 I've had a lot of Fitbits... I am a sucker for stats, and the reminders to move and silent alarms are great features. Upgraded to this from the Alta, love that the HR is finally in a smaller feminine package! The vibration is also a bit more subtle than the Alta, which I like - my silent alarm is actually pretty silent now. Lets me take advantage of the new sleep stages that Fitbit launched recently, I like seeing that level of detail about my sleep. And the watch band design is great, love the gray color. I find that automatic exercise tracking is lacking since my activity is mostly strength training, and it seems to only pick up running and walking, but it's easy to track manually with the app. Definitely happy with the upgrade.
 Love the Fitbit Alta..it's comfortable and easy to use.
 Although it took time from ordering to receiving, it was cheaply available. I was able to start using it without problems immediately.
 Great while it lasted. Stopped working within a year : /
 love it
 Works great, packaging was great, arrive on time, really have nothing bad to say.
 I love my new Fitbit! It is so nice to be able to track my heart rate patterns when I sleep. Already beginning to enjoy my new life style
 this a personal item
 These are life savers
 It gives accurate HR and sleep tracking. It is stylish and comfortable. The Fitbit app is intuitive and useful to track your progress. Thumbs up!
 I only had this product for one day and the band irritated my skin. Plus it doesn't count stairs either. Overall it is a nice product but just not meant for me. I am returning it and just sticking with my Apple Watch Series 2!
 Really like this fitbit and what it keeps track of!
 Good
 Perfect fit love it!!
 I have a very small wrist and originally bought a charge 2.  It wouldn't pick up my steps correctly so my husband tried it on and it works perfect for him.....he kept it! lol  I decided to try the Alta HR and I absolutely love it!  It's smaller than the Charge 2 and I think that is why it works better for me.  My wrist are child size, and even the Charge 2 with a small band would skip hundreds of steps for me a day.  They are both very nice, but personally I prefer the comfort and look of the Alta HR.  I can now walk or jog without long periods of missed steps and the heart rate tracker is wonderful.  I love waking up to check out the sleep analysis that records how well I rested (or didn't) every night.  I highly recommend the Alta HR for anyone who wants to get a clearer picture of your overall health, as well as remind you to get up and move!
 Performs as expected.  Good buy.
 Wow, this thing sucks.  There is no documentation.  One needs to surf the web and wade through phone and app settings to get something as simple as text message notifications to work.  Hmm, they still don't work.  WTF.  No idea.  Oh, and no email notifications either.<br/><br/>Previously I had a Garmin Vivosmart HR and the main thing I used it for was to track an activity, and secondarily to monitor heart rate.  I could start it at the beginning of a walk or hike and could see how far I'd gone.  If the hike was say 8 miles and I'd gone 6, I'd know what's left to do.  The info was there, on the device, on my wrist.  This doesn't do that.  I don't always want to carry my phone and be looking at it.  I don't know but I think that's my option.  Even then it's 'auto-start' so who knows when it begins.  At the trail head?  I'll guess not.  I obviously I didn't do enough research before purchasing.  I read comparisons with the Charge 2, which has a GPS and can map your activity.  The review implied to me that with the Alta I just couldn't map it, not that I couldn't even track it.<br/><br/>So frustrated and disappointed.
 I wish it would show the steps on it instead of the bars on the band
 I really wanted to like this but it is too painful to wear. I have small wrists and the Alta is too long (wide?) for my wrist and no matter how I adjust the band, it digs into my wrist or dangles off my arm. I've tried two different bands to no avail. It also doesn't count floors, which is a drag. So...back to the Fitbit One. No pain with that one.
 Great product!
 Used. Smells like cigarettes.
 Almost Perfect
 Love it! Exactly what I wanted!
 LOVE IT
 Bought for mom.  She loves it.  Arrived on time.  Thanks!
 Bad product.
 There is nothing I don't love about it
 Love it except band picks up newspaper print
 Love this little piece of technology...it is really helping me to stay on track with my fitness goals in a fun way.
 Keeps me moving.
 I love my Fitbit
 I like it!
 Very happy with this Fitbit. I don't exercise so this is helping me to start moving.
 wife love's it
 Easy to set up and use.  Really happy I bought this
 Two different wristbands broke within one month.  Replacement wristbands are $30.
 Wife loved it. It is inspiring her to challenge herself to move around more thru the day.
 I love that it's sleek and I  can change bands.
 Love it,  love it!
 Like everything about it.
 Good
 Useful, helpful, informative, supportive, practical and extremely motivational tool.
 Delayed delivery, but good
 couldn't connect it to my phone so I returned it.
 i like it
 Nice
 Love it
 Display was not working, had to return it
 Got as a gift for daughter; she loves it.
 Terrific gadget.
 Quit taking a charge after 2 months
 Small, Practical and  convenient.  Like this design.
 Wife and recipient of gift here. Exactly what I wanted. Was on time for my birthday. Am thrilled so far!
 This product​ is great! totally recommend buying.
 I loved the idea of the Alta HR model as I was looking to downsize the amount of real estate a fitness band takes up on my wrist. I fell in love blue/gray color and liked the options for changing out the bands.  I had been a long time user of the Charge HR model and used it mostly for fitness tracking.  I do like the Alta for many reasons but since my main goal is fitness tracking, I find I still prefer the Charge HR model.  The Alta version does track my aerobic activities, however the SmartTrack feature does not seem to work as seamlessly as the manual tracking feature that the Charge HR has.  There are times during my kickboxing workouts that SmartTrack records two separate intervals of either aerobic or sport activity when in actuality I've been working out for 60 minutes non stop.  I do compare my workouts in conjunction with one another so when SmartTrack drops tracking, this makes it hard to do.
 This has opened my eyes to my eating, drinking and sleeping habits and provides a great tool to help make positive changes to each.
 Got it for my daughter and she loves it.
 Got for my wife for Mother's Day. It has really inspired her to get more active.
 Perfect
 It is not recording my sleep
 gets dirty very easily and doesn't come clean
 Good.
 Great! Didn't fit as expected tho, but it works fine.
 Poor doesn't keep time or start over on steps each morning..
 Love love love my new Fitbit and I love the color! This rose gold band is everything
 Great price and early delivery. Grand kids love them.
 Love the addition of the HR to the Alta. It's definitely upgraded what the tracker can do for you.
 Love it!
 Didn’t work
 Love it! Shipping was super quick and prompt. Thanks!
 Fails to count steps way over on count
 great product but the heart rate stops working when you are sweating or during workout
 This product is terrific, does everything I need it to.  Perfect for my very small wrist.
 Awesome tracker and I like sleeping tracker the most.
 excellent
 I bought this for my wife who was beginning an exercise fitness program. She loves it! She uses it with the smartphone and PC applications to track activity. Since I don't personally use it, I can't go into great detail about it, but I know she is syncs the device to both her phone and laptop to track activity, steps, calories burned, etc. It has provided just a little more "incentive" for her and helps to provide a bit of "instant gratification" knowing that she has met small goals throughout the day! It was definitely an appreciated gift!
 A Christmas gift for my Wife. She loves it!!
 Comfortable to wear &amp; it does what it's suppose to do. Very satisfied with this purchase.
 Band is too small.
 I got it for the sleep tracking and it does seem to work very well.<br/><br/>But the thin band or rigidity of the face itself puts weird pressure on my wrists. I thought maybe only wearing it at night would help, but the pain is too much. I do not have huge or fat wrists, and even putting band to ultra loose, where I can fit 3 fingers still doesn't stop the pain.<br/><br/>I bought a charge 2, with a fatter and softer band and I no longer feel any pain. You can google "alta fitbit pain" and see tons of other people complaining about it.
 tracks sleeping patterns, calories burned, steps. easy to use.
 Works great. Looks great!
 This product is AMAZING! It really has all of the items you need for a true fitness tracker.
 Upgraded from the original Charge HR. Much cleaner interface, slimmer fit, and the waterproofing is extremely helpful. Functionality is almost identical. Warning, if you have tiny wrists, don't get the large thinking you can just use it at its smallest setting, make sure you get a smaller size!
 We have to tap the fitbit screen 4 or 5 times before anything appears on the screen (sometimes even more). Not responsive at all. Then to tap through the other screens sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. If it doesn't the screen will eventually go dark and you have to tap 4 or 5 more times (sometimes more) to get it to come on and then hope you can tap to other screens. Takes us a few minutes to scroll through the few screens on the fitbit. Does this every single time. Can't stand how unresponsive that touch screen is, makes it almost useless.
 Really am enjoying my Fitbit!!
 Product as expected.
 Love it! I wish it was waterproof so I could wear it swimming but a minor detail. Sleek and stylish.
 Love my new Fitbit Alta HR!
 Product good quality and was as described. No issues.
 Disappointed that it does not smart track walking on a treadmill.
 Love how light and comfortable it is.  Noticed it does not track flights of stairs but that could be a setting I haven't found yet.  I use reading glasses and the one setting allows the display to be big enough that I don't need to put on my reading glasses to see the time and step count.  Tracking stages of sleep was a surprise for me as did not read into all the new options.  Seeing REM, light, and deep sleep has been eye opening.
 Too difficult to view and operate on a sunny day.
 It does everything it says and more. Love it.
 excellent Product and works very well
 I love it! It helps me to get moving again.  It does not get me up or tell me to go to sleep like it did at first. I set a remind to go to bed at 11:00 pm and get up at 8:00 am. I have gotten in 10,000 steps a couple of times, mostly 8,000 is the highest. I have a sore foot so walking a lot right now is not going to happen. Plus I have surgery next week so I wont be walking much for 3 weeks. However, I will try to do set ups until I can walk again.<br/><br/>My next door neighbor always gets in 10,000 or even 14,000 steps a day, which is amazing!
 It keeps track of heart rate
 Quite happy with it.
 Love love love!
 I love my Fitbit! It is fun and helps me challenge myself every day!
 Love it
 Very good to monitor my daily pulse, steps etc.
 Great features and long battery life.
 Very beautifull fitness tracker!
 could not get it to charge.
 Wife loves it. Happy life.
 works great!!  It has really helped to keep my motivation to get back into running.
 Easy to use and bring me a healthy life everyday
 Love the smaller profile of the Alta. This replaces my Charge HR. I do miss the stair counter a little bit but not enough to switch back. I also prefer the charging device on the Alta - and that you can switch out bands.  The only MAJOR frustration with the Alta is the way you cycle the display through the info (heart rate, steps, etc).  Wish it had a button like the Charge. Finally found a post that suggested tapping the band instead of the display and that has worked wonders.
 I liked the looks of it, but it broke after a few days.
 Great product. Highly recommend.
 It is everything I thought I was getting. Love it!
 First, let me start by the fulfillment of my order... amazing.  I ordered this just before midnight and had it by the early afternoon the next day.<br/><br/>Regarding the product...There are a lot of things I love about the Fitbit: the tracking of activity, calories, sleep, etc. all in one place is fantastic.  As someone who has always struggled with sleep, I've found the sleep tracking really interesting.  And I love that it syncs with my phone for text, calendar and call notifications (as long as it's in range).  That said, I haven't not transformed into a significantly fitter person.  Obviously this cannot actually work out or prepare healthy meals for me (that would help), but it has made me more aware of how inactive I have been and the child in me is thrilled when I get a notification that I've met one of my goals.  So it has helped a bit with motivation.<br/><br/>Now that I've had this a few months, I do see some of the same problems I'd read in other reviews.  The coral band is grey and dirty around the edges and will not come off no matter how much I've cleaned it.  The other issue I've had is with the comfort.  I had been wearing this virtually 24/7 and found that my wrist and forearm started to ache (I wear it very loose as they suggest, so it's not an issue of being too tight).  I've started taking the band off a lot more, particularly when I sleep, or switching wrists, but obviously that kind of defeats the purpose of wearing a tracker in the first place.  Finally, the tracking is not always consistent, and I find that on the rare occasions I do intense cardio, the Fitbit doesn't pick up my heart rate at all.<br/><br/>Overall, although I really like the technology, I would probably try a different version of the Fitbit that is more comfortable to wear.
 Works great
 GREAT!!
 Works great for what I need. Too bad it doesn't give your blood sugar too! What more can I say..
 Love it
 I'm am VERY upset. I haven't even had this Fitbit for a month and it already quit working. I haven't gotten it wet or ruined it in any way! I was at work and the screen just quit working. I thought maybe the battery just died. I have been charging it for hours and the screen still will not come on. When you spend over 100$ on a product you'd expect it to last for more than a month. As you can see my battery is at Medium so it should be working. I keep trying to get the screen to come on and it wont. I'm very upset, this is the worst product ever!
 I love it
 It does not work
 Comfortable on my wrist and love the optional bands.
 Fits well, wife loves it...
 Love it!!
 This fitbit is so awesome! I highly recommend it.
 cool
 Perfect fit thanks
 Fantastic tracker
 good material and nice look
 Love it!
 Exactly as advertised and super fast delivery
 My fitbit has worked very well.  It reminds me to keep moving.
 I love my Fitbit!!! Great features!
 I love it!! I'm extremely happy with my purchase!!
 Perfect!!!!!
 Great product. Helps to track sleep.
 Interesting piece of machinery
 Works wonderfully!
 it is poor.. cannot receive whatsapp message
 I regret buying into this fad. My phone can do almost everything the Fitbit does for free, or with a $5 pedometer and some common sense. The pedometer in the Fitbit is crazy inaccurate. The only useful part is the sleep monitoring, but I think that's pretty inaccurate as well. The unique Fitbit charger is difficult to attach and a pain. I would not recommend this product.
 I had a Charge HR previously, and dealt with it coming apart through time.  The Alta HR is slim, which I like, and the screen is bigger, which I like.  The ability to replace the band is a great option as well, as opposed to the Charge HR.  My only gripe is the touch screen is the opposite of sensitive,  I have to tap it several times, most of the time, to get the screen on (oh, and because there is no button to turn on the screen, so touching it, or whipping your wrist toward you, which is also suspect, turns the screen on).
 I absolutely love the look.  It was a birthday gift from my son.  However,  I can not understand  why the display is so hard to read in day light.  What was the thinking behind that?  It might save battery life, but certainly not a good trade off when most Fitbit wearers get there exercise outdoors.  Add sunglasses, and it is unreadable.  Also, I do miss the tracker for flights of stairs.<br/>Everything else is great.  Love the new sleep analysis.  Love love the bands available.
 Love it!
 I really wanted to like this FitBit.  I was drawn to its slim profile and ability to change out the bands (the bands have been the bane of my existence with the Charge HR I currently have).  Unfortunately, I was not pleased with this version's inability to count flights of stairs, nor the ability to track exercise by pressing a button.  Returned and purchased Charge HR 2 instead.
 Love it!!!
 I really like quality and durability
 Works great. Provides vital information. Making my fitness journey complete.
 Fit perfectly and she loved it
 Love the color!
 Doesn’t respond as fast as HR model.
 I really love a like a lot about this fitness tracker... having vibration alerts on your wrist for alarm clock, phone calls, text messages and notifications, sleep stages tracking, heart rate, activity tracking... great battery life too, lasts 5-7 days on a charge!  This is much better than the old charge HR... no more disintegrating wrist bands!  I love that it’s smaller and lighter, too.<br/><br/>The only thing that I dislike about it is the lack of stair tracking, though my iPhone isn’t a bad substitute.
 very good and fast
 👍
 This is a Great motivator...💞
 Great fit .... color wasn't what I thought though. Thought it was going to be brighter.
 I like it
 Given as a gift.  Granddaughter loves

 I love everything about this product
 was a giftan he loves it
 I absolutely love this fitness band - its sleek size and appearance.  I bought dress bands to compliment my dress attire and I'm constantly aware of my heart rate.  The app allows me to do more things than I ever imagined.  Only one problem and that is the display does not show up in direct sunlight so I cup my hand over the screen to monitor outdoor activity.
 This fitbit is AMAZING! Exactly what I was hopping for.
 love it
 Wear it everyday!
 My wife loved her gift and is putting it to good use.
 Great and easy to use. Just wish it counted stairs
 gr8 device. should be waterproff
 Great to keep me focused in walking everyday!
 This Fitbit is all I thuogt it would be.
 Great!
 Nice.
 Got it for my daughter and she loves it.
 I love this product. I don't regret buying it.

 Improved design. Love the heart rate feature.
 Good
 Easy to use.  Awesome display!
 My wife loves it.

 Don't buy this product after a few hours or days stops syncing with your devices and you have to reset it. After awhile it will not reset then you have to remove and reset it up on your phone or device. Doesn't do any of the things it claims. I am a long time Fitbit customer and all they would do is send me another  Alta HR new trackers that does the same thing. I don't think this track is made for people that really exercise can't keep up.  Customer service is outside of the USA and can't really do anything but send you another bad product. I request a different Fitbit product for the same cost value and they refused. They are happy to loose a long time customer when I was requesting a different product. Only have had the product for a few days and had to get a warranty track and that one only work for 24 hours.
 I love it!
 Love my new Fitbit HR. Comfortable, accurate, classy looking. Can order &amp; change bands to match every outfit or mood.<br/>Would definitely recommend!
 Love my new watch every thing I needed in one place
 Love it!
 This was a gift for my wife.  She loves it.
 Works just as advertised.
 V good product. Analysis on sleep is what I needed!!<br/>Slim and light.
 Love it
 very nice
 I love it!! Better than I expected!
 Bought for my wife, she loves it.
 Love it 😍
 I am done with Fitbit products.  I have had this product for 2 months and the face was cracked.  I was not doing anything unusual just usual household stuff and looked down and it was broken.  Contacted Fitbit and they said since we don't know how it happened they will not warranty it.  Really 2 months old and no warranty.  This product should be able to hold up with normal wear and tear longer than that.  While I will never use another Fitbit again AMAZON is amazing.  They have taken care of it so I can purchase something else that is more durable. I have owned several other fitbit and I know they do not last forever. Usually I get about a year from it and don't think my expectations are to high.
 Love, love, love, fitbit.
 Perfect size. I was going to buy the charge 2 because I wanted the heart rate monitor. So glad they came out with this version. So far, very happy with this purchase!
 Great for managing sleep quality.
 Superb, love it.
 Very good, fashionable look,track sleeping stage well
 Works well
 Very happy
 Perfect ! Fitbit is the Best<br/>Thanks
 Great gift.

 My wife loves it
 It is a great product.
 Wonderful

 Great tracker
 Not working not charging
 Love it
 I just wish one could set the time ahead manually and not have it set itself automatically. Even my iPhone I can set it offset.<br/>I suggest allowing an offset feature of time that allows minutes and hours offsetting. The HR feature is very accurate. Compared it against one at the Dr's Office. Off by 2-3 heartbeats, that is very accurate for the slim size of the Fitbit. And this was not at resting state but active, around 117=120 bpm.
 Upgraded from my Charge HR and I'm already in love with the new Alta HR two days in. One thing I didn't like about the Charge HR was its bulkiness and it was kind of ugly. The Alta HR is much more stylish and small enough that I can wear it while sleeping and it's not uncomfortable like the Charge HR. Heart rate, calories burned, and steps seem consistent with my old fitbit. Some of the features I really like so far besides the design: the sleep cycles, the option to have a flower grow as you're more active, the lack of counting stairs (my Charge HR was never even remotely accurate), longer battery life, more secure charging clasp, &amp; the new watch clasp. A couple of things I would have liked to see: the charger clasp is more secure but it seems cheaply made. I'm paranoid I'm going to break it. The second is to have a button on the side of the tracker so I can start/end a workout. I'd like my warm-up walk to be counted towards my workout steps and calories burned, but it doesn't recognize my workout until I'm running. Overall, I'm really glad I upgraded my Fitbit. It was hard to pick between this and the Charge 2, but in the end, size won.
 Very nice thank you
 I love my Fitbit
 This was my first Fitbit and I couldn't be more pleased. The medium gray color is great - neutral without being as boring as black. I would say I have average sized female wrists and the small fits me on a middle hole. I haven't had any issues with discoloration as reported in some other reviews. Love how small it is and all of the features are fantastic. Really glad this model has a heart rate feature. It's definitely challenged me to be more active. Would recommend to everyone!
 Love it!
 Fantastic! Even better than my previous one.
 Does what I expected!
 Like the device
 Absolutely love love love my fitbit alta HR...
 Absolutely love my fitbit alta!
 I have had the Charge HR- but it recently broke. So I decided to replace it with the new Alta- I like that it is sleeker on my wrist, still has the HR monitor and I can change the bands. The charger is more study- my previous fit bits I had issues with the charging portion breaking. Would definitely recommend!
 Great product
 Great item. No problems
 It works well.
 Great
 Works perfect.
 I absolutely love my Fitbit Alta HR! I bought the small wrist band and it fits perfect! I track my daily steps, sleep patterns, calorie intake and heart rate. I have an iPhone 6s and it synced up with the app just fine. I will be ordering different colored bands in the future. I just love how danty and small it is on my wrist!
 My wife loves it.
 I love it!
 At first I really liked this one.  But the design doesn't work well with my wrist.  It's always stuck on my wrist bone and no matter how loose or tight I make it, it's very uncomfortable to wear at night. I purchased this for the sleep stages, but I feel i have wasted money cause it is so hard on your wrist and I wake up at night a lot just to take it off.  I do not recommend this fitbit for people with small wrists. ☹️
 Love it!
 Great value for what you get!
 Pictured color is pretty accurate.  Works better than the older Fitbit I borrowed from my husband, but doesn't update automatically as the other one did.  Seem to have synch it every two days.  I run the display horizontally, so I can get an accurate step count without it rounding up.<br/>UPDATE:  Synch issue resolved, but the face scratches very easily and I am not a rough person.  Very disappointed that the face is not scratch resistant.  Hold a charge about a week.
 Buen producto
 Love my Alta HR!
 Wife loves it !
 Nice love it!
 Love it

 Love this Fitbit
 Works great.
 Love love love this Fitbit!!!!
 Doesn't charge correctly
 What the DONGLE? DONGLE, DONGLE, DONGLE. I learned a new word today. Nice to know, AFTER I ORDERED and RECEIVED, that this device does NOT come with the required DONGLE to sync to an older computer. Apparently, you have to have the latest and greatest tech to be able to use this device without the DONGLE. I would think that they would, at the very least, give you the option when selling this device to get it with or without the DONGLE. I got the option when I opened and tried to set it up to order the dang DONGLE. AWESOME, now I can wait another 3 or 4 days to get the required DONGLE. Hopefully it works.
 Love it.
 Happy
 Love it!!!
 This is the worst Fitbit I have owned.  It is very inconsistent.  I frequently do not have a pulse no matter where I wear the Fitbit.  The HR monitor is very inaccurate when compared to a HR strap.  Off by 20 points.  According to my Fitbit I should be passed out as high as my heart rate displays on the Fitbit.  The advanced sleep mode worked the first week, but hasn't worked in three weeks.  This Fitbit is only good for tracking steps.  Very disappointing especially considering the cost.  Bought my husband one and it stopped working completely in one week.  Have replacement.  We'll see what happens.
 Excellent
 So far, I'm liking this fitbit pretty well. The charger takes some getting used to, and the display is super narrow. It's nice that it gives you multiple display options to work around that. I find that I have to tap it pretty hard to get the display to come on. I was thinking it would be more sensitive. Other than that, it seems to work fine, and is a little daintier than the Charge 2 that I was considering.
 Love itt!
 :)
 Love it!
 Love my new Fitbit.  It helps me stay motivated and keeps me aware of how hard I'm working by monitoring my heart rate.  I would give it a five, but they need to improve visibility of the display in the sun.
 Amazing product
 I decided to spend the few extra dollars and get The Alta HR.  I am so happy I did.  I get texts on it and can see who is calling me.  I don't need to have my phone in my hands this way.  It's so convenient.  If I am at church, riding my bike, at work,etc... I don't need to dig through my purse to get my phone anymore, or worry about the sound being disruptive.  I also love the fact that the closure is more secure now, like a watch.  I lost my first fit bit when I was at the show and my little girl was sitting in my lap.  It came undone and fell off w/o me even knowing.  I am very happy with my purchase.  It cam very fast and securely packed in great condition!
 Great
 Good
 This has left burn marks, blisters and now cuts on my wrist where the Fitbit used to be. I used to have the Fitbit charge 2 and this never happened! I want my money back!
 I gave this as a gift to my daughter who is a professional dancer, practices yoga on a daily bases.  I was hoping that it could record her yoga exercises but so far it has not.  I am not sure if there is indeed a way to add such exercises to the program so it can register them or not... and if there is, where and how can we find the information to be able to get it?
 So far, this has been great! I bought this to replace a nearly 2 year old Fitbit Charge HR that fell apart. This is a much sleeker, more attractive product with all the same functionality. Sleep tracking is actually more detailed (how accurate it is about sleep stages, I have no idea.) The new display took a little getting used to, but I like that it can tell me who is texting me, unlike the Charge, which only told me who was calling.
 Awesome
 I love it
 very good
 Love it!! I had the charge and it bothered my wrist bone, this one fits perfectly.
 This is my first fitness tracker; I opted for the Alta HR for it's slim size but increased functions. The sleep tracker has been incredibly useful! The app also has a variety of helpful features: water tracking, hourly reminders, exercise tracking are my favorites. There are a few quirks that hopefully Fitbit will update (250 is the set hourly goal - it can't be changed, and I've run into some headaches linking it with other apps). Overall though, easy to use and incredible helpful if you want to build healthier habits.
 Quick delivery and working just as I expected.  If you want to use a computer it requires a dongle, which is not included.  It just reminded me it is time to move around a bit.
 The fit bit Alta hr is very slim, easy to use and I love the feature where you get an alert to keep on moving until you complete your goal. Is like having a personal trainer on your side. Also the calories in vs the calories out helps me achieve my goal without trying to figure out the amount of calories needed to get to my ideal weight. Overall I recommend it. Also you can invite friends that have other fit bits devices to join you in different challenges, that will keep you motivated.
 I was so excited about this tracker! Unfortunately it turned out to be a dud.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-The app with nutrition tracking is great! Enjoyed the extra motivation from goal visuals. Sleep tracking was not something I was needing, but was still interesting.<br/>-Relatively comfortable. After the first day I stopped noticing it.<br/>-Relatively attractive. I liked the thin design of the band.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-The worst part of this tracker is how inaccurate heart rate tracking is. It was 20-30 bpm off during exercise. After weird data on the 2nd day I decided to check it against my machine's (stairmaster) HRM, my polar chest strap, and even an O2 monitor. All of those were within 5 bpm on each other, but the fitbit was SO off. I tried tightening the band- no luck. I tried resetting it three times- no luck.<br/>-Data lag. This was not bothersome to me but might be for someone doing HIIT or serious training.<br/>-Step tracker was mildly inaccurate. Sometimes I would walk a whole minute without the monitor registering a single step.<br/><br/>So basically the app and aesthetics of this monitor were great. However the functionality (the MOST important factor) of the monitor fell flat. I will be returning.
 I really like my fitbit! I work in the sleep medicine field and love the way it tracks the different sleep stages. Seems really accurate. Also a great encourage to get out and increase steps. The other thing is that it vibrates if you get a text or a phone call, so if you leave your phone somewhere else in your house, you don't miss a call or text. Sometimes I don't hear my phone, and the vibration lets me know it is ringing. It is really pretty amazing technology!
 This is my 2nd Fitbit and I loved my first one. I upgraded with the Alta HR because after 2 years, the band on the old one had had it. I like the looks of this new one and it's features but the battery life is awful. I last charged it on Sunday and it's Wednesday evening and it needs charging again!! That is too soon as my last Fitbit would hold a charge at least a week. This annoying, disappointing and inconvenient.
 Love having this tracker to remind me to get up and move! It seems to track my sleep surprisingly well, though obviously it's not going to be entirely accurate. It appears to measure my heart rate reasonably, though I expect it would be less accurate with very strenuous activity. I like how small the tracker is - I have very small wrists, so anything larger would be a problem.
 Barely 3 months after it was delivered and I have persistently noticed that it gets discharged very quickly, 2 days after being charged fully.<br/>It  is starting to be very annoying.  If this problem persists, I will stop using it.<br/>Some of my friends and relatives who noticed it when I started wearing it were very interested in buying the same one that I purchased;<br/>they are just waiting for the holiday sales.<br/>If I do not receive a corrective action from this defective product soon, I will discourage those planing to buy one to consider other<br/>brands or manufacturers.
 I've had a week and found it to be very accurate on steps and easy to use.  I like the way it looks too. So far so good!!
 So far, so good. I replaced my Fitbit Flex with this model. I am very happy with my purchase. Works well and looks much nicer on my wrist than the old Flex. I like that the band is like a real watch band. I was always knocking my Flex off as the band was not as secure.
 This is awesome!!! I love it.  The only thing I've noticed is it doesn't track my steps when I'm pushing my stroller so that makes my daily activity tracking off a little, but no big deal. Still love it! Very comfortable to wear and it's super fun when you get 10k steps in!! Surprised/startled me the first time, lol!!
 Absolutely love my Fitbit Alta HR! It helps track my sleep patterns, my heart rate, and my exercise. I am by no means an exercise buff BUT I will say wearing my Fitbit has increased my activity level throughout the day. It provides that motivation needed to move and reach step goals daily! I would highly recommend!!!
 Very Happy overall with new Fitbit. App doesn't sync well to two devices, (for example iPhone syncs, but iPad does not sync to current day results. Wish it was waterproof and did not require charging like my previous Garmin Vivofit. I do like receiving alerts for phone calls and texts, features Garmin Vivofit didn't have.
 Will definitely help me keep up with my workouts. Thanks
 Very disappointing! The step counter already has steps registered before I even get out of bed. It counts every time you move your arm so it's very inaccurate. It even counts when I reach for a pen on the counter at work, which I do several times a day at my job. Same with simply lifting my arm above my waist...it counts as a step! You'd be better off with a simple step counter. The heart rate monitor doesn't always work. I know this because I have worn another device at the same time that I know to be extremely accurate, and sometimes it can be off up to 20 bpm !!  Really just not happy with the product for what I actually purchased it to do. Now I just wear it as a watch and to alert me when I have a phone text message or call.
 Love it so far. It buzzes at me to "Get up!" and I actually get up from my desk at work and walk around.  Before I wouldn't do that.  It has also inspired me to join in a group where they have monthly contests to compete against others to walk farther.  I never would've done this before the Fitbit.
 I wish I had worn the Alta HR for a while before I left my first review. I find it is very inaccurate, especially if you are on a treadmill. You get a much lower step count on the treadmill as opposed to just "pounding the pavement".  I was on the treadmill for an hour yesterday and only got credit for 15 minutes of activity. My Zip is much more accurate.  The only reason I changed to the Alta was because I would always forget to take the Zip off my gym clothes.
 Waste of money !!!<br/>Useless, started showing battery empty, resetted several times, did not fix. When i dont wear it, it adds that period as sleeping, why it has HR then, silly, takes long time to pair, sync with phone.<br/>İ would not recommend, get something else if you really need one
 Initially a little difficulty setting up as it wanted to upgrade software without a way to stop it. Bought as a gift for a friend and she has been wearing it for a few days. It is helping her in her quest for deeper REM sleep and the move around alarms are very helpful as she is tied to a desk during the day. Hopeful product!
 I like the Alta HR and how it keeps track of heart rate and sleep cycles, but my Fitbit One does a MUCH better job of keeping track of flights up the stairs. We have a flight of stairs in our home and the One always sensed when I went up them. So far, the Alta hasn't tracked even one flight of stairs ☹️
 Hey Im trying to return this item, the product stopped working a week into having it. Doesn't recognize my heart rate, along with a few other things. I don't seem to find a return option. If it is possible i would exchange it for another one. I hope that you read this, or if someone in the comment could help me out that would be awesome, Thanks !
 Love it! I had a fitbit one &amp; lost it. This is much better. Love the small size &amp; the fact it tracks my sleep patterns better than the Fitbit One. Love the "reminder" when I have gone an hour without walking. Good to be able to check my heart rate on the treadmill.
 Slightly smaller in width than the Alta. So far there's been no problem with the band as I've heard other people complain about it. Only wish it kept track of stairs too.
 I purchased the Fitbit Alta to replace my Fitbit Charge HR which I had completely worn out.  I liked to the sleeker style of the Alta and the ability to change the bands.  However, the Fitbit itself falls off of the detachable bands regularly.  I have only had the Fitbit for 2 months and it fell off again yesterday and broke the glass on the screen.  Very disappointing.  Concept is great but functionality is terrible.
 The most important thing fitness tracker feature for me is sleep tracking and this one is excellent. I've had a 2 other Jawbone fitness trackers and this is the most durable and feature rich one yet. I wanted something small and unobtrusive. The gunmetal Alta HR is subtle. The associate app is full featured and regularly synchs with the unit. I don't like to wear a watch but this unit will show the time - which can be really convenient. The only improvement I can suggest is for the alarm feature to wake account of your sleep cycle - like the Jawbone UP devices.
 I am addicted to FitBit!  I am totally lost without it.  I have had a few FitBit Charges and decided to go to something a bit smaller when my last one wore out.  I got the Alta HR and I love the way it looks, is not over burdensome and has all the stats I need!
 Bought this for my wife as an "upgrade" to her Charge 2. It does have a slimmer profile, but for some reason there are a few things that aren't included with this.<br/><br/>One is the altimeter, the part that allows for tracking changes in elevation (i.e. stair climbing). With today's electronics I find it hard to believe that they couldn't fit it into the form factor.<br/><br/>The other is the way that you activate it. The Charge 2 will wake up and report if you move your wrist in a way that's consistent with checking your watch. The Charge 2 also seems to be more easily tapped to toggle between readouts.<br/><br/>Other than that, the unit seems to work as well as the Charge 2.
 So far I love it. I tend to be rough on Fitbits, so I'm hoping this one hold up. Love the look and the feel. Seems like a high quality band. I definitely like the look better than the Charge HR. I love that the bands are changeable too.
 I wanted to get on this wave. I tried using it for awhile, but ultimately I'm way to lazy to get any benefit from the technology in this. It's not waterproof which I think is apart of the design requirements but really sucks either way.
 I charged the Fitbit for hours but still no process... the Fitbit is fully charged but it shows still “Akku half full”. I get the same info on my iPad / Fitbit. Very disappointing. No response or discount from the seller at all
 I am sending my FB back, several problems,<br/>Will not load to my IPhone 7<br/>It Overrides my Bluetooth in my car<br/>Less then one day and the battery drained to half.<br/>Yes I called tech support they told me to turn off several options, which did not make a difference  still will not load to my iPhone. I own a FB Charge HR 1st generation, zip and I have none of the listed problems with them, just wanted to updated.<br/>I gave this 2 stars I like the size and the ability to change bands.
 The Alta HR is pretty good, I am being a bit critical here.<br/>* I like the display, it's great to have a display and be able to see steps and other information without referencing the smart phone.<br/>* I like the new style watch band, it is much easier to get on.<br/>* I have two of these, one each for my wife and I. I find myself charging it every 4 days, it's advertised as 7.<br/>* Sleep measurements seem to miss offering detailed info, and offers simple readout instead (I guess the HR sensor got out of position). This happens 1 day out of 5. But after a time, I lose interest in knowing how much is REM vs light vs deep sleep, so it's fine with me.
 Thank you!
 Absolutely LOVE my new Alta! It looks sleek w the add-on silver mesh band; the HR is just what I needed; and the integrated app features make it easy to track (and meet) your goals!! 👍🏼
 I loved first fitbit. I bought this one excited to have text and my calendar notification come up. My calendar notification don't come up. Also my tracker won't sync. It also has an up date that won't up date.
 Love the Alta HR!  It keeps my heart rate,  mileage, steps,  activity, and also alerts me when I have a phone call or a text.  I didn't want a smart watch because they're big and bulky and I like not being attached to my phone every second.  This is perfect!!!
 The band is like the first one. I will wait and see if it works out. Your customer service is outstanding. I hope all goes well with the new band.<br/><br/>This is a follow up review to the first one summited.
 It was too difficult for me to set this up on my computer. Even my husband, who is much more computer savvy that I am wasn't able to set it up. I finally decided to stop wasting my precious time trying to set it up and have returned it for a refund.
 What a great step up from a traditional wrist watch. Love this thing and all it's cool features. Has already helped me lose 5#.😎
 I love the Fitbit, but I didn't pay all this money to have to deal with ads when I open the app. It just tried to sell me more Fitbits for Mother's Day.  I will stop using if this is consistent.
 Wonderful! I love everything about it. I especially love it when I hit 10,000 steps and it shows me stars and fireworks. Good value and easy to wear. It also keeps it's charge longer then my previous fitbit.
 Heat rate monitor is only accurate when my heart is resting. Anything over 80 bpm is captured inaccurately.
 Bought this for my wife and she did not like it.  Sits very high on the wrist,  Returned it for a Blaze.
 It's all good! Momma is wearing it everyday! When she is happy we all are happy! 😂
 LOVE my Fitbit. I love how it encourages me to walk more every hour. It was just what I wanted! The only thing I would change is that the band gets "dirty" and you can't get it off! But I love my new tech toy!
 I love this Fitbit, I'm so glad I waited for this one before purchasing. The heart rate is accurate and fun to see your results. I wish I had gotten a small though. I got the large because all the reviews said to but I have to wear it on the second hole, which leaves a lot of band. This is a great product.
 Doesn’t measure heart rate correctly when I am in my spinning or weight lifting class; most of the time losses even my heart rate altogether, tried adjusting wrist band and using other hand; didn’t improve accuracy at all.
 LOVE THIS FITBIT!! I have found it useful for the sleep tracker and the step reminder.
 Original review: Neither Fitbit page nor Amazon page communicated effectively that you need the Alta HR, not the Alta, to track sleep stages. So it took two weeks to return the Alta and get the Alta HR. Then syncing with my smartphone was a nightmare. Now I can't get sleep stages. Community discussion indicates others are also having problems. Instead of providing useful instructions, they give you tips. Save that for later and help me get this thing to work!<br/>Revision one week later: Online instructions were incomplete, but I eventually got sleep stages to work. Then after three days, it wouldn't sync any more. The problem was Bluetooth, but the instruction to turn Bluetooth off and on, resetting Fitbit, is incomplete. Ultimately got it to work.<br/>Bottom line: if you are frustrated as I am about nonverbal pictographic instructions that assume everything works right and is intuitively obvious, Google Fitbit support, call the number, and a helpful person from halfway around the world will help you solve your problem step-by-step.
 I had a Fitbit Alta that I really liked but when they came out with the Fitbit Alta HR I just had to try it. I LOVE IT!  I'm 61 and trying to keep my health on track and this certainly helps me hone in on stepping up my game plan!
 This is a great product that I purchased for my nine-year-old son. He is very active and loves keeping track of how many steps he has put in for the day.
 Love this! Previously had the Fitbit charge hr. This is sleek and fashionable and does a great job. I love being able to read my text messages on it too!
 I love this fitbit, this is my second one.  Still also use the ZIP too.
 It's hard not to give it a one star rating when the primary reason I bought this was to track sleep stages - which it is not doing.  A simple internet search will show a significant number of people are having the same problem with less than a satisfactory response from the manufacturer who is giving the "you don't know how to use it properly" response on their community support site.  I hope that they will take ownership of the problem eventually and provide a firmware fix.  I would hold off buying this product until this has been fixed. The other functions seem to work as advertised.
 It's great! I love it!
 The product might be just fine, but clearly been opened and possibly used. I paid full price for a bew item.  There is gunk on the band and the adapter package was torn open and loose. VERY disappointing.
 This is the first time I've ever written a review, it's THAT bad that I felt I needed to. I love the look, slim design and wearability of this Fitbit, so I'm sad that it's crap. However, it is, in fact, crap. I don't know if there is something wrong with my device (and all the people on the Fitbit Forum who are also having these issues) or if other people just don't watch their steps that closely but... This tracker did not track many of my steps while I was walking, but it didn't seem to be SO off that it was a dealbreaker (I was going to keep an eye on it). However I sat down to spend 45 minutes folding laundry and ended up with another 434 steps. I never got out of the chair... Sort of defeats the purpose of counting steps if it's going to be off by HUNDREDS. Yes, I realize SOME wrist movement might be counted, however not hundreds of steps in 45 minutes. Imagine how many extra steps that would be over the course of a day!  Plus Fitbit indicates that wrist movement alone (unless very vigorous) shouldn't count as steps anyway. I initiated a return through Amazon and ordered the Fitbit Blaze. Hoping for better results.
 My girl loves it and so far has held up well.  I didn't even have to set it up, which makes it even better.  Great size for petites.
 Counts steps accurately and the app is great! Deducting one star because the face/screen stopped turning on when I looked at it about two weeks after I got it.
 Love it wear it 24/7/365 use the fit bit software I have upgraded to the premium software, but the standard is just fine.<br/>​
 Wish I could say I was able to wear it. Was looking forward to it for a week... Disappointment is an understatement.
 FitBit is attractive and I loved the color.  However, I couldn't read the screen when outdoors in either bright sunlight or when it was cloudy.  That was the whole reason I purchased the FitBit.  Also, I spoke with 4 people about their fitbits and every one of them indicated they were on their 2nd or 3rd fitbit.  That's a lot of money for replacements.  I sent mine back and bought an Apple Watch.  LOVE IT!
 It died the replacement died
 Would like it &amp; wear it more if it wasn't painful to wear. Has a penetrating light that is irritating to painful if worn for more than a couple of hours. I adjusted the strap to be looser on my wrist, switched wrists &amp; it still will become too painful to wear.  Very disappointing because I enjoyed the app &amp; idea of keeping me on track, but again too painful to wear to keep it on 24/7.
 the screen is hard to turn on at times the band is to loose or to tight for me I will be trying to find a different one you try to flick to turn on screen with out tapping and does not work right but will when your sleeping heart rate is off steps are off will not recognize activity app is great helps fix the stuff that's wrong but it will give you an idea of your info just dont bet it's all accurate
 Gave this ad a gift to my husband. He has NOT been able to sync it to his phone. We have tried for 4 days now, have been on the Internet looking for support and no suggestions are working. Getting ready to send it back and ask for a refund. Very disappointed.
 Very accurate step count.  I really like how it analyzes and provides details of sleep effectiveness.
 I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It fits her arm well. She wears it everyday.
 I love this Fitbit.  It's sleek, and comfortable, and the battery lasts for days!
 What a joke. It logged, while not being worn, a 2 hour span of intense activity and a 2 hour nap over the exact same time span. The heart rate reads 5 bpm slower than my pulse oximeter. Will be returning.
 Yes,  I like my fitbit alta.  I have several basic color bands.  Always looks good, work and play.  Reminds me to move!  I prefer the slimmer style.
 I had a Fitbit Flex for several years until it wore out last month. I've only had this one for three days but I very much like the fact that I can see my step total without linking to the app. I have had major back surgery and find that my Fitbit is key to getting 10,000 steps a day as part of my ongoing work to stay as active as possible.
 I love my Fitbit!!! I got a great price and fast shipping!!
 Sexy. Af.  I feel the heartbeat might not be 100%.but I love it
 My wife loves it.  Small and petite and fits her small wrist.
 I love my alta HR! I got the rose gold / pink and it's great but I've had it for two days now and the band has already picked up dark colors from anything I wear .. won't stay pink for long<br/><br/>UPDATED REVIEW:<br/>I did love my alta HR, as I always have loved FitBit. However, my excitement got the best of me and the previous review-<br/>Don't waste your money.<br/>Unable to make returns, unhelpful support, nothing but regret.
 Works great
 Purchased as a gift and my daughter loves it!
 It actually encourages lifestyle changes once you start collecting data and examining it. You don't need to make a plan as you will figure out what is good for you as you go along. You just have to apply yourself a little and it will enourage more effort based on your own gains you see in the data.<br/>You will understand this better if you purchase one and do a little bit.
 product does not sync correctly.  I have to remove the tracker from the app and set it up again every day in order for it to sync.  I am not alone in this if  you read their community posts it becomes obvious that it is a systemic problem that they either can't or won't fix.
 Only thing I didn't care for was the band, so  I ordered a stainless band with a magnetic clasp separately and love it. Fitbit has caused be to be intentional about exercise.
 Looked great very stylish and easy to work.
 returned - did not fit my needs.
 Keeps me motivated.
 Another useless FITBIT scam
 Did not work as expected.
 So happy with my fitbit.
 My wife loves it. It replaced her origional fit bit. Battery life is improved and info provided is more useful.
 I love it. Keeps me moving
 Husband loves it!
 Absolutely love it! Don't know why I took so long to upgrade!<br/>Started out with the flex and then to the Ulta. Using the flex as backup when Ulta was charging. Also use the flex for dressy as it is easy to hide under bracelets!<br/>Ulta crapped out on me :(<br/>So, the flex and I made do.<br/>Now the Alta and flex are the perfect pair!
 good product fast ship
 Love my Fitbit
 Still like jawbone
 Love my FitBit Alta HR! It's slender style is comfortable and I barely notice I'm wearing it. Love the heart rate feature so I can get the most out of my workouts. And I also really like being able to track my sleep patterns as well!
 Ok
 So far so good
 Wear it every day...
 Good
 Looks hood
 Can’t get it to set up right
 Love this...
 The Fitbit was exactly as described. I love the slim version and it is very comfortable wearing it while walking.
 good
 Got one used
 Clearly the best fitness tracker on the market for your buck. Very satisfied.
 Just upgraded to the HR ...love it !
 Great
 post
 Love it
 Fitbit is amazing got here and quit time I was very satisfied with the package and the product
 I've only had it 2 months and it doesn't seem to keep a charge more than 2 days.  Also,  if you keep your hand on a shopping cart handle, it doesn't register your steps.
 Great product. Love it.
 GREAT!!
 It's a good item to have for fitness. I use it every day.
 Packaging was great. The product its self sucks. I've had two defective Alta hr fitbits now. I wouldn't recommend this specific fit bit.
 Keeps me honest. The only con is the display does not always pop up on the screen each time I twist my wrist. I end up having to tap the screen to activate the display.
 I just received this but the box was open, as was the charging piece that should have been in a sealed plastic bag. There was no booklet, etc. And it won’t take a charge. I was sent a defect.
 I liked the app but I didn't like the battery. You can't use it even for 4 days. You have to charge consecutively.
 Love my Fitbit! It will keep me on track to being more healthy. The app has so much info and I'm not​ yet using it for food. The sleep data is fascinating. I'm glad I made this purchase!
 I love the Alta HR. However, I scratched the screen day 2. I wish it was a little more scratch resistant but so far so good!
 Light small and does everything I need. Love it
 Great battery life
 Love the look, the durability and capabilities...however, specifically need a BP, HP and 02 sensor.  I'm crying to have to return it.
 Maribel loves it. Lets her know her heart rate and her millage lol.
 mine did not come with the dong and how is it suppose to change with out the dong worth less junk
 Strap design is fab and won't come off easily during exercise. You can't go wrong with a buckle watch-strap and moreover, one that is grippy with patterns. Love how my Fitbit tends to communicate with my by asking me to walk my 250 per hour in witty ways. The app is amazing however it won't sync with Apple Health, but that doesn't matter to me. Unlike the Jawbone Up bands that I used in the past, this strap seems tougher and even if they do break off, they're replaceable without having to buy a new unit altogether. I like the smoky blue-gray bands for now and they look unique. Do note that when navigating the screen, you'll need to tap somewhere below the Fitbit logo for best response though. This is a slim band however, it might get in the way of double-cuff shirts. Can't wait for the update to enable REM sleep tracking. I'm happy with my purchase.
 I don’t want to give any stars .. I have lots of pain in my wrist from wearing this watch .. do your research before you buy
 Wish I would have known it didn't come with a plug in adapter.
 My Fitbit Alta HR works most of the time. When I log to sync my Fitbit sometimes it freezes up my Mac or won sync at all. Not completely happy it could be better.
 Perfect
 Package was opened and charger was opened, not happy with this purchase
 Really love having the heart rate addition.
 Ordered as a present for myself. But it affects my wrist to the point of pinkie finger going numb and the screen scratches and scuffs super easily. I set it up yesterday afternoon, wore it thru the night and it looks and still feels horrible today. Back it goes...
 I bought this for my wife and she loves it.
 Did not work
 I bought this Fitbit Alta HR for my wife. She was very surprised and happy. So far she loves the product. :)
 Love my Fitbit Alta HR. I have had it less than a week but so far, I love it.
 ❤️❤️❤️
 Love it, and I received it in 6 days that's awesome!!!<br/>Thank you so much.
 Awesome!!!!!
 This product is everything I expected and more.I love my Alta HR Fitbit!  I find the data it provides me very useful.
 Perfect for my small wrist
 Love it! Keeps me on track.
 Love it. Was very interested in heart rate monitor for health reasons.
 My screen broke!  How the hell does that happen?  Does anyone know how to get that fixed?
 The Fitbit Alta is awesome! I receelived the delivery winthin days of ordering and it does everything!
 I truly love my Fitbit Alta HR. I am new to the fitness tracker world and was looking into various trackers after I started attending spin classes recently. After some research, I decided to go with the Fitbit Alta HR for it's heart rate monitoring, great health insights, and sleep tracking ability. I love how simple and sleek the tracker is, and the app is incredibly helpful. After a week, I have already gained so much insight regarding my resting heart rate, average daily calorie burn, sleep patterns, and fitness/exercise performance.<br/><br/>I also tried out the Apple iWatch just because I love the look of it, thinking that it did many of the things the Alta is able to do. What I found was that the iWatch was way too busy and the corresponding app failed to show clear and concise health data. Fitbit truly holds the top spot for making it easy to understand your health profile and see progress on the goals you have set for yourself. I returned the iWatch and am so happy I have kept my Alta HR. I could go into many of the major differences between the two, but what it boils down to is this - If you are looking for the best health/fitness watch, go with the Fitbit. You won't be disappointed. If I could change anything about the Fitbit, it would just be the screen design. It is slightly elementary and hard to compete style wise with the iWatch. Still, it is discrete and so effective, that I would choose the Fitbit every time over competitors.
 Very good device to keep me aware of how I should eat and not go over.
 Nice watch and very light better than charge hr and serg
 Great investment.  Enjoying what this fitbit is doing in my life.
 Came as it was advertised. Have had no problems since buying it! I love it
 My Fitbit stopped working 1 month after I bought it very disappointing!
 Love my fitbit Alta hr!
 HR in a tiny package
 Sometimes the heart-rate monitor doesn't work. But other than that it is very good.
 The band gets dirty and looks awful after using it for a couple of days.
 Excelent
 Received as a gift. Love it!
 Arrrived exactly when you predicted. Excellent shape and I love it.
 Battery is faulty and doesn't last more than a day.
 Was not able to wear, caused numbness in arm.  Not sure why.
 I love it but I can't get the silent alarm to work good for me
 will never ever purchase a fitbit product again.  lack of real instructions made it too painful to get it paired to mobile device.  plus the uber short charging cable was another joke.  this product did get the heart rate up with out exercising.
 Great information details.
 Great product, exactly as advertised
 WOULD NOT KEEP A CHARGE
 Love it
 I bought this Fitbit for my wife.  She loves it.  She has MS, and we both thought a goal of a thousand steps would be tough for her to reach.  But now in our second week she is setting a goal of 5,000 steps (2.5 miles)!  This was a great surprise.  She loves the hourly get up and move feature (asking for 250 steps).  She has a sit-down job and this feature has really gotten her on her fit and moving.  I see improvements in her general health after just one week!  We are very hopeful after more weeks go by.  She told me this is the best fitness thing she has ever had.  I wish it had the ability to track activities (like my Charge 2 has), but my wife doesn't miss it.  One can manually log activities (like an exercise bike) on the Fitbit website, but you have to take the time to do this.  My wife likes the Alta over the Charge 2 mainly for its better styling.
 Love it!
 Love it.
 I love it!
 great
 Doesn't track exercises.<br/>Difficult to get it to give the time.<br/>2 stars because it looks nice.
 wearing it 24/7
 Does everything I wanted.
 Hard to tap on screen !
 Purchased for my wife to replace her Charge 2(it didn't break, I get it!), and I'm very happy about the Alta HR! The functions are like the fit bit Charge 2 HR, and like a previously owned Charge 1 HR.  The only difference being that the Alta HR is a bit more compact than the other two models that I have owned, and I think it's very attractive also.<br/><br/>If you liked the other fit bit models, I highly suggest this one as well.
 Love it!!
 Great device!
 Great watch!
 Love it 👍🏾
 Excellent!
 Love it!
 Heart rate detection maybe good for a walk with your grandmother but for a serious workout this product sucks.
 I have been using Fitbit since last year. I had Charge HR and I replace it with Alta HR. The battery life is as promised, 7 days. I have been wearing it for a week with normal usage and still have not charged it. The Alta HR could have come with same features as Charge 2 and it would become female version due to its slick design. My entire family has fitbit and all different models. Fitbit Customer service is excellent as I had to use it few times with other fitbit devices. I am now waiting for the App upgrade that will track different sleep stages. I recommend this to anyone who would want their HR monitored. Great product!
 This is my first experience with any Fitbit product and the data it produces seems exaggerated.
 Got this for my wife  for our 10 year anniversary. Stopped charging after a week. Customer service did nothing. Will never buy another fit bit again. After having 3 with issues, different styles and terrible customer service , I'm done. The app is great and very easy when the product works. But who cares when it has limited life and no honor to the warranty? We give these away as a health promo at work. I am doing everything  I can at this point to stop pushing to employees  and our healthcare customers alike.
 I love the color.  However, this tracker rarely syncs with my phone.  And the tap screen doesn't work well at all.  The first two days of having the tracker I had to contact customer service due to issues.  They say if you tilt the fitbit towards you the screen will display time, etc and this has NEVER happened.  The only positive is the FitBit customer service is awesome.
 What a great investment into my health!
 Did not show heart rate in real time.  Too many motions to get it.  Returned it
 Had such high expectations for my Fitbit. I was so excited when it came. I set it up and decided to wear it out for some errands. My hand, wrist and arm slowly started to become tingly and numb over the course of an hour or two. I had to remove the Fitbit and could absolutely not continue wearing it. The tingling and numbness continued to go through my hand and wrist for a few more hours even though I had removed the device. Needless to say I returned the Fitbit and got a refund. I am extremely disappointed.
 Well I bought this for my cousin who is absolutely in love with the newly released Fitbit Alta HR. She likes the sleek band and rectangular dial which makes it a very handy and comfortable watch to wear. Also, she has praised the HR monitoring capability of the watch which was the primary reason why she opted for this particular model. Overall, it is accurate and the inbuilt fitbit app gives you more reasons to improve on your fitness which I believe gives it the upper hand over its competitors.
 Arrived in just 1 day and my husband hasn't put it down since.
 Step counter is way off .  I gave 300 setps just sleeping and before I get out of bed. The only pro is the sleep monitor and battery life. Bit worth the money. At least $100 overpriced.  TONS of people making the same complaints on their board not worth it and bought two.
 I have a heart condition and thought this would help monitor the situation. So after I was diagnosed I purchased the Fitbit 2 that was suppose to do it all.  The  problem is I couldn't see the display or I would tap, tap and tap and nothing would pop up on the screen.  I didn't anticipate great scientific results, but I did expect something.  So when I couldn't even tell what time it was I bought this model which is advertised as more of a Heart Monitor.  Its crap.  Same problems and same issues.  In fact this is the same exact model as the fitbit 2.  So after a big waste of money I got into the online monitoring of my vital statistics and the whole thing begins to look like a Facebook device.  They want me to hook up with all my friends and give them all their information, then they suggest I can play yah yah I got you because my heart rate is better than yours, or I slept better than you  did last night.  I wish somebody at that company is smart enough to make this thing a healthcare device because that is what the market wants. I would not buy another Fitbit device if they were giving them away for free. One Star and that's because I can't go any lower.
 I liked this product until I let the battery run out.  Now it WILL NOT CHARGE AT ALL.
 This device worked for about 10 weeks, then died.  Reboot fix failed. $150 wasted.  I will not buy anything by Fitbit again.
 Just love my new fitbit altra hr..works great and so easy to put on and off
 Have I ever been screwed over royally!  Not only did I pay 129.00 for this, but I had to pay shipping too which brought it to $148.00!  Since this was my first Fitbit, I thought it seemed pretty neat until I went to charge it!  Not only did I get the wrong charger for it, but the battery is dead in it!  I would not have known this at first since he sent it with the battery half charged.  It wasn't until I went to charge it that I found out about this!  Another thing that I found out that this was not a new Alta HR, but it must be an older Alta HR since it goes back until 2014!  I am not spending another dime on this piece of junk, therefore I will not be sending it back to pay shipping on it again!  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PERSON if you do not want to have the same experience I had!
 PERFECT !  Ording bags now !
 100% DEFECTIVE.  Did not function AT ALL out of the box.  Complete waste of money.
 Battery lasts maybe a day and a half. For something that's supposed to be good for sleep tracking this is practically unusable. Product description promises "up to 7 days". maybe 7 days on the charger...
 It is great!  I just wish it showed the number of steps instead of KM.
 good
 Buy an Apple watch instead. Watch is difficult to read, understand, and the information transfers poorly to any electronic device it is hooked up to.
 Great compact Fitbit. Small size is a true small size
 Wonderful Easter gift.  Time to get healthy
 The shipping order was delayed even with Amazon Prime and upon receipt I excitedly opened the package.  I set it up according to instructions but after waiting patiently for an hour, the screen never popped up with anything; no charging screen nor time...
 Love it
 Like it
 Wanted something waterproof.
 Useful product
 Awesome
 Love my Fitbit!
 I started my Fitbit journey with a Flex before upgrading to an Alta. I have been so happy with the Alta, I waited to purchase the Alta HR. The added heart rate monitoring and sleep stage analysis on my husbands HR convinced me to make the purchase.<br/>Pros: the band has a comfortable clasp. Easier to put on and take off and secure.<br/>Improved sleep analysis, this is very accurate now. My old one seemed to count reading in bed as sleep!<br/>The same functionality of message alerts and silent alarms (who wants everyone to know I have an alarm set to remind me it is time to get ready to leave work?)<br/>Cons: none noted so far<br/>As an online shopper I rely heavily on reviews left by others when trying to decide what to buy so I try to leave useful reviews for those products that I feel strongly about.  Please let me know if you find my review helpful. Thanks so much!
 Color advertised as pink and rose gold...it looks lavender and the rose gold is way off from my rose gold Apple Watch. It arrived earlier than originally projected so wondering if the packaging was just wrong? I like the sleep feature to track my sleep since I have issues with insomnia but my Apple Watch does everything else I need it to do. Can't justify the price for the disappointment! May be going back to Amazon!
 No one should buy an Alta HR. There is something wrong with the heart rate monitor and it causes burning, deep tissue pain, tingling, and dizziness. I've had this for 5 days and the pain is now unbearable that I've had to call it quits. If you google anything about the HR versions of fit bit you will find hundreds of similar complaints to back it up.
 I am a little disappointed that you can't manually set this Fitbit to exercise mode. It auto recognizes some aerobic exercises after 15 mins but that doesn't help for yoga, Pilates, weight lifting etc.
 The Fitbit Alta HR is the perfect tracker! I upgraded from the Flex after discontinuing use due to the inability to see my steps without logging into the app. At first I was skeptical with spending $150 on a product that was just released, but after a week I can happily say it exceeds all of my expectations!<br/><br/>Pros<br/>- Text and call alerts<br/>- Accurate heart rate monitor (manually took my pulse daily to compare and it was always exact)<br/>- The step counter is much more accurate than others I've used (+\- 50 steps on average)<br/>- Band is extremely comfortable and the new clasp style is definitely a bonus<br/>- Battery life (going on day 5 and still at half a battery)<br/>- Sleep tracker and silent alarms<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- Calorie counter seems a bit off, but considering it takes into account calories burned while at rest too it's hard to measure accuracy<br/>- The feature that allows the display to turn on when turning your wrist toward you doesn't always work<br/><br/>I also purchased a stainless steel band to wear on dressier occasions. The band was very easy to remove and replace without losing any functionality. The size small fits my slender wrists perfectly.
 Experienced some issues and still learning how to use it. Not always do user friendly
 piiece of junk. impossible to set it up without instructions. not everybody in this world is an electronic genius. i am stuck since i have already paid for it. i am very disappointed in amazon.i will be very careful if i ever purchase anything electronic from amazon again.
 Love it
 Only after a couple days of having this..... this band marked up like this from having wear long sleeve shirt. Very disappointed in the product. Would not recommend this to anyone....
 Got the FitBit super fast and loved it, HOWEVER it wouldn't charge.  After fooling around with it for 2 days called tech support. The call took all of about 5 minutes and after trying several things they asked me to ship the FitBit back to them and they would fix it or replace it - very painless!  They provided a FedEx shipping label so all I had to do was drop it off.  What they didn't mention is they used standard shipping, I dropped off my FitBit at FedEx on Saturday, it didn't move all weekend and won't be delivered to to them for another week!  I've now owned my FitBit for 9 days with 7 of them being in FedEx's hands with another 2 days to go BEFORE they start looking at it.  BTW an Alta charger will NOT fit an Alta HR
 DO NOT recommend Coral colored band. I just received my Alta HR Friday evening so started wearing Saturday, light wear.  And the band edges and end of strap already turning gross.  i reached out to Fitbit help through my app and it took me to twitter messages.  It seems I got canned responses with a link to read about band care.  I already tried to wipe edges clean including alcohol wipes as suggested.  Still the same yucky.  For the record, I have a pink sand light colored Apple watch strap that does not turn yucky easily like the Coral strap.  In my opinion, a quality issue.  I have photos attached, sadly I will be returning.
 This was a bit tough to review.<br/><br/>My comparison is mostly with the Apple Watch 1st Gen. Although Fitbit says they are not competing with the Apple Watch, a used first gen Apple watch can be found for under 200 bucks, so yes I believe they are now competing, and in short the Apple watch for the most part blows the fitbit out of the water, with a few exceptions. Here is what the Fitbit Alta does well and why I'm torn between keeping my old Apple watch versus the Fitbit:<br/><br/>The Fitbit app is great. Its simple, its user friendly, and I really like the challenges with friends. In fact, that is pretty much the main reason for me holding onto the Fitbit at this point, because they do not allow any third party trackers to sync with their app.<br/><br/>The Alta HR is slim and lightweight. This tracker is so small its barely noticable. Compared to my Apple watch, Its barely there.<br/><br/>The Alta HR is great at auto tracking exercise, including weightlifting. By monitoring your heart rate it will add up any minutes you are exerting yourself and count those toward your exercise goal. Although the weightlifting isnt noted specifically, my cycling, running, and walking are somehow magically tracked and noted.<br/><br/>Here are some of the things I dont like about the Alta HR:<br/><br/>The sleep tracking. I really dislike that it occasionally wakes me up with text messages and calls, and that there is no way for it to automatically quiet itself at night.<br/><br/>The heart rate monitor. Although it is accurate, if the Fitbit isnt super tight around your wrist you will see it shining through-- especially when you are trying to sleep. Even on auto mode, it seems really stupid and tries to track my heart rate when its sitting on my dresser, and the light is blinding. I have never seen an apple watch do this before.<br/><br/>I also dislike the charger. This isn't that big of a deal, but compared to the Apple watch it's really short, cheaply made, and a pain to get it lined up correctly. Also, the pins are exposed on the back of the tracker, meaning they are in contact with your skin, which was a huge problem for Fitbit if you recall. Remember the Fitbit burns and scars? Apple and most other smartwatches now use wireless charging to avoid this skin contact.<br/><br/>Heres what I really dislike: The data does not sync with Apple health kit. This really drives me crazy. I had a Pebble watch at one point, and it synced fine with Apple health. Fitbit of course purchased Pebble, so they should have the technology, but they are surely doing this on purpose to keep people in the Fitbit world.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, I am currently keeping the Alta HR in my pocket to compete in Fitbit challenges but keeping my old clunky Apple watch. I have a feeling that my Fitbit's days are numbered, and if they don't soon provide support for other devices other people will go the same way. Why not an Apple watch app or something for the Samsung Gear? I think at this point its about fitbit trying to hang onto every last dollar, unfortunately they dont seem to realize that their gold is in their software and I for one would happily pay a premium for it.
 Works great.
 Nice quality 😃
 I was so excited to buy the new Fitbit Alta HR! It's smaller and the band is nice! It was a thinner version of the Fitbit Charge 2 but you have to tap tap on the top of it! You are suppose to tap 2 times and then your stats come up but mine struggled to respond! It was very irritating to have to just tap tap tap for it to respond! I like the button on the side you push like the Fitbit Charge HR or the Fitbit Charge 2!! Plus it does not record climbing stairs! Overall I was not happy with the new Fitbit Alta HR so I returned it! I'll just use my Fitbit Charge HR!
 LOVED the look of the band and received so many compliments at first, but unfortunately it broke literally three weeks after I started wearing it.
 My husband bought this for me for my birthday. It is small and sleek, but the other reviews he read about poor functionality are true. I must tap tap and tap again (in order to get anything to come up on my screen and sometimes I'll just give up and try later. This may be going back.
 This is my first Fitbit, and after having it for a couple of days I already know I love it. I had been debating between the Charge 2 and the Alta for quite a while (I wanted the slim style, but heart rate monitoring was also important), so I was super happy when they came out with this one. Definitely would recommend.
 Pros: the sleep tracking information is extremely helpful.  The 250+ steps/hour is great for reminding me to get up and move.  I set the timer on my phone to remind me every hour (the tracker doesn't do that - note that even when you get your 250 steps and sync with your phone, you'll probably have to sync twice to get the 250 steps to register as a dot)  The heartrate information is good to have.<br/>Cons: the "minutes" tracking works sporadically.  There's no method to how often it reports, but if you're looking to get an accurate and timely picture of how many minutes you've exercised, don't look for it here.  The goal tracker of meeting 5 days of exercise seems to also work sporadically.  I can far exceed all the tracking goals and have it not show I exercised that day, or barely make the goals (minutes, steps, miles, calories) and have the tracker say I met the exercise goal.  Don't count on this working/being accurate. You'll get a notification on phone that you've met the goal but tracker will say you haven't.  If syncing with iPhone, you'll need to charge the tracker every 2 days.  The display on tracker has to be tapped VERY hard to get it to display time, etc.  All displays are rounded, so I have to use my phone to see exactly where I am with steps and miles (6.2K steps isn't as helpful as the exact number).  The counts/displays on the Fitbit One were far superior to this tracker.  The tracker is big.  I have very small wrists so it's just at the cusp of being too big for my wrist.  Fortunately I got the metal band and use the magnet to keep the tracker snug to my wrist. The notification vibration is so minimal I miss every notification that comes in unless I happen to be doing nothing and looking at my wrist when it comes in.  If you're looking for the vibration to notify you of texts/emails, find a more reliable solution.<br/>Overall it's ok.  I like some of the functions (you have to use your phone to get information, though) and am annoyed that Fitbit isn't resolving the problem of every other day charging (this has been a known problem to Fitbit for a very long time - company answer is "we're working on it and have no idea when it'll be resolved") and making the displays easier to read (forget trying to read the display outside - it's too bright to see the display).  As an aside, don't bother calling or emailing customer support; they ask the same questions over and over, don't listen to the answers, and then tell you that you are doing something wrong.<br/>Updated review since yesterday, downgrading from 3 stars to 1 star.  In the past 24 hours:  the sleep tracker didn't work (no, Fitbit, it's not because I had the tracker in a strange or different position), the 250+ steps/hour didn't track all the hours, the minutes totally stopped tracking, and the heart rate reads sometimes and not others (it can actually turn on and off 4-5 times in the same 60 second period).  Additionally the 5 of 5 days goal disregarded a day.  This is an extremely expensive, non-working gadget.  Fitbit customer support says it must be something I'm doing wrong.  Judging from the reviews posted (should have read them prior to purchasing), apparently many of us are doing something wrong.  Totally discouraging.
 Didn't like that it didn't track lifting weights<br/>Returned got charge 2 hr. Had charge hr before! I will stick with that.
 I bought mine from a large warehouse retailer, so I’m not a confirmed buyer, but I’m a real person and received no reimbursement of any kind for this review.  I LOVE this thing.  Recording behavior is well known to be the best way to reduce unhealthy behavior and increase good behavior and the Fitbit does the recording for me.  I have had problems with depression and obesity for most of my adult life.  I’ve found the eating well, adequate sleep and exercise, and sunshine and fresh air are more helpful than my medications.  I am a bit compulsive; I check my stats hourly.on my tablet, only takes about 10 seconds, so  I’m getting up from my desk more, sitting less and exercising more.  I actually got up in the middle of the day yesterday and went up and down steps and ran in place for 5 minutes to reach my hourly goal.  It is pushing me to go outside for a walk, even though it is very cold in VT right now.  It is also affecting my eating.  I have gradually lost 50#, and have at least another 20 to go, but I’ve been stalled for 6 months.  My biggest challenge has always been getting started on healthy habits once I’ve fallen off the wagon.  If I can get through 3 days of healthy eating, I can do very well.  I’ve been eating badly for months now.  I’ve had many false starts, but with the Fitbit, it is new and exciting, so I’m back in the groove of counting calories and recoding my food intake and exercise.  You can link your  Fitbit to MyFitnessPal,the easiest food tracker I’ve found, so that is extremely helpful.  The sleep monitor function is probably the most important one for me.  I’m a night owl in an early bird world and the reminder to go to bed and seeing how much sleep I loose by watching “one more” YouTube video till late in the night is staring me in the face the next day.  Certainly not perfect, but I’m improving.  Also the positive reinforcement seems silly but is a big boost for me.  Best purchase I’ve ever made!
 I have owned several different models of Fitbits, and all of the other models were very accurate. This one not so much. My husband and I got identical models at the same time. His is overcounting steps and mine was counting maybe half to 67% of the steps. It was also struggling with syncing. Customer service responded fairly quickly with directions to restart it, walk and count exactly 100 steps to confirm it is working Ok. It did work... but after that started looking around online. Within just a few short hours it again stopped counting accurately. Apparently, it is an issue to count only half or so of your steps when your battery at 50% or less. Well, they should have disclosed that- I don't want to have to charge it every day. The charging cradle is finicky to get just right and the cord is super short making it a real nuisance. I could live with that if it worked better. I also had a lot of trouble getting it to sync, but restarting it so far has also helped with that issue. I would not purchase this model again, but would absolutely purchase other models.  Update: After a few emails back and forth with customer service I simply decided to return it since it was still within the window. I went and returned it, and when I got home had a replacement offer from Fitbit. The choices were to either replace the model or they would give me 50% off a purchase. I really appreciated how they handled that and decided to switch to a different model. So the Alta HR I would avoid, but the company was great to work with and I have really loved their other products. Stars adjusted up to reflect the great customer service.
 Wonderful device, very helpful, easy to charge and wear. BUT it tracks active minutes by measuring your heart rate. I just recorded 25 active minutes driving home from the theatre. Active minutes should be the effort you expend moving from Point A to Point B in a specific time period. Fitbit has decided it's how fast your heart beats, Ok, watching porn can raise your heart rate but you have never moved. If you are serious about monitoring your activity don't use the Alta HR. use the Fitbit ONE, which records the active minutes on the App. Maybe not as convenient as the Alta HR but it is accurate, not an imaginary number making you feel good for all your cardio effort.
 I'm loving my Alta HR! It has far surpassed my expectations. I can see the time and heart rate by just lifting my arm up like I would view a watch. No tapping needed. I can see text and call notifications when they come in. And then it can do everything my flex did. It is super comfortable. I was worried about having to keep it super tight for it to read my heart rate, but I don't. It can be worn just like a watch. One of my favorite functions is the silent alarm. I'm one busy mom, and this feature has helped me get my life back on schedule. From getting up in the morning, to having to leave the house to pick up my daughter from preschool, to nap time, reminder to fix dinner then reminding me have my kids getting ready for bed. I just love it!!
 Why I hate this fit bit.  (I wouldn't have bought it but it was a gift.)<br/>1. I can’t see my steps in the day light as the numbers are too light. This is important as I walk outdoors and never on a boring treadmill indoors.<br/>2. I want to be able to see the time without tapping on it twice.<br/>3. Often, the time does not appear on the first two taps.  I have to do it several times to get the time to appear.<br/>4. I have a small wrist and the long face doesn’t fit well.  It hangs out over my wrist.  So the watch is uncomfortable.<br/>5. It doesn’t count steps when I push a grocery cart.<br/>6. It doesn’t track my bicycle mileage.<br/>I much prefer the first generation in shape and features. I’m going to sell this on Craigslist and purchase a new one in old version style on ebay or go to another manufacturer.
 I used a cheap brand tracker for over a year with no complaints. A sleep study showed I get less than 1 hour of REM sleep in 8 hours of sleep and have chronic fatigue so I bought a Fitbit only because they measure all 4 stages of sleep to monitor my sleep. Otherwise I like the cheap brand tracker better. I don't even know how accurate the sleep stage data is from the fitbit. After 30 days I may return it.<br/><br/>Cons of the Fitbit vs cheap brand:<br/>1. To charge the fitbit you have to have this extra charging wire to attach to the tracker and that wire is what gets plugged into a USB. With the cheap ones you just take one half of the band off and stick the tracker itself directly into any USB which means, charge anywhere, no extra wire needed when you're on the go.<br/>2. Fitbit measures steps in thousands (K) once you reach over 999. The cheap ones would give you the actual exact number of steps, ie 9,999 steps! I miss that. I don't like seeing 1.2K. Not even the word "steps" is shown with fitbit. You don't know how close to the next 1,000 you are.<br/>3. You really need to tap the fitbit quite hard to get it to come on and to switch between modes. With the cheap ones you just need to lightly touch the screen or swipe the screen. Very nice. You don't attract any attention smacking your wrist with the cheap brands.<br/><br/>Pros of Fitbit vs. Cheap brands:<br/>1. I like the watch band style of the fitbit. The cheaper ones have a less secure closure although I've only had it pulled off once in the year of wearing it.<br/>2. More colors and styles of bands with fitbit.<br/>3.Insurance plans and such can connect with the Fitbit platform and do not recognize cheap brands.
 The heart rate is NOT a continuous rate as advertised - it is an average heart rate over some length of time which does not help during exercising. Yes, it will tell you some random (ok, not random, but not a true number) heart rate continuously, until you peak your heart rate and it can't figure out an average and then it just reads two dashes for a few minutes.<br/><br/>In the evenings, it can't tell if I am just laying down watching TV or actually asleep, so the sleep monitoring is way off. It often says I got 9+ hours of sleep but at least 1 hour of that is me just relaxing before bed.<br/><br/>I wore the Coral band for just under 3 weeks and it was already very discolored from normal wear. I have a desk job so I am not often moving around or doing anything that would make it dirty.<br/><br/>Overall from a highly rated item and name brand, I am very disappointed is the mis-advertising in the product.
 Glaringly bad. Bought this due to the heart rate monitor and the advanced app from Fitbit. However, it has one major drawback and it’s the brightness of the screen-numbers. You cannot read the info on the watch if you are outdoors. You cannot read the Alta if you have your sunroof open. You cannot read the Alta if you are running outdoors. You cannot read the Alta if you are walking outdoors. You CAN read the Alta if you’re indoors, at a movie theater or in your car if you don’t have a sunroof or drive a Jeep Wrangler.<br/><br/>If you don’t need to read it outdoors, it’s a great product. The battery life lasts 7 days.... I wonder why. Perhaps it’s because you can’t adjust the brightness. It’s so dim. I’d rather it last 3days and let me control the brightness so I can read it outdoors. The app is awesome. The HR monitor is great and sleep monitor and prompts are terrific but I have to return mine. It’s too bad. Don’t believe me? Go on the community forum and you’ll see lots of requests to make it brighter. I wish I had read this drawback before purchasing mine. I hope this helps you make an informed decision.
 I really hated this product, and finally sent it back.<br/>From the start, I had trouble clicking on the screen to activate the time and other functions. Someone at work showed me how to flick my nail against it, and that's the only way it would work for me.  Tapping didn't work. Moving my wrist toward me, like you're supposed to do, sometimes worked and sometimes didn't (only worked waking up in the morning when I *wasn't* attempting to get it to work!).  This was soooo frustrating... even if I wanted to see the time, I had to flick and flick and flick until it would light up.<br/>I did like tracking my steps, and found that I exercised more. But when the weather got cold and I went back to the gym, I discovered that the heart rate tracker was not accurate. The treadmill would say 138 and the Fitbit was only 119. The treadmill is accurate because both hands are on it. HR was the main reason I bought the Fitbit. Then I discovered that my walking on the treadmill was not registering. Apparently you have to move your hands, which doesn't exactly feel safe on a treadmill.<br/>Without a reliable heart rate and not able to track the treadmill, and problems activating the screen, this product was not satisfactory for me.
 Bought during Prime Day. Received the item on July 17. I opened the package that evening and the watch had ZERO charge. Nothing. Couldn't even power on the unit. That wasn't a big deal, but it was definitely odd. I've never had an item with a built-in battery arrive with zero charge. So I start charging the watch and by the time I go to bed, it appears to have a full charge (full battery shown on screen). I then wear it to sleep so that I can try out the sleep-monitoring feature. Next morning, battery is drained to half. Hmm. Maybe it didn't get a full charge the night before? OK, I'll charge it all day while I'm at work. That night, wear it to sleep again. Wake up, same deal - down to half charge. Something's not right. This watch is supposed to last 5+ days being constantly worn. For my last test, I gave it a full charge then let the watch sit on my desk. At the 12 hour mark, the battery is almost completely drained. Do your research before you buy, these watches are plagued by battery problems. Mine is going back for a refund. I don't even want a replacement if this is how shoddy Fitbit's QC is.
 I got the Alta HR for christmas last year. It worked well for a while and I loved it. About 6 months in, the screen cracked. Fitbit refused to fix it or offer any concessions. Then, a couple months ago, it stopped syncing to my phone notifications so I wasn't getting text messages or calls. A couple weeks ago, it stopped syncing to my phone altogether. I called customer support and they said they'd get back to me. never did. I called them again and he tried to help me but was not able to resolve the issue. I tried calling a third time and the number did not go through. then I used an online chat with customer support, and they tried to help me but the issue could not be resolved. They told me to "get a new smartphone or tablet." That was outrageous to me. Your product stopped working with a different product so you tell me to replace the OTHER product? That is not a solution. They would not replace the product or do anything else to help me. Both issues were well within the warranty. Never buying a fitbit product again. I hate saying this because I'm not a big Apple person, but get an apple watch or a Garmin instead.
 The Pros: I bought the Rose Gold with the pale pink band version and I love that. I also love the app and the features of this tracker.<br/>The Cons: When the tracker arrived I fully charged it and at the end of the week it needed charging again but I couldn't get it to charge. I didn't get the vibration that shows it's being charged. I chatted with a guy from Fitbit and he decided, after going through different steps to get it to charge, I needed a replacement. After more than a week I received the replacement yesterday and guess what, it wouldn't start up. I chatted with another guy from FitBit and after trying things to get it to start up and failing, he decided I needed another replacement. Oy! But this time I have to send back the one I just got before they will send a replacement. Disappointing! Off it goes today, but this is its last chance.
 Let me preface by saying we've used fitbits pretty much since their inception. This isn't my first issue with their product or support but definitely my last!<br/><br/>My mother (in her 60's) just had open-heart surgery. We decided to purchase her a Fitbit (from retail) to help her monitor her heart rate, food and exercise. I went to set the product up and was unable to create an account for her because they said the email was already in use. She has one email and never owned any tracker prior. Fitbit refused help and told us to take the item back to the store. We tried that but because the package was open the store refused refund. Fitbit also refused to refund. This is ridiculous! I'm now stuck with a tracker and extra bracelets because of this companies horrible policies!
 My husband got me this as a surprise replacement for my Flex. (He bought it from his Amazon account, if you care about that sort of thing.) After some difficulty with setup, which kind of killed the initial excitement I've been really happy with it.<br/><br/>The positive:<br/><br/>The device is small and unobtrusive. I considered the surge when I was deciding on a device, because it does more. But I have small wrists and the larger device would have looked ridiculous on me. The Alta HR does an admirable job without looking too bulky.<br/><br/>It does allow me to track when my heart rate is increasing, even if I'm not stepping. Which honestly is the most important feature I was looking for, and it seems to do this well. I don't need anything SUPER exact for my purposes.<br/><br/>I really like the little reminders to move. I know it's a gimmick, but they make me laugh and I do actually find myself motivated to move, even if only around the house.<br/><br/>The alarm feature is helpful. I don't use it for getting up in the morning, but for a lot of little 'heads-up' reminders of time throughout the day.<br/><br/>I like having an actual informative display and it is clear and easy to read.<br/><br/>But more than anything else, the device does what it sets out to do.<br/><br/>Note: I've not used the text notification feature.<br/><br/>The negative:<br/>Straight out of the box I had problems. The Alta comes with NO DIRECTIONS, just an instruction to go online and download the app. This is annoying, but doubly so when, once I had the app, the first thing the device wanted to do was update its firmware. Again, annoying, but triply so since it had a lot of trouble doing it. After a dozen attempts, searching the forums for advice, removing any device in the area that might be interfering, etc, it did eventually update. But it was such a hassle I was seriously considering the possibility that I'd gotten a duff device.<br/><br/>No altimeter, so no tracking stairs. I knew this when I chose this device. I didn't think it would matter, since my Flex didn't either. But I find that it does so much, it seems like an odd thing not to do. But that's just my impression.<br/><br/>The main reason I wanted to update from my Flex to a heart rate version is because my primary means of exercise is yoga. It's really frustrating to do an hour-long, difficult class and be told you burned 80 calories with you 81 steps. And the heart rate monitor does track heart rate, you can see it on the graph on the dashboard. But it doesn't log it as exercise on that dashboard. Apparently its still only cardio that counts. This matters to me, because one of the things I wear a Fitbit for is because it reports to my insurance when I've been active. My insurance, in turn, does things like pay for my gym as long as I prove I use it. So, this is a fairly large oversight for me.<br/><br/>Which leads to the lack of ability to manually tell the device when you are exercising (or sleeping). Really there is no means of manually imputing information. You can alter info after the fact on the dashboard, but that's it. For me, this is annoying for both exercise and sleep. I read a lot and embarrassingly, the device sometimes thinks I'm asleep while reading and I have no way to tell it, "Now I'm going to bed." (As a humor aside to this, I got the flu while wearing it and basically slept for 36 hours. The sleep tracker apparently didn't know what to do with that, so it logged nothing. Though I did burn 1600 calories with 237 in 24 hours.)<br/><br/>All in all, the device isn't perfect for what I was hoping to accomplish with it. But I've been happy so far and my main complain is something that could be corrected on the software side. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
 I am extremely grateful for Fit Bit!  I had previously owned a Fit Bit Blaze.  I definitely enjoyed it.  It had a lot of extra features, though, that I definitely didn't use, which felt like a waste.  It was also a hassle to charge and I was always afraid of breaking it when having to remove the little electronic part from the wrist band by pushing it through.  It helped tremendously, though, and I lost over 150 lbs using it.  I unfortunately misplaced it so I decided to buy a Fit Bit Alta HR.  In comparison, the Alta HR is SO much better.  It's a lot more simple.  It doesn't have ten thousand different things that I don't use and it seems to pick up on my heart rate much better and more accurately.  It's also *SO* much easier to charge.  It just clips on &amp; boom!  You're done!  I haven't tested all of the other Fit Bits, but I've read a lot of the reviews and done research.  If you're unsure of what to start out with or what to purchase, I would definitely recommend going with this one.  I love my Alta and absolutely recommend it!  10/10 STARS!!!
 I liked the device (purchased from Amazon in Dec '17) a lot, and bought a platform charging device which was more convenient for its frequent charging needs. However, 7 months after purchase, the device no longer starts at all despite my trying all the recommended trouble-shooting and I assume the battery has reached its life expectancy. Customer service will replace the unit, which has a year warranty, but that means the entire product is only good for 14 months max assuming one replacement. Will turn off features such as all-day syncing this time (customers aren't warned about this in advance) but I am sure that company is aware of these problems and chooses not to inform customers.
 Love it! I recommend it to anyone looking for an elegant fitness tracker.
 The tracker itself works OK. This is my 3rd Fitbit. Previously I had the Charge HR and this is similar but with a few less functions and slimmer profile. My main gripe with the Alta is the light pink band that comes with the Rose Gold tracker. Dark blue stains developed on the band within just a few days of wear and nothing has worked to remove the stains. The band looks filthy and terrible. I know I'm not the only one with this problem, and FitBit is aware of this situation, yet they keep selling these bands. When I complained customer service sent me a note saying that the tracker shouldn't be worn with dark clothing, as transfer of dye should occur. Seriously? You do realize that most women wear dark colored yoga pants? Our wardrobes aren't all white. How about you develop a band that isn't sensitive to the color of clothing? I'm currently dealing with customer service to see if I can get a replacement black band, as I'm assuming no stains would show up on the black. I've also purchased a tan leather band which hopefully isn't susceptible to this problem, but of course I don't want to wear the leather band while exercising.
 I loved my Alta HR, but recently the band had become defective. My Alta would be secured to my wrist and then watch portion would unlatch from the band and the whole thing would fall off my wrist. I was able to catch it a few times, but now it’s too late. It came off when I wasn’t paying attention and now it’s lost. This is the last Fitbit product I’m buying. I heard from a friend recently that Fitbit products can be wildly inaccurate with their heart rate tracking, so I guess that’s another good reason to make the switch to another product. Also, I did contact their customer service and lost Fitbits due to defects with the band aren’t covered, so they did nothing to help. Be prepared for disappointment if you buy this product.
 I'm pretty pleased with my Alta HR. I got it through Costco and after wearing for 2 days I can say it's a great item to add to my "things of need". Battery so far seems pretty decent, I have most non-useful things turned off including the heart rate monitor. I needed something to: tell me the time on my wrist, count and track my walking distance, tracking my "active time", and be small and not expensive. The Alta fits the price. I like how you can easily replace the bands. Complaints I'm reading about "hard to put bands"? None whatsover. Just replace the band if you don't like the default one. Another great perk: if you have bluetooth turned ON you will get notifications of texts or calls on your Fitbit. Simple. Just something to give you a vibration. I don't need to the whole schebang! and talking on my wrist like Dick Tracy (looking at you Apple Watch). This is a simple easy and yes "comfortable" device.
 So.... Excellent battery life. Sleep monitoring and analysis is great. And that’s it. Everything else feels meh. Out of the box, this thing was recording a step for almost every breath I took. I set it up as well and as accurately as I could. After some research, It was determined that using false handedness settings does the trick. Also, resetting the device helped get it closer to accurate. Tapping the device to see the different screens is very inconsistent. Same goes for swinging the wrist. It sometimes activates the screen, sometimes no. The worst part of this experience so far is the heart rate monitoring. It is infuriating to look at the device over and over in the middle of the workout only to see no heart rate because the fitbit it struggling to measure it. This happens a lot while doing hiit. I love to know where my heart rate is, and this is probably the most unreliable part of wearing this thing. I’d say the heart rate info appears less than half the time during these workouts. I’ve tried wearing it all sorts of different ways, especially the ways Fitbit advises with little to no effect. For being a Fitbit, I expected a lot more. Its performance I would expect from the cheaper Amazon knock-offs. All that said, I still use it every day and night. The info it does provide is still usefull in the end. It is an overall good way to keep track of your fitness once you get it working as well as it can. Oh and the app is pretty nice, though it needs some work.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I lowered it to 2 stars just a day after this review, Why? Well I’m doing my usual routine (as of late at least). This consists of 20-30 mins biking to gym, weight training for 50-70 mins, and biking back home for another 20-30 mins. I lost count as to how many times I would look at this fitbit and see no heartrate being monitored. At one point, it kept measuring my HR in the 70’s, for several mins, in the middle of several sets of weight training where I was breathing heavily and sweating profusely. This is the same heart rate I record while making coffee. Similar monitoring happened while biking. And YES, I understand that I should make it fit tighter and in a higher spot on my arm while working out. I’ve tried tighter, higher up, and everything in between. I can’t tell you how many times I just thought to myself, “this thing sucks!” I think I’m moving on.<br/>WAIT! I Almost FORGOT!<br/>Very impressive thing I noticed when I took it off before a shower... ready?...<br/>it kept measuring a heart rate! Wtf? Wow! I didn’t have it on, yet heart rate was being measured, even though I couldn’t get a solid reading while actually wearing it. Bluetooth in my blood?
 I wanted to love this so much! It's so cute and so much more "dainty" than my Charge HR but I can't get past what it is lacking.<br/>The Alta HR that I received will not track my stairs which is frustrating. I saw another "1 star" reviewer say the same thing as well. I'm sure it's just a glitch in a few of the trackers or else everyone would be saying the same thing. Sure, I could request a replacement but that wouldn't solve my biggest pet peeve - I cant manually track exercise!<br/>I take my dog for a few short runs per day to get my heart rate up, most times these runs do not last 15 min. (which are the only exercises that alta automatically recognizes as exercise) or more but we cover a lot of ground during this time, so I like to record them to see how these short runs contribute to my day as far as steps, calories burned per min and what zones my heart rate was in. With the AltaHR, I can not do that, I like to see these breakdowns/summaries so unless/until this is changed, I will be sticking with my ChargeHR.<br/>Also, I love the bigger display on the Alta HR but you have to tap quite hard on it to get it to cycle through steps, calories burned, etc.
 It's OK during the rather short time it works, which isn't long. But even then it's not good, just OK. I'm on my second one...they replaced the first one without a problem, the second one barely lasted a year and now they won't replace it.<br/><br/>I only bought this one because it's small.<br/><br/>When it 'sort of' works, here is what it does:<br/>- you have to tap it REALLY REALLY hard numerous times to see i.e. the time<br/>- kind of tracks heart rate (for a little while...then it breaks &amp; they don't replace it)<br/>- automatically tracks SOME exercise, but not very accurately<br/>- SOMETIMES lets you know when you have a call or text, but most of the time not until after the phone stops ringing &amp; if you don't look at the text quickly enough or if you move your hand the wrong way the text is gone. There's no way to see it again or dismiss it once you've read it (which is how other trackers work)<br/><br/>After less than a year:<br/>- suddenly keeps reading ridiculously high heart rate for no reason, i.e. higher when walking slowly than when I'm running<br/><br/>It's MUCH too expensive for what you get.
 Mine has worked well for me and was easy to set up using my iphone7. Problems occurred with the one received also as a gift by my wife.  The return / exchange was easily accomplish and the 2nd one posed no problem and is functioning well. To me this is just another tech toy and I would never have considered wearing something like this when I was a daily runner of 5 to 10 miles.  It will never replace the chrono stop watch for accuracy.  After a month of ownership I am still trying to calibrate so that it is within .10 miles for distance.  I found the app which you will have to install on your phone easy to use and the synchronization  just as easy.  Take it from someone now a walker after 42+ years of running -- listen to your body but it you are inclined toward tech type toys this is what you may have been missing.  Give it a chance....
 1. Steps – This thing doesn't track just steps. It tracks movement – almost any movement. Drink coffee, scratch your head, wave good bye, put on a shirt, etc, etc. It even tracks movement I didn't know I made. Reading a book for an hour gave me another 130 steps (Note – I use a Kindle, so I wasn't turning pages.) Unfortunately, it records all that movement as steps. One comedian said that he bought a Fitbit and found he could masturbate for four miles.<br/><br/>2. I like the sleep recording part. Recording sleep by registering heartbeat is cool. It records X amount of hours of restless sleep, X hours of deep sleep, and X hours of REM sleep. BTW – I had 470 steps while I was sleeping. No – I don't sleepwalk.<br/><br/>3. No GPS – so, if you want to track your walking, running or biking, you still have to lug your phone around. Then, I found, from reading about Fitbit's, is that they actually use the GPS in your phone. So, even if you have a “GPS connected” Fitbit, you have to carry your phone around with you.<br/><br/>4. Compatibility – be sure and look at Fitbit's web page to see if your phone is compatible with it. I have an LG G5. After an hour of trying to get the Alta recognized by the app, I found that the G5 was not on the compatibility list. I did get them connected and they have stayed connected, but it took three reinstalls and a couple of times clearing the cache and data in the app.<br/><br/>6. I do have tracker software in my phone which, uses the Phone GPS. And, I have some routes that I follow, that I know the exact distances. When I used the Alta on one of my 1.5 mile routes, it reported that I had walked 2.3 miles, while my phone app reported 1.54 miles. A park, where we walk, has a .65 miles track around it. After two laps, the Fitbit reported 2.1 miles, while the phone app reported 1.33 miles.<br/><br/>I think a wrist mounted tracker, from any of the companies, is going to register movement rather than just steps. When someone comes out with one that can differentiate between a head scratch and a walk across the living room, I'll be more interested. Of course you can get a step tracker, that hooks on the belt or waist band for $10 - $20, but they won't provide the information that the AltaHR does. If you want the heart rate tracking, then the device has to be worn some place where the heart beat can be read. Fitbit HR's are designed for the wrist, although, I've heard of folks wearing them on their ankles to minimize arm movement as steps. Fitbit does not recommend that.<br/><br/>Will I keep this one? I've only had it for a week – I'd like to exchange it for another one to see if I get less counts for movement, I don't think I made (reading my Kindle or sleeping). If the next one does the same, then it is what it is and no recommendation.<br/><br/>I want to like this thing. It was purchased with rewards points from a local department store. They do have an easy return/exchange policy. If I get a better one, then I may modify the star count. If not then it stays as is. I'll update after the exchange.
 I bought the Alta HR because I had two different Charge HRs that fell apart on me (which is a common complaint) and was hoping to get a more durable product.  I train regularly so an exercise tracker with heart rate is very important, particularly for running (i.e. keeping track of how long I'd been running and how far is very important to me). I was appalled to find that, despite the extremely high price, there is no exercise mode (which the charge had).  So I'm stuck with an extremely expensive glorified pedometer. And guess what?  My phone has a pedometer and a heart rate monitor, so it's not useful for exercise at all.  Also, the display is pretty thick, so its potential as a sleep tracker is limited by the discomfort of wearing it while I sleep.  They say "no buttons, just tap to manipulate the display," but it appears the lack of buttons means there are fewer features available.  This doesn't make much sense, because this thing is really thick - you could easily fit half a dozen buttons on the real estate available. Disappointed, all around.
 My FitBit Alta HR is less than nine months old, and while I have really loved the device and the interface with the app, I was shocked when it recently cracked across the face of the screen without having been dropped or hit against anything. As I’ve looked at the forums, this is a somewhat common problem for users and many are attributing it to the heat of the summer.  Fitbit customer service  refuses to honor the one-year warranty and replace the Fitbit, even though there’s obviously a major design flaw if screens are cracking without having had any external damage. Also, since I have a small wrist, the wristbands keep breaking and my Fitbit falls off. I’ve had to replace them three times in the 8 months I’ve  had my Fitbit.  I think I’m going to have to investigate other brands, such as Garmin.
 I have tried to contact customer service first on all my issues and they only reply with copy and paste generic answers. Sleep tracking is not correct. It recorded me as being sleeping on multiple days where I was up walking around, or even being DD in the wee hours. Steps and heart rate seem accurate. The other thing is it makes my thumb go numb. I have to alternate hands a lot because it does this. Until I got this one, I wore a jawbone tracker on the same hand for almost 3 years, so the numbness has been happening because of the fitbit Alta.<br/>Edit****<br/>It still does not track sleep accurately. Even if the alarm is set through the band, it still records as being asleep. Also, it is very unreliable with turning your wrist to turn on the faceplate. I pretty much have to always tap it to make it turn on, I can't just turn my wrist as I should be able to. It really isn't worth the money.
 Previously you could easily export your Fitbit data into an Excel file.  However, Fitbit just started a new data export process that requires multiple email requests to retrieve data and exports every bit of past data into a json file which is not easy to work with unless you are a programmer.  Check the community comments about this on the Fitbit website before you buy - your data will be difficult to retrieve.  I have not yet seen a single positive comment about the revised data export process.  I've had a couple of fitbits.  The first one didn't work very long and fell apart within months.  The Alta HR I now have works ok and has not fallen apart.  But I won't get another fitbit if I can't retrieve my data easily.
 This is my 3rd fitbit that has stopped working at about the 1 year mark (I know I should have learned after the first 2).  I contacted customer service and the best they would do was give me 25% off a new one.  Really?!! The Black Friday deals are better than that.  Customer service also told me: "Marco:I’d like to share with you that Fitbit trackers were designed to be life-long due to the high-quality materials they were made of. The tracker’s life span will be affected by weather changes, over charging (standard charging is 1 to 2 hours), temperature, storage and workout activities you're engaged in."  What a joke!  I wore this like a normal watch and took very good care of it.  I can see from the other reviews I'm not the only one to have this problem.
 I really wanted to like this band, but am going to send it back for a couple of reasons.  First of all, the fitbit software is great.  Does excellent job at tracking steps, HR and sleep. However, I ordered the coral color and within a month it was already super dirty looking.  The fitbit website warns that lighter color bands may get color-rub from jeans and such, but unfortunately I didn't read that before I ordered it.  It doesn't seem to clean off... The second reason I will be returning it is because of the lack of buttons.  Having to tap the screen to turn it on is super super annoying.  If it worked smoothly, it wouldn't be a big deal, but oftentimes I have to almost pummel the thing to get it to come on.  Anyways, if you order a dark band, and don't mind tapping it, it is a great product for the price and features you get, but just not the tracker for me!
 The fitbit is great &amp; the color is pretty but after 2 days of wearing it. The coral is looking dirty as if I've had it a longtime or been in an environment that was dirty but I haven't. Just normal wear but the color is stained already.
 So glad I finally threw my UP Move in the trash and got the new Alta HR from FitBit.  The sleep app for FitBit, especially with the added HR info, is so much better!  I LOVE IT!<br/><br/>I have an Apple Watch (see below), so my main interest was in Sleep Tracking.  (Apple watch can't do that and get recharged at the same time.)  I've been a Jawbone UP user for years.  When my last UP band choked under warranty last year, I tried the FitBit Blaze, but quickly decided to get an Apple Watch instead.  After all, Jawbone kindle gave me a fancy new UP Move to replace my UP band.  (Should have waited for the backordered UP band - hated the UP Move the entire time I had it.)  Well, two days ago that useless UP Move needed a new battery - AGAIN, so I threw it in the trash with the replacement band I had to buy for it when the old one crapped out.<br/><br/>I decided to switch from Jawbone to Fitbit and I'm so glad I finally made the move.  Since sleep tracking is my main goal, the Alta HR does a better job by incorporating heart rate data, and the Fitbit App, which is working flawlessly for me, provides your sleep data in a number of different ways that, so far, I like much more than the UP app.  Maybe Jawbone has a new app that's better, but since they stuck me with that UP Move, I'll never know.  They got a bad batch of UP bands and when people asked for warranty replacement, they offered something inferior and made it sound like it was great because it was new.  Bad move. I doubt I'll ever use anything from their brand again.
 I already had a Fitbit Zip which worked great for tracking my steps. I bought the Alta HR mainly for the sleep analysis. I have an emfit QS as well, which is supposed to be the most accurate sleep monitor on the market. The first night I used both and was impressed at how well the Fitbit results matched the emfit QS. In fact, I think it did a better job of estimating my total # hours of sleep. The emfit QS always over-estimates my total # hours sleep, so I have to go through the data to figure out the actual value. I didn't need to do that with the Fitbit. It also showed times during the night when I was awake, something the emfit never shows. The Alta HR is cheaper too. I kind of don't like having something on my wrist, which is why I delayed purchasing it, but I'm getting used to it. I like the reminder to go to bed and the information about the different sleep stages. Also revealing is the 'benchmarks' i.e. showing how much REM/deep/light sleep I get compared to other people my age.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an accurate sleep monitor, I could definitely recommend the Alta HR.
 My son got this for me for Christmas and I really like the slim fit and even got a different band for it for comfort. As far as the features go it's good and I like that texts come through and notifies me of a call but I'm really dissatisfied with the excersize part. I'm really into cardio and it seemed to be tracking fine at first but there are glitches in this tracker. For example I did a 50 minute total cardio hard workout and it only calculated 23 minutes. I was livid!!  Heart rate wasn't tracking either and just had lines on it. Then there are other times when I'm sitting at my desk at work and it has calculated 35 minutes of excersize. Wtf??it also doesn't calculate my miles on my recumbent bike which I do 23-25 miles every night (don't have a life lol) Tried going on the app on my phone and resetting it to no avail. This isn't the first time this has happened. Very innaccurate in my opinion. I thought it was a wonderful gift but disappointed as of late. Maybe I just got a bad one.
 I really wanted to love this but after 3 days of trying and talking to people at the fitbit community I have come to the reallization that Fitbit (at least the alta hr model) is not designed for you to waer it all day but just when you do hiking or exersize. Here are a couple of examples :<br/><br/>- it track your lack of movement and not your actuall speed. I watched a movie for two hours last night and it counted it as sleep.<br/>- it registers movement in a car. It showed 3,278 steps on a 12 miles drive<br/>- it registers 670 steps when sitting down
 Highly disappointed in this product. I had a Charge HR that I loved but after 2 years it bit the dust so I was excited seeing this product and how sleek it was. And that's all it has going for it. Problems-<br/><br/>1. "Auto Exercise Recognition" doesn't work hardly at all as opposed to like the charge hr where you push to begin your workout. This doesn't recognize lifting weights as exercise and only recognizes cardio partially.<br/><br/>2. Heart rate monitor is VERY inaccurate. Going as hard as I can doing plyo I could barely get it to register 120bpm. Typically my Charge HR reads into the 160s which I feel was pretty accurate because I can barely speak when going. But to be sure I put on my Polar chest strap to measure and sure enough 166bpm peak with 143 avg.<br/><br/>3. This doesn't have a altimeter in it so it doesn't count flights of stairs which the Charge HR did and if you have stairs in your house or work this is a must have feature.<br/><br/>I wanted to love this product cause I loved my Charge and I love the look of this one but sadly the functionality of this one just isn't there. I am currently working to get it refunded that's how dissatisfied I am with this product.
 The Alta is OK but the charger is so cheap that it breaks.  It is held onto the fitbit with two tiny plastic clips which break.  Trying to get another charger is very difficult.  I but lots of things and cannot remember where or from whom I buy and Ineeded this information...for them to send another charger.  When I threatened to never buy another fitbit, they sent me a new charger.  Now I am waiting with baited breath for this one to break.  There are too many other options out there to fool around with Fitbit, especially, when they know this is a defective charger.  I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER FIT BIT AGAIN.
 this is my second fitbit in the space of 3 years. it seems these are all built to last exactly past the warranty. my first mechanism completely fell apart soon after the warranty past. I foolishly purchase another, in which the band clamps broke and were replaced. must less than a year later the replacement band split however fitbit refuses to replace the band because the device is over a year old. sounds absurd when the band was originally faulty and the replacement one they sent is also faulty well with in the warranty. both fitbits online and phone customer service is deplorable, simply denying and not caring about the previous case reference number from the few months earlier. bottom line is I have purchased multiple of these devices and they could care less about following their own guidelines let alone satisfying a clearly wronged customer. these people will never get another penny from me.
 If you liked fitbit you won't after you update the app.  I sent their customer service an E-mail re: this stupid app.  They guarantee a reply in 2 business days due to "volume of business".  I'm sure that is absolutely true.  My watch won't snyc with my phone.  I have to put my e-mail and password in each time I try to open the app.  You would not BELIEVE what how much work they want you to do to try to get the app working.  This used to be an ok product.  I had to replace every six months due to poor bands....but at least it gave me some info.  For what you pay for one of these, save up for an iPhone.......Not a happy customer
 I've had the Fitbit Alta for a few years now and just upgraded to the Alta HR. There are so many reasons I love this tracker. First and foremost, it keeps me moving. But any tracker can do that, right? Well, I also love that it checks heart rate, which is especially important to me when I'm doing something super active. And the Fitbit app goes above and beyond. You can track food and water intake, your weight and body fat % goals, active minutes vs. regular movement, and for women, you can track your reproductive health as well. You can also challenge your friends and family to keep each other motivated. I've absolutely incorporated Alta HR and the Fitbit app into making positive changes for a healthier lifestyle.
 The Fitbit Alta HR is just the thing to complement your active lifestyle. While the sensors continuously track your steps, calories burned, and heart rate all you have to do is keep moving. Additional features available from the Alta HR include active minutes; sleep tracking, and distance monitors making this an ideal fitness tracker for most of your typical daily activities. The Fitbit Alta HR is compatible with the Fitbit app that can be downloaded on all smart devices. The app provides even more features such as silent alarms, water intake tracking, and syncing all your phone notifications to display on your Fitbit screen.<br/><br/>The Fitbit Alta HR comes in a variety of colors and two sizes: small and large. The neutral band on this particular Fitbit is especially nice for everyday wear with a wide variety of outfits. The slim, modern looking band makes the Alta HR acceptable anywhere from your work office to the gym. You may find over time that a replacement band is necessary; in that case many options are available. For only $19.99 Amazon offers an <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Greeninsync-Bands-for-Fitbit-Alta-HR-Fitbit-Alta-Replacement-Band-Large-Accessory-Watch-Buckle-Wristband-for-Fitbit-Alta-Fitbit-Alta-HR-Strap-Bracelets-W-Same-Color-Metal-Clasp-and-Fastener-10Pack/dp/B078XDHCCP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Greeninsync Bands for Fitbit Alta HR, Fitbit Alta Replacement Band Large Accessory Watch Buckle Wristband for Fitbit Alta/Fitbit Alta HR Strap Bracelets W/ Same Color Metal Clasp and Fastener(10Pack)</a> designed specially for the Alta HR Fitbit model. Besides the band durability, the Fitbit sensor itself is very durable. The screen has stayed scratch free and sensors have continued to provide accurate readings even though many day-to-day scrapes and drops. The one thing your Fitbit will not hold up against is water. You must always take your Fitbit off your wrist before showering or swimming.<br/><br/>Even with constant use, the battery power hold on the Fitbit Alta HR is very impressive. A full charge will keep your Fitbit running for about 5 days on average. Getting a dead Fitbit Alta HR battery to a full charge only takes about an hour. It is very convenient to not have to spend so much time charing your Fitbit as it could be in use.<br/><br/>The market price for fitness trackers greatly varies depending on brand, model, and features available. At $149.95 you truly are receiving that value back in your Alta Hr with its wide variety of features, substantial usable life, and durability.<br/><br/>Overall, the Fitbit Alta HR has proven to be an effective product to consciously highlight progress towards fitness goals and is designed with high quality software and materials. This product deserves a 4.5 rating out of 5. Take the step to an even more active lifestyle by purchasing the Fitbit Alta HR.
 I had the original Fitbit Flex for just over three years when it finally started acting wonky (walking 1 mile yielded 88 steps), so I decided to replace it with the Alta HR.  I love the new Alta HR.  It is slim, but still records a lot of useful information.  I like the notifications reminding me to move every hour (you can set the hours where you should be getting 250 steps per hour).  The sleep analysis is a lot more sophisticated than my old Flex could provide. The resting heart beat analysis helps me figure out if my workout is helping my heart work more efficiently.<br/><br/>The only minor quibble is that the only way to show all of your steps (and not rounded to the nearest 100 steps) is to set the display to show horizontally not vertically. I like the horizontal display, but I like seeing my exact number of steps more.<br/><br/>Additional bonus:  Road ID makes an ID that fits on the Alta band, so you can have your emergency information also listed on your band in case of emergency.
 I like what this tracker does in theory, but practically speaking there are some flaws. The most significant is that the wristband design proves to fail within 6 months. I had 2 replacement bands sent to me over the course of the warranty and 1 time I almost lost my Fitbit on the streets of Brooklyn. If I hadn’t retraced my steps carefully, it would’ve been lost forever. The other flaw in the design is the base of the unit (including points where the wristband attaches) is a bit too long, it’s painful to wear on smaller wrists as recommended and I have to wear it with the face on my inner wrist.
 I bought this for my girlfriend as she's looking into a healthier lifestyle and I have had a good experience with the Charge 2 FitBit. Though it's been released for a while, the HR is still one of the best trackers on the market for your average fitness interest. She's able to measure her heart rate, steps, sleep, and workouts all through the device and the app on her android phone. The device has a battery life of about 7 days and charges fairly fast, getting an extra two to three days of battery on a 20 minute charge.<br/><br/>The fitbit apps that come free from the play store are also very helpful and well integrated. You can easily sync the tracker to the app and see your results, watch workouts and follow along, and explore a variety of other features such as diet tracking and fitness analysis.<br/><br/>The only inconvenience of this model is the lack of a physical button. You can still move through the different stats by tapping the screen, but sometimes the taps don't register. I find the physical button and touch screen of my Charge 2 to be more user friendly.
 This may be a great choice for monitoring typical daily activities, although I had to call customer service to reset my device and adjust my profile on the back-end to get it to work correctly for these. (It was showing far lower heart rate and calorie burn than the actual number.) During things like walks and housework, the monitor seemed to accurately track steps, heart rate and calorie burn after customer service fixed whatever was wrong. The app it synchs with is simple to use.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it never accurately tracked calorie burn or heart  rate during workouts. I tracked my workouts - rowing, jogging, and Crossfit workouts, and it might show a 100 calorie burn and about 100 heart rate when the actual numbers were more like 300 and 180 respectively. I called customer service twice to try to sort out the issue, and they said they couldn't confirm that the device was defective and offered to send me a new one anyway. I suspect that the device just didn't sense my heart rate during vigorous activity, as it was less accurate during activities that required wrist movement. I tried making it tighter, looser, higher on the wrist, lower, switching wrists... and nothing worked. The device and wristband are also pretty uncomfortable, the higher-profile of the device bruising my wrist when I'd sleep with it on.<br/><br/>I decided to spring for an apple watch instead.<br/><br/>It may be great for simple things like step counting and low-intensity activity, but I'm afraid it just wasn't for me.
 Being a Fitbit user since their beginning. I found the Alta the best model for me when it came to size and use. I learned from the beginning that while I loved the discretion of the One and its predecessor, I had a bad habit of washing them. They would usually survive 1 to 2 machine cycles, but I switched to the wrist styles after too many mistakes. When the Charge 2 came out, I bought it, despite having reacted to the first HR model. While I absolutely loved the display, the syncing with my personal Pixel and my work iPhone, I found that I really missed the trim Alta. When the Alta HR came out I resisted as long as I could. The Rose Gold edition, a catch of the Charge HR while traveling recently and my spouse needing to monitor his heart rate became the perfect storm and I switched to this unit. I love it! I do miss the bigger screen, but this one is far more discrete and works better for me. FYI,  customer service is good (the used to be great, now you have to be insistent). And, I have always been able to sell off my old Fitbits to afford upgrades. In 2012 I had a major medical situation and I had a hard time with the experts because it turns out that I have an unusual baseline. The data I collected via years of Fitbit wearing finally convinced the experts that I was not some crazy person... for me, wearing a health tracker is non-negotiable now.<br/><br/>As a family, in the summer time, I used the Flex models to encourage my kids into incentive based movements. We use the Aria as well, and very amusingly I can report that my 15.6 lb dog frequently goes and weighs herself on it too (no training from us)!<br/><br/>As a very long-time user, I can say that I am quite happy with Fitbit and that I have tried 3 other versions of personal trackers on the market and prefer Fitbit every time.
 I loved my fitbit. I've had it for five months. I got it as a gift, and have lost 40lbs using it. Like I said loved it, until I got a rocking chair. It counts every rock as a step. Also I have a very low heart rate, and while it keeps a pretty accurate account, it doesn't go below 40bpm on the heart chart, which is great for those who don't have my issue. Still, I give it three stars because it does have a good sleep monitor, and accurate heart monitor. The app has helped me a lot with my daily calorie count. The low star rate is for the inaccurate step counter, and the exercise monitor.
 I've had mine less than a month and I didn't buy it from Amazon. I'm not sure whether to give it 3 or 4 stars.<br/>Pros: motivating, easy to use, small, light, the app is easy to use and the little motivation things are cute/fun.<br/>Cons: It feels loose where the actual fitbit connects to the bands. I got the coral, terrible, terrible mistake. It looked pretty for two seconds then it turned awful and I cannot clean it with anything. I don't even know how it got so dirty, it's the worst! Stick to dark colors.<br/><br/>Is it worth the 149 price tag? Not sure. If I scored it for a $100, it would feel more of a right price for it. But, I needed something to help me take charge of my health again, and I figured it was worth the investment.
 In all honesty, I don't know why this product has as many as negative reviews as it does. It does everything it claims to do as long as you wear it correctly, and Fitbit explicitly gives instructions on how to do that. First off, the Fitbit app that this products syncs to is very easy to manage and you can organize the dashboard to your liking. Daily steps are an accurate estimate, give or take. You just need to let Fitbit know which hand is your dominate hand and which wrist you are going to put it on so that it can take those factors into account. It can automatically track when you start an exercise and I noticed that people complained about this part because the Alta HR does not have a start/stop button for exercises like the Charge 2 does, but there's a way to still track your exercise, even if Fitbit fails to do that automatically. Just log in the start/stop times  yourself in the app and label what you did and based on your heart rate during your exercise within those times, it will take that into account and adjust it's overall steps and calories burned. It will also adjust your active minutes for you, which is insightful to know. It's really no big deal to manually put that information in, and at the end of the day, your exercise is still being tracked and it does a great job at it. Burned calories values are accurate too because it takes information based on your weight, height, and heart rate to calculate it and I don't think that most people realize that you are still burning calories even when you are just resting and doing nothing physically exerting. I noticed that in some negative reviews, they were saying how Fitbit is giving them inaccurate caloric values when they just woke up, but in all reality it's correct because our bodies still burn calories even when we go to sleep! Moving on to analyzing your sleep, it works so well. It knows exactly the times I fell asleep and the times I woke up, and I even took note of the times I woke up to make sure that it knows what it's doing. It's always so interesting to see your various sleep stages throughout the night when you're fast asleep and it gives you sleep insights so that you can at least try to attempt to sleep better every night. You can also keep a food log and it's very informational because it gives you feedback on the amounts of macronutrients you are getting in the foods you eat. It strongly advises you to watch your calories and to not go over the limited caloric value that you set up yourself, which is good discipline that I need and I wouldn't be more aware of that if I didn't have this Fitbit to keep track of everything. Next thing it does to help you better yourself is that it lets you keep track of how much water you drink throughout the day and it also has the option of setting a goal of how many ounces of water you want to drink daily. In the app, you can also log your weight throughout your fitness journey and it will show your progress in a really easy-to-read line graph as well as your BMI. Lastly, if you are a woman, it has an amazing Female Health Setting where it will track your period and predict accurately when your monthly cycle will begin and you can log in the details of how you are feeling during it. It's nice that it keeps track of this so that there's no need to download another period app that does the same thing. Battery life claims that it can last 7 days, but it varies from person to person on how much they use it and since this watch is not waterproof  (it's only water resistant), I just charge it whenever I take a shower everyday and I mean, if you do that everyday, then you will never run out of battery while you are using it throughout the day.<br/><br/>Overall, this product works and claims to do the things that it's meant to do. It's not a smartwatch, so don't compare it to that. An added bonus that I did not expect the Fitbit Alta HR to do is vibrate whenever you get a text or a call and it will inform you on the screen who it is and what the message says. It's honestly a really good fitness tracker for those who have fitness goals and wants to keep track of their fitness journey along the way. I don't have problems with mine, I'm a really satisfied customer with Fitbit and what they have to offer. This product does so much in one device and throughout the day, I don't even notice that I have it on just because it's so comfortable to wear and it helps that it's the slimmest fitness tracker that they have. This product is truly not as bad as people make it out to be, you just have to wear it correctly and work around things like editing your own exercise sometimes and charging it when you don't need to wear it on your wrist, and it's a really amazing product!!
 Product’s battery will die within a year. Fitbit was very good in replacing the original purchased, but expect the device to fail again after the year is over. I called Customer Support, transferring to the highest level with the support stating that the warranty only starts from my original purchase, not the date the replacement has been sent. So, in effect I am now a few weeks under 2 years since my original purchase of the device, not the replacement.<br/><br/>Customer support stated that since they have no facility for repairs, their warehouse needs to send out the devices. Since I am out of a year since my original purchase, I can be offered a discount to buy a completely new device, well over the amount of the new Alta (Alta not being an option with only their more expensive models having the discount).
 I bought this for my 13 year old daughter as a birthday present. She loves it! It fits, was super easy for her to set up and link to her I-phone, and she has been tracking her exercise and sleep with positive results. The only downside is now she gets readable texts and alerts of phone activity even when her phone is not on her. This has interrupted our conversations twice already and is a terrible habit for young people to develop. I will likely help her to turn off certain alerts to minimize this effect moving forward. For an adult with an attention span, this is an otherwise very useful feature.
 I bought my Fitbit Alta HR through Amazon March, 2017, so it's about 1.5 years old.  I know, that's out of warranty ( one year ).<br/><br/>Recently, the heart rate monitor froze at 115 BPM and the battery started rapid discharge, lasting about 1 day or a little less.  I called support, they worked me through a "reset" using the button on the charger.  Viola, the heart rate monitor was restored to normal function.  I recharged, and...….<br/><br/>This morning, the battery was again discharged in less than one day.  The support rep. I talked to today said that the reset would not fix the battery discharge issue, the device needs to be replaced.  He offered a 25% discount, or 40% if I upgraded to the newer, more expensive Ionic ( a full on smart watch, more than I need or want ).  Plus free expedited shipping, extra band, etc.  Of course, the discount is from the $150 list price, not the $129.95 actual selling price retail ( Amazon ).  So the actual discount is only about $18.<br/><br/>As I told the representative, I remain disappointed.  Even outside waranty a few months, the battery should not fail like this.  I didn't expect a free replacement ( which would be nice but, hey, out of warranty ).  However, a much larger discount would IMHO be more appropriate.<br/><br/>So do I swallow my distaste and get another Alta HR, which I really like, or start shopping elsewhere?  Two bad choices.  Thanks, Fitbit.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  I went to the link on Fitbit's e-mail for the discounted purchase offer.  The good news is that the list price was down to $129.XX, same as on Amazon.  The bad news was that when I went to order, no expedited shipping as promised.  That was Sunday PM, so I called ( again, again, again ) Fitbit customer service ( location - "Central America" ).  I could hardly hear the rep., it's a long way to Central America and I didn't want to redial and go through menus and wait again so we coped.  No problem per the rep., just go back in, order, and he will go into the completed order and authorize free expedited shipping.  That was fine until I completed the order and it ONLY THEN said backordered, time frame unknown.<br/><br/>Rep. couldn't help further so I talked to a "supervisor" ( location - "Southeast Asia" ).  Since I use an accessory band, not the rubber Fitbit band ( which irritates the heck out of my skin ), she arranged an order for me of the Fitbit Alta HR ignoring the useless small, fuscia colored band and including expedited shipping.  That was Monday morning, I received the new Fitbit Alta HR Tuesday via Fed Ex as promised.<br/><br/>Fitbit's whole process was time consuming and annoying.  Their customer service is out of country with the attendant communication issues, both language ( I would rate understanding as maybe "OK" and that's it ) and connection quality.  Their discount purchase process was flawed, letting me order and pay for an out of stock item ( had to be cancelled by them ) and not including promised expedited shipping.  They were out of stock of Fitbit Alta HR with a large black band even though Amazon is in stock.  Huh?<br/><br/>I truly enjoy the Fitbit Alta HR or I would not have put up with this crap to get another  I just hope this one lasts longer. And that I don't have any more reason to deal with Fitbit customer service.
 I miss my HR. This has a ‘tap screen’ instead of a button and I swear I have to assault the darn thing for the screen to come on.<br/>As for the sleek design- it has a thinner width but it is tall! It probably sticks up half an inch off my wrist. (Plenty of room for a button- wink wink.)<br/>Also I didn’t realize this doesn’t register flights of stairs which I guess is my fault because I didn’t look, but I didn’t think to look. Why would I suspect the new model had less than the old model?<br/>Anyways, it works and it counts steps.
 I ordered the Fitbit Alta HR when it was a deal of the day.  I wish I had ordered sooner because the features help you track and improve your overall health.  Features include heart rate monitor, activity tracker (30 minutes of continuous exercise), your steps, water consumption, sleep length and quality. as well as caloric intake.  The watch band is comfortable.  I have a small wrist and it visits very nice.  It’s easy to read the face of the device and you can customize what you see on the face of the device.<br/><br/>I found it difficult to set up the account and pair the Fitbit to my iPhone X.  It was even difficult after I downloaded the App and followed the instructions step-by-step.  I read suggestions from others that experienced the same thing. I had to click the terms and conditions and acknowledge the terms several times before my phone connected to the device.  I’m also not impressed with the length of the charge of the battery.  I have no idea what the average length of time should be before charging but my charge is about 2.5 days.<br/><br/>Even with these issues, I’d still recommend the device.
 My fitbit Alta HR that I bought at Nordstrom's took a crap after 13 months and their limited warranty is good for 12 months. I wrote to them telling them it was disgruntling that their product doesn't last and that it was a poor, expensive investment that dissapointed me. I have also bought 2 as gifts (Ace and Alta) and the rubber wrist band metal brackets wore out and broke (one was covered under the 12 mo warranty, good experience getting a replacement on this, one was not covered so I ordered a replacement online). Mine was not charging anymore and showing a continuous display of the fitbit logo and all the menus.  They tried troubleshooting it and ultimately said they had never seen such a thing. They said, thanks for the feedback and use our coupon to buy a new one. Never again! It was an expensive $175 for 13 months of use.  I took good care of it, kept it charged, never got it wet, never abused it... They insinuated that I abused it, as they go through rigorous testing prior to sale.  Evidently mine was not their high quality product they stand by.  Here is their response:<br/><br/>We hear your concern about the durability of our trackers.

 I purchased this to replace my Polar watch/chest strap that I'd had for years. I exercise 5-6 days a week and like knowing where my heart rate is throughout each workout. The Fitbit Alta HR will not pick up my heart rate for anything more intense than a brisk walk. I do spin classes a few days a week, run, walk my dog, and also lift a few days. The Alta HR will only pick up my heart rate when I walk my dog at a slower pace and every once in a while when I lift. If you're going to go any harder than a brisk walk, I would look elsewhere. The only thing i'm using this for now, is to monitor sleep and that's just so I don't feel so bad about wasting money on it.
 I purchased the Coral color and only after 1 day of wearing it at my work (I sit at a desk all day) it had dark black marks all around the edges and corners. When I got home I did everything their clean care said and the black wouldn't come off. I called their customer service to request a darker color band be sent and they were extremely helpful! I had to email them pictures and they will be sending me a black band for free. I definitely would not suggest this color if you care about it looking dingy and dirty after only 1 day and it not washing off. Other than that it's great, I'm enjoying it a lot more than my previously owned Charge HR. Would definitely recommend this product and with the black band! The picture is after I cleaned it with rubbing alcohol and used a soft toothbrush per their care instructions.
 I have been a Fitbit owner since 2011 and recently had the One which they don't make any longer.  Since my One was old and I was afraid it might "bite the dust" soon, I took advantage of Amazon's recent Prime Day and purchased the Alta HR that was on sale.  I really like it.  Because I ride a stationary bike and I like to count that as steps sometimes (cheating???), I bought the device that you can insert your Alta into and clip it on your pocket, bra, or just put it in a pocket.  It works great.  I am very happy with my Alta HR and it has an awesome sleep tracker on it.
 As an avid exerciser, this product really fell short for me. It frequently loses my heart rate (won't measure it) during exercise, so I can't get an accurate record of my rate throughout my workout. I have also had tons of problems with it syncing my workouts. It's very frustrating to go for a 45 minute run, and have my fitbit not count the workout. I have gone onto many fitbit help discussions online and it seems that my issues with it are common. You have to tap the screen in order to get things to pop up, but I often end up banging the screen over and over again, because it does not respond to a light touch (this is just more annoying than anything). Bottom line, if you take fitness seriously and are looking for a product to accurately reflect your exercise, look elsewhere. There are some features I enjoy about it, which I why it has three stars: the sleep tracker is a fun feature and the app is very user friendly with a great calorie-tracker.
 I am very happy with my Fitbit. I love the app &amp; have been able to track my weight loss. I love that it prompts me to get up if I haven't been up in a while. I also enjoy logging in my water &amp; food. I tried sleeping with it on, but it's not comfortable for me. However, if you do, its very enlightening to see how much sleep you are actually getting. I don't like wearing bracelets or watches, but I figured if it's for my health, I should give it a try. I might try the Versa next, but that won't happen until I break this one (I might have accidentally given my daughter a bath and it might have gotten immersed in water - but it's still working fine - but I forsee some other mishaps in the future... so... we will see how long it works :).
 I love this fitbit! I measured my wrist at 6.5" using a fabric measuring tape. I bought the small bracelet and it fits perfect. I wear it on the 4th hole from the top so there is plenty of room! I use the Auto heart rate so I feel like the battery drains a little quicker but it charges fast. The sleep tracker is great because it shows the different sleep cycles you enter throughout the night. I'm really glad I decided to upgrade and get this fitbit (I owned and wore the Fitbit One for two years and loved it - most accurate step count in my opinion).
 I have a very unpleasant experience with Fitbit customer service.<br/><br/>I bought my alta about two weeks ago, and using it after few days I found it started incorrectly recording the time it idled on the table as my sleep time. What happened: I usually take it off after returning home and place it on the table, and wear it again about one hour or immediately before go to bed. However it records the time being placed on the table, sometimes as long as 4 hours, as my sleep time. See attached pictures for those incorrect records.<br/><br/>I sought help from customer service. However they at the very beginning said "it's normal." After I insisted they looked into the records, they suggested me to reset the alta and try another day. I did and found the issue persists. At this point I believe my alta is defective since it should not happen with a brand new item. However when I again informed the customer service they taught me how to delete those incorrect records. Why should I learn how to delete those records  with a defective device? After I said I decided to return, they simply replied "our products are not replaced due to inaccuracy issues as stated" and threw a link to me that contains their policy. It is a 12-page document and the customer service gave no hint of where the replace polcy is.<br/><br/>My take:<br/>-Product defect is different from product inaccuracy. I can't believe 5-day incorrect records in one week is simply inaccuracy, not product defect. If it is, why buy such inaccurate product?<br/>- Fitbit's customer service is responsive and polite. However that's it. They don't sincerely help; they see my concern as non-sense and deal with it in a "oh you just another person likes to complain" way.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I will never buy fitbit product again.<br/><br/> update]<br/>One comments said if I or fitbit idle for 3 hours it will recognize as sleep and it's in the FAQ. My response is as follows:<br/><br/>It's unimaginable that for a device that features sleep tracking as one of its main functions, simply idling a few hours can make it "inaccurate" (the term insisted by fitbit, though for me it's nothing but product defect). More interestingly, fitbit even reminds users take off the device from time to time. Does it intentionally hope the users to experience its inaccuracy?<br/><br/>Overall, if such "inaccurate" feature is what fitbit officially recognize, why there's no such explanation under the sleep section in the app? The customer service took time to provide the no replacement policy to me but no single word concerning this "inaccurate" function. Interesting.
 I am a fitness professional that has put on a few pounds in my 40s that I wanted to get off.  I purchased the Alta HR in hopes of getting accurate heart rate, calorie burn and activity data.  About a year ago, I participated in a USDA sponsored scientific study that gave me my (resting)  Basal Metabolic Rate of 1300 cals/day and a solid idea of calorie burn/activity throughout the day by wearing a GPS enabled tracker on my hip for a week.  I know more than most what the numbers should be.<br/><br/>The Alta HR falls short in:<br/>1)  step tracking - I wake up with 300 steps, it records steps when I go over bumps in the car, and it records A LOT (thousands) of steps when I am sedentary at my desk typing!<br/>2)  distance tracking  - I tested this with my phone gps on a short walk.  My phone showed 1.73 miles while the fitbit showed 1.47 miles.  How much error is there over longer distances?  Today I've been at my desk all day and it shows 1.47 miles already.<br/>3) calorie burn - I cannot tell for sure but I surmise this is inaccurate as well since it showed me burning 1600 calories at 5 pm when I sat on my butt working at a desk all day long.  (Updated) On the flipside, I just taught a vigorous 60 minute spin class and recorded no more calories burned then the previous minimally active day<br/>4) heartrate - does not increase to what it should with heavy activity.  I have a good idea of my "active" heartrate as I've used a polar band monitor for many years.  Could not get this to go above 125 bpm and it dropped off completely during fast pedaling in my spin class.<br/><br/>The display only sometimes turns on with a tap and it stings my wrist, like a tiny shock.  I guess I'm not too surprised by any of this as there is no GPS so it's only recording arm movement. The stinginess?  I have an electronic impulse connected to my wrist.<br/><br/>The only thing that seems accurate is the time!  Cannot wait to return this thing.  Imo, it's a fad, a gimmick and a product of the need to know everything culture we have today.
 Form over function. I like the slim design, but it's wildly inaccurate. It logs steps when I'm brushing my hair, petting my dog, and even sleeping (no I'm not a sleepwalker!). The screen is supposed to turn on when you turn your wrist to look at it, but I can sit there and flip my wrist around a dozen times and it'll blink on maybe once. The screen is impossible to see in outdoor sunlight, and the HR is consistently around 10 bpm less than it should be when I'm pushing my max HR, which makes it pretty useless for running HIITs outside. I just wish there were a decent HR fitness watch that was as slim as this one in this price range.
 Granted, the tracker does what it's supposed to do counting steps, etc. However, the bluetooth interface app is the biggest piece of crap I've ever seen. Had I realized there were so, so many problems getting this thing to sync with a phone, I'd have run the other way. See for yourself. Google "Fitbit won't sync" and read the hundreds of people who posted problems. This isn't a new product. There's no reason they can't have got it right by now. FitBit's answer is always the same series of stock steps that, simply put, just don't work. I shouldn't have to reinstall the android app every time I want to sync this little piece of junk. If you just want a pretty little thing that keeps track of your steps, buy a $10 pedometer. You'll save yourself hours of aggravation.
 I have a health condition (tachycardia) which means I have to be careful what I consume (like caffeine) so my heart doesn't beat too fast. This weekend, I'm suffering from a cold. I took some cold syrup that I had purchased before I was diagnosed with the heart condition. I glanced at my Alta HR for the time and thought, "Why is my heart rate 108? I'm just sitting here!" I soon realized it was the cold syrup. Today, I bought some cold medication that doesn't raise your blood pressure or heart rate, and right now I'm sitting here typing, while my heart rate is in a normal range. If I kept on taking that cold syrup, I could be in the hospital right now.
 I was so excited about buying a Fitbit. The only reason why I am giving a 3-star review is because I did like the sleep tracker and the heart rate monitor for my workouts. My disappointment is that the main reason why I bought this watch is so it can sync to MyFitnessPal app. It showed connected but it would never transfer my workouts to MyFitnessPal. The Fitbit Alta HR came with two different color bands . After the first 4 months the first wristband went bad, it kept falling off. Then I switched to the second color wristband. This purchase ended up being a waste of money because in a 7 month period the 2 bands broke with the second one falling off of  my arm without me knowing and now I no longer have the fitness watch. I am in the process of trying to find one of good quality that meets my needs.
 I bought this fitbit in order to better track my sleep, but after having it a bit over a week it still has yet to actually kick in with sleep stages, the part where it tracks REM sleep etc. I looked at the fitbit forums and was frustrated to find a ton of others experiencing the same problem, with fitbit support being a joke. It seems like certain alta HRs just don't work for sleep stages, but fitbit won't acknowledge it.<br/><br/>Additionally, I still haven't gotten the fitbit to accurately track exercise. I don't do cardio, I mainly do weightlifting or HIIT, and the fitbit never auto recognizes that I'm exercising.
 Ten months after purchase it started fogging up on the inside of both the screen and the heart rate monitor. I’ve been extremely careful to keep it out of water and there is no damage to the device, but we had a week of very humid weather and an internal seal must have failed. Fitbit support refuses to honor their warranty because according to them, any sort of moisture damage is not covered regardless of the circumstances. This is the second Fitbit device I’ve had fail on me within a year of purchase and the second time Fitbit has refused to honor their supposed warranty. Never again.
 Bought this for the heart monitor function. But when I compared the Fitbit readings to a reliable heart monitor, the Fitbit readings were completely different. Need accurate heart rate for monitoring of medical condition, not just for fun.  The readings weren’t even close to what the actual heart rate was.  Very disappointed.
 I loved the slim design. Esthetically it was exactly what I wanted. The heart rate monitor and sleep tracker were great. The app is super easy to use. All and all, loved the watch for about two days until it was time to charge it. The watch simply would not charge. I googled it and apparently it’s a super common problem with this watch. I even called customer service to see if I was just an idiot and missing something very basic in my charging technique. Customer service was less than helpful and I ended up simply returning the watch. If the thing would have just charged, I’d have given it 5 stars.
 I had the One, it was awesome.  This is a piece of junk.  I've already exchanged it once thinking the old one was a bad, nope, it's just terrible.  It does a bad job of reading my heart rate, in fact I've never seen it go over 107 even during intense cardio work-outs where my old chest strap would tell me I was in the 145 range.  It does a bad job of syncing up with alarms and will frequently repeat an alarm when it's not set to repeat.  Just stay away.  The Fitbit One was amazing, this thing is a piece of junk.
 Not purchase at Amazon, but felt the product needed a review to assist folks with same issues. Purchased for a person with a low pulse rate. ( below 50)Totally inaccurate for heart rate and sleep information.Not accurate either for a person with a heart rate of 52 but closer than one with really low pulse..  Help desk unable to figure it out either. Would only recommend this for persons younger and with a heart rate in the more usual range of 60-72 who only needed a "rough estimate" of their heart rate.
 Paid extra $50 for the special edition pink rose, because it is my wife's favorite color.  Functions fine, but color is blotched/discolored after a few weeks of wear.  It does not clean off.  Will return to replace as many times as needed to realize a fix to the defective band.<br/><br/>Update:  I convinced my wife that the special edition watch was defective and we decided to return it to Amazon, and then discovered we were beyond the return period (late Christmas gift opening).<br/>The comment from Fitbit attached to this review is to follow their cleaning instructions.  Fail.  The band does not come clean.<br/><br/>Downgrading to one star after trying to resolve the warranty issue with Fitbit customer support.  I requested they replace the defective watch for a new one in a standard color scheme (acceptable to my wife and we would only be out the "special" fifty bucks).  No go. They have taken a hard line that the watch is not defective, and they will only replace the band, with the same color or another color that is in-stock.  The defective pink band has not been fixed, and their recommendation is that you don't wear dark clothing when wearing this band.<br/>So, after going around in circles on the subject, the only thing they would agree to is sending two replacement bands- the original matching color, and another color that doesn't match, that can be worn at all times when she chooses to wear something dark.  Apparently, it is not the watch that is defective, it is the clothes that people choose to wear, with it.  I reminded them that there was no such disclosure when I bought the watch, and it is just plain ridiculous for a fitness watch.<br/>This was the fourth Fitbit HR I have purchased for myself and as gifts.  It will likely be the last.<br/>Hopefully, my wife won't get tazed via the Fitbit app, because of this review...
 I purchased my fitbit on August 18, 2018. I enjoyed it and liked the sleep feature that describes sleep patterns. But on October 24th it fell off my wrist! I connected the band and put it back on my wrist only to have it fall off again. The band can not secure itself to the main part of the fitbit. I am soooo disappointed in this fitbit construction! Very cheaply made. So if you are thinking you'd like a device that lasts longer than 2 and a half months, I would skip purchasing this fitbit. Donna Smith
 I wish I could give it ZERO stars! Trust me DO NOT BUY a FITBIT product! After being a faithful customer of FITBIT for years, owing a few devices, my recent Alta purchase was a nightmare! From the beginning it was on backorder, when I finally got it the battery was never working right.  I called and had it "replaced" and received a peeble, after trying to pair that it didn't work! Literally hours on the phone, live chat and trying to fix it, I just wanted my money back and they refused "policy is after 45 days of purchase only a replacement" ummm, it didn't even arrive in the mail well past 45 days! I asked for a supervisor, same lame story, not the customer service reps fault, it's a higher up issue with FitBit and not caring about their customers.  SO Sad, I refuse to do business with them and now have this broken device sitting in my room, who has money like that to waste?? AWFUL!
 I am glad to see they changed the band style as I got the one that had the push button to hold the band together.  It got lost.  This looks like a better design and I wish I'd know they had changed it before I ordered another style.  But in all fairness to the company, they did work with me as I told them it was a design flaw and provided me options.  I did like the first alta I got but I have a Charge 2 now and I like it as well, it is just a little bigger than the alta.  I would recommend either one, I just gave it a lower rating due to the initial design of my alta so I would not recommend getting the push button style if you happen to come across one.
 The Fitbit is great, but the fact that you can’t program this for anyone under the age of 13 is ridiculous. There is a kids Fitbit that is the only one that can be programmed for someone under the age of 13. My daughter is 12 and we couldn’t program this for her.
 It measures heart rate well, but I've found the sleep tracking to be either wildly inaccurate, or not working at all. During some nights, it will show sleep data, but that sleep data is super inaccurate. During other nights, it shows no sleep activity at all, as though I didn't sleep.
 I bought my Fitbit Alta HR from Best Buy in order to get the Geek Squad warranty, even though I'm an Amazon Prime Member.  I like Fitbit, but I've found them to be fragile and temperamental with occasionally flaky batteries.  I've never had one that lasted out its warranty.  I'm returning the Alta for an older Charge HR for the following reasons:  1.) The "tap me to open me" on the Alta to get to the functions is cumbersome and hard to do when you're moving-the old side button is much better, for me anyway.  2.)  Having a great deal of trouble syncing the Alta, as opposed to an older Charge and Charge HR.  3.)  The lighter, miniaturized design comes with a price-the display is tiny and shows less information, and as I mentioned you have to tap through the information-not ideal.  There is nothing wrong with the Alta-it's just harder for me to use.  The tap to open, small screen, lack of stair climbing information and difficulty syncing (iPhone and Mac) overcome any advantage I get from having the Alta be smaller and sleeker.  So, for me, the Alta is not a leap forward, but a step back-as best I can tell it does nothing better than the older model Charge HR, and some things not as well.
 I've had my Fitbit for one day.  It's pretty cool! I really like the sleep tracker function.  I did find it humorous that after getting off the lawnmower​, my Fitbit app congratulated my for riding my bike for 45 minutes... I don't like how the Fitbit doesn't make any sounds!! Not even a simple ding!! Nada!  It slightly vibrates to notify you of things.  Sometimes I don't even notice it vibrating!  Also, a major bummer is that you can't get it wet.  One more thing... It would be much nicer if I could read the entirety of my incoming text messages on the watch and not just the first 40 characters.
 The functionality of the software is great, but this product has one MAJOR and basic flaw. If you are someone who plans to track your exercise outdoors, this product WILL NOT WORK for you. You cannot see the screen when outdoors during the day. When I contacted the company, they wanted me to leave feedback on their own board. I was a little irritated with this since I already had to take time from my schedule to contact them. Their representative should be responsible for passing along the feedback, not the customer. And let's not forget, if the product had been tested properly, to begin with, they would already know you cannot see the screen outdoors during the day. How can they get away with advertising this product for outdoors use during daylight hours? This is NOT okay.
 This review is on December 28th, only after 2 days of use. The coral band is absolutely subject to staining and is a huge design flaw. I have already contacted Fit Bit and they are sending my wife 2 free replacement bands in darker colors. The Fit Bit Alta HR is a great product just please don’t order the Coral Band. I ignored previous bad reviews on it and should have listened. That is just normal everyday wear after 2 days. See pics for better detail.
 I bought 2 of these (one was a gift and still unopened). Mine the more expensive black/gunmetal Alta HR has not been retaining charge. I received it on Friday and charged it fully before using then on Saturday around lunch the battery was medium and by the afternoon I had to charge it because it said the battery was low. On Sunday, I waited to see how long it would last and by the evening the battery was once again low and I charged it yet again. This morning I synced my Fitbit to see the battery at medium and have put it to charge while I shower. Within 15 minutes, the app was saying that the battery is full. I did extensive research before buying my Alta HR and this very poor battery performance seems inconsistent.<br/><br/>Update Tuesday- maintaining charge isn't the only problem, the sleep tracking is not very useful as on Sunday, I managed to have a conversation with friends then walk my dogs all while in the midst of REM sleep. Activity tracker is also not  very accurate as it only records a fraction of my active minutes even while it records my heart rate at 121. I hope I just got a defective tracker but after the disappointment of what had the potential to be a great device, I think I will return both trackers... I didn't bother giving the second one as a gift after being disappointed with mine.
 The Fitbit Alta HR is a type of smart watch that can keep records of distance walked, exercise time, heartbeat, sleep patterns, time and date, calories burned, daily goals, and more. The ideal user for this product is an athlete, somebody who likes to workout, or even just somebody that wants to keep track of their daily steps and sleep patterns. I evaluated the product in the areas of durability, comfortability, battery life, band size, the app, and features.<br/><br/>First off the durability of the product is great, even if you’re not the most careful about not hitting your wrist (or the Fitbit) on objects around you and so far my Fitbit hasn’t had any problems with the harsh treatment. However, I do have a couple minor scratches on the screen that aren’t ideal, but it doesn’t hinder the products functioning. If anything I would maybe change it so that the Fitbit would come with screen protectors. Also I have gotten it a little wet before while washing my hands and it hasn’t had any problems or damage from that, so you don't need to worry about damaging it from it being exposed to a little moisture.<br/><br/>Secondly, we have the comfortability of the Fitbit, since I have had the product I have slept in it every single night and it never hindered my ability to sleep and doesn’t bother me in the slightest to have it on my wrist all day long. As I stated previously, I wear my Fitbit day and night and barely ever take it off. The only time I do take it off is to shower or to charge it. You only have to charge it a couple times a week and I haven’t actually had it die on me before. Even if you have a really small wrist the Fitbit band is adjustable so it won’t be too tight or slide around a lot. I got the small band and the third notch works perfectly for me and although it slides around some it’s not too bad and makes it more comfortable in the fact that it doesn’t stick or dig in to my wrist too much.<br/><br/>The Fitbit app for the iPhone is also very useful so that you can view all the information from the day/night and it keeps the information so you can look back to see previous statistics. You can view statistics on your resting heartbeat, sleep patterns, steps, and exercise, hourly activity, weight, calories lost, daily goals, and you can also input your calorie intake. The Fitbit app has features that allows you to track which wrist your Fitbit is on, and to change what statistics you want to be able to view on your Fitbit screen. In all, I think the Fitbit is a great, high-quality product that has a variety of features and is very user friendly. I especially like the Fitbit Alta HR because of the smaller size of the screen and band and because it can track your sleep. Therefore I would highly recommend the Fitbit Alta HR to anyone that is considering getting a Fitbit.
 I liked the functionality of the watch and the ease with which one could set up the app, get a report of daily and weekly stats and consistently monitor how one is doing in achieving daily and longer term fitness goals.  I was very disappointed with the fact that I have to replace the band on a relatively expensive piece of equipment.  If the outlay is $100 plus, if I can't depend on the value or have to consider replacing a portion of it after such a short period of time, I should just invest in a smart watch that has significantly more functionality.
 BMI and body gat % totally wrong. I am an extrmely good shape after bulking up in the winter, weighed 217. now I'm down to 189... and my BF % says I I've only gone done #%---the funnieST part, it believes I had 23.5% body fat when I was 217. now 28 lbs lighter, shredded with a visible protruding 6 back, I'm apparently 18.9% BF or something.<br/><br/>I've had caliper BF measurements done before where they pinch different areas of fat on your body--triceps, back fat, thigh etc. and when I was 195lbs, and less lean than I am now, I was 10.4% BF. Now, 5 lbs lighter, but stronger and more cut it says 18.5%. what a joke!!<br/><br/>Great concept, terrible readings besides weight and the feat for tracking and synching with your Fitbit app/device is cool. but the data is off so still, kind of worthless. i guess logging my weight every day accurately is also a plus.
 The  Fitbit alta HR quit working after 4 months. It would not sync. I tried without success to troubleshoot from the website without success.  I contacted fitbit and they tried  troubleshooting  without success. After 1 1/2 hours they said they were sending another fitbit.  I received the 2nd fitbit and again followed directions to sycn without success. Again I called the company and spent 1 1/2 hours with fitbit trying to sync this new device without success. I asked for a refund but they said it had to be within 45 days.  Now their sending a 3rd fitbit! I'm not sure about any other fitbit products but this one is not reliable.<br/><br/>.
 Stopped working after 14 months...FITBIT offered no help ...attitude was sorry, but you are 56 days out of warranty. Our family will NOT buy anymore FITBIT products. Just google them and see how many people have problems with the company, customer ser ice and the short lifetime of the product.
 NEVER EVER BUY A FITBIT!! My father in law, who is in his 70's, received a Fitbit ChargeHR watch as a gift. He is mostly an inactive guy who takes leisurely walks. His Fitbit broke within the time of the warranty,  it just snapped in half as if it was held together by super glue. Unfortunately I was unaware that it had broken until 5 months past the warranty. He is forgetful so he just did not tell me until then. When I called in FitBit customer service identified that it was inactive within the warranty but since I had called in 5 months after warranty they refused to replace the product. Even though they knew and acknowledged the watch had been inactive within the 1 year warranty time frame!!! This is not my first problem with Fitbit. I have owned a few of their products and they always crap out 2-5 months after warranty. Their customer service is as useless as their products. I highly recommend you DO NOT BUY A FITBIT.
 I purchased this product for my father with the intention of improving his health.  After using it for only a few months, the wristband broke.  It became detached from the face of the watch and was unwearable.  After spending a long time dealing with customer service, he received a replacement.  However, after using this new fitbit after a few months, the band has become detached from the watch again.  I contacted customer service, and the response was that they only guarantee the replacement product for 30 days.  30 days!  This shows the level of quality of their products!  I'm so embarrassed I got this as a gift for my father!  Take positive reviews with a grain of salt, but know that negative reviews are truly from users.  Beware!
 I love the simplicity of the Alta HR. I went from the original Charge HR to this because I wanted something smaller, classier and honestly, a more timeless band color (my Charge was purple and you couldn't change the band 😔). I was super thrilled with my purchase and loved the way it fit on my wrist and looked as well. But after a few days of wear, I'm not thrilled by how it works.<br/><br/>First of all, I realized it did not have a button on it like my Charge did. I figured "thats fine, it isn't necessary" but to me, that button totally is. I workout from home, sometimes it's cardio other times it's weight training. These workouts range from 15min up to an hour. Even with the auto-sense setting set to 10min.... It has yet to sense a single one of my workouts. And I don't have time or the patience to go into the app to remember to add my workouts. This band should do it for me. And to be honest, I hate that I can't automatically track it from my band because the auto sense doesn't seem to work very well.<br/><br/>With that being said, it did track me folding laundry as a "sport" because it elevated my heart rate for a solid 20 minutes 😒<br/><br/>But due to the lack of the button and being able to start and stop tracking my workouts on the wristband itself, I believe that I will be returning this band and exchanging it for the Charge2.<br/><br/>Though the simplicity and smaller design of the AltaHR is wonderful, it is not designed for those who would like it to track different kinds of workouts, such as weight training or quick cardio/core workouts. For runners, joggers, or avid gym cardio goers, I assume this will work wonderfully for those of you who track 30+ minutes of cardio/HIIT at a time.<br/><br/>I wish I loved this band enough to keep it, but sadly I do not.
 I have had three fitbits and the batteries give out after a year.  One was 4 days after the warranty wore off.  The company does not honor a day after the warranty.  They will give you a small discount if you update your faulty fitbit for a more expensive fitbit.  I fell for this once and then that one also stopped holding a charge 30 days after the one year warranty expired.<br/><br/>DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY if you want it to work after the one year warranty.  Or buy it and invest in some type of additional coverage.<br/><br/>Fitbit has serious Battery Issues!!!!
 Bought an Fit bit alta HR in Rose Gold edition for my girlfriend and after one week of use the band was awful, it was starting to change the color, i think because of the cheap material they use.<br/>The screen needs a 2, 3 or 4 taps in order to turn on and is not very accurate.<br/>I'm very dissapointed of this product i will buy an iwatch instead.
 Wow. Extremely disappointed. Had the Charge 2 for a while, and was really looking forward to the Alta HR as a sleeker option - I rely a lot on my Fitbit. Clearly, I should have stuck with my charge. If your workout routine is anything other than running, walking, or hiking, the functionality of this Fitbit significantly decreases. None of my strength training was auto detected, nor was any of my time on the stair master. In addition, the tracker wasn't even tracking my heart rate for the majority of my workout. I now need to use a heart rate monitor while exercising so that I can manually plug in my exercise stats - what a WASTE! I spent more money (bought the special edition) to have to use two devices to do the job of one.  Will likely switch back or abandon Fitbit altogether - very disappointing.
 It's good as a watch.  That's pretty much it.  The sleep tracking, which was the most important feature to me, is based on heart rate.  The app showed deep sleep at a stretch of time during which I was wide awake.  This happens frequently.  The heart rate monitor doesn't match with a blood pressure monitor reading.  Distance measures are a rough - very rough -  estimate based on estimated step length.  Using Google maps is more accurate.  All in all, it's a watch.  It gives some very rough information about activity levels, but not much more.
 I really liked this for the first 2 months I had it... until I realized it was ridiculously over-counting my steps. After spending an entire day with a friend, we realized that my Alta HR had counted about 13k steps while my friend's tracker only had about 7k. I started doing tests and looking closely at the breakdown in steps over the course of the day. The results of my observations showed how useless this device is as a step tracker. It was continuing to count steps every time I sat down, whether it was on the couch to watch TV or at the computer. I was getting about 400 steps every time I sat down and ate a meal! Eating was apparently getting me 1200 steps a day.<br/><br/>It gets two stars instead of one star because it does appear to be accurate on the heart rate measurements and it tracks sleep. However, without a way to test and verify the effectiveness of the sleep tracker, I have no idea if it's actually accurate.
 I received mine as a gift purchased from Amazon by my wife.  It did everything advertised well for me.  The only possible glitch I found was although it did a really good job of recognizing when I was on a bicycle workout, it would still log steps for the same time period.  Not sure if that is intentional on Fitbit’s part.  I also found the wristband a bit sticky when fastening it on and trying to thread through the band loop.<br/>It took a good while to isolate, but I was disappointed to find that it was the source of the rashes I experiencing.
 So happy that I got the Amazon Prime Day deal! The sleep tracking log fails initially if you wake up and go back to sleep but it eventually logs it. So happy to use the HR as I need it for health reasons as well.
 I have used a fitbit for several years. I've gone through 2 fitbits because the side edges pull away from the charging port. I'm really glad the alta does not have the same design. So far so good and has all the same qualities that I love about fitbit. No issues with syncing or use.
 Great product for tracking steps, workouts, and sleep, but unreliable band. It fell off when I was standing at work, and then again when I was out and about so now its gone! Not a common problem..I know a lot of people that have older fitbits without this issue, but a friend of mine said that hers fell off as well so I would beware in buying! Fitbit customer support was terrible and did not care about the faulty band or that it fell off. All they would say to me was "the band is designed to stay on the wrist". All they care about is money. I would spend your money on a different brand for sure!
 Keeps me moving. Wanting to beat the stats from day before
 Don't buy a FitBit. Mine cracked in a little over 3 months, and it's apparently not covered under warranty. They want me to get a new one for 25% off, but why on Earth would I throw good money after bad knowing it may happen again and there's nothing they or I could do about it. My Garmin lasted 3 years, I just wanted something new. Beware, they apparently crack easily, I don't even know how it happened. Customer service will do nothing to back up their product, even after talking to a supervisor.
 Well at around 9 moths everything starts to fall apart.<br/>Not very heavy duty less so that touch screen smart watches.<br/>I may give them 1 more try i do like there ap<br/>Less than 1 year band failed clasp and where locks int body.<br/>Screen is easily scratched also body.
 I bought an Alta hr to replace my two year old charge hr. While it is sleeker, the screen is useless and doesn't respond to my touch, taps or slaps and the alarm is so subtle I just got in trouble at work for not feeling it go off.<br/><br/>After two years of wearing a Fitbit, I'm incredibly disappointed with this "upgrade" and will be returning it.
 As much as I love the tracker and the color<br/>Turns out there’s a problem with the light pink: it absorbs black color from your clothing and gets dirty very easily<br/>I’ve had it for three days and can’t get it clean :(<br/>I’m obsessed with the color and had I known I never would’ve worn it with my black jacket
 I’ve had this product about 2 weeks and I am thrilled with it so far. Only weaknesses - batter isn’t quite 7 days, more like 6, but this is likely just because of how I use the product (notifications, continual HR monitoring, etc.) I just charge it when I’m in the shower and I never have problems with low battery. The second weakness is that the HR monitor isn’t 100% consistent. There will be sometimes on a jog that I will check for a reading, and it sill not be able to give me one. This happens rarely, but it does happen. Overall, I would highly recommend this device.
 Great features, very compact. But the device only lasted just over a year! Contacted support and they walked me through some test (it wouldnt hold a charge after disconnecting from charger) only to tell me that it was not repairable. They offered me a discount on a new one, but I can't see spending over a hundred dollars for a tracker that lasts only a year. I am very disappointed. I will be looking at other tracker brands.
 I love my Alta.  Have had it for about year, which from previous experience with fitbits; is about how long they seem to last ! It's still going strong.<br/>I have had issues syncing once or twice; but it eventually syncs after I reboot it.  I do love my Alta, it seems to keep accurate count of my steps; and I would recommend it.
 I liked the sleep tracking and the all day heart monitoring. I just wish that I didn't break so soon. I talked with Edwin G from support for an hour but because it was after my one year warranty period, Fitbit was unwilling to replace my broken device. With so many alternatives on the market I think I'll just try another brand next instead of buying fitbit again.<br/><br/>All they had to do was give me a discount on the broken piece (the band) and I would have gotten a second year of use out of the fitbit and likely upgraded to the next model. I don't think I should have to buy a new watch every year become of product durability issues.
 I like the features and the size of the alta hr.  The most of my activity is done outdoors hiking, walking and living on a farm so would really love to be able to read the screen in the sunlight.  Why has fit bit who has known of this problem for well over two years not been able to come up with a fix??  In today's technology that should be something that certainly should have been addressed.
 This is bullcrap. The fitbit died after about a month and 1\2 and the company says I can not return it after March 16th. I bought it just at the end of Feb. and it died a week ago. There has been alot of trouble with these particular fitbits and I want another one without the bloodpressure reading which seems to be the problem or my money back. It was not cheap.
 Upgraded from the Flex 2 because I needed a heart rate tracker. I'd highly recommend Fitbit and this is my favorite tracker yet!
 My wrist measures 6 5/8 inches. I bought a large. On my wrist, I wear it on the 3rd from smallest hole. I get easily irritated by things on my wrists though, so the large will also fit on my ankle when my wrist needs a break. Works well in either position.  I really like the more detailed sleep stages available with this product. Had a small issue with not syncing a few days after I started out, but it was easily resolved by searching the help section on the app.
 Mine does fine recording walks, but doesn't seem to recognized workouts on stationary equipment at all. Yesterday I did 20 minutes on an eliptical, 20 minutes on a stationary bike, and 10 minutes with weights and got zero credit for "Active Minutes" and a very low calorie burn, today I did half an hour of light houework and got 29 minutes. I was amused a few days ago when it gave me credit for a bike ride when I was in fact on a motorized scooter, hardly moving at all.
 I love my Fitbit!! I had one of the first Fitbit models to come out and never really liked it. During prime day I bought this one (Alta HR) and I’m in love! There are so many amazing features and it’s very user friendly (once you download the Fitbit app).<br/>It tracks steps, cardio, resting and active heart rate, how much I sleep, the quality of sleep and what it means, it can set reminders for when to sleep, eat, drink water, be active... and for women it tracks our cycles.<br/>I feel very in tune with my body and it’s nice to keep track.
 Hugh waste of money. Terribly inaccurate. I walked 2 miles on treadmill and it registered nothing because i held onto rails and apparently it measures the movement of your arms... so i put it on my ankle and walked a measured distance... this time it was reasonably close... the other accuracy issue is that it consistently racks up thousands of steps while I’m driving  and claims i take several naps a day...<br/><br/>If youre looking for an accurate measure you’ve got the wrong product... (yes, i called the company to make sure it was set up correctly).<br/> Garbage
 I love the surface does not scratch up easily and the band is very comfortable.  The app is easy to use, I have a small wrist, the small size fit perfect.
 Have been too busy to adequately learn how to us it, Hope to remedy that soon! I have limited vision.
 I have had my Fitbit Alta HR for three days now. Each time the Fitbit Alta HR leaves two black marks on each side of my wrist from the dye coming off. For a product that is advertised as "sweat and splash proof" the dye shouldn't come off just from wearing while at work. I have had two other Fitbits (one purchased and one a replacement) and both have had the bands tear and rip within one year. I am amazed how a product that is over $150 with tax can be made with such low quality.<br/><br/>After seeing the quality of the Fitibt I don't think I would recommend them to anyone. If someone is going to buy one make sure you put in for a replacement before the one year warranty is up as you Fitbit will break in some way within a year.
 I bought this at Best Buy for the same price. Initially, I really liked it, it did everything I wanted. I’ve had some issues up to today (bought about a week ago) with getting it to wake when I tap it, but that is rare. Today, I was on a stationary bike and was checking my heart rate on the bike. At one point, the bike was telling me 152 bpm, then I decided to check my Fitbit Alta and it was registering at 117 bpm. I am 99% certain the bike was correct and the Fitbit was way off.<br/><br/>Long story short, I will be returning this and looking for another way to monitor my heart rate.
 I had the old Flex and I was way overdue for an upgrade.  It works great, holds a charge and I am super glad that I made this purchase.  I also bought a replacement wristband that dresses it up like a silver watch and I have never been more pleased with two purchases! Love my Fitbit Alta and all that it does!
 Hard to get it out of the mailbox. Package is too large for Fitbit. Someone needs to review the packaging for the shipping box.<br/>Fitbit was best price from anyone. Arrived quick and inspite of no air bag in the box it appears to be ok.<br/>Great item especially for price.
 I purchased an Alta HR in January and have worn it every day since.  It almost never tracks my activity minutes, and despite the fact that I reset it (as recommended by Fitbit), it works only sporadically.  I’ve owned several different Fitbit models, and every one of them has had some kind of problem from flimsy bands to terrible batteries.  I keep hoping that the next iteration will be an improvement, but there never seems to be a perfect Fitbit (circle the slow learner in this picture).  I’m giving up and buying an Apple Watch.  At least if I have a problem, I might get help at the Apple store.
 Walking around the Alta HR seemed great, and sleep tracking was nice. When it came to working out, however, the heart rate would always be way off or stop reading altogether and just show dashes. I tried all the troubleshooting steps I could find from FitBit and forums - restarting, readjusting the strap, moving up and down my wrist, wiping sweat away, etc, and the problem persisted for every workout, defeating the purpose I bought it for.<br/><br/>I returned the Alta HR and bought a Versa, which works great and has loads more features!
 I have owned two fitbit altas  The first one ceased to function after just over a year of use.  The second died in less than 6 months out of nowhere while I was wearing it, and I did not mistreat it in any way.  I like the style and the functionality of the device, but the reliability is not there.  The company is honoring the warranty and sending me a new one.  To be honest, if I had to pay for another such device, I would look at other brands given my experience.
 Just received my Fitbit Alta HR in Rose Gold. Used to have one a few years ago, loved it but accidentally lost it. Glad to finally have another, and I'm glad I sprung for the Rose Gold.
 I purchased the Fitbit Alta HR on Prime Day 2018. I love its functionality and the ease of the app. Through the app I track my sleep, daily activity, hourly activity at work, and water intake. My only complaint is that it only stays charged for 3-4 days resulting in missed steps or sleep tracking. I would understand the reduced battery life if I owned the product for a long time, but it has not even been a month. If you are looking to become healthier, enjoy setting goals and achieving them then this will be helpful.
 I got this in May 2017 as a request for my birthday as my first tracker. I really like it. Tracking my activity (working out), HR, sleep patterns, steps, etc. I have 6.5 in wrist at smallest point (above wrist bone). I was concerned the small would be too small but it is fine and I have plenty of slots to use.<br/>My only concern is I’m right handed and worn it on my right wrist for 5 mo - which you can configure in the app. I’m concerned right hand movement (like putting on make up, filing nails, etc) falsely counts these movements as steps. So I have moved it to my left arm though I still wear a watch out of the house. I’ll have to check Fitbit site if there are suggestions.
 Not very accurate in tracking steps. Sleep activity is sometimes off by a couple of hours - could be the way it’s fitting my wrist as I sleep. Heart rate is pretty accurate when compared to a finger heart rate monitor.
 This was a gift for my wife. I was choosing between iwatch and this, but after looking a lot of review I bought fitbit. Its slim and fitness oriented solution. But If you want iwatch on your wrist than there is nothing to explain.<br/><br/>The only thing I would suggest Fitbit to implement is a way to find a phone through the tracker. Almost every tracker has it now, and its beggining to be a must have feature.
 Disappointed - the band keeps falling off. It appears this is a big problem w Fitbit and they keep selling them without warning anybody
 I was expecting this to be basically the same as the Charge II, just a smaller, sleeker design, but it seems like there are significantly less features and the clock faces are harder to read.. I still wear it to work (RN) but I still use my charge II for working out
 I have a small wrist and the full size Fitbit would have been too big, this smaller size is perfect  for me.
 It was supper inaccurate with the heart rate it would never work . I tryed every trick in the book and even called fit bit exchange it for a different one and the heart rate still wasn’t working . But the sleep feature is cool
 Love it. I've had an apple watch for a year now and had previously owned a Fitbit HR. This is based on fitness but gives you reminders and texts like you'd get from an apple watch. I love this way more than my apple watch.
 This is my third fitbit. Started with the Charge then upgraded to the Alta. I gave it to my granddaughter but missed it so purchased the Alta HR. Nice fit and like the new band with the buckle. Also like the idea that you can change the band. Purchased different colors for a new look.
 Absolutely love it. Owned the regular Alta prior to this. The HR function adds great insight not only to your workouts, but also sleep patterns (REM, light, deep) and heart rate throughout day. The Alta HR in general stul has same great functions as other Fitbits (step count, calories, syncs perfectly with iPhone....). A+++
 Has all the info I want on daily basis and easy to scroll through data points. Upgrade for me from the Fitbit Flex and am enjoying the extra features.  For me, the reliability of this brand is worth the price compared to the unknowns
 I love this so much. It has really helped me stay on top of my workout and my sleep patterns.<br/>I love it so much when I am not wearing it it makes me sad, I literally can’t sleep without it.<br/>I check every morning how well I slept. And I love how it automatically tracts my workouts. I has helped me loose weight.<br/>Which to the gold band
 Super bummed about this - was really wanting to love it - the design, color, fit were all awesome - but now I have experienced several situations where the Fitbit was collecting my steps and then - they vanished! two times in the past week - yesterday I was at 20K steps - and this morning I synced and it told me I had 2,000 yesterday - and after a 7 mile hike I sure wanted credit! then another day I had about 10K and when I looked at the Fitbit later in the day - it reset me back to 1,000.too frustrating to keep it.
 My doctor advised walking 3 miles a day and the Fitbit is a huge plus. Works great but better with bling band purchased separately. The black band is uncomfortable and my wrist got sweaty
 This is my second Fitbit Alta hr. I bought mine at target. My first one was defected. I call Fitbit customer service about it they told me they would monitor the problem and I would hear back from IT in 48 to 72 hours well that was a month ago. I return it to target and got another one at first it worked great but only records walks into activities tracker. I do spin,barre, and elliptical none which it will record into my activities like it's suppose too. Like the first one I had it has stopped recording my heart rate mid work out. I have a polar watch and wish I got the newer one instead of the Fitbit but it doesn't sync with WW app.
 The Heart Rate (the reason I purchased this) is inaccurate and much lower than measured against an accurate chest strap when really working out. Disappointed.
 I thought this Alta hr was pretty neat, but twice now when the battery died my account resets to a new account, it shows my account but email verification required to set up, lets me do nothing will not connect Bluetooth and it will not send me a new email. I have to setup a whole new account each time. And the spam emails they send once you do setup is to much. I don’t mind 1 or 2 a week but it seems like everyday. Their only support online is via social media, I don’t have any social media accounts nor do I want to open more new accounts to get anwsers
 Love it. Easy to use with instant feedback.Got me back into the exercise routine.
 had this watch since july, gave to my sister middle of august as a gift. she was thrilled and really loved it, now it no longer charges for some reason. she called fitbit they told her to get a adapter to charge it i don't understand why she has to do that, until the company solves this problem i am not giving a good review
 I have many models of Fitbit before and was thinking of buying this one. After reading lots of forums on this Fitbit, I realized that it has no "Start" or "Stop" button for a exercise like a timed run event. This important information is lacking on the Fitbit web site and its specs etc. So if you are like me who want know exactly what  is the elapsed Time, Average  and Maximum Heart Rates during say a 5k, 10k, 20k run, you are out of luck.
 Don't waste your time with buying a Fitbit device. Previously their customer service was one to be rivaled, and now they won't support or replace defective items even after going through all the proper channels. If I'm spending a couple hundred dollars per unit I would expect a little assistance, but that is no longer the case with their customer support. There are many great Garmin options out there with more bells and whistles at a fraction of the price.
 They "closed" my account on me, and when I call they "are working on it" for weeks = nothing happening.  Can't do anything - even set the time.  Fitbit support just says - we are working on it ---- but they aren't.<br/>{Fitbit can check case number 28015059 12/24/18 to verify this complaint!}
 I had my flex for almost 3 years and wanted to get one that measured heartbeat. This one is great! Glad to have gotten it on prime day and I really like it!! It's been great!!
 So far so good! I'd like to do a thorough review once I've had the product longer than a week but I'm enjoying the HR function. This feels lighter to wear than I expected. I wish it was more water proof--the only downside. I like the hourly reminders to move!
 I was rocking in my chair with an injured back for a day, and didn't move from it. Every rock registered as a step. 14,000 steps without moving? Man, this product sucks. Way, way more trouble than it's worth.
 Great device for motivation in fitness. Helps to keep track of steps, and heart rate. Using the app makes it more useful. Compared to other heart rate monitors and the it is same as higher priced devices.
 I don't know if my fitbit band had a manufacturing defect but the band had to be replaced after 6 months--I thought it would last at least a year. Other than that, it's your usual fitbit tracker. I really appreciate the sleep stages tracking that comes with this (and all fitbits with HR tracking capability).
 As other reviews have pointed out, FitBit does a poor job of tracking steps. Step counts include your driving so it inflats your step counts. I have another trackers (cheap ones $20-$30) which have same problems so I bought FitBit assuming it will not have the same issue. Why will one pay extra for the same problem?
 So far I'm happy with the Alta HR. I previously had the Alta (non HR) and lost it because the strap just had an button to keep it closed. I like that the strap on the HR is more secure. The strap connection to the tracker feels looser than the Alta did.<br/> Overall I'm happy with the Alta HR.
 I specifically bought a new phone and a new Fitbit Alta to work together.  You would think by 6 months FITBIT would have gotten their stuff together and fixed this problem by now considering Apple and Samsng are THE most popular phones sold.  Very unhappy I am unable to get messages on my phone!!!  I will be not be purchasing another FITBIT product as they cannot keep their programming up to date.
 Bought this as a gift for my dad and he loves it! Just a small note, though, is that I got the blue/gray band color and it actually looks lavender in person so my dad ended up getting the black band instead.
 Over the course of a year, I had the band replaced at least 5 times. They were covered under warranty.  All bands tore in the exact same spot, their warranty department would not listen, as I think the unit was to blame after this repetitive problem.  Just sending a replacement band was their easy solution, but not the resolving the source of the problem or looking at the unit.  I do not recommend Fitbit.  Also, read this issue on their forum, I'm not the only one. I wish I read them before buying.
 I love my new Alta HR! The band is comfortable and easy to put on. The app walks you through every step. The charger style is easy to use and it’s made to last. I enjoy being able to check my pulse periodically when exercising. I’m considering them as gifts for family. I use it with my fitbit scale for overall health and weight management.
 I liked everything about this, although I returned it within a day due to the display not being on longer than 2-3 seconds. I was expecting the clock face to appear longer since I need to count the seconds for my job (counting heart rate), though it can't be done with no option to keep the display lit longer. Very disappointed otherwise.
 Apparently the Fitbit Alta HR does not have the feature to track weight training, despite it's predecessors and similar fitbit models including the feature. Everything else is great but not tracking weight training is disappointing as it's a major part of my exercise routine. Don't know why fitbit would've removed that..
 The Fitbit product itself is great, but the Coral band is horrible. Whatever the band is made out of, picks up any color that may come from your clothing. Even clothing that doesn't normally bleed, like Polyester! The color transfer does not come off, even after following the cleaning instructions from the Fitbit website and using rubbing alcohol. This color may work for you if you never wear long sleeves, or rub the band on anything. If I were reviewing the band itself, it would definitely be 1 star.<br/><br/>It's so disappointing because the Coral band is so pretty, but I would not recommend.
 Changed from the Alta to the HR to monitor my heart and was pleasantly surprised about he sleep feature that shows different stages like R.E.M. And Deep.<br/>I bought the small but thought I would get the old band which I loved with the clip feature. This one seems too small and the material makes me swear more than the other.
 This didn't say that it was refurbished and I don't know that it was. All I know is this has never worked properly. I don't even try with this anymore. I am going to store and purchasing a new one. The one I received from Amazon was garbage. Wouldn't stay synchronized. Battery kept going dead after a few hours. Totally defective
 So far so good. Pretty much what I expected. I have the AltaHR, it's slim, lightweight, doesn't interfere with my daily activities. I love the fact that it has reminders, sleep analysis and especially the ability to check your heart rate!
 I like certain features like the sleep tracker and HR monitor. What I don’t like is that any real arm movement counts as a step. I drive about half of my workday, and am walking off and on the rest of the day. Moving the steering wheel and reaching and picking up things registers as a step. So by the end of the day, the step and distance counters are way off. So in turn, I’m sure the calories counter isn’t accurate either.
 I love it. I have used the Charge HR for a year and a half, but as a woman I couldn't wait to try something with a thinner band... and you can get other wristbands (like with the flex I used over 2 years ago) so you can coordinate with any outfit!
 This is my third fitbit.  I upgraded to the Alta HR from the basic Alta and very much like having the heartrate function.  The setup was easy and I also like the band that came with it.
 Took 2 weeks to ship (thanks amazon prime), and now that I have it I cant set it up. Apparently it requires a fitbit specific dongle to connect to PC. I already have a regular bluetooth dongle, but you have to spend an extra 20$ for the fitbit version.
 I received this as a gift, it replaced my FitBit Flex (1st edition).  I love that the size is similar to the Flex, I was afraid the Charge would be too large.  The hourly reminders to move have been a great help, I work in an office and tend to sit for hours without thinking about getting up.  I also love having my heart rate right on the tracker.  The band is soft and I like the texture on it.  Definitely an upgrade for me!
 I bought the Alta HR on recommendation of a friend who used this particular product.  I did not like the idea that it was not waterproof but thought this was a minor concern.  She was charging her Fitbit every eight days.  Mine has to be charged every three days which is an inconvenience for me.  I would not recommend this product for anyone who has a busy life and wants to keep track of their daily activities.  Gwen
 A year after I purchased my Alta on the Fitbit site, the band began to disengage a few minutes after putting it on. The band wasn't abused or broken,  just worn down from normal usage— coincidently (?) just after the warranty ended. Fitbit  support provided no help.  Fitbit seemed not the least bit concerned about my customer satisfaction.  My conclusion is that my Alta was a $170 mistake so I will stay away from Fitbit from now on.
 I'm loving the new Fitbit! It has all the great features of my last Fitbit but it's thinner. The app is pretty awesome as well. I like challenging my friends and it's great motivation.
 I have loved this Fitbit since I got it for Christmas! But lately my band has been randomly detaching from the device. It is not even six months old and I looked at the band, it's broken and falling apart on one side. I am very disappointed about this! This should not be happening after only 6 months of normal use. With that being said, I am happy with everything else! I love the sleep tracker!
 I love knowing the amount of calories I burn each day. Being able to change out the bands is fun for me. I get bored easy so I like to change things up. I would not recommend this to someone who walks pushing a stroller, it will not count your steps. Thats a big negative. HR monitor is a great touch.
 My HR of 2 years broke when charging.  I traded up to Alta HR.  Had for a few days but not satisfied from the first.  Struggle to tell time.  Beat it to see steps and heartbeat.  Steps truncate.  Not 8523 but 8.5.  Sorry I traded up.  Liked the push button on my old HR.
 Love this watch, pretty accurate step count and heart rate reading. Plus its not bad looking. It's not always great at auto tracking exercise but that's not a deal breaker.
 Absolutely love it!  It's my first FitBit.  Easy to use.  Got me up &amp; moving!  I'm excited about getting my steps in each day!
 very happy so far with my Fit Bit.  I'm able t o track my sleep and make sure I am taking enough steps every day especially since I am in outside sales and in the car more than not.  I really have to make sure I am doing steps due to that fact and this definitely helps as it alerts me that I haven't taken enough each hour as the hour is closing in.
 For medical reasons I made this purchase and I’m glad I did.  Helps with activity level and heart rate which are my two interest.
 Hi, I bought a Fitbit ALta HR (large) for my mom for Christmas and her fitbit doesn't hasn't been able to charge. I own a fitbit alta myself and have had no problem and have done everything i can think of to fix the problem but nothing works.
 We bought ours during Prime Day this year, but ultimately returned them and upgraded to the Fitbit Charge 2, since we needed connected GPS for tracking some of our workouts.  Apart from that, the design and smaller size of the Fitbit Alta HR is really great.  I highly recommend if you do not care about connected GPS features.  Enjoy!  ~K
 Have had several fitbits and they don’t last long.  My daughter’s Alta just quit working today after only having it for a year and a half.  I’m done with Fitbit.
 I love how interactive this Fitbit is.... in that it reminds me when to get those extra steps and is really sleek and super fashionable witht he silver leather band I purchased to go with it.
 My cheap, old Garmin finally stopped telling time so I figured time to upgrade.  After much consideration, I chose this one based on so many positive reviews.  However, it was a complete nightmare to set up.  The display is so small, basically not visible to me at all.  At night impossible and it flashes light when I move.  Not handy  It is not counting my steps at all accurately and I have had no sleep data at all.  There is basically no movement bar.<br/><br/>So its been a week and I am actually wearing my old Garmin again - so who needs the time anyway?  This device was a TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.
 Love this product!  Especially helpful for tracking my sleep. Looking forward to using more of fit bits options
 I bought mine through a different retailer in December 2018 and the band broke three months later.  Worked with Fitbit to get it replaced and they had 3 options for replacement bands and only one was a small. The small was the cheaper version without a buckle.
 So far I am very happy with this purchase! I always said I would never own a fitness tracker. However, I have gained a lot of weight and haven’t been eating healthy. This device has made it easier for me to get my water in for the day and helps me make sure to get up and move. I love the sleep feature that shows the different stages of sleep you get during the night. I ordered different bands for it as I do not like the band that comes with it. (Just a personal preference) This Fitbit has a Sleek design if your not wanting something bulky. I ordered the small and it fits perfectly!
 It is a shame that when you invest your money...... and the product does not have bands worth a good closure.  This is the second time I have invested in a FITBIT and lost it due to the closure..
 Bought this for my wife.  She loves it and pays attention to its alarms about moving each hour, etc.  Well worth the money.
 Works great, I wear it almost every day.
 How far Fitbit technology has come since my first Charge HR. Wears very comfortable, skinny and and interchangeable bands keep me stylish when I'm dressed up or down. All stats seem very accurate. The display is great and seems to be getting better with each release. One downside is that display is smaller than other versions, so instead of seeing the whole number I only see a rounded number (ex- 17k steps instead of 17,500 steps), but I just look at my phone and it gives me the exact numbers. It's a small trade off for a more sleek size.
 I travel quite frequently. The time zone will not change on the app giving me the wrong time. I have tried changing it on the phone, tablet, and computer to no avail. I will be returning this frustrating purchase.
 Love these. Just wish they were made better. This replaced one that lasted less than a year. Sad.
 I got this for my boyfriend and he’s in love! He’s never had any sort of smart watch before, but he loves that he can read all texts anytime. If there’s anything urgent he can go reply on his phone, if not he’s completely hands free!
 I love my Fitbit so much and make a concerted effort to reach all the goals I set on a daily basis.
 Had this Fitbit for a couple of months and it worked great but then it just stopped syncing with my phone.  I tried everything and finally called their customer service.  I was told that my Samsung Galaxy J3 was not a supported device.  When I asked why did it work for a couple of months, they had no answers.  I can only now wear it as a watch.  Worthless.
 I am very disappointed. I was wearing this and the watch fell right off my hand. I had this for a year and loved it but I would get one of the other brands. They all do the same thing but with a better band!
 Product is fine and was just what I was looking for. The problem was I didn't compare prices and I definitely should of with other retailers selling for as much as $50 less.
 I like the Fitbit Alta HR, when it works.  It refused to charge 31 days after purchase (and my husband's Fitbit did the same after 2 weeks of use).  I contacted Fitbit and they were nice and sent a label for me to send the Alta back.  However, it is the slowest Fedex delivery ever, and who knows when I will receive my new Fitbit.  I have heard several people say that their Fitbits (various types) stopped charging, so I don't have much faith that this new one will be much better.  But I can hope.
 Very hard to read in direct sunlight so it loses 1 star.  Otherwise. Great product.  Battery last seven days before needing recharge.
 Great product, has been a huge help to me in determining how active I really am and how many calories I burn on average but it doesn’t track my heart rate when I’m sweaty and apparently it’s like that for a lot of people, kind of a major flaw since when I’m doing cardio that’s when I really want to know what my heart rate is
 The fitbit is an awesome way to track your health, fitness and sleep. Whether you're trying to lose a lot of weight or just live a healthier lifestyle, I highly recommend using the fitbit. It gives you so much information about the food you eat, the personalized exercise program you should have, and your sleep cycle. Amazing! And so easy to use!
 I really like the HR monitoring, but the sensors have stopped working on 2 after 6-8 months of use. They seem to be sensitive to moisture corruption even though they are supposed to be water resistant.
 i absolutely loved the operations of the Fitbit . However it was always falling off my wrist because of the way the wrist band snaps into the holes. If you dont get both "prongs" inserted really firmly, it comes undone. After many times of picking it up off the floor, i finally lost it for good. :-(
 Useless. It worked great when new but now, 6 months later will not sync with I need or want it to. I have had four different fitbits and after several months of use they all developed the same problem. Customer support repeatedly suggests that I try all of same methods to remedy the problem despite the fact that I stated several times that I have already tried those methods. I'm switching to garmin.
 Won't work if you sweat it hasnt given me a reading over 115 even though I've reached a heart rate of 155. I tried putting it everywhere on my wrist but. Compared it to a under armour chest strap. I don't know if I can trust it for normal activity.
 Love this fitbit. I had the older version and they have come a long way with this one
 Can pick what you want to show when tapping. Only thing I have a problem with is I can't read it outside when in the sun.
 This Fitbit display doesn't show in the heat and sun. The display doesn't easily show when you flip your wrist.  Same with tapping. Sometimes it doesn't show the display when tapped.  Otherwise, it serves its purpose.
 If you like to be as accurate as possible with how many calories you burned and how long you exercised, do NOT buy this product.  It will track cardio after 10 minutes of consistently moderate to high exercise.  If you manually input it, you have to remember what time you started.  When tracking manually you have to go to your exercise bar graph to see how much you actually burned and for how long.  Yes, it's cute; but if you like to be as accurate as possible don't get this.
 I absolutely love the Fitbit Alta HR.  (I didn't purchase the Blue/gray one as the heading says; I purchased the black one.)  It's slim, it's lightweight and it has the features I was looking for except, it's not waterproof. I've only had it for 4 days but it's already motivated me to up my steps and increase workout time.  When I'm sitting at my desk or on the sofa for too long, it reminds me to get up and move!  I wish I would've purchased a Fitbit years ago.
 Everything you need for fitness with style. Love the abilities to change bands, simple unique.  Format is excellent . Fitbit just keeps getting better with every new product.  Customer service is excellent.
 i was very disapointed with this as you would think that the newest product and one of the most expensive would have the ability to do what the older  fitbits did.  What im speaking about counting the floor climbed (Stairs)  this product dont do what the prior product did do.
 Battery life does not last seven days as advertised
 It looks great and worked great while it worked. A year and three months later with no abuse, it failed (full charge doesn't last overnight). Fitbit support says it's out of warranty, but I can buy a new one for 25% off. That was our family's fourth Fitbit, but it will be our last product purchase from the company.
 I love my fitbit. Would definitely recommend them. My husband and I have so much fun challenging each other. and we love to challenge relatives that are far away.
 I bought one for me and my mom. Mine works great, but for some reason two weeks go by with her using it and it doesn’t work any more. We tried charging it and everything but nothing worked so I returned it. Hopefully when I order another one it won’t die. I also hope mine doesn’t shut off like hers did.
 this is the second Fitbit HR with a Faulty Bluetooth. Both my daughter and I tried with different devices to sync a brand new fitbit HR and it does locate the new device.  even if to remove old devices.  HR monitor is not accurate either. I will never own another Fitbit product this is my last attempt...
 This product will work nicely for about a year, maybe a year and a half if your lucky.  After that time things start to happen like it won't sink, turn on when tapped, etc.  You'll contact the company and they will tell you its broken and offer you a 25% discount to purchase a new one.  Its not worth the money for the this short life expectance!
 I bought one for my family member (actually bought also Charge2, and Flex 2). All of them without exception experience problems during synchronization with smartphones. Some tricks help but it should not be that way.
 great price and exactly what I was looking for
 I've had this 4 days now and I like it. The band is comfortable so it's easy to wear all day. The tracker automatically detects when you walk, etc., for more than 15minutes and logs it as exercise. The app is intuitive and has badges you get when you make a fitness goal. It would be perfect if it was waterproof- no swimming with it.
 Since the first of the year, I have purchased both a Charge HR and an Alta HR. The Charge stopped syncing with two months and the Alta heart rate function stopped working within two months. No more.
 The wife as had the watch only since Christmas and its not working properly, it as been taken care of but fitbit wanna charge her to get it fixed, don't waste your time with these you will get ripped off.
 Works great, Love it!
 I love my Fitbit...It keeps me walking and aware of my heart rate.
 I got a good deal on this Fitbit on prime day. I love it!!! It shows my HR constant on the app or the watch &amp; the app allows me to put in my calories and water daily. It does keep track of your sleep also which is great for me!!
 It keeps me moving!
 Best gift ever!!!!
 Love it! Upgraded from the flex. I love it's features.
 i love the sleep monitoring feature
 Like size, battery life and sleep tracking feature.  Heart rate not always accurate.  Turn of wrist rarely wakes the screen and touch screen is touchy (pardon the pun:).
 Doesn’t capture your heart rate right after a couple months. Don’t spend any money on this, it’s just a waste. Just caused me frustration...
 You can buy something exactly like this for a fraction of the cost. Very fit pro offers the exact same thing for only 29.99 . The application and the product works very well.
 i was using Fitbit charge 2 but i lost it and i bought Alta HR , and I'm happy to using it because it's small size why i like small size because i want to fell it look like wrist band because its accurate calculating for the features, for my old charge 2 its very good but i like smaller that's why i bout Alta HR.
 Utterly fails to correctly track heart rate, during exercise it will spend 5+ minutes at low levels and then suddenly jump 50+ BPM to correct level.  Will report HR even when device is off wrist etc etc.
 Thought it did more.
 I dislike this tracker because it is widely inaccurate. I had the Fitbit ONE until it would not take a charge any longer. It was accurate. So I tried to replace it and Fitbit had decided to discontinue this tracker. Much to the chagrin and complaints of its many owners. So I bought the Fitbit Alta HR, a wristband tracker. The most inaccurate tracker imaginable. Every wrist-move counts as a step, but not every step counts as a step. I had also purchased the Fitbit ZIP to be able to compare. It tracked correctly and appropriately, when making steps, not when doing needlework. I dual carried these trackers for about 6 months and never could get an exact result from the Alta. So now I use the ZIP as my primary tracker and only wear the Alta at night to track my sleep. Sleep and heartrate tracking are useful but incorrect steps make it useless for exercise logs. Sad, extra expense and extra effort. Fitbit does not listen to their customers. Waist trackers work, wrist worn trackers DO NOT.
 I love this Fitbit with gentle nudges and encouraging messages  it gets you up and walking.
 Love it! Also ordered replacement bands for variety!
 for me really difficult to set up, spent long time online w/service rep, pretty cool when finally up &amp; running
 Pretty good but not very accurate
 I have had the fit bit for  3 months and have thoroughly enjoyed it until the band broke and ti won't stay on my wrist. It sort of defeats the purpose. That was a lot of money to have a device that won't even work.
 Beautiful little piece. I bought it to track my sleep as I have issues there and it does a smashing job, all the other bits come in very useful. Haven't used the food or drinks tracking as they seem slightly OTT. Only issues are it is SO easy to scratch, happened within the first day, and it doesn't always react as it should when tapping the screen. Would very much recommend for any sleep tracking, and day to day activities
 I loved my fitbit.  Until it died.  I have been working with Fitbit on a warranty replacement for six weeks.  I have yet to receive a replacement.
 Sooooooo. .. . Fitbit couldn't have come out with this any sooner! I had bought the Charge 2 just a few days before the Alta HR came out. I loved the ability to see my HR on the Charge 2 but the one thing that didn't look right on my small wrist, was the size! The Alta HR has everything I needed on the Charge 2. The design is beautiful and I don't feel it like I did with the Charge 2. Love love love!!!
 Great watch. Holds a charge well, and works and looks exactly as described. I waited a while to review it to make sure it didn't have any immediate breaks or malfunctions; it doesn't.
 Was not accurate at all was not satisfied and returned
 This Alta HR model has been such a headache. The app says it’s fully charged but won’t turn on. I’ve spent hours troubleshooting, and days charging it. Piece of junk!
 This was a waste of money!  It will read fully charge and then not last the day.  The clock does not automatically update and the mileage is not reliable.
 Excellent balance of size, features, functionality, and look. It's the best designed fitbit to date now if only they would create one that is waterproof!  And would love it to track stairs, but that is expecting too much for now.<br/><br/>I've used the altar regular, the charge 2, the charge HR, the flex 2, and the one - this is the best for sure.
 I got this as a gift for My birthday in july and was very happy with this item. I didn’t have any problems whatsoever with it until February when I went to plug it in to charge it. A couple hours after charging I touched it and it was extremely HOT. I’m lucky it didn’t catch on fire. It hasn’t turned back on since. 😞
 I really love everything this fit bit does. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't stay charged but for 2 to 3 days at the most.
 Good stuff. Works as advertised.
 I bought this for my wife and she is very satisfied with it with no complaints.<br/><br/>Recommend if you are in the market for a light and thin activity tracker, especially because the battery life is as good as advertised!
 Fitbit is somewhat thick.  Syncing work only 25 % of the time, so not very convenient. I sync to IPad Pro and have to reset or restart to sync.  There is no other Bluetooth device around.  Otherwise it is a fun item to gather steps &amp; hear rate info.
 Love the Fitbit Alta HR and all it does!
 Works just as advertised
 Just bought this in July this year, my band won’t stay on. I think that I should be replaced by amazon. I not sure if it’s the band or side clasp.
 I bought this FITBIT I really like it a lot!! It is very ez to use and to understand.  I bought it mainly to check on my heart rate.  It's comfortable to have on. Even during sleep.
 I love it so far, very fashionable (i got the rose gold version). I used the old version of HR before, and loved it.  The sleeping patterns function is cute
 I have had just about all of the various Fitbit devices over the last 4 years and still actively use the Blaze and Surge.  Bought the Alta HR because it was thin and still had so much functionality.  It's become my go-to device already because it is unobtrusive but it is also the most accurate for measuring heart rate.  Great job Fitbit!
 Just upgraded from an older version and I love the sleek look. The tapping responsiveness could be better. Overall, I love how Fitbit motivates me to keep a healthy, moving lifestyle.
 Excellent
 Arrived fast and just as advertised
 Fits well.  I like the Alta much better than my last fitbit.  The other model kept catching on things.
 Nothing
 Check if compatible with your phone prior to purchasing.<br/>I used with an old  Samsung S4 in the past and was happy with it. Not compatible with the S9 currently; and per online blogs, there does not appear to be any sign of fixing this in the near future.
 Helping me keep my steps up...and love that it shows how my night sleep goes.
 Easy to use!
 I love this.  it helps me to keep track of my water intake, my sleep, and my daily movement.
 I changed to this one when my Fitbit Charge HR fell apart after a year. So far so good! I love the size and fit. You can choose what you want for the main screen from a list of options. The only downside is the step count only shows the first 2 digits since the display is vertical.
 Love it! Just needed something give me that extra push. Text alerts are handy and once charged this was ready to use in minutes.
 This is a buttonless Fitbit , to activate the tracker you can either flick your wrist or tap twice , both don't work every time , which brings me to the first thing in this review , why not have a button in the first place ??
 It surpasses all the previous ones. Less bulky, more attractive. Works well and the sleep information is helpful especially since soerp is an issue for me.
 Got my item in good condition, and so far no issues with my fitbit :)
 First Fitbit. As with hats and Nike shoes, it's only matter of time before I have a "collection" of Fitbits that any normal person could only describe as unnecessary. Notification vibration could be a little stronger but otherwise not one bit of disappointment about this purchase. Would give it six bleeping stars if I I could.
 It’s ok but a little disappointed. It doesn’t light up to show anything unless it’s taken off.
 Had kinks getting it started compared to my previous Alta.  Good thing, the Alta online community is active and up-to-date, I was able to get it to start (I'm referring to straight out of the box start up here.) I have to use this a bit before a better review can be made.
 I bought a Charge HR in 2016. I loved it, but it was so clunky and didn't have all the features I wanted. The Alta HR is awesome. It looks much better on my small wrist and has all the features I want. I've had it for nearly a week and love it.
 Most of the time, my Alta HR won't pair with my phone.  This time, I tried to unpair it.  Now it won't pair!  I believe this is a fitbit bluetooth issue as my phone pairs with other devices with no problem.
 Great product. I used to own a flex and had to manually enter workouts. Especially when I started a little bit of weights, I found flex wasn't capture it. I love that this can do so. The HR feature really gives more visibility on the impact of your workout. The product came well packaged and is pretty sleek.
 Can't pair this to save my life. I've tried everything. Super frustrated right now.
 Loved the fit bit and fast shipping service. However I purchased two of these and both are now gone.  The wrist bank easily falls off if not snapped perfectly tight and both of the items I purchased the wrist band came loose and we lost both fitbits.
 I love it~
 Screen didn't work and had to send it back to FitBit. 3 weeks later I still haven't been given a replacement and told that the color I wanted is now backordered with no timeframe on when I am able to get one. Very Upsetting.
 Worked as intended
 Love this fitbit! I had the original but wanted a smaller profile and the ability to check my heart rate. I gave the other to my husband and he loves it too. Win win situation!
 It gives you a lot of information to be so small. I had to change the band it came with it made my arm sweat.
 Really loved my fitbit. Kept track of my sleep much better than my previous one. However I'm disappointed that battery would only last 3 days even after all notifications and quick views were turned off. Then just today it will not even being to charge.
 I use it to measure my steps and slerp. I don't like that if your arms don't move when you walk, like when pushing a store cart, etc. steps taken do not register.
 Love it! Much nicer fitting than the charge hr. Love that you can change the band's so easily.
 Love all the info it gives you.  Wish the band was more attractive.
 You can not adjust the time screen stays lit. Major flaw.
 Horrible. Only 4 months old and the band fell apart and it doesn't charge anymore.  And it always had trouble syncing.  Am going back to Polar.
 Lost 3 watches in 2 years after the clasp breaks and it just falls of my arm. Otherwise love it.
 The milage is off a little and not having the side button like the chargeHR is a little annoying...nice battery life to go along with the Alta being sleek and comfortable.
 Boring. Boring. Boring. Overpriced. Boring.<br/>ALL you are paying for is outdated tech and a name-brand. I had this for about 12 hours then sent it back, because it was awful and boring. Everything I ASSUMED this would do, it didn't. It's terribly difficult to use.<br/>If you enjoy spending $120+ on a boring pedometer and a sleep tracker that doesn't work AT ALL, be my guest. I couldn't even sleep with it on, actually, because it's so sharp and bulky that I LOST sleep over it.  Good luck!
 It's so slender &amp; lightweight you don't feel it on your wrist. It's comfortable to sleep in now! I love it! Can't wait to buy more bands &amp; switch it up!
 Love having the ability to see my heart rate before and after a workout. It's nice not having to carry my phone with me all the time. Just getting a little bit of a text message lets me know if I need to get my phone right away or wait. This upgrade for me is the best thing I've done.
 Love the product
 I like my Fitbit. Hoping I can continue my daily goals with it.
 I just got it, but love it. The only thing I would change is having a different band option for those of us who do not like a clasp watch.
 The item received was heavily scratched up and did not look brand new. Even the charger was all scratched up. This is while the package was sealed and all the "brand new" stickers were in place. Completely unacceptable and cannot believe i could be sold a piece like this.
 The coral color is very orange which was disappointing as I had gotten it for a present. Other than that, great product!
 Gave this to my daughter for her birthday and she loves it.
 Love it
 Love it
 I love my Fitbit. It worked just long enough for me to love it. One year in EXACTLY, it’s done. No more battery life. I’m not spending $150/year for a battery.
 There is so many including myself that will tell you that the display WILL NOT be visible outside. Google the Alta HR visibility outside and see all the reports. You will be wasting your money on something that is intended to be viewed while you exercise, but can't deliver unless you are indoors.
 So far after only having it for a couple of days I am really liking the features, tips, and community of the Fitbit. Getting motivation and staying motivated to keep going. Easy to operate and make changes if I want or need to.
 Love it, it is such a great size and I barely feel it on my wrist. Looks more feminine that the other Fitbit trackers that I have owned.
 I returned this because the display was not readable outdoors, even in shade or on a cloudy day.
 Love my Fitbit
 Looks good. Does all I want clearly and concisely and I'm up and moving now. I'm a competitive person and I like that I can link up with family members who also have Fitbit and we compare notes.
 The battery is non replaceable and dies out fast. If you're thinking of buying from fitbit, prepare yourself to buy a new fitbit every 6 months - 1 year.
 I like the information I am able to view with this Fitbit.  I also like the ability to see text messages I receive.
 Love it so far!
 Love it, love the sleep insights
 Husband loves it
 I like all the features.
 Love my Fitbit. Especially the HR &amp; sleep
 Had a Charge 2 prior to getting this one.  I find that this model is slower to repond. I like the looks of it and overall it's easy to use.
 Perfect.  Just what I needed.
 I love this Fitbit. The only down side is it can't get wet. If it were water proof too, it would be perfect
 Great product - highly  recommended!
 Awesome product.
 Great device, easy to set up, very functional.
 Live this
 Best watch I ever bought. Allows me to manage my weight. I love that i know how many steps I can take and it helps me take more steps a day. I love that when I get a text on my iPhone my watch alerts me and displays the entire text. Aweeesooommmme
 I generally do not leave such a bad review but I purchased this for my daughter and I would never purchase another one it never keeps correct date and time and I can never get it to synchronize I call customer service and we are always on the phone for way over an hour I have the fitbit charge2 and I never have any problem with it, keeps the correct time no problems so I decided I will throw this alta in garbage and give her my charger 2 I will never ever purchase another fitbit peroid I own the alta rh for my daughter and the charger and I like how it performs but it loses time and very very hard to synchonize and updating omg I be on phone for like 3hours never another if I have to upadate and have these problems I am throwing both away to much for me but customer support is exceptional
 NEED RETURN AUTH. DOES NOT WORK
 Do not buy this tracker. It became invisible to to Bluetooth and there is no way to reboot the device.
 The Alta has not worked for me. The heart rate monitor is unreliable and inconsistent. I loved the charge HR and never had a problem.  I have called the costumer service line several times- it takes forever and it has only solved the problem for short periods of time. It will not register cycling or spin classes at all- they said that I should have known that. ????I would not buy again and will dissuade my clients from purchasing too.
 Addictive
 Enjoy all the features that Alta watch has to offer. ... especially while walking.
 Si dar the Alta HR has exceeded my expectations. I purchased it for the heart beat monitor, and it has been spit on.
 Love it ❤️
 Heart rate monitor keeps stop working until I reset Fitbit.  It’s really annoying I have to reset it every time it stop.
 Love the slim design and versatility! Super lightweight and easy to use.<br/>Only wish is that clock face could be military/24h time.
 HR does not track floors and sometimes you have to hit the face hard before it come on.  Also unlike flex Fitbit online manual said must take Alta HR off in the shower, and then I forget to put it back on. Otherwise an awesome product.
 Love this Fitbit bc it isn’t bulky
 Love the band on this Fitbit. Will not get lost like my other one that just snapped in place.
 I have only been using it 3 days, but so far impressive. Set-up was a breeze.  Never imagined I was moving around so much.
 Dead on Arrival. Will update review as soon as replacement arrives in a timely fashion.
 Would not sync up with my Android phone. Very aggravating.
 Love the functions of the fitbit HR  BUT not the band!  I've had it a week and it's already got black markings.  Going back!
 The screen fell off in 4 months, called for repair, was told I have to buy a whole new unit! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
 I'm new to the Fitbit party, but this is awesome! I absolutely love it!
 Love the fitbit produce so much ...I used to have the Charge 2 but I wanted something smaller so I got this!❤
 It's alright but it doesn't always show up when I tap the screen, I usually have to tap it like 10 times before anything comes up. I would have just could a Mi band at this rate. Definitely not worth the price.
 Wow
 Good but not as good as the Blaze. Harder to read and doesn't always light up with wrist movement or tapping. Have to use phone app more.
 Really like my Alta HR. A definite step up from my old Fitbit. The iPhone alerts for my calls and texts is a great extra. Also like the wrist band a lot better than the Alta's band. Very happy with it...
 This is a great Fitbit. It even reminds me to get up and move to help me reach my daily goal.
 Really like the slim fit. Works great with a readable display that I don't need my reading glasses to see. Just wished it counted floors like my previous Fitbit.
 Light.  Looks professional at the office
 Does all the Charge HR did and more with a much thinner appearance. So far, so great....
 Love my Fitbit just wish it was waterproof
 Great device to keep you on track and motivated during your diet and fitness goals. More features than I thought it would have
 I've hadn't three fit bits in the past and this is the best. HR function and size is perfect!!! Had the charge 2 last and it was just a little to big for my taste. Love this new one!!! Also love the charging feature :)
 Very comfortable design. I’ve had 2 other Fitbit styles in the past and this is by far my favorite. I wish it counted stairs climbed like the charge though.
 Heart rate and sleep stages!  I loved my first Alta but love the HR more!  I wanted to stay with a smaller Fitbit and now I can!
 Our Fitbit Alta HR stopped working properly shortly after the return period expired.  Fitbit will not repair or exchange even though it is covered by their warranty.
 sadly, when taking my son for a walk in his stroller it didnt count any of my steps - a mile and a half walk.<br/>i like the fitbit one better for this reason.
 Great tracker! Love the slimmer band (I was using the Charge HR original before) and the interchangeable bands. The screen is great and I love the reminders when I am being lazy ;)
 I really like that the battery is long lasting, wrist band is interchangeable and slim. All the other features are awesome too!
 I gifted this for my wife Bday. She liked it very much.  It has all the cool features.
 it was amazing it does everything<br/> i could not of got any thing better<br/>than this.i will treasure it for ever.<br/>as long as i live it the best<br/>thing i used my money on .
 Reminds me to keep moving
 Easy to wear; stylish. After researching the different fit bits, I know I made the right decision here.<br/>You have to tap the screen pretty hard to get it to register, but it works great!
 Perfect. Thank you.
 Upgraded from a charge HR. The only thing I am unhappy about is you cannot read the display when you are outside if the sun is out. I mean can't see a thing!!!
 Overall a good Fitbit but the lack of stair counter is a bummer. I also have to tap the screen several times to get it to turn on.
 Love this.  Comfortable and battery lasts a long time.
 Not very responsive and doesn't respond to touch. More disappointing than useful.
 Love all the colors! The only thing I'd change is to order a combination of Large and Small bands.
 Sometimes it is difficult to get the info to appear on the face. It doesn't always show when I turn my wrist up or tap once. I have to repeat the action a few times. Other than that, it is good.
 I hope the functionality is good. But the band is disappointing compared to charge 2.  Band less heavy duty and clasp is cheap plastic not metal.
 Does everything I need it to. I especially like the reminders to move every hour.
 Everything works just as it should
 Love the watch clasp in the back you can adjust it to your perfect size. So comfortable to wear and very helpful.  Monitoring your steps and heart rate
 Works great love the slim design
 Latch is getting detached very easy in 3rd month
 I love this fitbit. I can see how much I have walked, Heart rate etc. Greatest thing I have purchased for myself. Thanks
 Didn’t buy it from here . Got it from Walmart for a gift . But i really love it . Must say alittle better than my original Alta
 I started with the Fitbit flex then upgraded to the charge HR. I love my new Alta!! Will always be a Fitbit fan because their customer service is amazing
 Product was defective when received. Ans when I wanted to make a replacement order, product ran out.
 Absolutely love it!! The only thing I wish it had was better tracking for elliptical training, and that it was waterproof! It by far is way better than the surge
 Liked that it tracks steps,sleep, exercise. Disliked that it’s not water proof
 Very good
 Love my new Alta HR. it's slim and stylish. More importantly it keeps track of all the areas that are a priority for me. I love it much better than the Charge HR.
 It's awesome and especially the notifications. I love the text and caller id function.
 This thing sucks at measuring hear rate accurately. Anything above resting heart rate is way off. Compared it to Polar H10 and it's off by a lot.
 Love the fact that it is small and has HR! Enjoy the fireworks when step goal is reached.
 I like it a lot.  Easy set up.  Looks great
 Great!
 The Fitbit is a good tool to keep track of how many hours you spleep it’s easy to track food and fluids sleep pattern
 The Alta HR is amazing.  Still small but giving so much more information.  The sleep information has been useful in changing some of my normal habits to get more rest.
 Just got it yesterday. Did not seem to register an hour long nap, but other than that, the features are pretty cool. Like it much better than my old tracker
 Much lighter and more comfortable after upgrading from the original Fitbit flex!<br/><br/>Also love that it's small but works like a watch still and displays all your stats!
 Excellent size. Does what you need it to. Like  the band replacement option. Simple to set up and replace old Fitbit.
 Awesome
 Does as expected. Am happy with it.  Said takes an hour or so to charge, but first time took many hours.
 I love the slim and light fit! I like that the bands can be changed, since I like to change colors or if it gets dirty. All around a great purchase!
 The battery life of this model is perfect, given that it constantly monitors your heart rate.<br/><br/>Customer service of Amazon is the best!
 It's perfect the only problem is the old version had the stairs count this one dont
 I have had it for 2 months and it won't hold a charge.
 Long battery, great design, easy to read display. Most important, it keeps me honest about my physical activity.
 Went from the Charge HR to this beauty and I couldn't be happier! I love that I can see texts on my wrist and the new sleep tracker is awesome 😍
 Love it! Already helping my fitness goals come to life.
 Valuable info and a motivator to do better at getting up and out
 Fabulous, I love the new sleep tracker, and the ability to change the band. It lets me customize my Fitbit to whatever style I want!
 Too soon to determine if the Alta is good. This is my 4th Fit Bit. Really hoping the Alta doesn't break down like the Charge HR
 Still trying it. I liked the Charge 2 but wanted something smaller. I don't think the HR monitoring is as good as the Charge 2.
 so does a charger come with it or are the batteries replaceable?
 Like that it's much smaller than the blaze, seems harder to get the display to light up but just getting used to it
 I had to get a black one cause they were out blue/gray. I just wish it was waterproof
 Was amazing deal
 Really like the smaller footprint. Great size to wear all day to work. Hope it has a longer life than my Fitbit charge hr which lasted 17 months.
 Works
 Love the new design and added features.
 Love this model.  Has many features.
 This was a gift from my husband, and I love it! The design and all the functions are what I was looking for.
 Great.  It fits on my very small wrist!
 Had the previous Alta and just started wear the HR this week. Love it. Not wild about the band but I can use the old ones. It's hard to get off.
 Love the slim design and interchangeable wrist bands. It's helping me meet my fitness goals plus not miss an important text or call.
 I barely feel it on my wrist and I love all the functions, great purchase!
 I love it!
 Good for tracking calories that u burn everyday. It is very useful for people who want to lose weight.
 Easy setup and use.
 Love my Fitbit
 Very poor product quality and very poor service<br/>Stopped measuring my pulse after a month and half
 Love my new Alta HR. Small / lightweight /easy to access to view steps etc... so happy I can change my band
 Love the color! And it works perfectly great for counting my steps
 Excellent product. Exactly as advertised! I would purchase again
 Loved my new Fitbit. The only problem I have is with the band. I have arthritis and it's a challenge fastening it.
 Great band, but not the color was expecting. Great quality.
 Works great. Love being able to see my R.E.M. sleep and heart rate.
 Love it
 I don’t like that doesn’t have the step like the other ones...
 I Love it!!! It's light weight, tells your heart rate and show texts and calls!! I also love that I can change the bands!!
 Very sleek and fashionable
 Love my new Fitbit!
 My best Fitbit yet!! Sleek, small but easy to read and does so many things - and Fitbit has the BEST customer service!
 Great product
 Notifications are great and it's a nice feminine soze
 I've had it for a few days and like the sleep tracking aspect! So far so good!
 Returned my Apple Watch and bought the Fitbit. It's light and comfortable. Does everything I wanted.
 Has been a wonderful tool in my fitness journey
 I have only had it for a few days but so far it is a great step up from the Flex.
 Great product, someone needs to come up with a technology like this to measure blood pressure.
 Love it. Changing bands and the sleek design are great.!!!
 Really motivates you to stay fit
 I'm having difficulty syncing my Fitbit to Virgin Pulse.
 I love this model much better than the chargeHR. So far so good.
 Love this model. The Fitbit app is my favorite fitness app. Just wish it was water proof.
 I love my Fitbit HR!! It is amazing.
 Loving it
 Love when it reminds me to get up and move!!
 Nothing to complain so far
 Phone does not charge
 This product is pretty crappy. Isn't not comfortable what so ever, the watch is very tall compared to the charge. Doesn't track your heart accurately at all and during a stair master workout it picked up my heart rate 50% of the time, and my workout was a fat burn cardio (not a drenched sweat workout). Returning this product. Can't think of many good things other than the average person wearing it as a fashion trend and a sleep alarm (it dug into my wrist during sleep, very uncomfortable) Also, I wear a heaving metal watch, so I'm used to a bracelet on my wrist and this rubber Fitbit is junk.
 I just wish I knew it didn't log floors like my last fitbit does.
 Absolutely wonderful!
 Best watch ever
 Love my fitbit!  Very comfortable to wear.  Very stylish.
 Love it. Fashionable and works great.
 IT IS AWESOME!!!
 Great product!!
 Just got it, and already loving it!
 Best small side tracker.
 Love it 💕💜❤️😍
 Great device and so easy to use!!
 Love it! Super helpful
 Enjoy tracking my movements as well as sleep!
 Battery doesn't last.
 I love the Fitbit Alta! It has helped me keep motivated to keep up with my steps. Before I literally had no idea. Definitely has helped me keep things in perspective too.
 Awesome!
 Great so far.
 I love my Alta HR!
 Great

 good
 Wears nice but a bit heavy, liked it overall
 Although the Alta has many features - the one most important to me is accurately recording steps. It records steps by arm movements- which includes turning your steering wheel, etc etc.  and, I missed the stair climbing feature. Returned to my Fitbit One - and love it.
 I've had a Fitbit Alta HR for about 6 or 7 weeks, and I was absolutely in love with it.  Until two nights ago, when suddenly I developed sick inducing pain along my thumb and wrist.  It came on fast and hard, and was incapacitating.  I don't sleep with the fitbit, but in the morning, the pain was still bad enough to get me out of bed.  I put the fitbit on, and by lunchtime was in tears.  I took the fitbit off, and by evening, could move my thumb, and this morning, I am almost back to normal.  I am shocked.  But a few minutes research online assured me that I am not the only person to have gotten tendonitis from these devices.  I'm unlucky in this.  As I've said, I loved my fitbit.  But I do think that it should come with some kind of warning that for a small percentage of people, the device can cause tendonitis, and other problems.
 Was super excited to get my fit bit and the screen wouldn't even turn on! I know it''s probably just a defective one but if I'm spending that amount of money on a fit bit it should work when I get it! Pretty disappointing.
 The Fitbit is fully charged and won’t count steps. I would like to order a new one!
 I like what the Alta is suppose to be, however I am having a heck of a time with the "tap". It does not work for me most of the time.
 Came with the wrong charger. Cannot use product at all. Will update those review when I receive my charger
 The Alta HR does not have an altimeter and cannot track floors climbed. Returned it for a different model that can track floors.
 I had a Charge HR for about a year. Happily switched to the Alta HR when it came out. My wrist is 6.5” and I got a large. I wear it on the second smallest hole (with the Charge HR I’d worn it on the third smallest). I like the large because it can fit around my ankle if I want, and the extra strap fits across most of my under-wrist which I think looks good.<br/><br/>STEPS: it does this just as well as the Charge HR<br/>HEART RATE: Does this just as well as the Charge HR. I run a few days a week and it gets the same readings.<br/>STAIRS: Doesn’t have this function, but I found it flaky in Charge HR and always got more stairs than I’d actually climbed for the day, so I don’t miss it.<br/>BATTERY: I had it set with “All-Day Sync” on and "Always Connected" off and the battery has lasted about 8 days. A little after the 6 day mark I started getting low battery warnings (I guess they start happening at 25%). I started getting nervous it would finally give out at the 8 day mark so I put it on the charger. I tried it with “Always Connected” on next and it lasted almost the same. I got the low battery warning earlier on the 6th day. By the 7th day I decided it was close enough and started charging again, so I'm not sure exactly how long it will take, but at least a week.<br/>ALARM: I like this better than Charge HR. The alarm goes and buzzes about four times. If you don’t do anything it stops and snoozes and goes again 9 minutes later. You have to tap it twice (or more, I usually bang on it a few times) to turn it off. Otherwise it just keeps automatically snoozing. I like that if I’ve decided I want to sleep a little longer I don’t have to do anything.<br/>SLEEP TRACKING: when set on “normal” was about the same as Charge HR. I tried it on “sensitive” for a few nights and I got big wide bars of “restless” and the tracker only counted the non-restless times as sleep, so even though I was sleeping for 6 hours, it only counted 2 hours as sleeping. I thought that was weird so I’ve had it set to “normal” since. Maybe this reading would be useful to someone, but I found it confusing. Five days after getting my Alta HR it started tracking “sleep stages”. This is cool, I like getting to see what stages I got at night. If you click on the chart it walks you through what the different stages are and what percentage of your sleep they made up.<br/>HOURLY ACTIVITY: It warns you ten minutes before the next hour if you haven’t had your 250 steps yet. I like this, I don’t always care to accomplish this throughout the day, but on the days that I do I used to get frustrated if I lost track of time at work and missed an hour since there’s no way to go back and get steps in so you just ruined getting 100%. I’m glad Alta reminds me. Sometimes instead of just walking around I stand up and shadow box - the punching counts as steps and my arms and torso get a workout and I get the elevated heart rate and I can get to 250 quicker.<br/>EXERCISE TRACKING: It can tell when I’m running, although like Charge HR it won’t know distances, just steps, heart rate, and calories. It doesn’t have the side button to start an exercise timer, but I never used that in the Charge so I don’t miss it. I have two other apps I use to track my runs, so I don’t care that much about how detailed the Fitbit tracks them. Although I did recently discover the fitbit phone app can track my runs if I start it at the beginning of the run (on the exercise screen click the stopwatch and go to the tracking tab: you can select the activity then click the play button. If it’s a run it uses the phone’s GPS to map the run).<br/>CALL/TEXT ALERT: I like getting the little buzz to let me know to check my phone. It displays a little of the text message, but not much. Which is fine, it’s usually enough to give me an idea of whether it’s something important or not.
 I had seen a coworker's Alta a while back and debated getting one but was disappointed that it didn't do HR. I didn't like the bulkiness of the Fitbits which did measure heart rate. So I started doing research -- trying to decide what features I did and didn't need. I have been using my phone to track my steps and whatnot to this point. I stopped by the fitbit website to see if they had new offerings and there it was. Exactly what I wanted!<br/><br/>I ordered 2 (a small and a large) for my sister and myself from Amazon (2 day shipping!)  I was on the cusp of small/large and I can tell you that both fit, but as the website recommends, size up if you're unsure. I've attached photos with the small and large slightly up my wrist.<br/><br/>I love the size, the band, and the display. I appreciate the sleep tracker, the compatibility with MyFitnessPal, the silent alarms, and reminders.<br/><br/>While it can receive text messages, it will only display short messages and truncate longer ones. The text displayed is small. If you get 2 or more messages from a person in short succession it will display the number of messages instead of the actual messages. However, I understand that I ordered a fitness tracker, not a smartwatch and so I am pleased it has text reading abilities in the first place.<br/><br/>It does not track flights of stairs, which is okay by me. My phone didn't track them either.<br/>I have been comparing the steps tracked with my other step tracking apps and it seems relatively accurate.<br/>I'm sure that there are more accurate HR trackers out there, but the convenience of having these things together in one place is what sold me.<br/><br/>Random side story: My sister stole my large fitbit the other day while I was doing dishes and threw it on her ankle to see if it would track. Not only did it track, but the HR was consistent with her small fitbit on her wrist.<br/><br/>Some people have thought the calories are wildly off. I think they don't understand how Fitbit does calories. In many tracking systems, you will be shown how many calories you burned for exercise. So if you've done nothing and see some level of calories burned, you aren't sure why it's saying that. You do burn calories even when inactive. The overall calories for the day aren't that useful for me because I'm used to the system where you only get calories shown for specific exercise sessions but I've found when it tracks a workout session, those calories are pretty accurate.<br/><br/>I love the social aspect of it, and I like that you can challenge your friends for a specific day/week/weekend of steps and meeting your goals.<br/>I like the app that goes along with the fitbit.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>~Design! (I can't express how happy I am with this.)<br/>~Tracks HR<br/>~Auto tracks exercise<br/>~Battery Life (I get around a week and it charges fairly quickly)<br/>~Friend challenges and social community<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>~Not waterproof<br/>~Cost (maybe prohibitive, but that is the market of fitness trackers.)<br/>~Text messages system (but again, fitness tracker, not smart watch)<br/><br/>Honestly, of the negative reviews I've read about this particular item, most of the people who are unhappy didn't do enough research first. You should judge an item by what it advertises it does. So far this has done everything it's said it would for me. I couldn't be happier.<br/><br/>I think if you've done your research and this item has the features you have been looking for, you'll be super excited with it, like me.<br/><br/>*Edit 6/5*<br/>I've had the FitBit Alta HR for a couple months now. I am still just as happy as when I got it.<br/><br/>I've lost about 20 lbs since Christmas. It's slow going but the FitBit community has been great.  I posted a picture for my first 5k and 90 some odd strangers cheered me on. Reading the discussion area is always positive and motivating.<br/><br/>My only disappointment at this point is the lack of waterproofing because I am swimming more often these days. I'm slowly upping my goals and plan to work even harder all summer.
 I love this Fitbit.<br/>I previously had the Fitbit Alta, and was drawn to upgrade to the newer Fitbit Alta HR. I was mostly drawn to it because of the new sleep stages. It's a huge improvement from the previous sleep tracking. I do also enjoy seeing my heart rate plus, how it shows the area of your heart rate that indicates when you burn more fat.(see photos)<br/>The new band- I was hesitant because I really liked the previous Alta band because of how snugly and comfortably it fit me. It looked very sleek and I was nervous about a buckle making it seem too bulky. But I must say, I love it. It is very sleek and looks very professional.<br/>I ordered the blue/grey color. And I do see why they call it "blue/grey". When I am indoors exposed to mild/comfortable lighting the band looks completely grey with almost no blue in it. When I am outdoors or exposed to very bright lighting the band definitely looks more blue than grey. (See photos) I think it is a very unique color and I'm very pleased with it.<br/>I am also very impressed with the time it takes to charge my fitbit. It charges VERY quickly. One charge lasts several days. I must note you should always charge your fitbit using a laptop, if you use the wall to charge your fitbit it may flood too much power into the battery at once and over time it will ruin your fitbit.<br/>I have only experienced one issue worth noting. A few days after receiving my fitbit it would stop syncing to my phone (Samsung galaxy S7 edge) but it was a very quick and easy fix. I simply restarted my fitbit via the charging cable (press the button 3 times on the end of the charging cable while your fitbit is charging) it fixed the issue and I haven't experienced any problems since.<br/>Overall a 5 star product and I LOVE my Fitbit Alta HR.
 I am a first time Fitbit buyer, and after a long debate between the Alta HR and Charge 2, I decided to buy this Alta HR. I ordered the Large size, but I wear it on the second fastener. I used the printable sizing chart on the Fitbit website, and I am very glad I did - otherwise I would have bought the wrong size! I chose the pictured color, which was black on my Amazon app. I love that it doubles as a watch when you turn your wrist to look at it. I downloaded the Fitbit app to find out that the face is customizable, which was a huge deal for me since I love to customize my belongings. The only reason I am rating it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the face is easily damaged. After a month of wearing it, I have a large scuff on the left side of the screen and a small dent farther down. This does not bother me but I realize it may bother others, so I would suggest buying a screen protector if you're worried about damaging the face. One of the coolest features is the sleep monitoring. I have a hard time sleeping, so it was very interesting to see my sleeping patterns. I also enjoy the hourly reminders to move - I definitely have been more active since I got my Fitbit! I paid for 2-day shipping because I ordered it right before I went on vacation and wanted to see how many steps I would take while I was gone. I received the package a day early, so I appreciate the seller's attention and commitment to my shipping preferences. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to others.
 In general, I like this tracker, but there are a few things about it that are super frustrating. I work as a nanny, and therefore spend a lot of time pushing carts and strollers as well as carrying children. I've found that this tracker does not accurately track steps when doing those activities, even when I also use gps tracking through the app on my phone (which also burns through battery and data). It's really frustrating to go on a four or five mile walk and only have 5,000 steps tracked when I actually took about twice as many. I had the Fitbit One before this, but I switched because I didn't have a great place to clip it other than my bra most days and it was very uncomfortable when carrying children. I also wanted to have a tracker that would monitor my heart rate and better track my overall fitness. As I spend a lot of time hiking on the weekends, I was very disappointed to learn that this tracker (unlike the One) does not track elevation gain. Considering the price tag for this item, I feel like those are two things that need to be resolved. I'm definitely a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>Update: (photo added) Confirmed that it is about a 40% loss in steps and distance when pushing a stroller/cart. I lowered my rating because of my experience with Fitbit customer service. I contacted them because I think a 40%+ loss of data is an unreasonable margin of error and they basically told me that that's how their tracker works and if I don't like it, then I should look into other fitness trackers... It seems fairly obvious that they, as a company, don't care about customer feedback or retention.
 I spent a long time eyeing fitness trackers and wondering if I REALLY needed one.<br/><br/>Well, you don't NEED one to be fit. But I finally decided to go for it with the Alta HR. And I LOVE this thing.<br/><br/>Being able to see my steps encourages me to be more active. Seeing my calorie burn as I go through my day is nice, but even better is seeing how that burn adjusts with different types of workouts- HIIT training vs. different types of yoga classes. I've tried a lot of diets and ultimately found that calories in vs. calories out really is the deciding factor in what I weigh. The fitbit doesn't make my healthy choices for me, but I love having a measure of how much I've burned and how much I should be eating. (On some particularly busy days, I've found I need to eat MORE because I'm burning so much running around.) Seeing where my heart rate is at various points in my workout is nice, and allows me to easily and deliberately choose exercise that puts me in my desired heart rate zone(s) on any given day.<br/><br/>I didn't expect to be that enthused about the sleep tracking feature, but it may actually be my favorite part. I've mostly recovered from severe adrenal fatigue in the last few years, but I still have a tendency to run on way too little sleep, which sets me back. Since the Alta HR  tracks your sleep and subtracts the times at night when you happen to wake up, this has shown me just how restless I can be and how much less sleep I'm getting than I realized. I've been able to make some adjustments to log more quality sleep time,  and it's making a difference in my health.<br/><br/>I'm also a fan of the morning alarm feature, as well as the little buzz you can set to remind yourself to go to bed.<br/><br/>I did change the band out for a leather one, because the rubbery one it comes with isn't attractive, in my opinion. It was easy and cheap to switch, so whatever. I keep the one it came with on hand as a spare.<br/><br/>Yes, you can make healthy choices without this thing. No, you don't "need" it. But it's proving a helpful accountability tool for me, and I'm happy I bought it.
 I wanted to love this, and in fact it is very sleek and unobtrusive.  However, looking at the reviews and online forums, the odds are strong that your Alta will be problematic.  Right out the box my Fitbit was unresponsive, even after several hours on a securely engaged charging port.  After numerous resets, it finally came to life.  Setup and syncing were easy enough, and I enjoyed it for about three weeks (and three charges or so) before it became absolutely unresponsive again.  After a low battery warning, I plugged it in to the finicky charging port.  I was a little concerned when it failed to come back on, but figured it was totally dead.  A few hours later- NADA.  Although I was confident it was seated correctly, I checked the port again and gave it a couple more hours.  Still, it was unresponsive.  Just as I had to right out of the box, I began numerous attempts to reset the unit, pushing the button on the end of the charging port three times in succession (with brief pauses in between) as instructed on Fitbit's website and SEVERAL message boards where other frustrated users have posted the SAME issue (just put the terms "dead fitbit alta" into a search and you'll find plenty of angry and disappointed owners.<br/><br/>Bottom line:  after three weeks, my Fitbit is a paperweight.  My experience is all too common for something this pricey.  Unless you prefer gambling with poor odds (if so, go to Vegas and at least see a show), I'd avoid this item until the company makes serious improvements to their quality control.  This is unfortunate, as it was lovely for the few moments it actually worked.
 I purchased this item because I wanted a fitness watch that would monitor my heart rate during workouts but was also stylish for everyday wear.  (I also have a Polar H7 chest strap but was hoping to move towards a wrist-based device in the gym.  The strap works great, but sometimes it's a hassle.)<br/>On the box, the Alta HR appeared to do everything that I wanted.  After wearing it for four days, I decided to return it.  There are many good things about this device but unfortunately, it did not work for me when I most wanted it - (in the gym)<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>--Aesthetics: The rose gold is worth the extra cost if you prefer gold to silver.  I ordered several accessory bands to dress it up.<br/>Indeed, this device can be dressed up for a night out or dressed for sweat with the included athletic-type band, (or another, if pink isn't your style).<br/>Can't speak to the band color issues -- I didn't keep mine long enough, but I preferred the accessory bands to the pink one, so I only used the stock band in the gym, (because I felt the rubber-texture would hold it's position better/be more comfortable while working out... it did do a great job keeping the Alta in place on my small wrist during my workout.)<br/>Don't choose the pink special edition for the band.  Choose it for the rose gold -- it's really pretty, (well, if you like rose gold... otherwise stick with silver!)<br/><br/>--Ability to change bands:  The design on this device to swap out bands is brilliant!  The process is simple, elegant and straightforward -- takes all of five seconds to transform the appearance.  That clip design creates a seamless and secure attachment, making any band look like it belongs, as long as you've chosen colors that you like with your Alta model -- I felt confident that my device was not going to slip loose.<br/>(I can only speak for snug bands though -- I did not try any "bangle" type bands.)<br/><br/>--Fitbit's platform:  I have enjoyed a Fitbit One for several years and was looking forward to the enhanced capabilities of the Alta HR.  It gives more detailed sleep data, enhanced step tracking, as well as continuous heart monitoring, allowing the device to detect (and thus record) certain types of exercise without having to log them manually.  Lots of great features, (that DO work very well, btw), with this device.  I didn't have any problems with sleep or step recording.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>--Display during workout:  This device does not have a continuous "on" display option.  The Alta HR must be physically tapped to have the display turn on, and then quickly tapped again to see subsequent items.<br/>I wasn't bothered by this during casual wear but found it to be cumbersome in a gym setting -- because it did not allow me to quickly glance at my heart rate when my arms were engaged.<br/>--Display in outdoor settings:  very difficult to see in sunlight.  I needed to go in the shade (or tap/cup to shade really fast) to catch the readings.  Very easy to read indoors.<br/><br/>--Heart rate monitoring:  (This one was the deal breaker for me...)<br/>I checked the accuracy of the heart rate, (resting, normal activities &amp; in the gym), against my <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Polar-H7-Bluetooth-Heart-Rate-Sensor-Fitness-Tracker-Black-X-Small-Small/dp/B00FZX9CW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Polar H7 Bluetooth Heart Rate Sensor &amp; Fitness Tracker (Black, X-Small/Small)</a>.<br/>For resting &amp; day-to-day activities, the Alta was remarkably in sync with the H7.  I expected the margin to be much greater, but my heart rate consistently tracked within 5 beats between the two devices.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it failed at the gym, which is the main reason that I decided to purchase the Alta HR.  To me, this is a defect in the design.<br/><br/>I like to use cardio machines that involve my arms, (specifically Jacob's Ladder).  On that machine, and the elliptical (with fully engaged arms), the Alta HR failed to detect my HR at all!<br/>During a vigorous 20 minute "climb," my Polar app, (linked to the H7 chest strap), allowed me to see that I was maintaining my HR in my target workout zones.  The Alta requires tapping the device to see the stats, so I couldn't check it during my workout (without interrupting the workout).  I worked on, assuming that all was being recorded.<br/><br/>I did not expect perfect counting of steps, (many machines are not compatible with wrist-based step counters), but I did expect my activity to be recorded based on my elevated HR.<br/>After I synced the device with my Fitbit app, there was NO EVIDENCE of my having worked out!  I know that I maintained an elevated heart rate for a full 30 minutes before cooling down and my Alta did not record any part of that time as "active" !!  That tells me that this device is not compatible with normal gym use.<br/><br/>For my gym workout time, I used the pink band that came with the Alta HR, so I know the recording issue was not related to a third party band.  It was properly positioned two finger widths above my wristbone, snug against my skin.  It registered my heart rate &amp; steps UNTIL I started working out and AFTERWARDS, but not DURING.<br/><br/>(And for the record, all three third-party bands that I tested with my H7 (during rest and casual activity) did register perfectly with the Alta.  Fitbit states that third-party bands may yield inaccurate readings.)  I tried the Henoda leather/tan, Swees metal/rose gold and Oitom metal/coffee brown replacement bands -- all three were wonderful.<br/><br/>--Comfort:  This is a mixed bag for me.  The Alta HR is "comfortable enough."  I think all fitness watches are clunky.  I expected this to be no different.  Its narrow profile is really nice but it does not lay as flush as a normal watch and definitely has a presence on the wrist.<br/>At times, it felt stiff/uncomfortable because the sensor is longer than the flat top of my wrist.  The band is designed to keep it in place despite that bit of extra length and it does look nice, but it felt big on me.  Careful adjustment of the strap keeps it from sliding up and down on the wrist.<br/>It comes as close to jewelry as any heart monitoring device on the market today can, so I would have kept it if it had properly recorded my gym activities.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION:<br/>If your gym activities do not involve machines that actively engage your arms, then perhaps this might work well for you.<br/>It works great for walking, jumping around, (fitness classes that don't involve wrist/forearm activity), and can be dressed up with a simple band change, allowing all-day fitness prompts &amp; monitoring in a professional-looking package.  Fitbit has a nice platform with customizable (and thus attainable) goals.<br/><br/>Other members in my family own the Charge HR and Surge -- I haven't tried them, but no one has complained about lacking HR monitoring during activities -- not sure why my Alta HR was unable to do so... (Perhaps mine was defective, but I didn't want to go through the hassle of an exchange.)<br/><br/>I'm going to stick with my Fitbit One for steps &amp; H7/Polar app for the gym.  This experience has reminded me that I wanted a nice new gadget, but didn't really need one.
 I really liked this product at first, but it lasted less than 6 months.  Their customer service has gotten markedly worse.  This was my 5th Fitbit product, but it will be my last.<br/><br/>Last week I went to Nevada.  While walking through the airport, I noticed that the screen was cracked.  There were two thin fractures running parallel down either side (more visible when it lights up).  I don't remember ever hitting it and there are no indications of that being the cause of the crack.<br/><br/>I contacted customer service, who (on the phone) agreed that wasn't right.  They had me email in photos and finally said they consider the screen crack to be normal wear and tear.  Their solution was to offer me 25% off another product.  After I repeated that the product components should last more than 6 months, I was told, "We'd like to assure you that all of our products go through rigorous testing to ensure that they meet the high-quality standards expected. However, due to some factors that are beyond human control, materials that these trackers are made of also reaches its limitation. Same with other devices, it may encounter a manufacturing issue that we can only determine once the customer has experienced<br/><br/>We strive for excellent customer service. Though customer satisfaction remains our number one goal, the demands of running a global business require that we now enforce our warranty consistently. "<br/><br/>Their glass cracked after 6 months and their solution is for me to spend more money with them.  No.  I'll put the money towards another product.
 I switched to the Alta HR after having the Charge HR for the past 2-3 years. I give it 4 stars because, as it does have more features than the Charge HR, they did away with one of my favorite features!<br/><br/>Pros-<br/>-very slim<br/>-definitely more comfortable than the Charge HR<br/>-the band can be changed out to any color/style<br/>-text/call notifications (Charge HR just did call notifications)<br/>-constant reminders to get up and move!<br/>-different display options with cute motivating expressions.<br/>-GPS<br/><br/>Cons-<br/>-You can't start a workout!!<br/>With the Charge HR, you push and hold the button on the side to start and end your workout. The Alta doesn't have this feature. Instead, it has a "SmartTrack" feature that assumes when you're working out after 15 minutes of movement? I personally like to manually start my work outs and the only way to do so, with this Fitbit, is via the app on your phone; which I do not always have with me.<br/>The reason this is such a big deal to me is because I do yoga and other activities, besides my actual crossfit workouts, that weren't picked up by the Alta HR.<br/><br/>Overall, setup was super simple, it works great and looks great! I'll just have to get used to not starting my own workout and trust that it's being recorded!
 Having used this product for about a week and a half I'm pretty discouraged and feeling buyer's remorse. It has a ton of great features and is really motivating...when it works. I've found that it has stopped auto recognizing my exercise, specifically outdoor bicycling. I also noticed that it did not properly record my heart rate during my last bike ride, for no obvious reason, especially considering I double check wrist placement and strap tension before every ride. In addition, when I went back and checked the exercise log on the fitbit.com dashboard (as opposed to my phone app) I saw that it had grossly under-calculated the calories burned during the exercises it had auto tracked. I've spent more time troubleshooting this product and the associated apps than exercising. Seriously. And the answer to every and all problem is either "restart" the device or unpair it from your account/app and reinstall it. And worst of all I saw that this is an ongoing and very common problem with Alta HR devices on the fitbit.com help forums. If it fails during my bike ride tomorrow I'm going to have to return it because I can find plenty of free apps to track my food and calories if this thing is going to be defective in every other regard.
 I purchased 2 Fitbit’s; the Alta HR for myself and the Charge 2 for my husband.  The Alta HR; I love ALMOST everything about it.  It looks and feels great on my wrist and I love the encouragement that it gives when achieving a goal.  The exceptions are; 1) display does not always come on with a double tap as stated and 2) it does not always vibrate when it should.  According to everything I have read, both issues may have been caused by a recent upgrade.  If these were the only 2 issues, I would still be very happy with my Alta HR.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  The biggest issue I have with the Alta HR is that when I take it off for 30 minutes or to shower, wash dinner dishes, etc. it will not pick up the heartbeat again without having to connect it to the charger and forcing a reset.  Being new to Fitbit, it took a couple of nights of failing to track sleep for me to realize what was happening.<br/><br/>My husband’s Charge 2 does not seem to have the same issues; I have ordered a Charge 2 and will return the Alta HR as soon as it arrives.
 BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!  I would have given this no stars, but it did work well for 15-1/2 months.  I always updated it as necessary and never let the battery run completely down.  Two weeks ago, I noticed the green lights for the heart monitor weren't lit so I went online to the forum and found out how to restart the FB so the heart monitor was working again.  Three days later, the FB started vibrating violently for about 30 seconds, then died.  Restarted and charged the battery again and it worked fine for another 3 days, then died completely - couldn't get it to recharge at all.  OK, so I let it sit for 4-5 days then hooked it up to the charger.  Lo and behold, it started charging again (still no green lights) and I got it fully charged.  Then the battery completely drained in less than 6 hours.  So time to talk to the FB support people.  My rep researched my FB, saw it wasn't "working up to their standards" and because it was past the warranty time, offered me a 25% discount on any full price FB from their store.  Such a deal!!  They DIDN'T have any kind of fix for this problem even tho others have experienced the same thing in the year-and-a-half it's been on the market.  Just out of curiosity I spoke to one of their sales reps to see which model was the most reliable and fixable.  He did recommend the Charger 2, but was more interested in trying to sell me an extended warranty and interchangeable bands to customize my look.  Seriously?????  So now I have a $150 piece of scrap metal and will seriously consider whether to buy another Fitbit product.
 I use to have a Fitbit flex and I decided to upgrade to the Fitbit Alta HR. It's a great tracker and helps keep me moving. I synced it to my phone so my fitbit will tell me what number is calling even if my phone is across the room. I can even read text messages on it. The step tracking seems accurate to me. The new sleep tracking is one of my favorite things about this fitbit. With my old fitbit flex I use to have to tell it when I was going to sleep for it to even track my sleep, this Fitbit Altra HR does it all automatically and even tells me what sleep stages I was in and for how long. I do wish the charger was a little longer the cord is very short.<br/>My biggest complaint would have to be the coral band discolors within 1 week of normal wear. I made sure to keep it clean and to deep clean the band every time I charged the tracker but it looks so dingy and gross now and I haven't even owned it for a month. I will be exchanging it for one with a darker band that hopefully won't discolor. The pictures I'm adding are just short of a month of normal use. The inside of the band &amp; the part of the band that is under the excess strap stayed bright and colorful.
 Haven't been able to use it! Syncing / configuring with my computer requires a dongle. Have had neither time nor patience to figure it out or order the dongle. Blah! Why isn't it part of the product!?!
 I am seeing a sleep specialist and she asked me to keep a sleep diary.  well, taking the time to find a pencil and write things down in the middle of the night was giving me anxiety!  So I researched, and in my price range this was the only FitBit that tracked the FOUR stages of sleep - awake, light sleep, deep sleep, and REM.  Every morning I can download it to a sleep help site called Sleepio and I have a record there.<br/><br/>it has also helped me keep up with exercise (good for sleep too!) and drinking water.  I use it with an iPhone 7 and my computer.  Very  happy with how lightweight it is.  Bought a black strap for dress up.  The is my second tracking device.  I had the Garmin Vivofit 2 - this is superior.
 My wife gave this to me as a gift in April 2017.<br/><br/>In March 2018, the band broke on one side where it connects to the tracker. Thankfully I was within the 1 year warranty time frame, and Fitbit sent out a replacement band.<br/><br/>I've had the replacement band on since mid-March, and it broke earlier this week on the other side of the band (see the crack in the picture). So the band can't 'grip' the connector on the tracker.<br/><br/>Fitbit's band replacement policy is tied to your original purchase - so despite the fact they sent a new band (which you'd think would have a 1 year warranty), it's only good as long as your original warranty.<br/><br/>Fitbit support has informed me I can buy a new band for $30 from their website on a $130 tracker. And for what? To have the new band break in 6 months and buy yet another? That's $60/year in bands on a $130 tracker.<br/><br/>This story is VERY common. Check out the Fitbit community site, specifically the Alta HR Product Help forum. There are 8+ pages of complaints about this with no resolution.<br/><br/>Your options, should you choose to buy the Alta HR:<br/>1. Get 1 free replacement band if yours breaks within a year (which it likely will)<br/>2. Spend $30 every 6 months to get an official Fitbit replacement band once out of your original warranty<br/>3. Buy 3rd party bands on Amazon, which if you read the reviews, fail just as much or the color fades or some other issue<br/>4. Decide to avoid this mess and buy from a company that will stand by it's product.<br/><br/>Now I know what you're thinking, maybe this guy was really tough on his band, maybe he didn't take care of it, maybe he took it on and off 20 times per day.<br/><br/>Let's be honest: I'm not as active as I should be... by a long shot. My band wearing was more in line with a watch that you sleep with: wear it all day except for showering. I'm not out here doing extreme sports or being really rough with it. It's just a really poor design, and a genius business model that generates significant revenue for the company once they have you hooked on tracking your stats with their devices.
 This replaced my Jawbone Up Move, which had been malfunctioning for awhile. This was easy to set up, works consistently well, and is so light and comfortable that I forget I'm wearing it.  I use it for step/mileage/sleep tracking, and only take it off to shower.  The only issue I've had is that occasionally the sleep tracker won't give exact data (awake, REM, light, deep); instead it only gives awake, restless, and asleep). I think this happens to others, based on research I've done.  I like the silent alarms (it vibrates at a set time) and the notifications (I use it for calendar alerts and reminders to move).  I find I have to charge it about every 5-6 days, which is fine. I am VERY small-boned, so the small is still a little big for my wrist (mine is 5 inches). The band securely fastens, so losing it would be almost impossible.<br/><br/>If I ever need another tracker, I would definitely buy another one of these.
 I thought I wanted a slimmer, smaller fitbit after having a Charge HR for a year or so. The Charge HR was feeling pretty bulky on my arm. The Alta HR, while slimmer, still feels pretty bulky because of the longer display screen. Because the hardware is longer, the band bends at an awkward place on my wrist and doesn't ever rest quite comfortably on my arm. It make it difficult to find the right band tightness; it's either too tight and won't read my HR, or it's too big and falls too far down my forearm to be a "bracelet' anymore.<br/><br/>I do like the interchangeable band. That feature is very easy; I've already replaced my band with a black band for much cheaper than the difference between Fitbit's fuschia HR &amp; black HR.<br/><br/>I thought I could manage without the button to track workouts, but I was wrong. If you are very active and use that regularly, I would not recommend this version. It's not very accurate at automatic tracking, so I have to be mindful of when my workouts begin and end so I can edit the auto track results. When I'm doing something with a constantly raised HR like elliptical or running, it gets most of the workout. However if you do any sort of combo workout like cardio pilates, bodyweight exercises, etc, in which your HR is varied, you'll find it does not usually pick those up because of the limited categories of tracking in the fitbit app.<br/><br/>I should also note that it does not track stairs, but if you were tracking stairs in the app w/ a previous fitbit, the app will still display stairs when you link the Alta. It would be nice if they could find a way to remove stairs from the app when you link this. I was very confused for the first few days why I had zero stairs every day.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you are just in it for step tracking, it's a fine band. It does the trick. If you are an active person who wants to track your workouts (calories burned, time, etc), I would recommend going for the Charge HR 2 or another band which has manual control over tracking.
 I had a fitbit when they first came out years ago and it just fell apart one day.  So I didn't consider another one until recently when I saw this one.  I like that it is thin and lightweight.<br/><br/>It works well and it has been fun looking at the stats it gives me.  I am a fairly rugged person and so far I haven't scratched or broken it, so it must well made.  It has some sync problems with my android phone.  Sometimes I have to restart the phone to get the two to talk. It syncs beautifully with loseit, which I use to track my food.<br/><br/>It is nice looking and easy to wear;  thin and lightweight, great for me with small arms.  It looks like a classy watch.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how it knows I am walking.  One day I was painting and it gave me credit for over 2000 steps.<br/><br/>The battery does not last a week like claimed.  I have to charge it every evening while I am reading.
 For someone who has never owned a Fitbit before I have to say that I think I found my new love!!!  I researched ALL of the fitbits on Amazon and read tons and tons of reviews!  The Alta HR seems to have everything I was looking for, except that it is not waterproofed.  That part is no big deal because I don't see the need to wear it in the shower.  That is the ideal time to charge it!  Anyway, I have found it so fascinating to see my sleep patterns.  I had no clue how much deep sleep I was getting.  Obviously, I get much more on the weekends!  I was a little surprised that some nights I am only getting around 30 minutes of deep sleep.  I also like it when I reach my daily steps (10,000) and I feel the vibration on my fitbit.  I look down and see the little fireworks of congratulations!  Makes me work harder each day to get my steps in.  The other day it said that I was an over achiever since I was over 12,000 on a regular day.  Ha!  I love it!  I also like that it reminds me to get up and move if I've been sitting too long.  I was at a workshop the other day and had to sit.  I think my fitbit was having a fit that I wasn't moving, LOL!!  One small thing that throws my fitbit off is if I'm sitting and watching a movie or television in the evening.  It thinks I have gone to bed.  The minutes are added to my daily sleep time.  It has only happened twice in the few weeks that I have owned my fitbit, so I just delete that record before I go to bed.  No big deal!!  I do like the slimness of the Alta HR.  I also purchased a nice dressy sliver band to change it out on occasion, but so far I have really liked the black band.  It is really comfortable.  I have to say that the Fitbit Alta HR is one of the best purchases I have made in a very long time!!!  :)
 Changed my opinion about this product after just 3 months of use it started having sync issues, to the point where it won't sync for days. So what is the use of having a tracker with all these features if you can't access the information and stats? Pointless!! Each time it doesn't sync I have to try a different trick or combination of steps that will solve the problem just temporarily. Right now nothing is working, so only useful as a watch and to track daily steps. I am fed up of this and apparently it is a problem that sooner or later all Fitbit users experience. Should have bought another brand and I advice you do likewise. Don't even bother with this one.
 I love that it gives me updates to get me up and moving. I also like that it doesn't have to be close to my phone to let me know when a text or call comes through.
 I hate to say it, but I was not impressed at all by this Fitbit. Most of the time it wouldn't read my heart rate, my steps were always off, and the screen didn't respond well to touch. I had high hopes for this too. It was the first Fitbit I ever owned and had heard so many good things about them. The sleep tracking also seemed to be off as well. It would start to track my sleep even though I was awake in the evening. Maybe another version of a Fitbit may work better, or I may go with another brand all together to see if I get different results. I will say that I did like the way this one looked and loved that there were so many options to change the band. I have small wrists, and the smaller size fit me perfectly. I just wish that it was more accurate.
 I purchased this item as a gift for my sister this holiday season and I wanted to post her review of the Fitbit. I am very glad she loved it!<br/><br/>This Christmas I received a FitBit Alta HR as a gift and was super excited to use it. I love the sleekness of the band and face. It is simple and goes with everything, therefore I chose the Black band with silver sides. I wanted a simple tracker to track my calories/exercise and the fit bit does exactly that. For this Fitbit, you have to tap on the face to switch between screens (time, HR, steps, cals) and one thing I will say is that it is unresponsive to the tap at times. Not a huge deal, but just something to keep in mind. You really do have to tap on it hard sometimes to get the screen to advance. The set up was incredibly easy and linked to an apple phone. No problems with set up, super easy and straightforward.<br/><br/>The battery is great, I am on day 5 and at about 30% left with one charge so I think I will most likely get 7 days out of every charge which is amazing. The band isn't water proof, but it is "water resistant" which is nice in case water splashes when you're washing your hands/dishes/etc. I read negative reviews about how the step counting was off and the band is too sensitive, as in it was counting steps that weren't being taken. So far, I haven't noticed this on my Fitbit and it has been working excellently. I can't wait to take full advantage of the app and looking at reports, etc. It's only been a few days but I am excited to integrate the Fitbit into my day to day life! I'll give updates if there is anything that becomes problematic in the future!
 Let me start this review by saying my previous fitbit was a Blaze, which I loved (and sadly broke the screen on.) I knew I was stepping down in quality with the Alta, but I didn't realize how much. I will try to write a good pros and cons list for this device, but I definitely regret buying it.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>-One of the most feminine fitbits. I feel like it suits my wrist better.<br/><br/>-I have sensitive skin and neither the band or the watch cause me to break out.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>-Not great battery life. It usually goes 3 days for me. My blaze went longer and it had a color screen and more features.<br/><br/>-high profile. It may be thinner in width than the blaze, but it sticks out farther from my wrist. I find it much more uncomfortable to sleep in or even just wear around.<br/><br/>-the band is uncomfortable because the edge comes to a point and digs into your skin a little when you lean on it. You're not going to get a cut, but it is pokey and uncomfortable.<br/><br/>-the motion sensor for the display to turn on is very finicky. I sometimes have to do an over exaggerated "raising my arm" motion two or three times to get it to turn on.<br/><br/>-the touch screen is quite frankly horrible. There is one tiny spot near the top of the screen that actually accepts input. I often have to tap it three or four times for it to work, and then I usually go past the screen I want because it wasnt working and it starts suddenly and I have tapped too much then.<br/><br/>-One of the most annoying parts I think is that the Alta doesn't have an on/off switch. You turn it on by plugging it in. You turn it off by letting the battery die. The Bluetooth connection is iffy, and resetting/forcing it to work without being able to turn the device off is frustrating.<br/><br/>-the user interface can be a bit annoying. The screen sleeps super fast, and once it sleep it defaults back to the time. So of I'm working out, every time I want to check my heart rate I have to tap back through again with the iffy touchscreen. I think I can change what the home screen shows through the app, but I'm not going to switch it between being a useful watch and being a useful heart rate monitor every time I work out. Thats just a bit much.<br/><br/>-the only place you can access the watch settings is through the app, and you have to resync each time you change the settings. I know they were simplifying the watch portion, but its kind of a hastle. Especially when your watch is being stubborn about syncing.<br/><br/>-it disconnects from Bluetooth a lot. Like... A lot a lot. Every other day or so. Then its a process of restarting my app a time (or two sometimes) to get it syncing again.<br/><br/>-I find that when I sleep I often get "simple sleep" feed back. Meaning the heartrate monitor didn't work accurately. I don't have issues with the heartrate monitor during the day, so I'm not sure what the problem is.<br/><br/>All in all, I wish I had just spent the extra money and gotten a better fitbit. I gave it three stars because despite all its many failings, it does actually do what its supposed to do. It tracks my heartrate and steps.
 Best investment I have ever purchased for myself.
 Mother's Day gift from my husband and children. I have only had it two days and it is already making me more aware of what I eat and how much I move. I have very small wrists and it is not bulky at all. In fact, it's flattering. It seems to be accurate. I am pleased.
 The heart rate monitor seems somewhat accurate if worn correctly. I like the silent alarms. The battery life is good. But those are the only things I actually like about the Alta HR. It's completely inaccurate with step counting. Often times I wake up and it says I've walked 75+ steps and haven't even gotten out of bed yet. The tap screen is finicky. Sometimes too sensitive, other times I'm whacking it like a maniac and it won't respond, which is especially irritating when I'm trying to turn off a silent alarm. The wristband stretched and discolored. I wish I saved my money and didn't even bother with it. My phone is more accurate in tracking walks, runs, and hikes. The app is terrible too.
 <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Fitbit-Alta-HR-Black-X-large-US-Version/dp/B06XCH3FDX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fitbit Alta HR, Black, X-large (US Version)</a> I was all excited about getting a fitbit for the first time. I saw the Alta HR and the thin line design and thought, oh good, not so huge on my wrist. I measured my wrist, like it said to do, had someone even help me do this. I showed I have a size 8 in wrist. I have large bones, lol. After it arrived. I read the instructions three times. Put the fitbit on the charger while I was reading them. Nowhere in the instructions did it say to let the thing charge before using, but you do want to do this. Once it was charged I put it on for the first time. I put it where I thought it should be and looked and it was the last hole. So, instead of the x-large band, I should have gotten the large band. No problem, will just buy new bands. It says to tap it to show the time, I tap, nothing, so I tap harder, still nothing. I give it a good tap, ah, it is awake. My biggest thing I do not like about this is that I do have to tap it quite hard to get it to activate. Plus wearing it with the face up on my wrist I get one pulse measurement, wearing it with the face underneath my wrist, my pulse measurement went up 3. So which is correct? The one on top of the wrist or the one closer to the blood vessels that pump the blood? In conclusion, I am not sure at all how accurate these devices are at all, but I do know one thing, it does wake me up without an annoying alarm clock, and it has made me more aware of my physical movement. And it is sort of fun. Just can't seem to get the app to work to its fullest potential at the moment. No way of keeping a food diary or chart.
 This was a gift for my mom so my only real experience with it has been configuring it and a little tinkering.  What I can say is the heat rate appears to be very accurate and it does keep track of everything it's advertised to.  Battery life is very good too; 4 days no problem.  However, I must grip a bit as it can be difficult to "wake" it up at times and to switch between displays.  But there have been larger issues here...<br/><br/>About 2 weeks after receiving this, my mother mentioned nothing was syncing.  All local functions worked fine, just would not communicate with her phone.  Given her phone is an older Galaxy Mini, I figured we'd try some other devices.  My phone nor her Amazon Fire would detect it.  Tried a reset, resync, etc...nothing.  I finally broke down and swapped it out and the new one synced up instantly.<br/><br/>I hope we just got a dud because it seems to be a very nice device plus she does really like it.  I guess we'll see if this next one lasts longer than 2 weeks.
 I have been totally motivated and I lost 10 pounds in 1 month thanks to my Fitbit that keeps me on track. I use the app with my Samsung Note 3 and I enter the food that I eat. This app feature is easy to use and also has a barcode reader. I did not purchase the Fitbit scale because of the price but I did purchase a Weight Watchers scale from Walmart that gives me body fat bone mass Etc.<br/>I can log this information into the fitbit app on my cell phone and I can see my progress clearly. I love my Fitbit.. well I'm off to go get my 10000+ daily steps. Yes my dog loves my Fitbit too because he gets to walk with me.
 It worked great for about two weeks. I love it. It tells me my steps, calories burned, and hours of sleep. It was an eye opener for how much I sit still during the day at work. It got me up off my butt and move.<br/>After about 2 weeks, it stopped syncing with my phone. That is when my husband told me that all phones have this problem with the Fitbit. And it is an ongoing issue in all the forums.<br/>I still like it. But I have to disconnect it from my phone and reconnect it to get data. When you do this, it deletes all your history.<br/>You can still see number of steps, calories burned, and miles walked on your watch. It just for the day and resets at midnight.<br/>You also can see text messages and phone calls from your watch. But can not respond or answer. It is a cool feature.<br/>You can also set alarms. And it vibrates when you sit too long.<br/>Very easy to set up and use. Love it. Only gave it 3 stars because the sync to phone issue is a big one for me. I like to track my progress. It keeps me motivated.
 The Alta HR worked fine for about three weeks and then stopped displaying sleep stages with a message that it was not able to monitor my heart pulse. After trying everything I could find on the Fitbit forum and then spending a lot of time with three different service reps, the issue was not resolved. The agents were courteous and suggested all the obvious possibilities such as where to wear the unit, tightness of the band, firmware update, turning various options on or off, etc. While I tried all these things prior to contacting them, I can understand them walking me through them in the event that I might have missed something. When everything was tried, they were still polite but gave no indication what they would do to fix the problem and it looked like I would be stuck with a unit that didn't perform as advertised. Fortunately I was able to return the unit to Amazon for a refund (thank you Amazon). IMO and from reading the forum on this device, I think there are still bugs that need to be fixed and it is not fair to the consumer to sell a feature that has not been proven to work consistently.
 I purchased my Fitbit approximately 6 months ago from Amazon, as my UP2 by Jawbone was starting to fail and Jawbone was going out of business and customer service was unavailable..  UP stopped tracking for a couple of days in October, so I charged my Fitbit and started using it along with my UP2.  In the past month, with only TWO months of service, my Fitbit no longer tracks my heart rate (no green, blinking lights), never calcs my workouts correctly, or sometimes not at all and my Jawbone UP is working perfectly.  When I contacted Fitbit, they said basically the warranty is only good for 45 days, unless you purchased from them.  WTF???  So my Fitbit is going in the trash as it is worthless and I will never buy another FITBIT of any kind in the future.  Thanks for nothing but frustration, Fitbit.
 A few things worth noting about my FitBit: Step measurement is occasionally inaccurate (when you rock in a rocking chair or blow dry your hair, you accumulate "fake" steps, and in the thousands), wearing the FitBit per the instructions can be uncomfortable (less like a watch - they instruct you to wear it one "finger" length after your wrist bone, and even further "up" your wrist in order to accurately gauge active heart rate during exercise. Lastly, it is disappointing that active minutes (ie cardio, running, etc.) do not sync to My Fitness Pal - it only syncs steps, so true calories burned/minutes exercised do not offset your food intake that day - only steps.<br/><br/>The sleep tracking is informative and interesting. I am also surprised to learn how often doing "household" chores or day-to-day tasks can elevate heart rate and result in fat burning exercise. All in all, I do love my device and it is excellent for motivation, accountability, and tracking your progress/goals.
 As someone who is used jawbone in the past as well as cheap Chinese knockoffs, and bellabeat leaf urban/nature I have to say this so far this is my favorite tracker on the market. Regardless of the fact that it's not waterproof even though somehow the Chinese version I bought got $20 can be waterproof and still have HR.... I still love the fact that the heart rate is accurate in my case I love the look of this piece I love the colors out of the bands all of the options for the bands I love the screen itself yes it's a little difficult to read in direct sunlight but if you just cup your hand over your wrist you'll be able to see its screen just fine. This Fitbit motivates me to get up to move I sync it with my Fitness Pal it does wonders to keep me motivated. I can honestly say that it has played a huge part in my weight-loss Journey. MyFitnessPal app to see my stats with day to be congratulated by the community is part of the reason i choose Fitbit and continues to play a part of the reason I got in the first place. The Chinese knockoffs  Chinese versions that I was using didn't have a community aspect and they didnt help by allowing other people help cheer you on and relate to what you're thinking and saying and feeling. I bought mine at a steal of $119 on Valentine's Day I don't know if it would pay the $159 that's offered currently at right now it's a very steep price point I don't know if I might be worth waiting to see if it comes out with something new and even better within the time frame but for right now the Fitbit HR Alta has met most of my needs and then the terrific job of motivating me getting me in sync with my body my health my fitness and definitely show me what's lacking in my life and What needs to improve I couldn't have done that without the this fitbit! :)
 I was hesitant to purchase this, but it's fantastic. It's simple and makes it easy to keep up with my activity, track my sleep, etc. My only wish is that it was a little smaller and didn't stick off my wrist so much.
 I have owned two Fitbit HRs over the last five years or so, but I was interested in the smaller Alta HR. I was disappointed with it pretty quickly-especially with the heart rate and activity tracking. The heart rate tracking would give me the dreaded “- -“ at the peak of my workout regularly. I also found that it wouldn’t automatically record my active minutes as readily as my previous Charge HR did.  I really hate having to go in and log every workout that I do.  Now, 7 months after my Alta HR purchase, my band has broken and it falls off of my wrist several times a day.  I considered myself a loyal Fitbit customer up until this purchase. My frustration with this product outweighs the money I spent on it. It still works well for things like tracking steps (more accurately than the Charges I’ve had) and sleep, but it just isn't as good of a product as I expected from Fitbit.
 I started with a Bellabeat leaf as my first fitness tracker because the features on all trackers seemed similar.  I returned the leaf because it was inaccurate or just failed to record all together.<br/><br/>What I’ve learned since getting the alta HR... the alta is equally or more petite and passable as a watch.  The bands are very easy to swap and fasten (not so on the leaf) and the whole thing looks expensive even though it was cheaper than the Bellabeat.  I’ve also found that this app tracks quite a bit more and goes into quite a bit of depth about sleep patterns, quality of sleep, calorie burning, etc.<br/><br/>I also feel as though I got the mini version of the apple watch since the alta HR has a customizable display and phone integrations.  I do see the texter’s name as part of the alert on the alta and if I tap right away it will scroll the entire message for me as well.<br/><br/>Sort of far down in the review at this point l, but if you are still reading and have size questions...  My wrist is about 6.25”.  This was towards the upper end of small but still within so I ordered the small.  It seems that the upper end still has a quite generous tolerance, so I’d say the bands run big.  I purchased the silver magnetic band in small as well and it’s nearly  fully doubled over (small as it goes), so don’t size up.
 The device was completely worthless for counting steps. It only got about 20% of the number I take, even after doing the recommended fix of multiple resets. After a long period of time with a support person, who confirmed that the device was not working properly, they tried to talk me into buying another model at a 50% "discount."  I refused and they are supposed to be shipping a replacement, but I am genuinely appalled at company policy here. I'm sure others have had a good experience with Fitbit, but don't count me in as one of them. It's really too bad.
 Bought this to track sleep.  I use another pedometer, a separate food log, and track daily activity and food that way.  With Fitbit Alta HR, I've been able to combine all of this into one with added features.  I have a very small wrist and the small band was perfect with a couple of holes left at the top!  This slim style is comfortable to sleep in, which I was concerned about.  It tracks the different levels of sleep - awake, light, REM, and deep.  You can download the data into an Excel spreadsheet if needed.  I can very easily add food eaten, a lot easier than the other apps I am using.  It also track heart rates and steps.  It took a little bit of reading and research to set it up.  The sleep tile didn't show up until the tracker was fully charged.  It doesn't mention this in the manual or the card that was sent.  This package only has the charger, not the wireless bit to go into the computer.  After I fully charged it, the setup was super easy.  That is the only thing I wish they had said beforehand was the charging.  I was skeptical, being in my 60s, I don't like gadgets or electronic things to constantly have to monitor for accuracy or syncing.  This seems to be so easy, I just wear it, use my iPhone to manage the app, and everything takes care of itself.  This little gem goes way beyond my expectations.  I highly recommend it.
 Love it.<br/>I ordered the extra large because I wear it on my ankle for a more accurate measurement of my actual movement and strides (especially when you're carrying something or standing still and moving your hands a lot.) If you're worried about it falling off your ankle just use a shoe string and put it through the buckle loop and one of the holes on the band and tie it together.<br/>You can also measure your heart rate on your ankle if you make sure to put it over a visible vein or right above the inside anklebone on your ankle (also keeps the main flat part from jutting at an awkward angle too) if you're worried about that.<br/>I sometimes have issues with it connecting to my phone, but I'm not sure if it's my phone's bluetooth, or my bracelet. Eventually I can get it to reconnect, but other than that, it's perfectly fine.
 This looks great and the software is fantastic but the alta itself is a huge miss.  The alarms are very weak and can’t be adjusted. They’re also extremely short and that can’t be adjusted either. No support for email.  I had a Garmon vivosmart before. It was capable of doing all these things, it just looks like they designed it to use in a factory. In my case I’ll have to decide on functionality or poor design. What a shame Fitbit can’t get this basic market right after all these years. They seem a little too focused on their top end the units.  I would think they could take all of the Garmon Vivosmart sales if you could adjust the vibration time and get an email notification.  Obviously this is a choice they’ve made since there’s no reason the software couldn’t do this.
 I owned a Fitbit Charge HR prior to owning the Alta HR. I had issues with the band on the Charge HR, so when the band deteriorated to the point I could no longer wear the Charge, I decided to get an Alta. I used the silent alarm on my Charge a lot. The silent alarm on the Alta is very poor. I was actually surprised that the alarm didn’t really offer any more vibration than it did. I’ve owned three different types of Fitbits. When I get ready to purchase another fitness tracker, I plan to look closely at other brands. I’ve grown less and less satisfied with Fitbit products.
 this is my 5th or 6th Fitbit.  some have been lost, some have been put aside because they don't do enough, and my Charge HR flat out broke - although the unit itself still works!  But the Charge HR is a little too big for what I want in an everyday whereable.  Had replaced it with a flex that was fine, but realized missed the heart rate monitor part A LOT!  So this is my compromise.  See, when you are walking or running, the flex will record steps and time which is translated to distance and calories.  But it doesn't tell how hard you are working.  Having the heart rate monitored adds that extra bit of information.  You will work harder carrying in multi bags of groceries than you will just walking back and forth from the car.  You will work harder carrying bags of mulch into the garden than you will just carrying a rake.  Walking the floor with the baby uses more calories than walking the same circuit with a dust rag.  But the only way the Fitbit computer knows that is my recording your heart rate.  The charger hook up is better than the old ways also.  My old Charge HR was always difficult to hook up to the special USB set up and the flex had to come out of the band completely.  This charges quickly and holds the charge for about a week.  Have even forgotten to take it off before going into the shower and no harm done!
 I was only able to afford this when it was put on sale during Cyber Monday.  Wish I had saved my money.  The HR stands for Heart Rate, so I assumed that the heart rate counts would be accurate.  Wrong.  It's usually not even in the ballpark.  I was using a pulse oximeter to check the accuracy and the Fitbit was often as much as 15 beats per minute off.  The step tracker is also inaccurate (and yes, I did my stride measurement and entered it into the app).  The exercise feature inaccurately registers calories burned for various activities - for example, it shows 118 burned in 30 minutes of high intensity aerobics for someone my weight, whereas the accurate count is 243 or higher..<br/><br/>Foods logged cannot be removed from the master list ever.  I don't understand this at all.  If you log something that you'll probably only eat once or rarely (for example, Cajun rice), it will be on the master list forever and the list will become so cluttered that it'll give you a headache trying to pick something from it to log that you eat regularly.  I totally DO NOT understand why they would block you from removing items from your food list.  Makes no sense at all.<br/><br/>One thing I do like is the "get moving" alert where the unit vibrates for a couple of seconds to tell you that you need to get up and move.  I need that because sometimes I can be reading a book and completely lose track of the time and not even realize that I've been sitting or almost 2 hours (or sometimes longer).  But this one feature wasn't worth the price of admission.
 I mainly got this to help with my mental health problems &amp; to help with my Service Dog in Training (to confirm that when he alerts me, my heart rate is exceptionally low or high.) Love it! Normally don't treat myself to such expensive things but a great medical purchase! It can take a second to get an appropriate heart rate reading but it seems accurate and I LOVE the sleek design. Not too bulky and looks like a bracelet :)<br/><br/>I also like the app though if you have a computer I think you can still use the program. It helps keep track of things long term and give you a better perspective on how you are sleeping and such. In using it, I've been able to make a lot of better changes to my life (i.e. getting to bed earlier, making sure I relax first, etc.) because I have a visual showing me how I'm doing over a span of weeks/months.<br/><br/>As far as fitness purposes goes, been quite helpful! I really like that it keeps track of my exercise for me. I don't use the hourly notifications because they got annoying but I do like that I get rewarded (at least with the fun animation of stars or a rocket going into space) when I hit my daily step/mile goal.<br/><br/>Only things I don't like is that it isn't entirely water proof but maybe one day there will be one. I don't swim or anything but I would prefer it was waterproof for showering, being outdoors, washing dishes, etc.
 On sizing, I was right on the line for size L, so I took a chance and bought XL instead. I am glad I did.  The hole for the tightest fit was just nice, but I noted that the set up instructions recommended that I should wear it such that it is movable and not tight and at least 1 finger width ABOVE my wrist bone (i.e. towards the elbow, not towards the fingers). This means that I had to use the next hole for a looser fit. On top of that, when exercising, Fitbit recommends that one wears the device 2-3 fingers above the wrist bone ie I would need to wear it even looser.  I am glad I bought the XL. If I had gotten the L, it would be too tight and too short for the 2-3 finger width requirement.<br/><br/>Lastly, it only charges via the USB port linked to a computer. It does not charge if I plug it into my iphone charger.
 I really liked this Fitbit up until recently. It had been working to track my sleep, steps, heart rate, etc. but now, it doesn't want to sync with the app and doesn't seem to track my sleep or steps through the app any longer. I've had this Fitbit for just a little over a year and figured for the price, it would last longer. I've taken good care of it and there's no damage so I'm not sure if this is just what happens with most Fitbits or my is just an unusual case.<br/><br/>For the first year, it worked really nicely and did everything it claimed to do. But now, I'm wondering if I should have just stuck with my cheaper Garmin Vivofit instead - despite having fewer features. At least it consistently worked, was waterproof, and only needed a battery replacement every year and a half.
 I have had my Alta HR for a few weeks now. I like it so far. The band is a regular watch-like band, so it's easy to get on and off.<br/><br/>My problems with the fitbit so far:<br/><br/>1. I am a side sleeper and I constantly fall asleep on it, which cuts off the circulation in my arm. The sleep tracker is probably better for a back sleeper.<br/><br/>2. I am not sure how accurate the heart rate and heart rate ones are, sometimes it seems really off. My heart rate can reach 120 at the peak of my workout and it never reaches the highest exercise zone.<br/><br/>3. Consistently fails to log active minutes when I am doing stationary exercise like the row. Sometimes it logs as elypical.<br/><br/>4. I have been shocked by this thing several times, mostly in bed. I am young and hearty, but pacemakers beware.
 I bought this as an upgrade to my Alta, and I'm very happy with it. I wanted the more advanced sleep analysis and tracking, to help manage sleep problems due to fibromyalgia.<br/><br/>It's nice and small, which is good because I have very small wrists. The Small band size is juuuust slightly too loose on the smallest setting, so I have third party bands that I like. That said, the regular band it comes with IS really nice, and I would still wear it. The face isn't too large, so it doesn't get bulky or anything. It's no more obtrusive than a watch.<br/><br/>It lasts a really long time on a charge, much longer than the regular Alta. I charge it about once a week, but I only have it track my sleep and steps, and do not use it for notifications or as an alarm.<br/><br/>The only problem with this is the app, so I won't take any stars off since the band is not the app. KEEP IN MIND THAT THE APP DOES NOT OFFICIALLY SUPPORT ALL PHONES, AND THEY DO NOT UPDATE OFTEN. I've only had "unsupported" phones, and they just have trouble syncing about 5% of the time, for me at least. It doesn't affect how well the Fitbit itself works though.<br/><br/>Overall, well worth the money. I would absolutely recommend it even if you only use it for 2 things like I do.
 Did not cause allergic reaction, unlike my last one (Blaze).  And not so easy to lose like the One.  I have tried them all I think, but so far this one works best for me. Comfortable, and I love the ease in changing colors of bands.  I bought many colors.  It has gotten me back on my diet and fitness efforts.  Hint to dieters, very useful if you track everything you eat.  The estimate of calories burned and logging intake of calories works great for me in keeping on a diet.  As soon as I stop doing that I notice my weight starts creeping up.  It is a bit laborious but worth the effort.  Too bad it can't tell what you ate automatically (maybe the next model :-))
 I love that I can wear as a watch or put in a clip.  I have had the Fitbit one in the past which was great.  When it started to go after 5 years, I opted for the Alta HR.  Great choice.  I also like it sends text and alerts from my phone. I didn't care for the wrist band it came with. I have an extremely small wrist, the band was on the last hole.  I purchased a flexible wrist band and made wearing more comfortable.
 ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!<br/>I originally wanted a fitbit no more than 80 dollars (ordered it during black friday) and the screen size didnt matter much to me as I'd have the app with all the details and I'm sooo so glad I made the purchase. The fitbit can show the time, your heart rate, the battery, calories burned, active minutes, steps, distance traveled, and the alarm if you set one!<br/><br/>I'm gonna go into more depth<br/><br/>For starters, it's extremely comfortable. Battery lasts foreverrrrr. My battery would be about 75 percent, I pop it in the charger for about 10 minutes for a quick pre-work shower, and the battery is back on! It lasts for days and I've never had it almost empty yet!<br/><br/>Ever since I got the fitbit I was able to see how many calories I truly burn and found out I was eating a 1300 calorie deficit (very bad!!!) Which explained my constant struggle with not losing weight but relief of not gaining<br/>Ever since I got my fitbit I'm down 9 pounds in 2 weeks!<br/><br/>The alarm at first I didnt think I would wake up to, even with me being a light sleeper, but it wakes me up straight away and in a relaxing way, not a jolt kind of manner.<br/><br/>The app has a community and you can join groups as well as share progress, tips, or ask for some which has been extremely helpful and motivating.<br/><br/>If you want that kickstarting motivation to keep yourself on track, this is it!
 I felt compelled to write about Fitbit's stunning lack of dependality and product quality. I've had the original Fitbit, the Fitbit Blaze and currently, the Fitbit Alta HR. I received the former two as gifts and both failed within a few months of ownership. Please bear in mind that I take great care of my gadgets. Both failed after normal use. The Alta HR was no different. This was purchased on May 24 and now the heart rate component doesn't work. I've tried to remove the device and connect it to my phone, recharging after depleting the battery and even turning the heart rate on and off through the app. Although I love the form factor, that's about the only facet of this model that I can compliment. It's highly frustrating for a company to sell products at this price point only to receive faulty items that fails to hold its price.
 The fitbit would not take a charge. Not sure if the problem was the fitbit or just a bad charger. The only option from customer service was to return the unit. Which meant to reirder a new fitbit and go through the entire process of setting a new one uo. It would of much essier to at least try to send out just a new charger.
 I am a woman with a small wrist. After reading reviews for various trackers, I decided that the Alta HR would be best for my needs. Unfortunately, after using it for a week and a half, I had to return it. The first problem was that the Alta HR did not accurately count my steps. It would register far more steps than I actually took. For example, my bed is approximately 8 feet from my bathroom. When I would get up in the morning the Alta HR would record 50+ steps for the 15 or so actual steps I took to and from the bathroom. I believe it was interpreting my handwashing as steps. I called Fitbit customer service and the very nice rep told me to restart the Alta HR and see if that solved the issue. I did so, and then checked my actual steps against what the Alta HR registered. I did this test at my Y's indoor track, carefully counting 100 actual steps. I repeated the experiment about 8 times. Only once did the Alta HR come close to my actual steps. Each time it was over or under about 15 - 30 steps. The Alta HR also would not respond smoothy to my taps or wrist movement. The clock face on the Alta HR is supposed to light up when you turn your wrist. This rarely happened. I experimented with gentle and sharp turns, and it rarely turned on. I would try tapping it to turn on the clock face, and again, the Alta HR would only intermittently flash the clock face. The lack of response to tapping was also annoying when trying to access the other stats such as heart rate, active minutes, etc. Finally, the Alta HR was not comfortable to wear. I tried wearing it with the original band, and that was either too tight or loose. I immediately bought an infinitely-adjustable metal mesh band with magnetic closure to see if that would fit better. It allowed me to wear the Alta HR at its recommended looseness for daily use, and tighten it up for more accurate measurements during workouts.  Even with this band, the Alta HR was uncomfortable. It would knock against my wrist bone throughout the day, and wake me up at night. I believe a tracker that lays flat against your wrist, instead of sticking so far up, would be more comfortable. The one positive thing about the Alta HR was the sleep tracking. It was interesting to see my sleep patterns for the time I was wearing it. However, due to the step count being so wrong, I wonder how accurate the sleep  data was. I am now looking at either a Garmin or Apple watch.
 I've been using my alta HR for about 4 months now. I was very happy with my original alta but upgraded to the HR when it came out. While the alta HR is a really great item, it definitely isn't perfect and I found the lack of clear information about it's actually features to be lacking. Here are some of the pros/cons that I think people might want to know before buying:<br/><br/>PROS<br/>-Sleep tracker is neat but I pretty much stopped checking it after a while. It tends to show you as getting less sleep than you actually do and that can lead to anxiety for some people. Now I charge it at night.<br/>-Wrist band now has a buckle which is way more secure than other trackers. No more worrying about it popping off your wrist!<br/>-The HR monitor is pretty great for a wrist device. I use a chest HR monitor during my workouts and the 2 readings are usually pretty similar. The alta needs to be tight on your wrist though!<br/>-For some reason they removed the date display from the watch. I really like wearing a wristwatch and the original alta also displayed the date, which was helpful.<br/>-You can choose what info you want to display on the watch itself as well as the app.<br/>-I really like the app. I usually keep it open while I'm on the elliptical so I can watch my heart rate in real time.<br/><br/>CONS<br/>-There is no feature that allows you to start a workout. If you do an activity continuously for 10-15 mins it will give you a summary afterward of calories burned, and heat rate. You cannot use it to track steps/distance for a specific activity however...it only gives a daily total. (It's pretty smart though, knows when I've been biking).<br/>-After days of continuous wear (I took it off to shower and to charge/clean it). I developed an itchy rash under the charging area. I take it off at night now and that seems to help<br/>-The battery doesn't last a super long time. I was charging it everyday while I was in the shower, but it always seemed to be running low. Again, I charge it at night now.<br/>-If the alta is not tight against your skin, you may get wildly inaccurate readings.<br/>-If you want an accurate resting HR reading, you MUST sleep with the watch tightly clasped.<br/>-Perhaps to be expected but the bands get quite dirty and I had a hard time cleaning them. I mostly stick with the black one since it hides dirt the best.<br/>-As with the original alta, it does not count flights of stairs climbed; only steps, distance and heart rate.<br/>-Reading the watch can be annoying. It is supposed to display the time when you lift your arm to your face, but it doesn't always do that. Then I find myself tapping it like a madman in frustration. Once it's on, its easy to cycle through features however.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm happy with it. There are a few flaws with the actual design of the watch, but you cannot get a more accurate, continual HR watch for a better price.
 I wasn't sure if I would like this as much as my Charge HR, but I like this better. The thinner profile works for my wrist and I like that the HR sensor is flush with the back of the tracker. I was concerned that this doesn't track stairs climbed or allow you to press a button to start a work out, but I realized I rarely used that feature,typically allowing the auto tracking to do the work. So this works for me just as well on the Alta. As others have mentioned, the light band on the rose gold can stain quickly. I bought some other bands through Amazon that are a darker color and use those daily. I use the lighter one occasionally. I was hesitant to buy the rose gold but so far no scratching or wear is showing with daily and nightly wear. It looks great with the pink band and additional navy, gray and white bands I purchased. Bands are very, very easy to switch out, taking a few seconds at most. One negative is the lack of a button. Sometimes it can be hard to stop an alarm, requiring a lot of screen tapping but after reading a tip elsewhere to tap where it says Fitbit on the screen, that works! I have noticed that the screen comes on more consistently than my Charge HR did when I turn my wrist. I have owned this a couple months and am very pleased. I have owned several Fitbit trackers and so far, this is my favorite.
 I've had my Fitbit Alta HR a little over two weeks now and enjoy seeing how many steps I take in any given day, calories burned and my heart rate.  There are two things, however, that don't always seem accurate.  One is calories burned after a workout.  I know what my machine says and what Fitbit says and they don't match even a little close.  Fitbit shows much less.  The other is the amount of sleep which sometimes is rarely correct and usually shows less than I know I slept.  For those two reasons, I gave Fitbit three stars.  Otherwise, I'm enjoying Fitbit keeping me up and moving so I can meet my daily step goal.<br/><br/>UPDATE 11/9/2018: I'm not sure at all now about the accuracy regarding the number of steps I take on any given day. Example (one of many I could give you): Yesterday I needed 37 more steps to reach my daily goal of 10,000 steps. I was sitting down getting my nails done when I realized this. The next thing I knew, about 30 minutes later and still sitting down, my Fitbit went into it's fireworks display indicating I'd reached my goal.......but I never took one step in those 30 minutes. Inaccurate? Seems so to me. Maybe I should only give two stars.<br/><br/>Fitbit needs to look into these various inaccuracy issues I've mentioned and work out the bugs. Otherwise what's the point of owning one?!?
 It does its job in keeping track of steps taken and reminders to get moving. It also tracks heart rate and miles walked. However, I have tendonitis in my feet so I use the exercise bike at the gym more than anything; unfortunately, the Fitbit Alta HR doesn't recognize that. But it does recognize, as "cardio," when I mow my lawn so I guess that's a bit of a trade off.<br/><br/>The smart phone app is pretty good and the device communicates well with it. One thing I've had trouble with -- and I see others have similar complaints about this particular model, is that it doesn't monitor my sleep correctly. I'm very impressed by the detailed charts and graphs it sends to my phone, but it doesn't start monitoring my sleep until around 3 am or even later. I've set up both my bedtime and wake up times but the Fitbit doesn't start registering anything about my sleep for several hours. Clearly, this is a glitch within the device since so many people are reporting similar problems on Fitbit's website.<br/><br/>So, I like it as far as keeping up with my steps (I've set it to the standard 10,000 a day) but the sleep monitoring is a bit disappointing. I was as eager to learn more about that as I was keeping up with my walking schedule since I often have sleep problems. It only records three or four hours of sleep a night for me since it skips the first three or four hours.<br/><br/>Another minor thing I didn't care for is the silicone strap that comes on the device. I bought a leather replacement  see pictures] which is SO much better! There are a multitude of styles, colors, and materials available in replacement bands online so there's something for everyone at reasonable price too.<br/><br/>It needs to be charged about every four and a half days or so which is a bit more often than Fitbit's estimation of about seven days. Charging is easy via USB  only] either through a laptop or USB charging cube. Charging is done strictly via the Fitbit cable (included). While it's easy to clip the charger onto the device, care must be taken to ensure the contacts on the charger align properly with the contacts on the device. When it's clamped on correctly, the device will vibrate for a second or so. Charging isn't all that fast, and I haven't actually timed it. I'd estimate a couple of hours for full charge but that's just a guess.<br/><br/>What I recommend for anyone interested in a Fitbit is that you thoroughly compare all the Fitbit models and read all you can about each one, especially reviews from people who own them. That's the best way to determine what's right for you.
 I've used a Fitbit charge several years ago that I've misplaced during a move.  Not wanting to give up my traditional watch, I grabbed the Alta as it was one of the smaller Fitbits.<br/><br/>Pros<br/><br/>Thin and unobstructing.<br/><br/>Highly visible display<br/><br/>Fitbit app is good for calorie counting and general exorcise tracking<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>Non standard charger (not micro/mini USB/ USB C)<br/><br/>App doesn't sync to device with no network connection<br/><br/>Over-estimates calories burned, and this seems to be a big issue if you look around the Fitbit forums.  Just yesterday it claimed I was pushing 4,000 calories burned, but outside of some walking and standing around I didn't do much in terms of physical activity.  Didn't even manage to hit the gym like I normally do.  I believe this is the result of a gross miscalculation of calories burned by walking, as it's tracking walking at a steady, non rushed pace as 10+ calories burned per minute while most other sources online put someone with my physical characteristics at 6-7 call/min at the same pace.<br/><br/>HR monitor will cut out time to time with the tracker staying at the same point and tightness on my wrist, and no exaggerated arm movements to shift it around.<br/><br/>Just the other day I realized it's not counting steps correctly, as in I'd spend 5-10 minutes walking around the house trying to get my step count up only to realize at the end not a single step was logged.  After repeating with exaggerated arm movements, still no luck.  By Fitbits own admission (buried in documentation) the way steps are counted, some steps simply don't register on soft ground.  They used carpet as an example but I found wet grass/dirt and sand also tracks only intermittently.  Sorry hikers and beach runners, there's a chance you'll still find yourselves missing your 10k a day... This is also trying different positions on my wrist to no avail.
 Loving it and surprised at how much. Used for sleep data and daily steps. The sleep data has helped me figure out why I was so tired all the time, and now I am starting to get on track.<br/>Now that I understand better what is going on while I sleep, I can experiment to get a good night’s sleep. For instance, it’s true that there is less REM sleep with melatonin. It is a great educational tool which makes life better. Also I like comparing my sleep scores top others my age  part of the app] to let me know if the amount of each kind of sleep i am getting is normal for my age. It has made me worry less about the amount of sleep I get and helps me understand what happened if i feel tired in the morning. I feel more in charge of my sleep and the possiblilites of making it better.<br/><br/>Seeing how many steps you have taken and how many left to reach your step goal every day is motivating.<br/>The bracelet is comfortable, I don't notice I am wearing it and I really like that the fitbit only needs charging occasionally.
 I am a tracker fanatic. I had several different trackers. This is my second FITBIT tracker and I hate it as much as I loved my first one! My first Fitbit  tracker was Fitbit Charge 2. Compare to Fitbit Alta HR, Fitbit Charge 2  had a lot more options:  was adapted to different sport activities, counted floors, distinguished walking from aerobics, calculated calories from running/walking/sport equipment training.  Also, I never had any troubles with auto- uploading my results to the Fitbit web to track my progress.  My second tracker Fitbit Alta HR has nothing but a look. I constantly have trouble with syncing and uploading my physical activities. I have to reset this tracker almost every time I am trying to download my daily results. It ignores all physical activities but walking. Basically, you can buy a pedometer and it would replace Alta HR. Hate it, hate it, hate it! I would not recommend this product!!
 Loved it but it stopped charging after 1 month. Will not charge again. It got a bit of water on it when I forgot to remove it while scrubbing the shower. I bought 2 more for my daughters for Christmas but will be returning all 3. Be aware. This model is NOT waterproof OR sprinkle proof.  I don’t understand why anyone would make this kind of wearable electrical device without waterproofing. Other than that it was extremely accurate during its short life. Very disappointing.
 This thing is really poorly designed and just not working right.  I rode my bike for an hour yesterday and it gave me 0 minutes exercise.  It does show my steps, but not stairs.  It also only shows part of the time I was in bed.  I'm not sure how it senses these things, but reading other reviews it seems like it's very poorly designed for monitoring sleep, which it claims to track.  I had the original fitbit which worked fine for 6 months then stopped working no matter how many times I factory/totally reset it.  I'm going to try to return it because I need accurate sleep and exercise tracking.  That's it's purpose and it does it very poorly.
 The touch response leaves much to be desired. Sometimes it will display immediately and other times I have to sit there and tap it 6 times and then it goes through too many setting and you have to tap back to the beginning. but overall it is a good fitbit model. My issue with fitbit is their charging methods. In this day and age a wireless charger would be much more effective to charge this thing because the connectors aren't always reliable. Even just an additional option. I also had charging issues with the flex about 3 years ago. I also think that this should be waterproof. The manual makes it seem like it will ruin it if you get it even the slightest wet. An over $100 device that is used to promote fitness aka sweating/moisture.
 Love my fitbit!! I purchased the rose gold one and I love it. Very feminine which is what I wanted. I will say that the bad does become discolored and it doesn't come off even with the instructions fitbit gives to clean it. For me it was just in the clasp area so far, I assume because of me resting my arms on surfaces or it rubbing my shirt as I walk. It's not terrible, but for the price you'd assume they'd fix the issue instead of saying not to wear dark clothes....sorry, but I can't wear white everyday. To keep it from getting worse I ordered a cheap dark band for when I'm wearing super dark clothing.<br/>Overall I love the Alta hr and how thin it is. The alarm vibration is also pretty intense and wakes me up from sound sleep.<br/>I really recommend it!
 I received the Fitbit Alta HR and charged it right away. It charged but did nothing else. I followed the instructions, i.e., downloaded the app, set up account, Bluetooth pairing, etc. but The only thing that scrolled across the screen was “Fitbit.com/setup”. I tried all the recommendations of Fitbit support and still nothing. Obviously a defect. I am so disappointed and looked forward to using the Fitbit. I returned it. I doubt if I will purchase again.
 NEVER again....Fitbit  did not accurately report sleep, steps....wildly over estimated calories expended. Essentially it was an expensive watch that counted heartbeats. I consulted FitBit 'help line' three times; although they were polite, their advice did nothing to solve the issues with the FitBit.<br/><br/>They did offer to replace,  I declined. I know people who love their fit bits......I am NOT a fan; over promising and under-performing is not a good business strategy ~
 Buyer beware, the Fitbit is a great fitness tracker, but prepare to lose it because the band stinks!<br/><br/>We bought 2 of these and really enjoyed them, but after a few months both of our bands broke. We took good care of them, so it was frustrating that both of our bands broke after light use. To buy a new band is $30 a pop, and so that's frustrating. But on top of that, one of the bands broke while we were out in public, and we didn't notice until we got home, so the Fitbit was completely lost...which isn't covered by the protection plan we got through Square Trade, or the Fitbit warranty. So dumb!<br/><br/>If you're lucky and the band breaks at home, they will send you a replacement band...but you have to go through the pain of contacting them, and it'll probably break on you again soon.
 I had one years ago when they first came out and slowly stopped using it.. and increased in weight and other unhealthy trends. Now that i've got it the app has really motivated me to be more active with challenges and reminders. Highly recommend for anyone that works at a desk and doesn't realize how scarily close to a rock they are becoming.
 It broke 4 months later. I cant reset or anything. It just sits stuck on icon to boot.
 After several frustrating hours of trying to turn this thing on and get it set up (it kept refusing to charge at first), I have been in love with this thing. It's small and unassuming, keeps accurate count of all my steps, and the charge lasts forever despite opting for all-day sync and text/call notifications. There is a bit of a delay (which honestly may be my older phone's fault), so by the time the Fitbit starts alerting me of an incoming call, I only have about 5 seconds before the call goes to voicemail. Text alerts are only about 5-10 seconds delayed but calls are a bit longer. I turned off the move notifications because those were annoying and I don't need reminders to move when I get 15-20K steps per day on non-running days, and far more on running days. I use the original watchband style wristband for working out, so that I know it won't slip off me, but I opted for a very inexpensive "gold" knockoff band for everyday wear. It was a nice upgrade to my original Fitbit Flex from several years ago.
 I really struggle with giving poor reviews on items but in this case, the FitBit has issue and there are more than a disproportional number of people on line who complain that their FitBit fails either right before or after the one year warranty.  In our case, ours started giving us issues right before, we read the FAQ's and troubleshooting for the ultra . . . it just will not fix the issues of reporting a incorrect heart rate or no heart rate at all.  My sincere advice, unless you receive this as a gift, I would NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I can already see we will get nowhere with the india based customer support and I think getting it replaced is going to be like getting molars pulled.  So, there it is, do your due diligence and read the plethora of complaints on line how these mysteriously fail right at or just after the one year warranty.  I for one am done with FitBit and companies like theirs that will not stand behind their product . . . . .
 I love the size - it's not bulky and it goes with everything. So far all the features work really well for me, and it's gotten me to be so much more active than I expected. It reminds me to think about my health and fitness more often. Instead of making excuses to be lazy, I find myself making up reasons to be active. I love the data it compiles for me in the app, and the daily/weekly challenges are really fun and motivating. I do wish it had more interactive challenges via the app, and I would have loved to have GPS data for my walks and hikes. It syncs flawlessly with my phone and my digital scale. As someone who has never been a big fitness person, this device has been a huge success. I love that I can see baselines for my demographics to get an idea of what my goals should be, but I can customize everything to fit my needs and current fitness level.
 I replaced my Charge HR with this and I like it so far.<br/>Pros:<br/>-It's slimmer, lighter and I forget I'm wearing it. In fact, I briefly tried a Garmin Forerunner, but it was way too bulky so I went with this.<br/>- The display looks better<br/>- Sleep tracking has more data<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-There's no stopwatch. I used that feature constantly on the Charge, so it's disappointing.<br/>- The screen-tapping system is aggravating
 Despite the manufacturer's first rate instructions, it took me a minute or 2 to figure out the Fitbit Alta HR. I'm an instant gratification kind of girl, and "learning" a tech device is a pain for me. I just want to put it on and it works! Too much to ask?<br/><br/>Once I got the hang of it (with several phone calls to my out of state USMC son who has a Blaze), I started to understand it's appeal. I do want to hit my goals every day, and I do raise them up a few hundred steps after hitting the most current goal for 3 or 4 days in a row. I do look at my sleep patterns and try to add extra time to my sleep as well. There's something really useful about a little gadget that tells  you to get up to burn a couple hundred steps, or sends out fireworks on your wrist when you hit your step goal for the day.<br/><br/>I've recently added calorie counting to it's chores for the day, and that has virtually smacked me a couple times when I go over my calorie intake for the day. I would never have believed it it, but the accountability this little device affords me is something I had never considered.<br/><br/>The device was delivered well packaged, and the wristband fit as promised. The color was true to the photograph, and I found the blue/gray less harsh than black, and it really goes with all your casual gear. I did buy a couple "fancier" white and rose gold looking bands for dressier occasions.
 Wildly inaccurate compared to the Flex and Flex 2 I used for three years. In the first week, I was getting 2-3 hours of active minutes when I was mostly sitting at my desk for a normal workday. And it was estimating that I was burning 1,000-1,500 more calories per day than my Flex 2 on typical workdays. Returning it because it's worthless.
 I decided to upgrade to the Alta HR earlier this year because I wanted a more slim Fitbit. I really like the Alta, its fashionable and I love the HR feature. The Alta was difficult to set up, I was able to do it, but not as easy as I expected. I had to reset it (I Googled it to figure out how). I would have considered it just a fluke, but I bought my mom one for Mother's Day and it did the same thing. Also, you have to get use to the "tap". I sometimes still can't get it to come on the first time I tap, it takes practice. When I'm cycling and I want to check my HR it can be challenging to get it to turn on without me falling off my bike. Finally the display is hard to see in the sun. When I'm riding, I have trouble seeing it.
 Really wanted to enjoy this item gave it a few days but it was tracking steps while I was still in bed. I have my doubts about the accuracy of the readings it gives you, heart rate didn't match the treadmill readings, and I believe the steps it counts are a little exaggerated as well as the calories. Also I bought this watch because it allows you to preview your texts I wasn't able to see mine, all my settings on my phone and on the fitbit app were correct. I wasn't able to customize my home screen as well.  I found that finding help online to your questions was fairly difficult too. Pros about this item the battery lasted me almost 3 days, the design is simple and it looks cute.
 I was so excited when my Fitbit arrived but from the first day it wasn't tracking my steps accurately. I reset it, which seemed to help for a day or so, but then it went back to counting less than half of my steps. For example, I did 2.5 miles on my treadmill, my starting mileage on my fitbit was at 3.2 and at the end of my 2.5 miles on my treadmill, my fitbit registered 3.3 miles, so it was off by 2.4 miles. Other times I have counted my steps, only to have my fitbit record maybe half of my steps. I am so disappointed. What a waste.
 Watch would be great but, you can't see it outside and company does not care,and doesn't care about doing software update on watch so you can see it outside, I've asked more then once and other people that own it on there website also complain to no help from them ,I liked the small size because i have small wrist but ,if the time were brighter for outside i would be happy with it ,What is the sense of having a watch you can see outdoors. especially a fitness watch.The picture i attached is on a very dark day if sun were out forget it
 No complaints about the device itself. However, I bought it for my 9 year old granddaughter on her birthday. Download the app and enter the user information, then it tells me that she is too young and I need to open a family account. At that point, I cannot get to the link to open a family account and the app tells me that the email address and password are not valid, which is incorrect. After downloading the app a couple more times with no better results, I call the customer help line. The customer service guy was fine, but he tells me that the Alta HR cannot be used by anyone under 18 and that I need to get the Ace for children. Of course the Ace got crappy reviews on Amazon. Finally, I had to resort to changing the year she was born to satisfy the requirements for the Alta HR app. The age restriction is ridiculous as there is no information on this device that is inappropriate for any age.
 Six months into ownership and it quit syncing,  Called at least 4 times, never once returned call.  Passed the 30 days it could be returned to Amazon and after a lot of research on-line, I could not find a way to return it to Fitbit.  Then did the search for what others had done and found some info from Fitbit.  They best advise was to Reset it and re-install the app.  I did so and not only would it NOT sync after that, the clock lost 8 1/2 hours.  Did it again and same results then started reading the reviews on the Alta and MANY people were having the same problem.  I figure if the manufacture doesn't make it easy to get a product repaired they just manufacture throw away products or more of the cheap stuff shipped to us from China.  Anyway not a happy customer and Fitbit can take a hike.
 After using this for a few months, I'd have to say that I regret the purchase.  The sleep monitor is interesting for about a week, and the step counter is available in much cheaper models.  The heart rate monitor is where the product lost me.  Regardless of how tight or loose I wear the band or where I position it, the HR monitor losses the heart rate regularly.  From what I can tell this is caused by sweat.  It never malfunctions outside of a workout, or even early in a workout, but during distance runs the band needs to be re-positioned in order to regain the HR function.  When sweat causes your "fitness" band to malfunction, its not much of a fitness band.  If your just walking or engaging in low-intensity workouts, this band is probably fine, but for distance running or intense workouts, this is not the band for you.  Also, the readout is impossible to read in the sunlight.  At about $150 this band is about half the price of lower model Apple watches which IMO makes the apple watch a MUCH better value.
 So disappointed in this Fitbit. I have a small wrist and the width of device and the oversized band attachment mechanism meant that the heartbeat sensors did  not maincontsct with my wrist. Also just to check its step count I continued to wear my old Fitbit one at my waist. The Alta recorded less than half pf my steps based on treadmills odometer and my old device. The sleep tracker was worthless creating bogus wakefulness and multiple sleep logs. So back it goes🙁
 Always has trouble connecting to my phone, a Samsung Galaxy S8, which is updated. Then the only troubleshooting Fitbit suggests is to basically turn everything on and off (bluetooth, phone, uninstalling and reinstalling app, logging out and back in, Alta HR itself) and it still doesn't sync regularly. I had the Fitbit One before this, and it always synced in 20 seconds every time the app was opened. I have "Always Connected" on and "All-day sync", so even with every connection optimizing option turned on, it still won't sync regularly. This is especially annoying when setting the silent alarm. I don't know whether it will actually go off or not because I can't force the Alta HR to sync before I go to sleep.<br/><br/>You'd think for the $20 it costs to make the Alta HR, Fitbit would have enough left over to pay programmers and engineers to do their jobs.
 I had just purchased the previous version of the Fitbit Alta but due to some health issues I need to track my heart rate, so I purchased this on release. I had read that the resting heart rate is pretty accurate, and it recently helped me know I needed a medication change due to a marked difference in HR.<br/><br/>What I didn't know when I got it was that having this heart rate feature allows the device to record different stages of sleep: deep sleep, light sleep, REM and awake time. I'm addicted to seeing this daily!<br/><br/>My one complaint is the band. Even the smallest segment of the band seems to catch on everything. I like the previous snap band version much better.
 I've been using this Fitbit for a little over a month. My Charge HR finally bit the dust after 2 years and I needed a replacement so I decided to try the Alta. I love the slim design and flexibility that changing the bands offers! And there are so many reasonably priced band options on Amazon. The steps are consistent from what my charge tracked and the same with heart rate. The screen is prone to tiny scratches like most Fitbit products but any watch can do that. They have several display options but you can only get a total step count shown if you have it display your stats lengthwise instead of in a traditional wrist watch orientation(like the charge).<br/><br/>If you're looking for a more professional looking Fitbit and have smaller wrists like me, it is the obvious choice in Fitbit products.
 The Fitbit Alta HR is slim and handsome, but I am unhappy with the tracking of both steps and heart rate.  I have a course that I use consistently and is 1.5miles. The steps counted are off. The heart rate monitor does not track properly and I am disappointed because that is it main reason I bought it, to make sure I walk aerobically at the optimal speed. I get wildly different readings even while doing the same exercise. Considering returning it but still giving it a chance for a couple more days.
 I do not feel this product lived up tp the hype. It claims to "auto track" exercise activities like cycling, elliptical, or sports, however 9 times out of ten, it did not. Basically, unless the only thing you care about is "steps", then this would not work properly to give you credit for "exercise or activity" which was a huge let down. I think all exercise programs should have variety in order to avoid boredom and burnout. This product does not support that. The fitbit community was awesome, but even the feed had a long list of complaints, hints, and suggestions on what you had to do to "rig" the fitbit to work properly. I was told the other models were better. I returned this one.
 Pros: Spectacular battery life, records accurately, comfortable, slim/small<br/>Cons: Won't give you access to complete data set, tap to wake rarely works, tap to change modes works poorly<br/><br/>Overall: The device itself scores a 5, but their data policy brings it down to 2<br/><br/>I switched from my Apple Watch to the fitbit, because I got tired of having to rely on a 1-day battery life.  With the fitbit, I can go for a week without having to worry about the battery.  For that, it's great.  It's not always perfect on logging steps (there are 2 times when I've watched it literally logging no activity while I was running), but I'd say it doesn't miss a step 95% of the time...sorry, bad pun.<br/><br/>However, are you interested in collecting your own data and doing your own analytics?  Prepare for a headache, as they make this as painstakingly possible to keep you from gathering your information.  You can only download your data 31 days at a time, and the website that you must go through limits how you can manipulate the dates for download (i.e., it locks the calendar and makes you click through 4-5 steps every time you want to download a new month).<br/><br/>But don't worry, it's not impossible to download your data, just a headache.  Although, once you've finally downloaded it, you'll notice that there is no heartbeat data. Probably the most important factor of fitness, out of your fitbit, is kept from you.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS.  If you want to download your HR data, you need to rely on third-part apps or scripts in order to do so.<br/><br/>I bought a band myself, and 2 more for my parents.  I was going to by 3 more for other members of my family as their birthdays come up to allow us all to track each other through the family account setting, but I'm abandoning that idea to look at the Garmin or other options to see if their data policies are more user friendly.
 This thing is a nightmare. It’s totally inaccurate - my steps are wrong, it counts having your hand out the window while driving as additional steps, it tells me I’m in Light Sleep when I’ve been awake in bed for 1.5 hours literally playing around on my phone (has done this several times) and many times despite being hooked up properly it won’t charge! At all! I hate this thing. It might be defective, I don’t care, it’s a terrible product. I’m going to look into buying a Garmin which have better reviews anyway and seem to be testing as more accurate.
 I am a bit late to the Fitbit game, but I am in love! I had no idea how helpful this gadget actually is. I thought I would just be using it for my exercise-related stuff, but I have found out that it keeps track of my sleep patterns and many other things. I love seeing when I was in a REM state during my sleep and how long I slept for. I find this to be one of my favorite features. Like many other people, I have some sleep difficulty and now being able to work on getting a better night's sleep with my Fitbit is great. I will also say that recording my steps and exercise routines is amazing! I am currently in weight watchers and it sends all of the info right over to their app so I get my activity points added on automatically. I have found out I walk more than I thought now that I am not using my phone (which I put down) to track me. This is a must have for anyone who is alive and interested in these things!!!
 I'm obsessed with my fitbit. I wish the battery lasted slightly longer, but I understand it works very hard every second to measure heart rate and that must take a lot of battery power. with that said, the battery power is impressive given how much power it has to give to the HR function. If you're going to get a fitbit, get one with HR for sure... the only downside to this is that they couldnt include GPS or the stair-climber function in the alta version. I like the small size though, and prefer it to large ones that also include these features. Price was pretty reasonable too. Wish it hooked up to Apple's Health app, though...
 The battery runs out pretty fast, usually it lasts me about 3 to 4 days; also some how the clock is slow, it used to be one minute, now it's close to 2 minutes. The wrist band is a pain, cheap quality. One has to be very careful to recharge the battery, if one doesn't make sure it is place correctly it doesn't charge. There should be a better way to recharge the battery. It has happened to me that I see it is plugged correctly, but somehow it doesn't charge. I have to wiggle the charger when I plug it in.
 Got this as a present for my wife (small size), and it fits well! She loves the features of tracking your sleep (which stage you are in), work out modes (it can detect if she is running on a treadmill indoors or using the elliptical without her telling what type of workout it is!), and general heart rate and step counter. She has really enjoyed seeing her heart rate while working out so she can make sure she is in the cardio/fat-burn zone, depending on the workout.<br/><br/>The band that comes with it does get dirty quite quickly (two weeks). Using a makeup remover pad helps clean it up a bit.
 I like the product very much except for the charging. Often I have left it on charge only to discover that although it indicated that it was charging at the start, the connection was not good and it was not charging. It give you an indication of charging for about 5 seconds and then goes blank. There is no verification that the charging is in progress. I would suggest that a blinking spot on the display during charging would be an improvement.
 Having finally developed a skin sensitivity reaction to my charge HR, I had given up wearing it about a year ago. So when I saw that the Alta HR allowed for interchangeable bands - including metal - I jumped at it. The Swees metal bands I bought have magnetic clasps that allowed me to easily loosen the band during the day and tighten when I need heart rate readings. This helps minimize the chance of having a reaction to even the metal bands.<br/><br/>SLEEP TRACKING:  The sleep tracking with the Alta HR seems to be even better than with the Charge HR.  It now shows the percentage of time spent awake, in light sleep, deep sleep and REM. It also compares this data to the norms for your age and sex. (Note: I haven't tried the Charge HR with the most recent app upgrades but I do think the Alta is getting more data.) I am including screenshots for both.<br/><br/>I saw the nurse practitioner at my sleep doctors office a couple of days after getting the Alta HR. She told me that they find these to be quite reliable, and in fact had used FitBit data to correlate with CPAP data to figure out what was going on with one of their patients, who turned out to be going into atrial fibrillation at night. She also agreed it would be a good tool to use on my 89-year-old mother to test her for possible sleep apnea.  If the data shows any multiple awakenings or erratic heart rate, I'll show it to her general practitioner and request a referral to the sleep doctor.
 I purchased the new Alta HR to replace my old Charge HR. I never really liked the old style but I needed the heart rate monitoring for health reasons. I purchased it a little over a year ago and it completely stopped synching. I tried all the troubleshooting methods to no avail. Customer service wasn't great, either. So hear I am with my new Alta HR and I must say it is a more attractive tracker than my last. However, based on what I was reading, I expected it to have a slimmer profile. It's still a bit on the clunky side, to my liking. I found a great mesh replacement band in silver which makes it a lot more like a watch that I can also wear daily whether working out or not. I hope this one lasts a little longer than my last FitBit!
 I loved my Alta and found it accurately tracked my steps and sleep.  It's debatable HOW accurate its estimation of deep, REM and light sleep ARE, but I found the graphs fascinating, and my data showed me that I could get MORE deep sleep if I went to bed earlier.  It provided lots of motivation for increasing my activity and sleep, beyond that .  It would have been 5 starts, but the band attachment broke in about 7 months, so I contacted Fitbit about the warranty.  Amazon, however, was more immediately responsive and refunded MOST of the purchase price for me to put toward a Charge 3, which seems to have a sturdier band and will be water resistant.  If you don't care about water and want the slim band, order one or two extra bands.
 I love this watch! I do not like to wear watches much since I have a cell phone. I find them bulky and unnessary but this watch is alot of fun. I got this to improve my health goals but also to have a heart rate monitor when I am working out. I find it is easy to wear while sleeping, which it tracks your sleeping habits too. The options include monitoring water and food, heart rate and resting heart rate, activity level, steps, monitoring workouts and tells you how much energy you have expended. It is easy to charge and you can wear it up to seven days before charging it again. It takes about 2 hours to charge it. I find myself competition with my friends to compare steps but I love the fitbit ap which help you set up your fitbit. I can see why so many people have a fitbit and I am glad that I finally purchased one. I wish it was waterproof, but at least it is water resistant. So, no do not take it with you into the shower! :)
 This seemed like a great idea.  I bought one and my son bought one, to get fit together.  Right from Day 1 there have been problems with the Fitbit Alta syncing with my computer.  I've tried everything suggested on all of the Help boards.  Sometimes a solution will work for a day or two, but then it stops again.  Or part of the information will sync and part won't.  A Fitbit is a great idea, when it works properly.  It is too late to return this product, but I consider it a waste of $99.  So why 2 stars instead one?  It fits well on my wrist.
 I appreciate the more compact size and the increased sleep information available with this new model. However, the band is still very plain and is not that easy to buckle. The heart rate accuracy seems pretty good but the indicated number of calories used and the number of steps taken in a day appear to be inaccurate at best, differing significantly from my iWatch and phone's step count. I'm keeping it because of the detailed sleep information but doubt I'd buy it again. Overall, no great advantages in comparison to my old Charge 2 HR other than size and the additional sleep information. In fact, I think my Charge 2 might have more accurate steps information.
 This fitbit worked great except I can not see the display outside (riding bike, hiking, walking, etc.) even if i shade it from the sun I still can't see the display. Inside I have no problem seeing the display. I bought this fitbit for the slim design and the added heart rate feature, but after 2 months the only way the heart rate feature works is if i set it on continuously rather then auto (so it only turns on when i wear it). This is a major bummer since I can't return it back to Amazon at this point. I am very disappointed since I never had problems with my other two fitbits (flex and charge).  I guess now I just wonder when the heart rate feature will just stop working for good....so upsetting.
 I have been wearing it a while and have only one complaint:  it does not register my stationary bicycle riding and, as far as I can figure out, there is no way to manually enter it in the app.  Otherwise, I love it.  Hourly reminders to move, great poditive feedback.  Like the heart rate monitor and up-to-the-minute step count.  Also tells you total time exercising, based on heart rate elevation.  One can input all food intake in the app and it will track calories.  Other useful functions in the app, too.
 After 3 months the step tracking became inconsistent.  My normal walk has always registered a bit over 6,000 steps but this past week 3 times that same walk registered around 3,000 steps. And I was not wearing Seven League Boots on those walks so it can't be that.<br/>The sleep app is so-so and the company admits it. (Also what is the point of a sleep app? Do you wake up feeling rested? You got a good night's sleep. Do you really need an app to tell you that?)<br/>I don't understand the resting heart rate tracker: it seems to be some kind of average rather than what your heart rate is when you are actually at rest (not sleeping).<br/>It does fine with telling time and I like being able to swap bands but in the end I would have been better off with a good pedometer and a Timex.
 Bad tracking, small screen, returned, the tapping didn't work work well. If your a bit older go for the charge two, this is a tiny screen. I haven't walked in over 30 days but Sunday tt sad I took 133 steps, if only.
 I really can't believe so many people are ok with a device that counts 100's-1000's extra steps based on vibrations and general arm movement.  What I find most confusing is that my tracker says I took 681 steps yet the accompanying graph says it was only 249 steps.  (Mind you, there were no steps.  Fitbit was on a bedside table with a small fan for about 3 minutes.  Fitbit Support explained that vibrations can cause steps. Seriously.)  I went back to my first day where it said I took 9,880 steps (didn't go anywhere) but the graph only logged just shy of 2000.  Support keeps telling me that this is all normal, expected, etc.....all part of the program. ???<br/><br/>I still gave this 2 stars as I do like the heartbeat and sleep tracker.  I just don't think I can keep using something that is supposed to motivate me to move yet gives me so many "free" steps.  I paid too much for inaccuracy.
 Paid extra for the rose gold Alta with pink band. The pink became discolored to a blue-gray within 5 days of wear. Apparently this is a common issue on the FitBit forums. Contacted FitBit - their best advice was not to let the band come in contact with dark clothing. Not sure how to accomplish this as device is designed to be worn 24h. Not buying a new wardrobe to accommodate the pink.<br/>FitBit itself worked fine I guess.
 so far, so good.  i got mainly since my heart rate was dropping too low -- changing BP meds to compensate.  but watching closely.  i can see "resting rate"  easily.  i like the sleeping graph.  also set some goals for steps -- even though i work a home -- i'm amazed at how many steps.<br/><br/>the charger is way better than the charger from charge 2 model -- i was using my daughters until i got this (well until she made me get this one....and one for her!)<br/><br/>i love the coral (orangeish) color.<br/><br/>4 stars because doesnt always show up when i "flick" my wrist; have to tap it.<br/><br/>Update 07/2018.  I marked the inside of band making it easier to select the right size.  Was sometimes getting if off and had to redo.  Works good.
 I just received my Fitbit Alta HR yesterday. I followed all of the setup instructions exactly.  It does NOT notify me when I have a text message, calendar alert, or phone call from my iPhone 7 Plus.  I did online research through the Fitbit site and Google to do troubleshooting myself - I restarted the Fitbit, restarted my phone, verified that Notifications for the Fitbit app on the phone were turned on, verified on the Fitbit app that it was paired via Bluetooth and set to receive those notifications from my phone, verified on the phone that the Bluetooth was working and even disconnected other Bluetooth devices so none others would interfere with the notifications going to my Fitbit. I even went online for Chat with a Fitbit customer service person, but all I got were canned responses that didn't even answer my questions.  Their bottom line was that they would let their engineers know about my issue and that it would be resolved. I asked if I'd be sent an email letting me know about resolution; they said there would be no email - that I would know the issue was resolved when my Fitbit was working properly. Geeze!  I'm ready to return this device if it's defective.  If I wanted a device WITHOUT the message notifications, I would've purchased a Fitbit of lesser value that did not have that as an available feature.
 The Fitbit Alta HR has helped me track steps for my insurance program at work.  I'm not seeing it short me any steps.  If anything, it may give a few extra steps.  You cannot wear two Fitbits linked to the same account at the same time so I have not made a direct comparison on steps to my Zip.  The heart rate monitor works but is a few beats off my Polar chest strap.  It is close enough to see if I hit my HR zone for work out purposes.<br/><br/>I found I wore the band too tight the first day and after finding a good fit I never really notice that I am wearing it.  I do have to tap it pretty solid to kick the screen on.  It seems to keep a charge for about 5-6 days and it will charge in few hours.
 I originally bought a Fitbit clone for a whole lot less.  After a couple of weeks I was totally disappointed in the clone.  Returned it. Found this, on sale, and sunk the budget and bought it.  I'm not disappointed.  Tracks my heart, steps (with a 'get off your butt' reminder every hour), tracks my elliptical workout, lets me see when I get texts and phone calls, tracks my sleep pattern, tells me the time and a bunch of other things.  It fits well and is small enough to not be ostentatious yet large enough that I can read the screen.  Love it.  Looking at getting one for my daughter next.  Totally worth the money.
 Before this, I owned the Fitbit Zip which I liked, but watching and reading about the heart rate tracking in their more advance products looked intriguing. Overall, the Fitbit Alta HR is very nice. I enjoy looking at my stats. I currently do not have any friends that have a Fitbit, but I can imagine how the friends feature can be a great motivator for being active. I love the silent alarm! I don't have to wake up with an alarm clock screaming at me anymore.<br/><br/>Cons: It does not track your walking when your arms are still, such as carrying/holding things or pushing a shopping cart, which is a bit disappointing.<br/><br/>As a person who does not exercise for pleasure, I'm not sure if it's worth the high price. It's kinda like how I'm sucked into buying Apple products. Very pricy for the big name brands, but they do have a lot of cool features that make them stand out.<br/><br/>When I first wore it, it felt weird and uncomfortable. But after a day or two it felt fine and now I often forget I'm even wearing it. I bought a small because I have a tiny wrist. However, there is a small gap between my arm and the band on one side because the part where the band and device connect is stiff (which makes sense).
 Motivational device! I enjoy it so far. A little more accurate than a cheaper knockoff version I have. I don't think having something on your wrist is going to be accurate for taking steps but it gives me something to go by and a goal to meet each day. Another thing... I don't get why the band size has to be so confusing. I measured my wrist and was close to needing an extra large by their measurements so I figured I would size up just in case. I got the extra large band on the smallest hole and the band is too big for my wrist. I am a 5'11'' 244lb man and the extra large is too big for my wrist. So I had to order the large band. All they need to do is put some more holes in the band and it can be a one size fits all. Seems like a money making gimmick to me.
 The Alta HR is a great step/heartrate/sleep tracker.  It's comfortable to wear, and has a nice, if simple, display.<br/><br/>Mild warning: you have to have a Bluetooth smartphone or tablet, or a computer with Bluetooth interface.  If you don't have a smartphone, you can sync with the Fitbit website, but you still have to have Bluetooth on your computer to get the data from the Alta HR.  If your computer doesn't have built-in Bluetooth, there are inexpensive USB adapters that will add Bluetooth functions to your computer.<br/><br/>The Fitbit website and the Fitbit apps for Windows 10 and smartphones do a nice job of accumulating your data and displaying it for you, with smart conclusions and recommendations.  The device also integrates with other fitness apps like Google Fit and MyFitnessPal.  These are the two that I use.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have is in the syncing.  The device should sync when the Fitbit phone app is launched, but it usually doesn't.  I often have to manually trigger the sync two or three times to get it to actually get the data from the Alta.  That's an irritation, but not a big deal.<br/><br/>On the whole, highly recommended.
 I am a bit FitBt fan, and love that the Alta comes with a replaceable band. The older Charge HR models didn't, and the bands would often "bubble" and the top layer would separate from the band itself. With FitBit not wanting to replace it under warranty, that was my only complaint about any of their product really, and the only reason I was thinking of switching to something else. With the new Alta being an HR model, I can bypass the issues with the bands altogether, and just get a replacement for the band itself if it starts developing bubbles under the top layer.
 According to FitBit's website, my smartphone was compatible but the device never synced up with the required app I had to install. Without that, it wouldn't even give me the time of day. Maybe my phone didn't have enough memory or some other app was interfering. But it got worse: It started rebooting my phone every minute. That was barely enough time to uninstall it before rebooting again--once I figured out the tapping sequence and got it fast enough!<br/><br/>Also, it came with no instructions. If an online manual exists, I never found it. All I could find were random things strangers posted about how they got their's to work. It seemed pretty random to me.<br/><br/>Lots of other people seem to be happy with theirs, though. I guess it just depends on your phone and/or how much you like fiddling with things. I just just wanted it to work out of the box. So I returned it.
 This is a great small watch. I like the features it has, tracked by steps an heart rate. The app is very user friendly and helpful. The only thing I don’t like so far is the sleep tracking. If your are buying this for that look again. This will track sleep but if you get up at all at night the watch thinks you have woke up. When you go back to sleep it doesn’t read your sleeping anymore.
 So, I guess this is why this watch was discounted down to $149.  The description made absolutely NO mention of it being used or refurbished; but when I downloaded the Alta app and was doing the setup on mine, the previous two owners' info all showed up and was dated 2-3 months and 6-7 months ago!!  Not cool!!!  Used by two people, and their stats are still in the watch memory!  Ahhgg!!<br/>  I will be keeping the watch, at least for now, to ensure that it has all the features and abilities for which I was hoping in this watch.  If it does have everything, then I most likely will return it within my 30-day return window and reorder a BRAND NEW one.  I am especially interested in the sleep tracking info that this would give, and so far it's looking good. It gives much more info/detail than the cheaper watches give.
 I was very ambivalent about getting one of these. At 52, however, I knew I needed to shift into another gear if I was going to continue to fit into my clothes, but the idea of being measured, being monitored, mechanizing myself seemed ... a capitulation to something I was profoundly uncomfortable with.  One week later, and I could not be happier that I went ahead.  Like many, I want to maximize life - and that means having energy to do so.  The sleep monitor has helped me better understand how to get the KIND of sleep I need, and the steps/active minutes/calories burned has been remarkably motivating. I had a 'step counter' years ago - and promptly abandoned it.  This is light years ahead...
 I didn't know that biking wasn't one of the pre-loaded exercises. I require a Fitbit that can monitor HR, calories burned, etc., for outdoor and indoor cycling. This doesn't answer the mail, but I believe the Fitbit Charge 3 does all those things so returned the Alta HR and ordered the Charge 3. Still high quality tech and user-friendly mobile app. Just not the one for me.
 Unfortunate. These things should last more than several months, especially given that a new one of these costs substantially less than when I bought mine only several months back. The complaint is not so much with the digital portion though at times very annoying to have to smack it so much to get a  reading, but that the band went bad and that Fitbit isn't seeing fit to be quick about sending another one. 5 days ago they said it would ship within 24 hours. yet so far, it has not shipped and there's no indication of when it will. And then apparently 5-7-10 business days after that before arrival.  For a brand new order maybe not unreasonable, but when replacing a defective product, some attention to speed would be good business practice. Sorry Fitbit, I waited 5 days before writing this, to see if there was any sign of the replacement being shipped, but it has not shipped and reps indicate they don't yet know when it will.
 This is my second fitbit, my first was the flex, which I wore for 2 years. So far I'm loving it! It fits great and feels good on my wrist. The screen is a little hard to tap because I have fingernails, and I haven't quite got the wrist flick down to where the time comes up overtime, but I'm working on it! I love the fitbit products- I also have the scale. So this is a must have for someone who doesn't want the other wide varieties. I haven't changed the band but it looks simple and the website offers clear instructions. So this product really is great!
 Despite seemingly new, advanced tech, Fitbit has gone down hill. I had a Flex and loved it, synced flawlessly with both my computer and my phone.  It's still going strong, and I've had it since it first released.<br/><br/>I ordered this, and was excited to track my sleep better as well as my heart rate. And thought the text notification as an added benefit.  Well come to find out, after initial syncing, I cannot sync again, without uninstalling, reinstalling and setting up. Over and over again, every time I want to sync.<br/><br/>Talking to CS, I find out, that unless you have an iPhone or Samsung, good luck finding a newer phone they support.  They haven't supported ANY Moto since 2014. Similar stance with other major companies.  Meanwhile they only support the newest versions of Windows.  Their response is to either buy a new phone, a new computer (I have Win7 and have NO desire to go to 8 or 10), or just wait and hope.<br/><br/>The biggest issue is that online retailers and even their own box, do not indicate how likely you are to have a device that isn't supported.  They advertise that it works with Android 4.4+. Full stop.  On their box, there is a small link to compatible devices, but not a hint that their supported devices are so limited.
 I just got the Alta HR after having the Fitbit One for many years. I didn't think I would care that much about the heart rate feature, but after just one day I'm already loving it. I like seeing my sleep patterns and how much time I spend in REM, light and deep sleep. I also like checking my resting heart rate and seeing what zone I am in when I exercise. I've already been a big fan of the Fitbit in general. Wearing one definitely encourages me to be more active. I also like that it alerts you to text messages and phone calls, but has a small profile. I didn't want anything bulky. It's perfect.
 Below is my original review -- had given Fitbit Alta HR 5 stars.  Am now subtracting two stars because the strap design is faulty.  Both the original strap and the two purchased replacements kept detaching so that I was (am) in constant danger of losing the tracker.  I no longer consider the strap issue a "minor con."<br/><br/>I now wear my Fitbit daily instead of a watch.  It's definitely a goal-oriented, motivational tool though at times a guilt-inducing one as when the couch or computer calls.  Was going to subtract one star because the strap has a tendency to detach when I'm taking the device off at night, but Fitbit pros far outweigh this relatively minor con.
 I had the fit bit flex. The clasps weren't as good unless you bought the ones that are like watches. Lost 2. 3rd one the tracker lasted about 1 1/2 year. Needed to be charged every few days.<br/>Did a lot of research comparing all the trackers not just fit bit. I liked the Alta HR decent tracker charge time; nice bracelets so it doesn't look so big and sporty. Can get wet like when washing dishes not for swimming though.<br/>There are cheaper trackers but they don't have all of the features, Synch with phone; HR monitor, sleep monitor, activity tracker and I like the fiti bit app.
 i haven't quite figured out why it gives me great info sometimes and no info other times but all in all I really glad I got this. The sleep information was shocking and illuminating. Hard to imagine that a wrist band can change your life but it did. I'm encourgaged to make sure I get at least one step more today than yesterday... I have increased my steps goal by more than double since I got it. I have also changed my sleep hygiene and continue to make more changes after seeing how poorly I have been sleeping.
 This is a somewhat complicated review. I personally love the Fitbit and the Fitbit app. However some things are very frustrating. The responsiveness of lifting my arm to see the Fitbit screen isn’t amazing. It works like 70% of the time. The other times I have to relieve my arm once or twice and bring it up again. Not a huge deal, but annoying. Additionally, I tap and tap and tap to turn the silent alarm off, and it takes a good 7-10 taps to get it to register.<br/><br/>And the last thing, the band it comes with is terrible. Despite washing it every day, it ends up looking super ratty.<br/><br/>Despite that, the Fitbit app is great,and I find to Fitbit to be excellent for what it’s purpose is: tracking.
 Noticeably bulkier than the Alta, but you get some awesome features in return. As with other Fitbit models, the battery life is great out-of-the-box but can vary depending on use, and seems to diminish noticeably after a couple dozen charge cycles. Definitely worth buying the extended warranty for this reason. Make sure to adjust the sensitivity or it'll count steps while you're petting your dog, shaking hands, etc. Only other complaint is it only alerts for phone calls, calendar alerts, and text messages when paired with an iOS device -- Facebook messages and other 3rd party apps aren't compatible -- as of April 10, 2018. I love the device -- just wish it had a few tweaks.
 I like this Fitbit, everything worked well until the band started to fail. It was over Christmas and I was away; I had planned to get a new band as soon as I was home. I was supposed to be on one train the whole way back to New York on the 26th, so I wore it thinking I wouldn't be moving much. My train was cancelled; I ended up having to take a bus and a train with a transfer in Union Station in DC. Amtrak gave us no solid answers as to how we would make the second leg of our journey, so it was chaotic and much more running around than I expected. The band failed in Union Station and I couldn't find it. Fitbit claims that I lost it rather than their band failed so they won't replace it. They've offered me a discount on a new one, but frankly I paid less for the first one I bought so the discount isn't really significant. It's a good product for $100; I don't see paying $200 for it which is what I would pay for it this year if I purchase a second. Their band failed; I didn't lose it. If they don't honor their warranty, I don't think this is worth it. I'd rather try an Apple Watch if it's just going to break every 6 months.
 The Fitbit Alta HR is great. The sleep tracking is extremely accurate down to the minute. HR is also very accurate. I have both the special edition black one and a fuschia stainless steel one. The black seems to be more durable than the SS, and the black on black is a really sleek look. Fitbit App is easy to use and colorful, fun, and motivational.
 I'm so glad I made this purchase.  I initially only bought it because I was curious about the quality of my sleep.  The sleep tracker hasn't performed 100%, but I'd grade it a solid 95%.  (Examples of problems:  One day it said I fell asleep at exactly 5:00 AM, but I know I was asleep well before 4:00.  Also, it doesn't always track my naps.  It doesn't give detail for naps under 3 hours, and that's fine, but sometimes it doesn't even show that I was asleep  Once I also noticed that it said I fell asleep just a few minutes into a program, but I remember watching at least the first 10-15 minutes of the show before I dozed off).<br/><br/>I wasn't really interested in counting steps, but the first time I actually got to 10,000 and saw the fireworks on the display, it was really encouraging.  At first I found the hourly reminders to move to be annoying and refused to play along, but it's fun to earn a star for the day, so I make the effort to get in my 250 steps nine hours a day.<br/><br/>I chose the Alta HR because it was narrow and unobtrusive.  I like the style a lot.  I couldn't get used to the default time format (vertical), but that's easy to change.  I switched to a horizontal format and I like it much better.  There are still many features that I haven't used yet and I look forward to discovering them in the coming months.
 Great product overall. I bought this when Jawbone went out of business and I could no longer get my favorite tracker. Sometimes I wake up in the morning and my Fitbit says I took steps when I definitely didn't.The sleep tracking at Jawbone was definitely more accurate.  It'll say I was awake for a long period of time when I know I didn't wake up throughout the night. Otherwise great and no complaints! If I hadn't known what another tracker was like, I wouldn't have had to give 4 stars.
 More than a year after I bought two of these, both Alta Fitbit HR's have had their band unable to close due to normal wear and tear, leading me to believe this product was made with a big manufacturer defect that Fitbit didn't design well.<br/><br/>I have contacted Fitbit 3x now and gotten a band replacement for free each time covered under their 1 year warranty, however now that it is over a year from purchase date I can no longer due that.  Having to go out and spend for a new band that will likely have the same issue, over and over.... leads me to this review and letting folks know not to bother with this product.
 We are long time Fitbit users- Loved the slim size of the AltaHR, and the band closure is the best Fitbit has created so far - that said, we returned it and resumed using our Fitbit Blaze and Charge2. The AltaHR is cumbersome, cycling thru screens is slow and painful- when I'm running I wanna be able to raise my wrist and easily access heart rate information but with the AltaHR it's impossible. Quick view is hit or miss, notifications are tough to read. It misses a lot of step data and doesn't record sleep info as accurately as the Charge2.<br/>We were surprised and disappointed.
 Didn't have much in the way of expectations for getting a FitBit, but this one has been amazing.  In conjunction with the app, I've been able to stay aware of my daily activity (which before was just crap) as well as log my daily food intake to keep me aware of the full picture.  Only downside is if you get sweaty the band gets kinda gross, but wipe with a warm wet cloth and you're good to go again!  Biggest tip I have is if you want to wear it constantly, I've found charging while I'm in the shower a great way to keep the battery going so I don't have to miss out on the sleep insights or other times.
 Gave it two stars because it told time and date correctly.  However, Needed to repeatedly "tap-tap" the face to activate the display, often as many as 4-5 times to get it to display.  Then, not always able to "tap" it to the next screen.  Registered hundreds of "steps" while sleeping.  Also, alternatively, the display is supposed to turn on when you bring your hand to your face - worked perhaps 40% of the time.  Did not always reset the stats (steps, miles, etc.) to zero after midnight.  Way too much drama just to get the time &amp; date... maybe.
 I am a 70-year-old, full-time RV'er and I got this more to remind me to "move" and it does just that. I have it actually set at the lowest number of steps per day (5,000) and most days I don't meet that, but I will get 2000 to 4000 steps per days, which I was not getting without the Fit Bit. I'm working on it. It also give me my current heart rate, sleeping heart rate and tells me how well I'm sleeping.
 I have a Garmin 920XT for triathlon training, and a Surge HR for running.  I wanted this Alta HR to wear with ordinary clothes and I'm glad I got it.  I wear it nonstop except I don't track my sleep.  I've had it almost two weeks and have been motivated to get 10,000 steps (at least) every single day since.  I sometimes have to tap it five or six times to get the display up.  That might be me doing something wrong, and that's the only thing I don't like.  I have the clasp on the smallest hole, so a large is definitely large.
 The wife loves it, she primarily use it for sleep tracking and to follow up and try to better her routine. As long as she's happy i'm happy.<br/><br/>Update: reducing one star because the charger stop charging within 2 weeks. Searching looks like multiple people complain about that. It just stop charging..... Luckily Amazon replaced it immediately, hope the second one will not have the same issue. Other then that, it's a good professional tracker.<br/><br/>Update: the replacement unit stopped charging as well... returning for a complete refund and reducing 2 stars. its a great product, but unreliable...
 This is one of the best purchases I've made in my life.  You can't put a price on good and improved health.  It's so helpful that a friend asked me about it and immediately ordered one for herself from Amazon also!<br/>I love every single feature it has! From steps taken to reminding me to get up and move.  Knowing how long I sleep and what kind of sleep i have is extremely beneficial.  I'm working on increasing my sleep time.<br/>I always highly recommend it to my friends.
 I love this fitbit! I had the charge hr before and it was fine, but it was a bit bulky and the band could only be changed by removing 4 teeny tiny screws. The Alta HR takes about 15 seconds to change the band! It's also a lot Slimmer than the charge hr, which I love. The battery also lasts a long time, I would say around 5 days. The only thing that it doesn't do that the charge HR does is count flights of stairs, which I'm not really concerned with. It actually displays text messages on the display which I think is amazing, and  calendar notifications and phone calls also pop up on the display. Definitely recommend the alta hr!
 I previously had the Blaze but wanted the Alta because it’s smaller and slim. It’s not as bulky as the blaze. So far I like the Alta and noticed the battery life is a lot longer. The negative is that it doesn’t have GPS tracking. So it won’t route your walks/runs. That’s something I used all the time for tracking my walks. Also when you receive messages it’s sideways and kinda hard to read. But I turn off the feature so it doesn’t bother me.<br/><br/>Now I use the Alta daily but will use my blaze when I go for long walks or new routes.
 I had an earlier model Charge HR with a wide band, but I like the elegant look of the slim Alta HR much more. I was delighted when FitBit offered an Alta HR. The one thing I miss is the stair counter. My former FitBit automatically counted how many stairs I climbed, but this one does not. I have to log that information myself under Activities. I recommend buying the plastic shields to protect the black plastic over the display window. I did not and wish I had because I quickly acquired a couple of scratches on the plastic window.
 I had two other Fitbits and I was really kind of disappointed in this product.  My other fitibits were clips and they actually seemed to track my steps better. This watch style Fitbit definitely misses steps. It seems to count on the swinging of the arm that it is being worn on. Sometimes it misses steps and then seems to 'catch up' but it definitely under counts.  Also, the 'tilt your arm and it comes on' stopped working after a few weeks. The sleep tracking does seem to be accurate and is helpful and the other functions work fine. The App is great. However, If I had to do it over again, I'd just get the Fitbit Zip or Flex.
 This has been a very effective tool in terms of having insights into what is going on with me physically.  My mother has some heart related issues, and I wanted to be more in tune with my heart rate during exercise, and this is great at that.  It slices and dices data in tons of ways, not only for heart rate, but also for sleep, for exercise and on and on.<br/><br/>The interesting things are that the resting heart rate reported on the app is sometimes a one beat per minute different than it is on the PC, and that there appear to be some some analytic tools that are only available on the app (sleep benchmarking) some only available on the PC (times awake per night).<br/><br/>All in all so far (3 and a half weeks) a great tool.  Talked to my wife last night about getting one for her.
 Purchased with the intent to track exercise (aerobics, interval training, strength training, hiking, walking etc..) and also to see and compare the fitness app with that of Garmin's. There are definite pros and cons when comparing with the Garmin Vivofit 2 which was my previous tracker.<br/><br/>Pros: Better App/Dashboard &amp; data, sleek design, interchangeable straps, smart sync with phone to see messages, constant HR tracking<br/>Cons: Have to charge every 5 days vs. 1-year battery life, inaccurate HR tracking during exercise, even after following all suggestions, (i still believe you can't beat a chest strap for accuracy purposes!) and you can't wear in the shower or when taking a swim.<br/><br/>All in all I would recommend this watch so long as your main exercise focus doesn't have you moving your wrist around vigorously OR involve the water. I'll be returning since this has not proven to be accurate for my workouts, which is a large reason I wear a tracker.
 I bought it for my wife, but after opening it, she said she wanted a fitness tracker with a bigger face.  As a result of her choice, I got to keep the Fitbit Alta HR.  I've had it off of my wrist about 2 hours since I got it--I remove it to recharge it.  This is a very user-friendly device that will prompt you to walk every hour or so.  It also will notify you of incoming messages if you are near your phone.  I recommend this device.  it is a good value and, if you do what it tells you to do, you will be healthier as a result.
 I just wish it was waterproof. I can't wear it paddleboarding, t the beach, etc unless I feel like taking it off and putting it on and that's just a hassle. I know the next version up in price is waterproof but since this was my first fitness tracker purchase I wanted to be conservative with what I spent. When (if) this one dies I will probably upgrade. Other than that I think this is a great product. The app has a very user friendly interface.
 I have been using my Fitbit for about a month. I really like the sleep tracking. It also tracks my heart rate, steps, active time, and calories burned. I'm not sure how accurate these readings are. Sometimes I get the 10,000 steps alert when I am not walking, so I wonder if it is overestimating my steps. I have not yet found much correlation between steps or active time and calories burned. The display has a small scuff mark on it already from normal wear. I have to wear the band fairly loose to avoid the Fitbit cutting off my circulation, especially if I am wearing long sleeves that pull the band up on my arm.
 I bought this for my wife. The first one we got had a faulty battery, Amazon quickly replaced it and got the 2nd one to charge and setup easily for my wife on her Iphone. She loves it and found it very useful for daily use, sleep monitoring and as an exercise monitor. The app on the Iphone is also useful and easy to understand/navigate.
 I absolutely love my Fitbit Alta HR! Shipping was fast. I have fun switching up the bands every day to match my outfits. Wearing a Fitbit keeps me motivated, and I love challenging my friends every day. I have always used a Fitbit Zip (the clip-style tracker), and never imagined I would love a wristband tracker this much. The heart rate monitoring is awesome. I was worried that step counting would be inaccurate with a wristband tracker, but on the contrary, I have found it to be equally as accurate as the clip-style tracker. Plus, it looks really cute!
 This is without a doubt the product I regret buying the most. Fitness tracker my ass. How can you call something a fitness tracker when you cannot wear it while lifting weights? Okay, you can, but then it thinks you've ran miles when you've been lifting. Then it doubles your energy expenditure!<br/><br/>Maybe it's the software that needs improvement but regardless this product has years of development before it works as intended - check their forums to see everyone else's complaints.<br/><br/>Save your money, get a cheap heart rate monitor - it does the same thing.
 Fitbit knows that the HR monitor on this doesn't work correctly and instead of recalling the they bandaged the problem with set calorie count for work outs completely defeating the purpose for me buying it. The bands keep breaking as well from normal wear and tear. I threw this away and bought a Versa,  the upgrade was worth every penny.
 I read many, many reviews before deciding to buy. I love the Fitbit Alta HR!! I am a very competitive person so the reminders that I can set to make progress toward my goal are key for me. I did notice that the HR monitor doesn't read as well when I'm working out. To remedy this, I moved it further up my arm and it then tracked my HR continuously. I purchased the Rose Gold version but haven't noticed any discoloration as previously mentioned by others.
 This is my second fitbit alta (I upgraded to the HR version for the enhanced sleep tracking features) and I LOVE it. The step tracking is very accurate and I love the little reminders I get for my hourly step goals. I only have to charge my tracker once or twice a week and do not mind taking it off to shower everyday. I have bought replacement bands for it including a milanese metal one that makes it look much nicer on my wrist. I would strongly recommend this tracker for someone looking for a more fashionable alternative to larger fitness trackers. It has most of the same capabilities, looks cute, and feels comfortable.
 I already own the regular Alta and thought  I would benefit  from the heart rate feature.  What a difference , well worth getting!  I can use both of them.  I can wear one for a while, put it down and wear the other one.  I like wearing  it on a clip so I wear the regular  one on a clip.  The band that comes with this for small is small so be aware of that.  You can turn off the hr feature and the flower is available  too.  You can have either the flower or the heart on the first screen
 If you're looking for a relatively basic tracker with a few extra features then this is a great buy. I have found it to be pretty accurate in terms of tracking my overall distance and heart rate. The fitbit app has a couple glitches with accurately assigning calorie burn to exercises that are inputted manually, however the tracker's ability to track exercise appears to be fairly accurate. At the end of the day, its a $100 activity tracker that has some nice features. I don't expect it to be 100% accurate all the time.
 Girlfriend is over the moon over this fitness tracker.  She logs her food and exercise every day.  I've never seen such a good backup for her motivation.  She was able to change out her bands easily.  The sleep tracker is a big help.  The steps might be a little off, but it's all good - it's more about staying on track and getting a general idea of how she's doing it.  I think I might be more helpful that it's off.  She's never sure if she's gotten all her steps in, so just does more just in case.
 I purchased the Alta HR in August of 2017. A couple of days ago the HR function stopped working completely. I contacted customer support in an attempt to fix the problem, but they could not figure out what is wrong with it so they "transferred" my case to another department. This morning I received an email stating there is nothing else they will do about it because my tracker is "out of warranty" by TWO MONTHS. They offered a 25% off discount on a new tracker, which I imagine will also conveniently stop working a month or so out of the 1 year warranty period. Screw Fitbit. It's time to find a more reliable company.
 The biggest reason I'm giving this a 3 star verus a higher score is mainly because of the sizing issue. I spent $25-$30 more on the x-large sizing because of Fit Bit's sizing charge/ band printable sizer. The band length is too big to fit my wrist comfortably because apparently when they put those sizes out there it is literally the length of the band versus the length of band plus device. I didn't appreciate the misleading information on that especially for having to pay  more for a band size that I can't even wear... OTHER than that misfortune I am pleased to say the Fitbit Alta HR is working amazingly well. I enjoy the smaller wrist reading I like the ability to get prompts to move as well as getting my calls and texts sent to my wrist.
 Love use my Fitbit Altra - learn something new everyday. It was easy to sync with my iPhone. I did not like the band at all. It was uncomfortable and rigid. Ordered something different which is more to my liking. Wear it during the day and to monitor my sleep at night.
 I love this Fitbit! I had the flex for years before upgrading. I love the watch feature and that you can choose what type of notifications to receive from your phone (my calendar pops up and its very helpful).<br/><br/>The only downside is it may cause an allergic reaction on your wrist. Right where the red light is on my wrist I get a little bump. I can't wear it 24/7. I need to take it off at night.<br/><br/>If you have sensitive skin and you really want to track your sleep be aware of this possibility.<br/><br/>Even with my sensitivity I would highly suggest this product.
 I love this product. I’ve tried apps on my phone and always found them unreliable. I live that this goes with me wherever I go and Keegan track of all my activities. The app you can download with it is amazing and allows you to track food and sleep as well. I find it to be very motivating to help me eatoving more. He size is perfect for me and isn’t too wide. I did purchase another wrist band though, because I don’t like the rubber feeling of the band it came with. It wasn’t a big deal and I found a good price for a replacement band.
 The functions all work well...steps, sleep, etc.  The app on android is really helpful.  The display on this device is extremely dim though.  I cannot see it at all outside, even in shadow.  Also it can be difficult to tap it on.  I often have to tap it three or more times to get the display to come on.  I also don't like the band.  It bothers my skin and is heavy.  Over all, I wouldn't buy it again, but now that I have it I'm keeping it.  I will probably buy a new metal band.
 I debated with myself for a few years about getting a fitbit, but I really like it. This style is much more attractive and not so clunky looking as most fit bits. I ordered a large since I don't like anything confining on my wrist, but the small would have worked.  The little bit extra I paid for this color was definitely worth it.  I paired it with a matching Bayite Replacement Milanese Loop Stainless Metal Mesh Bands in Rose Gold - continually getting compliments, and it does guilt me into walking much more than I had been.
 I would give this 5 stars except the reason I bought this was to monitor my heart rate while exercising outside. You can’t see the display unless it’s a very cloudy day. I really disappointed this is an issue.
 I love the actual fit bit unit, it is sleek, has many options for bands. However, and this is huge, the clip to charge it SUCKS!  you have to fool with it over and over to get it to actually connect and show that it is indeed charging. and if it moves even slightly it is doing nothing but holding the unit.  it needs a much better connection. Looking at the clip I thought this will be great because it grasps it. NOPE. the prongs to charge it are super short and don't actually get a good connection. Fix the charging cable and this would be a much better product
 Overall, I like it a great deal.  Heart-rate jibes well with other monitors.  I like it's little reminders to get up and move (subtle, and you'll want to just check how close to 10,000 steps you are by the end of the day).  The companion Android app is handy, and integrates phone and band well (I like the text-message notification from my Fitbit better than the phone's own ways).<br/>A few things aren't working as well for me though: During HIIT-training bursts, the heart-rate moving-average seems too long, I feel its showing a lower rate when I must be near max.  Also, something about the motion on a Concept II rowing-machine makes it lose heart-rate on me.<br/>Most other scenarios, I'm pretty happy with it.
 I like the app interface and overall functionality of the tracker. The last year the GPS has not been tracking accurately, and it is a known problem. When reading the discussion forums, the Fitbit engineers have been working on the problem since 2016. I can no longer recommend this brand.
 Seems to be a little over on the steps calculation than other activity trackers. Its not water proof and that may be a problem. The display is a little small for me and recalling information seems to be a little trying. You can not recall text messages from your device once they come through if you miss it. However its stylish, securely fastened, and the battery life is good. The reports can be bettered designed compared to other trackers but its not bad. Overall I like it and hardly notice its there.
 I really liked the rose gold/pale mauve color when I took it out of the box.  But know that it gets dark and dirty easily.  Also I was borderline size small so I ordered the next size up, large, as they suggested.  So it's big and finding the right fit isn't easy.  I really miss the jawbone--it wrapped around your wrist like a spring.  These you have to buckle like an old leather watch and the material makes it hard to take on and off. Now I know why everyone has the black.
 I like the idea of the Fitbit. I had the clip on years ago when they first were a thing. I had forgotten the inate difficulties the company has with their software. It doesn't sync easily with my mobile app or with my MacBook. That right there is a deal breaker. I'm not technically challenged but I'm not a wiz either. After struggling with it for a week, getting my husband, who is a tech wiz, to try and calling their support line, problems continue.<br/>Bottom line, it's going back (dispite the restocking fee) and I'm replacing it with the Garmin which is what I ended up doing years ago.
 Works very well, heart rate monitor is very accurate (verified at my doctors office)  Stopped working after about a month and the customer service was great.  They sent out a new one right away.
 I love this thing!!! Especially the sleep function and vibrating alarm clock. I also love the fact that it's so light and comfortable that you hardly notice that you're wearing it. One thing that could make it better is sometimes when I flip my wrist and elevate it slightly, it doesn't always display the time/wake-up the display. If this was somehow a little bit more sensitive that would make this the most perfect fit bit ever. Another thing I noticed is when I'm at the gym and all I'm doing that day is lifting, it won't log that as "active hours". Activity seems to be selective towards either walking, running ie. cardio activity. Other than these two caveats, the fitbit alta hr is great. I take it off before I shower though because it is water resistant but not water proof.
 Bought this for my wife.  Was pretty sure she'd be upset with me for suggesting anything regarding exercise.  Not the case, she was really happy with it and it's motivated her to get up and get moving. She really works hard to get to 10,000 steps a day.  Glad I got her this (and survived).
 I've been wanting to get back into the Fitbit family for awhile now but didn't want the bulky Charge HR that I had before. Finally made the leap and got the Alta HR and I LOVE IT!!!! I can sleep with it on and it doesn't bother me a bit, easy to take on and off, looks nice instead of big and bulky. The heart rate isn't 100% accurate but it's very close. I work in a Dr office and have had them check my heart rate and it's always really close. The only down side is it doesn't track stairs but honestly I don't mind. Definitely recommend!!!
 So far this Fitbit is working great.  I have only been using it for a little over a week. I bought this one to replace a Fitbit One that I wore for a couple years.  This one is much better than the Fitbit One for tracking sleep.  I like the little reminders that pop up if you don't move for awhile.  Great initial impression.
 Interface is complicated. Took forever to figure out how to track sleep.  Does not show time when you lift wrist-- except in the middle of the night when it flashes every time I move. I have to wear a watch as well, since sometimes I want to know what time it is when I don't have extra hand free to tap.  Logs walking in KM and I can't figure out how to change it. Doesn't log steps it you are driving a grocery cart or for some other reason not swinging yr left arm. Wore it same time as another much cheaper unit, which kept much more accurate heart rate. The only way to check my sleep is to synch, which is tedious and doesn't always work. Now it refuses to synch entirely.  Yes, I have read all the directions and comments and have tried turning blue tooth on and off, Mac on and off, re-entered as a new device, and all other suggestions.  Cannot figure out how to turn unit off as directions say to press button, and there is no button. Oh, and magnetic wrist band catches on metal surfaces.  I lost my first fitbit after a month and decided it wasn't worth the expense.  This one worked for two months.  I prefer Runme Fitness tracker.
 I am one of the people not happy with the fit bit for the following reasons. 1.) It’s very hard to read the display on the device in sunlight. 2.) If your on a treadmill and not moving your arm. It will not record your activity or steps. I was on the mill for 45 minutes at a 8 incline as it was on cardio mode.  I held bar for heart rate , the Fitbit did not pick up my heart rate because my arm wasn’t moving or activity. 3.) If you are lifting your arm to do anything it counts it as a step. 4.) Speaking of steps this Fitbit doesn’t count steps like the older version (flights of stairs). It does look smaller and more refined than the big older version.  The interface on app is a nice feature.
 Every day I try to do better.  I love that it motivates me.  I love that it tracks my sleeping patterns and how much sleep I am getting. Also, something I did not expect is that it tracks my resting beats per minute.  In three months, my resting beats per minute has been reduced from 70 to 62. I can see how this is helping strength in my heart. The small sleek design is great for my skinny wrist.  The best part is that you can switch out the band with so many available bands. I like changing it out when I dress up.
 I really like all the feature of this fitbit but I feel like I bought an expensive watch. I don't like sleeping with the fitbit on, it's just uncomfortable. It does a decent job of measuring my sleep though. I like the reminder to walk, I am often busy at work and don't follow it (that's my fault not the fitbit) I basically use it to check the time and silently know when I get a call or text. Great features but I probably should have gone a different route for the money. The only issue I've experienced a couple of times is when I don't wear the fitbit at night when I put it back on in the morning the steps aren't reset, it just adds to my previous day.
 I did a lot of research before buying this and I must say it is the BEST gift I’ve ever given myself. My daughter bought one at the same time. We challenge each other to get 10,000 steps in. This Fitbit reminds us to get up and move if we have been idle too long. We love the notifications of text and calls and the celebrations for steps well done is very cool.  I can already feel a difference. LOVE this Fitbit Alta HR!!
 I would not buy this product again. To retrieve data from the app, the device needs to sync with the app. For the first week, it worked beautifully. Then it stopped syncing. I tried all the fixes outlined on the Fitbit site and the Internet in general. Finally I called and spoke to a Fitbit tech. He managed to get it to sync using the cable, my iPad, the Fitbit and deleting and re-adding the device a couple of times. Bingo! It worked. And then it didn’t. Now, when I want a report from the app, I have to go through a series of steps, deleting, re-adding, re-starting, removing the Fitbit and plugging it in to the charger and pushing a button a series of times. Do it three or four times, and the Fitbit syncs.<br/><br/>My assessment? This is a great product in theory. It has the power to motivate and to help with achieving fitness goals. But the reality is the device is not user friendly and is not worth the time of setting it up again on a daily basis in order to see how you are doing.<br/><br/>If I had it to do over, I would not purchase this item, and I would not recommend it to anyone. I have bought a screen protecter and a stylish band to add to the cost of this folly. I hope I have saved you some money.<br/><br/>PS. The heart rate monitor is grossly inaccurate. My exercise physiologist measures my hr with a Pulsox at the gym, and this monitor shows 167 while the Pulsox shows 111. Save up for an Apple Watch. It has to be better than this.
 Had some sync problems and still do sometimes. All in all I like the product. I also really appreciate the sleep summary. Its takes some getting used to a strap on your arm when sleeping.<br/>20170610  Here is an update of my last review.  In theory it is a great idea for a watch.  HOWEVER after considerable time using it I am very disappointed. I have a consistent problem with a sync to my computer via Bluetooth. It will work for 3-4 days then NOT SYNC for 3-5 days. I have tried every tech support suggestion. NO change. I was told that it was escalated to a higher level. Instead of investigating I received an email stating that it appears that its syncing now. Let us know if you have MORE problems. In fact I sent a VERY detailed email explaining everything however there has been NO answer.  I have 2 concerns I was never told that at anytime they can see all data that my watch records. My exercise, my calories burned and my sleep habits. That is not acceptable and a little creepy. Secondly my watch has not synced in 5 days however EVERY day it indicates how many calories I have burned. .Should I questions its accuracy at all? Aloha Douglas
 Made my wife's arm hurt badley after a few weeks of wear. Contacted fit bit, they bought it back, no questions asked. They sent a box and issued refund upon receipt of the product. I mean, you can't beat the service, but They were too eager to resolve in my opinion. Suspicious. Check web reviews, you'll see what I based on. Don't get me wrong, wife loved it, she tuffed it out for a while but pain got so bad she had to let it go.
 I only wanted it to track my sleep. The narrowness of the unit causes the pressure of it to push on the top of your writs. The first few nights my wrist was hurting. I have had to change the way I sleep. If I could do it all over again, I would get a health tracker that last flat and wide across my wrist. I do  like the app. The dashboard is clean and easy to understand. The other aspects of the fitbit are good but I just don't use them.
 I've been playing with the idea of getting a fit bit for a couple of years. Since I've gotten it, I really don't know why i waited so long. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is the battery isn't nearly as long lasting as described. Which is fine for now; however, when I go camping/hiking over the summer it's going to be harder to keep it charged. For now it's really nice to know more precisely the number steps I take and the calories I burn in kickboxing. The app with the fit bit is also great for calorie tracking. Definitely glad I spent a little more for a heart rate monitor.
 Just got it!  It replaces a fusion that was a pain and NOT accurate at all! Like it already. I'll get back to you after a week or 2 to give an update.<br/><br/>Update:  Its been 8 days.  Still really like it.  The only thing I wish it was waterproof!  I forget and get it wet!  Too expensive to lose it that way!<br/>Also it only tells you when the battery dies is when it's almost dead.  Need to know before it's too late!  Avid walkers be ware and charge it every 2 days. other then that still really like it!
 Love the Fitbit , but be aware that this pretty color band will start to look dirty in just 2-3 days. And cleaning it doesn’t help. You will want to purchase extra darker color bands. I think it’s just the nature of the material. Called the company and they are replacing band with a darker one. Other than that, this is a great item to have to help you get excited about excerise.
 I've had this Fitbit for 2 weeks now and I'm loving it so far. I was looking for something to keep me motivated to lose weight and this has been very helpful; I've already lost a couple pounds! The app is very user-friendly and has all sorts of useful and interesting information. The automatic exercise tracker is great - I'm still amazed that it knows when I'm on an elliptical and classifies it as an elliptical workout automatically. I like that you can customize the goals you are focusing on. For me, getting the recommended 10,000 steps a day wasn't as important as getting more active minutes, so I set my main goal for 30 minutes of exercise 5 days a week and it buzzes and shows fireworks when I meet my 30 minutes in a day.<br/><br/>Battery life has been great as well. I seem to be getting around 6 days before I have to charge it again. Charging takes around an hour to an hour and a half for me.<br/><br/>I'd seen some reviews about the screen being difficult to respond after tapping. I found tapping the band right above or below the tracker instead of on the screen itself to be much easier.<br/><br/>I like how the Fitbit looks on my wrist but I do wish the tracker was about half the height. I feel like it sticks up a bit too far on me but I've gotten used to it. I also wish this was waterproof; there's been a couple of times where I almost forgot to take it off before showering. Those are very minor issues for me though.<br/><br/>Overall a great product!
 Well Ive had it for a day. It does what its supposed to do. However, potential buyers need to be aware, i have an iphone 7 plus with up to date iOS and the text message notifications DO NOT come through the fitbit like they are supposed to. I called the fitbit customer service and they said thats an issue they are aware of and are currently working on.  Other than that, i like the slim fit of the device and hopefully it will be worth the $.
 I really like having all this info at my fingertips. I partike having my texts pushed to my watch.  The watch offers motivational reminders which are good. Amthe biggest drawback for me is that both the texts and motivations have the same buzzer pattern. Mostly at work I hate to look at my watch in a meeting but I need to monitor my texts so I find myself looking more than I need to. Heart rate and steps I’m sure are an estimate and I have no issue with that.
 Excellent product.  Had to replace my old one for I forgot to take it off on diving trip.  Like this one much better than the original.  Amazing how accurate the HR monitor is.  Works great on elliptical machine where as the old one did not record steps on the elliptical machine accurately.  The sleep pattern it records is very interesting vs just the time I sleep.  I do not have to remember to turn it on when going to bed.
 Love this product. I bought it to help keep me motivated to do exercises and it does help. I'm obsessed with doing my steps every day. I have had no issues. The battery life is fantastic. I highly recommend this product.
 Like the look of this Fitbit. I have a small wrist and it doesn't look big or bulky. The really nice thing is how easy it is to switch bands so you can change them to go with what you are wearing. The only thing I REALLY miss is it doesn't count stairs (which I do daily). I didn't realize it when I bought the Alta HR (it was my fault for assuming it did). I'm not sure it would have kept me from buying it though.
 Although I did return our Fitbit Alta HR, I am still giving it 3 stars.  This is because it works well in most regards.  However, if you have a medical problem like the recipient, the heart rate function may not work for you. She has inappropriate tachycardia and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which results in a very high pulse. This simply can't read her heart rate, though it can read my normal heart rate. So I would say that this is good for the typical user, but not for someone with an unusual heart rate or rhythm.
 I went back and forth for a few months about buying a Fitbit.  I didn't really want something that I "had" to wear 24/7 or to feel like it was tracking my every move.  Surprisingly I have really enjoyed the information that it provides and the way it motivates me to move and exercise more.  My favorite part is the sleep tracking, go figure.  So, I do wear it to bed every night and only take it off to charge it while I shower.
 Got this for my mom, she loves it.  It seems to be very accurate.  Nice and small and feminine too.  My dad has a big bulky manly one he loves.  It is very accurate too - and he needs it to be since he has A-Fib. He can count on the heart monitor to be as accurate as the annoying chest strap thing he used to have to wear.  The heart monitor on this little Fitbit Alta is just as accurate as the heart monitor on my dad's big Fitbit.
 I loved my fit bit for three months. It kept a charge all week, sleek, color was good, etc. Then, after three months the fitbit stopped logging workouts. I had gone on several bike excursions and it seemingly logged them, then, stopped and erased my workouts. Very disappointed in the app, crashing. Also did not work well with My Fitness Pal nor Map My Ride. I was disappointed. This had been recommended to me and I was extremely annoyed for all the longer that it worked. Not worth the money.
 I got this to remind me to get up and walk around every hour as I have a mostly sedentary office job. It does a good job of it! My only advice to the company is that I wish you could adjust the vibrate as I think I have gotten used to it and don't always feel it when it does it anymore.
 This is my first fitness tracker so I have no basis for comparison but it's a lot more precise than I expected. I find myself peeking at the app on my phone regularly to check my progress. The alarm and call/text alert feature is also helpful. It's too soon to say if I've changed my behavior as a result of wearing this thing - I exercise and walk a lot - but I can see how it helps people who are sedentary.
 I had to return this because it couldn't to connect with my S9+ phone and was difficult to connect to my mac. It was not easy to use once I got it working nor did it show my steps. I have an off brand version I bought on Amazon for about $35 and it works well... just can't get a pretty band to fit it. Fitbit is at this time overrated.
 Save yourself the $150 and don’t buy this dumpster fire of a product. The battery failed to hold a charge for longer than 24 hours precisely three months after the 1 year warranty expired and their “customer advocates” insisted they had no responsibility to their product, despite acknowledging the battery itself was faulty. Instead, they offered me the opportunity to drop another couple hundred dollars on their next garbage model.<br/><br/>I’ll never purchase another FitBit product, further I will tell the cautionary tale of their subpar customer service every time one of my friends or acquaintances considers buying one.
 Fitbit does not track the heart rate accurately. I have heart rate issues and can't rely on the reading.
 I've been wearing my Fitbit Alta HR for 2 weeks now.  LOVE IT!  My only complaint is that the app takes up a lot of storage on my cell phone, even when the sync all day is turned off.  But my cell phone is 3 years old (which is ancient for cell phones these days) and I just today purchased a new phone which should help with the Fitbit.  Love being able to see my sleep patterns, and have a more accurate count of daily steps.  It sure beats my old pedometer!
 The Fitbit Alta HR is really impressive.  I've only had it a couple of weeks and I know it's a fad gadget but I'm having a lot of fun with it.  The software is awesome!  I had a cheapie before this and it was awful, so I advise to go ahead and spend a little more for the Fitbit if you're looking for a great tracker.  Even if I get tired of it eventually, using it once in a while will be good to keep track of fitness levels.  Do it!
 My Dr. has been wanting me to get something like this for a while. The Alta HR is perfect! Had it about a week now, still haven't had to charge it, &amp; I especially like that it can give notifications for me to get off my butt! The app works seamlessly with it. I got the blue/grey, &amp;its a pretty neutral band.( I really like the fact you can switch them out, so easily too) I haven't had any skin reactions, or problems. Will update after a month or so
 My one star reflects my anger over losing my Alta HR. The wristband suddenly and inexplicably seperated from the unit. Apparently this is a known issue and the first time it happened, I followed the recommendations to remedy the problem, but no luck. It happened again as I was running across a wooden foot bridge. I watched helplessly as the device dropped through the gap between planks and plunged into the valley of a densely wooded forest.
 I bought this for my mom after I purchased one for myself. I had a Garmin device before this and I have to say I enjoy this product much more. Having text alerts and my heart rate readily available is so nice. It’s like I kinda have a Apple Watch without the pretentiousness of one. I also like the little celebration you get when you hit your goal. It is water resistant and my mom loved it, as do I.
 I had one of the first generation Fitbits and loved it. I bought this one, and am really disappointed. It counts way more steps than you actually take even when you’ve set it up and where it in your non-dominant hand. The heart rate meter is also off by at least 10 BPM. It’s nice to have a watch and know who is calling, which is why I gave it two stars. But save yourself the money and don’t buy this.
 I hate it...but I still wear it. It cracked within three days of getting it. The heart rate monitor does not pick up any of my exercise...and I work out hard, daily! I'm very disappointed by this Fitbit.
 It was super easy to charge and use, and I am not a tech savvy person.  It helps me keep track of movement, sleep, heart rate, diet - all the things I am trying to watch out for.
 When the strap of my Fitbit HR came loose (the older version was not replaceable) I switched to the Alta HR. I made this decision based on the slimmer profile, switchable straps, and longer battery life. Love it!  The battery life is indeed much linger and I prefer the look compared to the bigger versions.<br/><br/>The only downside is it does not count flights of stairs which I understand allows it to have a smaller profile. I chose the smaller profile, but of course would have preferred both. Your choice.
 I have used Fitbit products for about 4 years now. I used the Fitbit Zip before my current device. The Zip was accurate, but I wanted to have my HR &amp; sleep monitored, so I bought the Alta HR. I bought the Alta about 2.5 months ago. The battery drains too quickly (I do not use automatic sync), and more importantly, I find the calories burned and activity minutes off by quite a bit (the device is overestimating both by a lot). I am trying to lose weight, so essentially this device is useles to me right now. I did call customer service this evening. It was the first negative experience I have had with Fitbit. Very disappointing. So much so, that I am currently looking into other tracking devices. Time to try something other than Fitbit.
 I purchased the FitBit Alta HR right after I scheduled an appointment for medically monitored weight loss. It has all the features that will help me along with my weight loss journey. For example, monitor your heart rate, create meal plans, track steps taken, water intake, calories burned, minutes of exercise, monitor your sleep cycles as well as set specific goals for yourself. These are just some of the wonderful features and you can use the FitBit App as long as your phone supports it...which gives you very detailed information! And it only takes a few minutes to set up! I would recommend this tracker to anyone who is looking for one. And by being an Amazon Prime Member, I received it in 2 days...plus free shipping!! Can't beat that!!
 I resisted purchasing a "Fit-bit" for so many reasons.  I was an UP brand follower.  I have tried several brands since; avoiding Fit-bit.  Well... I am overly pleased.  I like the app and the band.  And like my little one says... "AWESOME SAUCE"... so far great.  Charging is a good process.  App is pretty decent.  And this sleep tracks, which was a big win.
 Fitbit is amazing, does exactly what it says it will and it does it in a great accurate manner at a good price point.<br/><br/>my only complaint is the charger, it is perhaps the cheapest part of the entire package, and it make weird noises when its connected to the USB port. i am not sure if its an issue with my charger, or they are so cheap that it makes a wining noise when connected to the USB port.<br/><br/>Other than that its great!
 One of the better purchases this year. The Alta is a very nice fitness tracker, and is very lightweight. I forgot I was even wearing it. Fairly accurate in HR and steps. I used a chest strap to test the accuracy and overall it kept up, however during sprints or hockey it was a little slow in registering fast movements, but did get the range. Chest registered 158, fitbit registered 151, then 160. I didnt really care about the other readings. The sleep tracker is pretty cool and was spot on for time of sleep and wake. That said the application is fluid and easy to use. Overall the fitbits usability is very good and you can set it up for simplicity. After trying some of the other fitness trackers, and returning them for this one it is clear why fitbit has cornered the market for these devices.
 like it. there are much more detailed reviews out there. this is small, has heart rate (how accurate i'm not sure) is splashproof, and i've submerged it in bucket of water because i forget about. battery lasts about a week which is great, and takes a couple of hours to get back to full charge. i had the flex 2 and absolutely loved it, but the battery was not as great and there was no heart rate.
 The heart rate works way better than my old Moto 360 ever did, and the resting pulse history is nice. I mainly got it to update my NutriSystem NuMi data with burned calories and stuff, but the extra data is really nice to have handy. My only complaint is the screen is unresponsive to finger taps. Someone should work on that. Otherwise, I'm quite happy with it.
 I was on the fence about buying a Fitbit for several months but I am really happy that I did! The battery on this really does last around a week, the sleep tracking feature is really interesting, and the calorie tracking options are super convenient as well. Having so much automatically fracked and having the rest combined into one app makes logging exercise, food, calories, and many other things much simpler than it's ever been.<br/><br/>Also, I was right between two sizes and ordered a size up and it fits perfectly.
 I love this Fitbit!  I bought one for myself and one for my daughter.  I also purchased gold, silver and rose gold bands so I could change it up when I wanted to.  It's so much nicer than the wide band.  It looks great and syncs to my iphone so I can track my process with the Fitbit App but also buzzes and show who is calling or texting and even the first part of the text.  I wear it every single day and it helps me meet by goal of at least 10k steps a day.
 I mostly bought this for sleep tracking and for step challenges with friends/family. For this purpose, it is great!  However, I do wish Fitbit would come out with one proprietary charging cable for all devices because sometimes it takes me a minute to get it on there right.
 Nice but cant see data in sunlight. I misplaced my Fitbit Zip so ordered this to access heart rate and sleep cycles. I like it but disappointed the data is difficult to see in the sunlight . I have to use my droid app in the sunlight to see the data.  In retrospect, I might have gotten the large size as this one is very narrow.
 I bought this mainly for heart rate monitoring. I work out daily at home and was curious which workout offered the best overall burn. The sleep monitoring is pretty neat. It shows time stamps of your whole night as to when you were awake, in light sleep or deep sleep. You can track your food intake and water intake. Overall it really helps keep me on track.
 I love this Fitbit! I also have a Charge HR but this one is slimmer and the band can be switched out.  I highly recommend the Alta HR.
 Ill not deep dive into a complete review for a device probably that people read a lot about it.<br/><br/>App is good but the syncing between the device and the app is terrible, this is not Rocket science the BT should be on however no response from the device. Nothing more to add if not syncing or giving you issues to sync why expend 150 bucks...go for the chinese brands are far better than this.
 I love FitBit and one of loyal fitbit user. I even gifted couple in my family. This one I was expecting premium feel and it didn't feel one. So I will not recommend this over regular model.<br/><br/>The other big flaw is step count is not accurate on this device it always shows 2000 steps more than mine Blaze. And I have found blaze more accurate.<br/><br/>I will not recommend it unless someone purely want it for looks
 Was great, until it wasn’t.  Got normal use, after &lt;8mos it just stopped working,  first it would randomly go black but recover after charging for DAYS and hitting the reset button repeatedly.  That lasted a couple weeks, now it’s just dead for real.  This thing wasn’t abused, it was worn like a watch, no excuse for it to die like that.<br/><br/>Upgrading to 2 stars b/c I just called Fitbit and they’re covering under warranty.  Here’s hoping the next one lasts...
 It does what it's supposed to do but I have a hard time getting the display to come up.  They say just twist your wrist or lightly tap it to get the clock and steps display to turn on, but it often does not with the flick of a wrist or even a hard tap!
 Do not buy this if you want the sleep stages function.  There is a bug in the software, and zero customer support.  Sleep stages worked for the first 3 nights, and then reverted back to the older simplified data display, which shows only total time asleep.  User forums reveal this is a common problem. I spent 1 hour on the phone with so-called customer support, including a supervisor.  They were totally useless. In the end said they will "refer the problem to their engineers".  Don't waste your money on the Alta HR.  It also is very uncomfortable to wear.
 Use to wear an Apple Watch but wanted to go back to my mechanical watches so I need d a tracker and this works really well with iPhone. Detects sleep and activities on its own.  Fairly accurate and has a nice battery that last well over 5 days. Can barely feel it on. Definitely digging it and all the info it gives. I’ve been converted.
 This works very well- it can even tell my heart rate when I need to stick it in my back pocket to do dishes at work! I find it a super helpful motivator to get my steps in, being able to see how much exercise I've done throughout the day. I've been using fitness trackers since the very first jawbone came out in 2013 or whatever, and this one is my favorite so far. The app is easy to use, I love the daily challenges, and the wristband itself has survived many splashes with water and daily wear since I bought it 6+ months ago.
 Love my Alta hr! I had the flex for 2 years and then the charge hr for 2 years,  but this is my favorite.  I don't get the green light from the heart rate monitor (occasionally) flashing in my eyes at night like I did with the charge hr. Also, being able to see text messages is amazing.  I work in a school and can't always get my phone out to check messages from my husband and kids.  This shows me enough of the message to let me know if it's important or it can wait. The fact that it is smaller is nice also.  Highly recommend the Alta hr!
 My husband purchased the Alta HR for me as a Christmas gift, to replace my original Flex because the Flex bands kept breaking and disconnecting. I have to say - the design of the Alta, which was supposed to be more secure is terrible. First, the band had to be replaced because where one side connected to the device tore and the device would not be secure and it (the band) came apart. Fitbit replaced it with little trouble - but since that time the device itself, on one side, would not "lock" to the band and lately has disconnected and fallen off at least once a day. Usually I can find it and put it back on, but today after a 3 mile walk I realized it had fallen off somewhere along the trail. Not in the mood to retrace my steps and find it. :-(
 I love my Fitbit! It has worked great over the past 7 months and it is very durable because it bang it against everything and it's still standing. Battery life is about 5-7 days, even after all this time, which is fine for me. I do think it counts accurately. I also love the different settings I could choose on my Fitbit screen, I have a flower that grows when I'm more active and it's so cute!
 I decided to buy this for the reason being that I lost my Fitbit Alta. The Fitbit Alta HR came in a brand new package &amp; was very easy to set up! I love how this one has a heart rate monitor (not really a necessity for me) but overall it’s a great product. I am living for the slim design since I am a smaller person with smaller wrists. The only thing I’m curious about is whether or not it can get wet since I am a lifeguard and I’m always around water. My older Fitbit held up with water (worn it in showers &amp; pools, never left it submerged) so I’m hoping this will still be fine after it gets wet. But so far, I would definitely recommend!
 Love it! And the battery does last longer than my charge hr. I got the small and it fits with holes to spare. So nice to have it look appropriate for my small arms and hands.<br/>I also like that I can change out the bands for more decorative ones.
 This may be more of an amazon issue but my Fitbit HR arrived DOA.  Charged it for almost 24 hours, battery says full after synching.  Only holds a charge for about 5 minutes before returning to empty.  I have the Fitbit Alta and it has worked like a charm so this one must be defective.  In any event, returning this one.
 The device fits well (L band, 7" wrist). At rest or for around-the-house &amp; work, seems to work OK,  has lots of cool-ish features.  BUT when I push my heart rate up, it measures about 10bpm low from maybe 130 up to about 170, and refuses to measure my pulse at all (blank screen) when I know it's a smidge above 180bpm.  Did not return to decent measurements, even below 120, until I had wiped the sweat off my forearm.  I bought it in the hope it would be useful for measuring my pulse during interval training. Nope.  Disappointing, just a useless gadget in a drawer now, after 3 days.
 It was a challenge for my "senior" tech abilities, but now that it's working, I'm very pleased.  It makes me get up and move!  It let me know that my sciatica pain was making me lose sleep, so I went to my doctor for a pain prescription and a referral for physical therapy.
 I bought this to track my sleep patterns.  Reviews I had read said it was pretty accurate.  After using it for a handful of weeks, it has not been very accurate.  It will show me asleep when I know I was wide awake. I also tried wearing to track my heart rate - it was not consistently accurate.  I thik this is a great product to help motivate people but in terms of real data not so much.  Mine will be going into a drawer and staying there unless I can find someone who wants it.
 DO NOT BUY PRODUCT. First of all it tracked that I walked when I was sleeping, I move a lot in my sleep but I’m not walking. The heart rate is NOT accurate. I work at a hospital and it always said my heart rate was high when it was no where near that. They charge you a restocking fee and ORIGINAL shipping price so you lose $50-60 right there. Don’t expect a full refund. Hua-wei is what I’m currently using and I love it. It’s $80 and works so much better. Would recommend to anyone who wanted a reliable fitness tracker.
 Bought it for Mom's Mother's Day gift.  She wears it CONSTANTLY!  She is not technically inclined yet she understands the Fitbit and the app so I'm cool with that!  Thanks for making me the best son ever! (well, I'm her only son so anyway... lol!)
 Works extremely well. App is also helpful. I ordered the large band as I am a large woman. It was still a bit loose on the tightest setting. Held up to water via handwashing and sweat. Even accidentally went into the shower a few times with it on. My first fitbit. Overall very happy.
 I ordered this Fitbit in February 2018. It's now May 2018 and it won't charge at all. I've tried multiple plugs to make sure it's not the outlet. It's useless and the window for return on Amazon has expired so I can't return it. It was $150 and it lasted less than 3 months. I very much regret buying this.
 My FitBit does not notify me when I receive calls or text messages, despite my settings instructing it to do so.  Because I did not report the issue soon enough, now I have no recourse.  Just a half-working FitBit.
 It is advertised as a step counter but if I wear it on my wrist it is really a motion counter.  When I work on my computer for hours it logs 1000's of steps.  If I wear it on my ankle (in my sock) it is a step counter but I really don't want to wear it on my ankle.  I'm kicking myself for missing the "return by" date.  My own fault of course.  Give me the old Fit Bit One which just did the basics, steps, calories, distance.  I loved it and used it for 5 years before I lost it. It was very accurate.  So sad that I Iost it and can't buy a replacement and mad at myself for not returning this one.
 Love the Alta! I had a Charge HR previously, but accidentally swam with it on.. I like the Alta HR because it isn’t bulky. I don’t do intense workouts so I knew I didn’t need one of the larger Fitbits. I just want to track steps and whatnot of a normal day with occasional walking/running. The Alta HR has been great!
 I really didn't like it at all. The message and phone notifications work only if you have your phone right next to the fitbit, if you go for only a few feet away, it doesn't work anymore. Also you have to tap hard and several times the screen to see the features. The screen doesn't show the time when you move your wrist. You have to literally shake your arm to see the time. I am returning it tomorrow.
 The fit and data collection are perfect.  I have had the HR2 before and loved it, this one is just the same just sleeker and more minimalistic!  The only downside to this one, is that it is a little harder for me to access the screen while wearing it.<br/>1. It doesn’t always respond to my wrist turn to show the screen.<br/>2. The screen projection lights are very dim, making it hard to see and use outside during a run.
 I did not think that I would use it or enjoy it as much as I do. I never liked wearing watches, but I have no issues wearing this one. I wear it to bed at night and it reports on my sleep patterns. Usually the report includes how much REM sleep I am getting, but occasionally it only reports on the amount of restless sleep because it does not get a good read on heart rate. I also did not realize that I was as active as I am during the day.
 Wonderful fitness product. Suits just right on my Mother's hand and as well as mine. So it has a broad spectrum of users that can be benefited from this product. The tapping and the quickview is inconsistent, to view the metrics, fit bit should concentrate on these aspects to have multiple types of gestures to enable this quick view and not everyone will have a robotic motion and getting the wrist turn right every time.<br/><br/>If not for that, this does its job and the battery life is pretty good as well, if you turn off the quickview mode, it stays alive for almost 10 days.
 Got this as a gift for mother-in-law who needed to count her steps. She is very simple and doesn't like anything that is too complicated or she will not use it so this was perfect for her.  She has managed to figure it out and uses it everyday.
 The "Rose Gold" was absolutely not worth the upcharge- I bought this for my girlfriend, but after a day of indoor wear a thick black line had appeared around the band, that kept getting darker by the hour. I seldom do returns, but this is being swapped for the black color.
 I bought this as a gift for my wife and she has declared it the best piece of electronics that I ever bought for her. It has surpassed the Kindle as her favorite. She uses the Fitbit to track daily steps, heart rate, blood pressure and it even lets her know when she gets a text message or an email. The battery will last for at least a day. And the charge time is less than a couple hours.
 the whole reason I bought this was for it to read my heart rate, and it doesn't do an accurate read at all!<br/>On the elliptical, the monitor will read 185, and yet when I check my fitbit, it reads 82, and this is after I tighten my band.  The heart rate sensor is pretty much a piece of trash for how much it costs.  The only thing it somewhat gets right, to my knowledge, is when it monitors my sleep, but who knows if that is an accurate read.  Overall, I'd invest in something with a better sensor.
 Super light and cool, but the heart rate monitor seems to be useless... It is totally incorrect most of the time (off by 10-20 beats in either direction). Tried a ton of positions and tightnesses but same results. If there's no update or improvement then I'll have to return it.
 Just got it this week, and so far so good. Helps me track heart rate, and reminds me when I've been sitting too long. It's fun to see your sleep record too. Who knew? The only problem I have with it is that outdoors, in the sun, the interaction between my sunglasses and the watch face is not good -- I can't see it when outside if my glasses are dark.
 This fit-bit is awesome are the words of our 11 year old grandson who received this fit-bit for his birthday!. He wears it all the time and shows it off to everyone. We ordered a men's small and it fits perfectly. Now his Dad wants one too, probably get another one for Christmas. Shipped fast and well packaged.
 Not even one year, I bought it last summer. Now it does not work at all. Cannot charge. I contact the support, they keep asking me to use toothbrush and alcohol to rub it. I know how to do that! come on I have been doing it so many times!! still not working. Customer service is not helping, very frustrated.
 I'm pleased as punch with my purchase.  I have been on the fence since I bought the charge HR and returned it due to it not showing when I received text messages.  However, this Alta HR has been totally in line with what I needed to track my fitness.  I went for a bike ride and couldn't figure out how that was inputted but I'm sure in time I'll figure it out....<br/><br/>Nonetheless, great product
 Have had my Fitbit for a couple months and loving it so far! Tracks heart rate quite accurately and really enjoy following the app for menstrual cycles as well as sleep patterns. Overall great product that I wear on the job as a nurse every day. Only wish is that it had a second hand for counting respiration’s, heart-rates on my patients!
 Beautiful device that worked great, with battery lasting  about  4-6 days. However, it caused severe skin irritation/burn, primarily where the sensors meet the skin. FitBit  was very accommodating in accepting return.
 Better wristband system, has pulse, looks great. provides more info on sleep time. Syncing seemed a little unpredictable compared to my old Fitbit hr. I think maybe having the old Fitbit set up with this one confused the signal. Removed old charge hr and syncing normally now. So no complaints really.
 I love it! I had the basic Fitbit a few years ago, but just seeing a few blinking dots didn't seem to keep me motivated. With all of the features on this one, I find myself using it constantly throughout the day. And the watch is really handy, so I don't carry my phone around with me anymore.
 I ended up returning this as it didn’t exactly fit my needs. I found it lacks options for workout tracking. If the only things you care about are heart rate and walking/running, this is a good product. If you would like more diverse workout tracking go with a different model. I ended up purchasing a Versa and I love it.
 I love my Fitbit. It encourages me to keep moving throughout the day to meet my goals. I walk or run for ~5 miles everyday and it tracks that perfectly. It doesn't track other exercise very well, but that's okay because I log it in MyFitnessPal along with the calories I burned and the length of the workout and Fitbit picks it up just fine. The battery life deserves a mention because it truly lasts for 7 days and that's wonderful. I typically put it on the charger while I'm showering or cooking and by the time I'm done it's fully charged (only takes about an hour for charging!) The silent alarm feature is definitely underrated. It wakes me peacefully but by the time I disable the alarm by tapping on the screen I'm wide awake. Overall I'm very very glad I purchased this and I can't wait to see how much weight I'll lose with Fitbit by my side.<br/><br/>Update (10/18/17): 5 stars to 3. After owning my Fitbit for just 5 months, the battery is an honest POS. It randomly dies and when it manages to stay with me throughout the day, the battery lasts at most 8 hours. I wear my Alta while I run so the most water it's been exposed to is drizzle - I run inside when it rains heavily. I'm not sure why the battery is so damaged but it's disappointing! I just ended a Live Chat with a very kind Fitbit Customer Service Rep and I'll be doing a 24-hour "battery draining test" which they will monitor and follow-up with me on. I hope they can either fix this issue or send a new one entirely. I'll update when I have more details.<br/><br/>Update (10/23/17): Back to 5 stars. I contacted customer service again after my battery had completely given out during the drainage test and they were extremely helpful. I'll be getting a replacement in a few days. Hopefully all is well. Fitbit has the best customer service of any company I've spoken with.
 Product only lasted about three months until it got too sensitive. I have the sensitivity turned down. It thinks I’m wearing it on dominant hand when it’s the opposite.<br/>Apparently petting my animals counts and steps.<br/>Also, the wrist band no longer stays clasped, and will fall off throughout the day. Glad I didn’t pay full price.
 The smaller width is much more comfortable to wear. The instructions were not very clear as to how some of the features work, so it took a while for me to determine how exercise minutes differ from active minutes. It seems that for activities to count as exercise, your heart rate (and speed?) need to be at a certain level.
 Consistent tracking/syncing, love the more detailed sleep recordings, love the notifications I can now get. Only thing that is a little off to me is it only works by tapping or by moving wrist quickly to see display. Sometimes have to tap is multiple times to get the screen to show. Other than that love that I can change out the bands and its much more streamline/simple.
 Have been using this for about a month now and am disappointed in its performance. Seems to need frequent recharging every 2 or 3 days. Doesn’t capture my time on my stationary bike or regular bike.  Certainly not worth the price. My iPhone does a better job at tracking and calculating time, mileage, etc. Also doesn’t “wake up” without several fairly hard taps and it’s difficult to get it to scroll through all the information screens.
 I've been a long fan of Fitbit, but I must say it's waning fast. Not a huge fan of the band on this style in particular.  It's quite complicated to fasten one-handed. I prefer the snap ones much better. Should have just gotten the Alta non-HR.
 I've only had it one for the past two yours but it's already so wonderful!  Had the old Fitbit Charge and this sleeker design and actual watch clasp is awesome!<br/><br/>And, I love that I can switch out bands whenever I want to.  Ordered separately, but still a great feature.
 I had to return the first one that I got because the screen was unresponsive. The second one was better but sometimes I still had to press it more than once for it to respond. But I really like the design, it's slick and small. The battery life is good too, I charge it once a week and wear it every day.
 This is a nice way to be reminded to get up and move, eat or drink something. I get a chuckle when it vibrates on my wrist with a message "Wanna stroll"? or "Feed me". "Thirsty"?. It even tells you when to get ready for bed. I would recommend this Fitbit for anyone that needs a reminder now and then.
 I just bought this product on May 9th and now here it is 3 months later and it doesn't keep a charge for longer than 2 days.  It did great up until 3 days ago when it started draining quicker than usual and wouldn't hold a charge.  I'm extremely disappointed as I was really enjoying it and I spent enough money on this thing.
 Bought this to replace my old one when the band fell apart.  I love that this one is nice and sleek and seems to be more sensitive especially to my heart rate.  I really like that I can change bands.
 I love this monitor. I thought I might not adapt to wearing something "as a" watch but fortunately I was wrong.<br/><br/>I like its buzzes notifying text messages, time to walk, time to start cooling down and go to sleep.<br/>The HR seems to be very precise.<br/><br/>My only CON is the charger (cable). You connect it to the monitor and sometimes it just doesn't charge, malcontent I guess.
 Overall a solid device. The wife likes it but definitely wishes it lasted longer (battery). The thinness is a huge plus though and it looks great on her wrist. I really wish that all Fitbit were waterproof though. Also, I and she hates how slow it is to sync out device to the app...why do does info have to be sent to the Fitbit server first?!?!? That's BS...it should not take more than a few seconds to send the info via Bluetooth. Once those fixes happen...5 stars. Still, one of the best devices out there so 4 stars it is.
 bought this watch NEW for the wife. It arrived in a good product box, but the watch and the box were not wrapped - so the watch looked used. plus I took pictures of how dirty the watch was.<br/>The wife didn't mind, so I had to clean it and put a screen protector on it before the wife could enjoy it.<br/>Aside for the watch arriving dirty, it works great and the wife loves it!
 The heart rate (and by extension, sleep tracking) leaves a lot to be desired. I could never get an accurate read no matter how I positioned it. Wearing it flush against my skin to try and get that accurate heart rate read also eventually led to a rash/reaction on my skin, so back to the warehouse it goes.
 I've late to the fitbit craze.I was waiting for one that had all the functions I would want. And this is it.Tells time, #steps taken, heart rate, total miles walked today, # of calories burned up by walking and what I really wanted was the tracking of my sleep patterns. Those nights where I feel like I didn't get sleep --,well that was right. I was too restless.This fitbit even gives encouraging notes throughout the day to "take your steps - only 12 more to reach your goal." Love It!!
 I used a Fitbit Flex for over two years and it was time to upgrade.  This was a terrific choice! Purchase the black because it was the least expensive, knowing I was going to change the band.  I love this device and so easy to use. The heart rate monitor your day is awesome especially for exercise.
 It works as expected. I researched a lot before I bought one.  It is accurate as far as steps, etc. It fits well. The band, in my opinion, should have more options for such a pricey little piece of tech. However, I know I can replace it.
 Lost my Blaze and as this is my third Fitbit, I thought I will go for a more streamlined version. It works nicely and only needs charging once a week. More discreet than the Blaze and I can even wear a regular watch on the other arm without looking too odd.
 I know there's cheaper options out there but I'm very happy with the Fitbit company as they supported my wife's Flex2 and sent her a replacement. I'm a Personal Trainer and I appreciate the features of the AltaHR. I really like to see my sleep patterns in addition to the exercise info.
 Quit after 2 days. Blank screen. Called Fitbit Support and they were nice, tried to problem but it's dead. So, they will send me a new. No charge. It was very hard to hear/understand the Fitbit help-person, she sounded foreign (but nice). I'll ipdate this ai get the new one. This is a real hassle.
 I really love this fitbit given that you get so much more information on sleep and other things, but the band is already looking terrible!  I wore a black sweater today and it got even darker.  Tried washing with soap, alcohol, etc. and NOTHING is cleaning this off.  Very disappointing because this is the color I like.
 I really like my Fitbit Alta. It has motivated me to get my daily 10,000 steps in. It doesn't seem to record my sleep patterns very well but that might be due to the irregular heartbeat condition I have. When I'm in Afib it can't seem to find the resting beat for sleeping.
 I chose Large even though I have a very small wrist, because I was afraid the small might feel too small.  I wear the large on the second tightest hole and the band is a little loose - and works fantastic.  My husband has the (not Alta) and he has to keep the band very tight or it complains/doesn't obtain data.  I love my Alta. It seems very accurate.
 I love Fitbit Alta HR! It's a beautiful, simple design. It's comfortable. The features are just what I wanted: time, date, calories, steps, miles, who is calling on my iPhone, sleep monitoring, and goal reminders. Am very happy with this product.
 After having this under a year it stopped syncing with my phone. Customer service basically just said my phone is not on the compatible list so oh well, they will file a ticket and maybe the developers might fix it someday. If it had never synced I could have returned this but now its too late. I have no use for this if it can't sync.
 Love my fitbit. I have worn it everyday for three months with no issues.<br/><br/>I bought my fitbit for the heart rate tracking and pedometer, but my favorite feature has been sleep tracking. My fitbit makes me feel guilty not going to bed when I set my reminder to get ready for bed lol. Another great benefit has been the battery life. I charge my fitbit once every two to three days for thirty minutes when I get ready in the morning and I have battery for literal days.<br/><br/>I use my fitbit with an iPhone 6s plus and the app has been nearly bug free and syncs relatively quickly.
 I was excited for this color combination and paid extra for the “special edition” - two weeks later the band looks like a grade school eraser with gray on ever edge! See pic. Had to buy a new band- who green lighted this?? Love the Alta but terrible band!
 Good app for my android phone and good performance with the Alta HR.  Switched out the band, but might use the coral band for the gym as they are easy to switch.  Chose Fitbit hoping the company will last for a while unlike other versions.  This was sold out at Costco it is so popular.
 I love this watch, bought it primarily to track my sleep and activity since I have an autoimmune disease.  I’ve been able to learn a lot about my body and how far I can push myself before over doing it.  My only complaint is how hard it is to turn off the alarm, you’re supposed to tap it and I end up having to tap it 10 times or so to turn off the alarm.
 Its been wonderful.  Keeps up with my activities and lack of them also.  Helps remind me to keep moving.  Like that it monitors my heart rate while I am exercising or sleeping.
 This was the best one so far I tried but it started acting up with charging issues and connectivity. It was good till lasted.
 I really liked my Alta HR at first... and I still wear it every day, but I do not like the fact that the heart rate monitor does not seem accurate.  I will be on the treadmill and the treadmill says my heart rate is 150 something, my fit bit says my heart rate is 110.  Therefore it does not track accurately the number of minutes that I am working out.  I do like the fact that it tracks my sleep.
 Lasted 2 months before the carrier came undone. I'm writing this now because I am on my 2nd replacement, and wanted to let buyers know not to expect a long lasting band.
 First time Fitbit user and I like the Alta HR.  Small, lightweight and I like the HR option.  Not sure how accurate it is as it was quite different from the results from a recent doctor visit, but it's helpful.
 Love my Fitbit Alta HR!  It tracks my heart rate sleep, weight loss, steps, miles and more. The many challenges are motivating.  Ordered a bunch of bands in different colors.  Also waiting for delivery on the their wireless earbuds and Aria 2 scale.  Yah...bit Fitbit fan.
 Addicted to this! Getting in shape has never been easier. Love this. It's smaller and love the fact I can switch out the bands with many different options! Def recommend to buy
 I would absolutely love this if it did what it was supposed to do. The HR is wildly inaccurate. After wearing the band for two months, it is clear that is measures heart rate by the amount the band is moving so any strength training exercises, the heart rate doesnt increase hardly at all (if at all). For example, when I use the stairmaster, it reads my heartrate as if I were sitting (around 70 bpm) since my arm is not moving. Walking to the stairmaster it will read it around 90 bpm since my arm is swinging. The stairmaster will read my heart rate at 150+ (And I feel my heart pounding) while the band never registers an increase (actually will decrease). I am very disappointed with this product. I liked having a step counter but I can find that for much cheaper. I have barely had the band for 2 months and yesterday it just stopped working. Doesnt turn on at all. The return window closed after 1 month so I am out $140 for a product that never did what it was supposed to do. :(
 I LOVE this!!! I love seeing my heart rate and this gives me extra motivation to work out having a competition with my husband who also has one now! I highly recommend fitbit over the apple watch! I also love that when I can't have my phone at work I can see who is texting/calling so I know if it is important enough to need to take a call.
 Ordered one a year ago that refused to connect to phone so I returned it. Daughter wanted one this year so i reluctantly agreed to try again. This one worked fine. Apparently this is a recurring problem with Fitbits.
 I thought a Fitbit Alta HR would be great for tracking my heart rate (HR) and sleep duration and cycles. Unfortunately, it only tracks your average resting HR; there is no option to track/graph your actual HR over the course of the day, or display lowest, average and highest HR. As someone with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), my HR is far from normal. I can't exercise because of my condition, and the calorie burning zones for HR are useless to me. For those of us with medical issues this device leaves a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>If Fitbit wanted to go above and beyond, they'd add the capability to record HR whenever you selected that option. That would give me the ability to mark my HR while laying down, and right after I stood up, as that is when POTS affects my HR the most. Then I could compare trends and adjust my medication as indicated.<br/><br/>The display only stays lit for about a second, which is horrible! I need the option to have the display always on or the ability to select how long it stays on whenever I tap it. Also, the cord to the charger is too short. My Fitbit Alta HR is useless for one of the two things I bought it for. If they fixed these issues, I'd love it.
 I  got a coral band, but it's not the soft blush pink color it is on my screen - more like bright orange. Ugh. Also not at all sure the heart rate tracker is accurate-- when I worked out the hardest, it read 88/min, which is close to my resting pulse rate. So... first impressions are not great! And it's more like WHACK it twice than TAP it twice. Hard to do mid-workout, as it takes 2 hands. . .
 This one being smaller fits better than the previous HR2. The color is unobtrusive and I can swap out for other bands in the future. I don't miss the stair capture feature that the HR2 had. Wearing it while sleeping is easier too, as the lights on the underside are smaller and less annoying. I don't like the charger as much, but am adapting. Recommend as a great new addition to the fitbit line
 Purchased for my mother - her older fitbit broke.  I was disappointed this only came in one color - not the color I preferred for my Mom but the only one I could find in her size.  Product was priced reasonably and arrived in a timely manner as advertised.  I purchased another band for her and she wears this everyday.
 I was their biggest critic. I am never ever going to wear one of these. Man was I wrong! So wrong. This was a first and I have to admit that. I was actually wrong once. I wear my all the time and I love it. I even bought extra bands. I would buy another, if I had to.
 Returned because did not count steps accurately in turn throwing my calories burned off.
 I got one of these 3 days ago after wanting one for quite some time. So far so good. Loving it.  I had purchased 2 cheap versions (unfamiliar brands) in the past and neither worked so i ended up returning both of them. After some time had passed I finally decided to pull the trigger and purchase an actual Fitbit. Glad that I did
 Overall great product, the big issues I have had are problems syncing  which is common with fitbit and that the band got dirty almost instantly so go with black over the coral color
 I do like my Fitbit, I like the reminder alarm and that it notifies me when my phone rings.  Now for what I don’t like, the band.  It was fine for 3 months and now the band comes loose several times a day all day long, all it takes is me turning my wrist or bumping it on my steering wheel.  At this rate it will end up in the toilet, on the ground with me stepping on it or losing it.  Customer service is the worst trying to see if I can get this fixed.  It all goes through emails.  I want to speak to someone! At this point I’m seriously considering an iWatch.
 I used to have the Fitbit Alta, which I ordered from Fitbit, so I was a little nervous about ordering from Amazon. But it's perfect! I ordered a size small and attached pics so you can see how it really fits. The color is more of a gray/purple than gray/blue, but it's still neutral enough to go with everything.
 Alta difficult to read , did not keep certain accurate measurements and I returned it
 I don't know why I waited so long to get one!!  I wear it all the time and love it.  The blue/gray was a good color choice.  I find myself moving more and striving to reach my daily goals.  I'm in no competition with anyone but myself.  It is a nice subtle reminder to get moving!  It's slim size is professional looking which was important.  It wears well with other jewelry.
 I love my Alta HR. It's nice knowing how my heart rate is trending and my resting heart rate. I am not super confident that the HR is very accurate but I think it's close enough to be helpful. The only complaint I have is that I like the old band better. The new bands are a little uncomfortable but I will probably buy a replacement band in the old style to replace it with.
 I received my new Fitbit and was so excited to use it. But what a let down. It has over 11,500 step on it for today and only 13 minutes of activity. I drive a truck and it records every move and vibration. What a let down. If I still had the box I would return it. I would not recommend this product.
 Works well, fits small wrist, several features. Don’t like that clock doesn’t show and isn’t waterproof.
 Loved it..  But the bands keep coming loose..<br/><br/>Tried buying new ones..  But lost it.<br/><br/>Solo..  I'd recommend never buying one.<br/><br/>Why do the bands even need to snap off.. Psh
 Works well for me except I wish I could manually start my elliptical sessions. It will not recognize the activity so I manually enter when finished. Love the sleeping stage feedback and now don't want to be without it. Strange that it doesn't recognize floors taken though.
 This is a piece of junk, and I can't believe I paid over $100 for it. Many bluetooth issues, won't sinc, had to be reset constantly... if you liok at fitbit forums, this seems to be a common issue. Save your money or splurge on a samsung.
 I ordered this to keep track of my pulse and sleep issues. It does both of those pretty well. But it doesn't come on when I want it to at times--wrist twist or tap doesn't wake it up sometimes. And large packets of data are missing, and only update days or weeks later on the app. But as far as the device goes, I have a bad nickel allergy, and I can wear it so far without a rash or itching. I wear it loosely as recommended. The silicone band is surprisingly non-irritating (very sensitive skin), but so far so good.<br/>I have my doubts that the step tracker is accurate, because it is very generous. I have a plan to test it against my iphone health app one of these days. Battery life isn't as good as I was led to believe. It gives you a warning by email when the battery is half depleted, which is weird--tells you battery is low, but indicator shows half charged still.<br/>Seems to do well w pulse and sleep tracking. Fitness buffs should get the Charge 2, but for normal folk, this is good.
 I purchased this FitBit for my daughter who is a college student. She wasn't sure how many steps that she walks daily on campus, but this confirms it - a lot! It's stylish and chic which appeals to my fashion conscience daughter. The Alta is nice too because it's slimmer than the other models so it's very unobtrusive and wears like jewelry.
 I am not a big person but the small barely goes around my wrist. Small must be for skinny person or child.<br/>I like the app but when napping it vibrates  and tells me to get moving?LOL. Since I get maybe one nap every two months - better take it off. Battery doesn’t llast  as I’d hoped. Overall, really nice addition to my life.
 Wanted the slimmer look of the Alta vs the Charge but I'm just not willing to give up the ability to track workouts to get it... this items already on it's way to be returned.<br/><br/>If you're just about steps or your exercise doesn't involve yoga, weightlifting, etc this would work for you.
 Moved from a Fitbit One and love the HR data.  Looks cool and small on your wrist.  Battery lasts over 5 days and I get my notifications to my wrist... picked this over the Apple Watch for all the obvious reasons... the best fitness watch/tracker available IMHO....
 I'm getting used to the Fitbit and find it a little difficult sometimes to get the display to appear and have to tap it several times.  It sometimes displays when I turn it to my face, but not all the time.  We'll see how we do as I learn a bit more how to operate and what to expect.
 What a change in my life since fitbit came along!  I am walking more and realizing my sleeping patterns need improvement.  I don't use all of its features as I should, but love the little happy vibration it gives when I have met my walking goal for the day.
 I love my fitbit except the stair tracker doesn't work which is why I'm giving it 3 stars. The fitbit I had before this one (charge) didn't record my active minutes which is why I got this one. Seems there is always one feature that doesn't work properly which really sucks
 I was very unhappy with this product. It didn’t calculate any of the information it is supposed to correctly. The step counter was always off. One minute it would read 409 and then 5 minutes later it was reading 6000. It dudn’t Capture my sleep; erased my food record, etc. Not satisfactory in any way.
 It came with a faulty charger that had a shot wire that needed to be held a certain way to charge. I got it to charge enough to use it so I can attest to it being a good tracker. I then called Fitbit and they had good customer service and are mailing me a new charger free of charge. 5 stars.
 Went from 254 to 239 and counting; since I bought it. Really great reminder to keep moving and stay active. I'll always say it's not the bracelet that makes you lose weight but your own hard work, but if you have trouble getting started or your a person who likes to document progress to give you motivation buy it. Use Myfitnesspal app for your dieting along with this and you will lose weight. Also if your competitive its alot of fun to beat your friends in who got more steps a day.
 Awesome product. Love the design and color of the gunmetal special edition. Received a bad product at first but amazon quickly sent me a replacement. Haven't had a problem with the new one. Would definitely recommend.
 I upgraded from the first generation Fitbit to this one and it's a world of difference. I'm really happy with the quality and (so far) happy with the battery life. LOVE having the heart rate monitor in this one. Definitely worth the extra cost, for me at least, so I can track my fitness, sleep, and even my anxiety more accurately.
 I enjoyed this product while I had it. I bought it Nov 24th and it was lost Dec 2nd. I'm only giving this product 2 stars because the wristband ripped off while running and LOST my fitbit which is completely unacceptable. These wrist bands should not be able to come undone during regular exercise, defeats the whole purpose. May have to look else where for a new fitness watch.
 This is the best purchase I made. I bought this because I had been sick lately and I needed a way to monitor and record my heart rate, activity and nutrition status. I'm also a nurse so I can tell you that for me the heart rate has been pretty accurate. I had lost 6 pounds in a week. After I used this in combination with myfitnesspal app I was able to stabilize my weight again since it calculates the calories needed based on metabolic rate. Also the sleep times have been pretty accurate. It even caught my afternoon naps. I would definitely recommend this product.
 I am very happy with my new Fitbit.  It is smaller than the first one I had.  The best thing is that I get messages on my Fitbit when I get a phone call or text message.  I do not always have my phone with me so this is a great advantage to know immediately if someone is contacting me.
 EXCELLENT! does not get in the way with my jewelry/bracelets. I love the fact that this new Fitbit Alta comes with the heart app. The previous Fitbit Alta does not have this version. Tracks well with my iPhone and the night sleep app on this is accurate so far! A little pricey but happy overall about this purchase!
 It was good when it was new but then the straps broke after 6 months. Now, (9 months after purchase), it seems to be beyond repair. (See pictures. These are all that shows up on the screen. Nothing more.)<br/><br/>Pros (when it’s working):<br/>-thin armband, which traps less sweat compared to Charge 2<br/>-tracks my steps<br/>-has alarms and reminders to move<br/>-display can be customized using the app<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-seems to break easily
 I really like it. It motivates me to walk more throughout the day and I've already lost a couple of pounds but I've also been watching very closely what I eat. Until I got my Fitbit I didn't realize how sedentary I was. I definitely I'm happy with it the only thing is sometimes it will freeze up and my steps won't get counted but that's only happened once or twice.
 Just got this fit bit - it is awesome!  The app makes it and the Heart Rate monitor is probably the coolest part!
 The Alta HR is similar in features to the Charge 2 but slimmer more wrist band width. It is an excellent fitness tracker by all standards and the Fitbit app. Is the best out there. Like the Charge 2 it is not waterproof and like our Charge 2 review it cost a star.
 With the app, you can really get an idea of what's going on in your life, improve it with extra exercise, even compete with fellow group members.<br/>A really good tool, and it even lets you know when you are getting a phone call or a text via bluetooth.
 I have worn a fitbit since 2011 and happily tracked my steps.  Today I received my new fitbit alta hr only to discover I cannot load it on my Windows 7 computer because it is not compatible. It took 2 hours on the telephone with a person who barely spoke English to find this out.  Her recommendation was to find a friend with a smartphone and set it up on her phone.  They are aware of the problem but don't know when it will be fixed.
 This Fitbit is great. It keeps track of your sleep, water, steps, heartbeat and more. Two features I love are the phone call and text message notification. It's amazing. Being able to change the wristbands is a plus. The only negative I have found is it is hard to read the Fitbit Alta HR when you are wearing polarized sunglasses.
 Size is perfect for my wrist being a female. Battery life is excellent, i charge it once a week. Bluetooth feature that tells me who's texting and calling me is great.overall build quality is awesome.
 I think I'll like this product, feels good on, nice slim fit. However I clearly ordered black and received blue/grey instead. Really don't want to send back &amp; wait for another. Was thinking of purchasing another as a gift but not if it's not correct.
 Love it.  Looks nice and works great.  Love how it syncs with my smart phone and how it automatically tracks my exercise type.  Very light weight, forget I have it on.
 I had the Charge and wanted a slimmer band.  I ordered the Alta last year but returned it because it wouldn't sync correctly.  I have had The Alta HR less than a week but I really like it.  I like being able to swap out the bands too.
 Cheap molded plastic of the band connects to the metal of the Fitbit.  Over time (6 mo) this plastic will stretch and no longer provide a solid connection...resulting in the Fitbit coming off your wrist randomly.  Got new metal band to solve the problem, but should be addressed in the basic design rather than an aftermarket!
 My favorite feature on this Fitbit is the reminder to move! My work and hobby are both sedentary so this helps me to get up and move every hour. You are supposed to be able to double tap the display to see the time/stats but on mine this does not work well. I don't seem to be able to find the speed or hardness of double tap that it likes. The band is rubber and not very comfortable. I will be buying another. I had an earlier model Fitbit that broke, but I liked it much better.
 I have had my Fitbit Alta, Large for 2 days and it is awesome! The Alta is actually mor accurate then the previous models. Use to I would be typing at work and my forgot would figure I was 'walking' which made me have incorrect step amounts. Also the automatic exercise works great! I will update on anything else, hut this model is one of the best ones so far.
 Fitbit has been a good motivator to ensure I walk and get exercise.  I did call their customer service twice for a broken band and faulty charger within 2 months of purchase.  I think they have a one year warranty and they mailed me both at no charge.  Would buy again.
 Second fitbit and again, only lasted about 1 year before it stopped recording workouts properly. It is also difficult to charge because of the way the connectors are designed. I will never buy another fitbit. If they are going to make a disposable watch to only last one year, then it needs to cost about $30!
 Bought this in November 2017 and I wear it everyday. It looks ok on my small wrist (not too big). The heart rate and step counts are on par with my Garmin. The wrist band has yet to wear out. I do have to charge every 4-5 days. The vibration reminders to move could be a little stronger, otherwise, no complaints here.
 I’ll make this short and sweet<br/><br/>PROs: sleek, stylish, responsive, very long battery life, tracks HR well when sitting, walking, walking stairs, etc. Basically does a good job tracking your real HR doing regular daily tasks. Great app with super easy pairing and it’s easy to navigate with sleep, food intake tracking, etc.<br/><br/>CONs: grossly inaccurate HR detection during more intense exercises such as weight lifting, running, P90X, etc. it literally stops reading heart rate giving you a double dash for HR. Extremely irritating and grossly inaccurate calorie burn and times spent in each HR zone. Just today I did 48 minutes of intense exercise and the app came up with 20 min in the fat burn zone and a peak HR of 118 - completely wrong.<br/><br/>I have tried moving it up the arm, to the other arm, on the ankle, heck I’d even tape in on top of my femoral vein but doubt it will pick my hear rate up there too. Maybe I’m..........dead?<br/><br/>I will update this post after I try one more thing, that is to apply antiperspirant to the wrist before workout. Perhaps even little sweat throws this devic off completely.
 I really love my new Fitbit Alta. It is smaller than my previous Fitbit, and I like that I can change the bands if this one gets broken somehow. It really helps to motivate me into moving. It gives reminders 10 minutes before the hour reminding me to move if I haven't done 250 steps that hour. I like the features that it offers.
 i bought the charge HR initially but was excited to find something smaller. i accidentally went snorkeling with the charge HR and killed it. it is well worth it to buy a protective screen (IQ shield) for alta HR as my previous fitbit was scratched easily from wear and tear.
 love my Fitbit  except it does not give a reminder to move.  according to info it should remind me 10 mins before the hour if i don't have 250 steps.  i have notifications on and other notifications work.  Reminders vibrate very softly but i am aware when they happen.  i don't want to return  it but am disappointed this feature is not working
 Terrible. It refused to update. After an hour on phone with help they sent me a new one. The exact same thing. It refuses to update and Fitbit only flashes there web address. They offered to send a new one or to get 50% off a new one, of course on the models that are on clearance because of the reviews they are receiving. Why should I have to spend more money to chance it not working.
 In love with my Alta HR. I wear it everyday and it keeps me motivated to keep moving and meet my goals. It holds its charge for a very long time, I generally only charge it ten minutes a day while in the shower and have never had it die on me with constant everyday use. The sleep tracker has been very insightful and I get more out of my workouts being able to track my heart rate. Overall, highly recommend
 Love my Fitbit! It is so easy to use. My only caution is to avoid the coral band. It gets dirty very quickly just with normal wear.
 I really liked this at first, but I've had it for about two months now and it's already inaccurate. It's missing steps and it's very inaccurate with my heart rate, particularly when I'm working out hard. I tried re-setting it but that did nothing. It has succeeded in getting me to move more, but the fact that it isn't tracking things correctly is frustrating.
 So far it’s good. It tells me my heartbeat and steps and sleep pattern which is what I got it for.<br/>My only problem is it hurts a little on my wrist but I guess I just have to get used to it.
 Expensive slim design watch and step counter, that's terribly inaccurate hr monitor.  I've warn it every which way they told me to, but it never reaches the peak, that I count when working out.  The pervious one I owned, last one year, and the battery died, which can not be replaced.  I've seen reviews for the latest one compared to the Apple Watch, but I'm hesitant to throw away any more money at Fitbit.
 I've only had mine for 3 days, but I'm already loving it! I'm thinking about moving more through my day in the office, and I love knowing exactly what my workout it doing for my heart and calories. The sleep feature also shows me that I'm not resting as well as I could be. I think this device will change my life because it gives so much insight. It took about a day for everything to start working right (showing a graph of my heart rate, syncing with myfitnesspal), so don't get frustrated on day 1.
 I punched this Fitbit for my wife to track her steps and to remind her to walk, her decision.  She wares all the time and keeps track of her sleep, steps, heart rate and food intake.  I also purchased a set of Accdessory Bands which she also loves to change to match her outfits
 I usually wear Polar watches for marathon runners but this one has been awesome for my day-to-day routine. Fun, useful and it makes me smile while giving me that extra challenge to ensure that I stay on track, especially on my relaxed days! :)
 The FitBit Alta helps keep me on track. I find myself parking further away from work so that I can get more steps in. I love the reminders to get up and move. The FitBit also helps me track my sleep and understand different patterns in my sleeping.
 yesterday, At just 4 days over my 1 year mark, display is dead. Wristband broke at about 5-6 months. Has had occassional audible ticking noise, which annoys me. For how expensive it was, I expected it to last longer. I only took off to shower, and didn’t switch the wrist bands or abuse it. Disappointed it didn’t last.
 It does the job, but does not impress me with its accuracy. The step counting is fairly good. If I count actual steps, the Alta sum is only a few off. Distance error is also within acceptable range.<br/>The heart monitor is fair. I tested by measuring with watch as well as chest strap. Close during regular activity, but erratic during workouts (yes, I did wear it correctly). The sleep monitoring is quite off. I cannot argue what sleep stage I was in, but I do know it records me asleep while awake and viceversa. I also doubt the cycle numbers are accurate.<br/>Lastly, the battery life is fair. Started recharging every 5 days and that made me very happy. However, after 4 months use, I am down to 2-3 days. A very steep decline. I will probably shop for a different system.
 I had a Flex, graduated to an Alta, and then to an Alta HR.  This little wrist unit does everything and even reminds me when to get up and move and when it is time to  go to bed.
 Wish I could read the time in sunlight.  Took a while to get the app to sync, but no problems now after using the online chat help function.  Great support!  Need to charge  once in five days.  Strap bickle takes time to secure, but stays on.  Comfortable and encouraging me to move.  I did turn off the function that buzzed me if I sat too long.  That was annoying.  Had owned a Charge 2 before.  Like this better!
 I'd rather give this a negative three stars but I can't.<br/><br/>I have had several Fitbits over the past few years and this is the worst ever.  It will not sync on a regular basis and the reset process to get it to sync is ridiculous. Recently went for 9 days without syncing.<br/><br/>I posted on the Fitbit forum but no one there seems to care.
 Bought this for myself after my Apple Watch died. I’m loving it. It is slim but still has caller ID and the standard tracker functions. Fitbit is a great affordable brand of fitness trackers.
 So far worth the extra money.  This is the 3rd fitness tracker I have purchased.  The others were cheap and only lasted a couple of weeks or a couple of months. I like the Fitbit app.  It is easy to use and fairly intuitive.  I like being able to map my walks right in the app.  I also like the summary I get each week by email.
 replacement, works well
 Really, I love it!  I love to examine my sleep cycles and learn about that aspect of my life.  The sleep cycle gauge does not detect the 1st couple of hours that you fall asleep for some obtuse reason, I can't remember what they said. So you have to take that into consideration . It is because of that lack of sensitivity at the 1st phase of "dropping off" that I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. I think they could correct it if they chose.
 I own both the Charge 2 and the Alta HR. The Alta HR is very slim, looks good with other bracelets on...the customizing menu is a lot simpler than on the Charge 2, there aren't quite as many options and you cannot have the taken steps display when you turn your wrist... which I really miss!<br/>It's not the greatest to detect exercise, I really wish it had the manual option like the Charge 2 does... definitely missing the multi-sport functionality!!! It does not connect to your phone's GPS so no tracking on the map where you walk, neither does it detect elevation, aka how many stairs you climb.<br/>The Alta HR lies a lot flatter on my wrist, it does not have the bump like the Charge 2 does. It is quite a bit lighter and will come with different kind of straps and bangles (I guess the original Alta accessories fit the HR also).<br/>The rest of the stuff seem to be pretty much the same as on the Charge 2...tracks sleep the same, heart rate is the same<br/>so I guess it depends on what functions you are looking to have and if you're willing to compromise the size/accessories vs functions!<br/>I use both, the Alta HR during the day (work, outing etc) and at night, and the Charge 2 during workouts...<br/>If this review has helped you in any way, please click the YES button. Thank you
 I love the heart rate monitor and sleep tracker. I'm not convinced it counts my steps correctly though, there have definitely been times it didn't count them and other times it counts when I'm not moving.
 I just received my Fitbit Alta HR today and I love it! The set up was easy and it's easy to use! Just charge it up, sync to phones Bluetooth, and follow a few simple prompts. I look forward to getting back into shape!
 It does everything that i need it to do. Sometimes i have to tap it a few times to get the display to show up, other times it comes up just fine with a twist of my wrist up to viewing it. Note: The band was okay, but i bought one that i liked better at the same time as i purchased the Alta HR.
 Thin, light, tracks heart rate and activity well. Band is rubber and can be hot and uncomfortable at times. Generally tracks sleep well. Good sleep start and stop times, but occasionally detailed sleep states are problematic. 7 nights out of 43 did not have details so far.
 No probs with Amazon. Having a lot of problems with this Fitbit. Called company several times and all they do is reset. Will not purchase another Fitbit again
 I love this thing, but the battery will no longer hold a charge and it is not even a year old.  Not cool.  Foe the money and the brand I expect better.  Buyer beware!
 I don't recommend the pink band. It picked up blue from my jeans etc and looked dirty. I returned it for black.
 Bought this for my wife. She loves it. Calls it her second best friend. If she could figure out how to charge it while wearing it, she would never take it off. The day after it arrived, we took a minivacation in Door County, WI. Hiked in a couple of state parks. She kept checking to see how many steps she had gone
 Bought it for the wife and after about three weeks the clasp connecting the strap to the actual fitbit broke requiring a replacement (that we got for free from Fitbit). Would recommend going one step larger or one step smaller in terms of Fitbit product lines.
 Might work for some, but not for me. Returning. Didn't like all the synching required (which only worked periodically anyway). Another caution is that the screen is nearly impossible to read if you need glasses for close-up work. Felt good on the wrist, I'll give it that. But I'm sticking with my old heart rate monitor, which gives calories burned as well, without all the "jazz."
 I liked how light it is on wrist. How it lasts 4 to 5 days on a single charge. I didn’t find any downside for the product to be honest. Maybe just maybe if it was only waterproof or water splash. I’m really careful when it comes to washing my hands.
 I purchased one from Verizon and it was out in 6 months. This Fitbit works like a charm and it better priced than from the Fitbit store. I will be watching to see if it lasts this time
 I have small wrists and I new right away this was not going to work out. There was a small gap on each side and it was painful to wear. I ended up returning it and getting an Amazfit Bip. I'm happy with my choice because.
 Love it!! Helps to keep me active and I enjoy the ability to see my heart rate. Haven't reviewed my sleep data yet but love the fact that it's available for my review. The design is both functional and beautiful which makes it versatile.
 Love this device, and love the elegant iPhone app. Small and weightless on your wrist. My wife and I wear and use it every day. So helpful to monitor how much we're moving (or not). Especially for people who struggle with weight gain--Step 1 should be wear a Fitbit and see how many steps per day. It tells the whole story!
 Love this!<br/>I will say I ended up getting different bands (SKYLET 3 Pack Silicone Breathable Wristbands for Fitbit Alta and Fitbit Alta HR Bracelet) because my skin had a reaction to wearing this one all the time.
 This watch displays my heart rate when I'm not even wearing it. It also records me as having slept when I'm not wearing it. My friends and I tried putting it on each person's wrist to see what heart rate was recorded, and it gave us all basically the same HR estimate. What's the point of this if it doesn't measure anything correctly?
 This was a gift for a friend. I really like the Fitbits and this model is no exception.  Really quite easy to setup and with the App for the iPhone very easy to use.  This is the third I've purchased on Amazon. 2 were gifts.
 Just upgraded to the Fitbit Alta HR from the old style Charge.  I've been using a Fitbit tracker for about 2 years.  Overall, I really like the Fitbit trackers.  They are not perfect but for the money way better than other devices I've used.<br/><br/>What I like about the Alta HR:  The fit is so much better than the old Charge bands! It fits my wrist well, I like the slimmer profile, and the fact you can change the bands is a real plus. (The band is what split and broke off my first Charge.  Fitbit did send me a new Charge because it was within the warranty period.)  The buckle band is a real plus, too, as the old style band had a habit of falling off.<br/><br/>I actually liked the Charge display better, but I am using the Vertical View and could switch to Horizontal View if I want to.  Not only phone calls come across the screen but also text messages, definitely a plus.  Like other devices it reminds you to move, but no longer counts stairs (The Charge really sucked at that anyway so it isn't a loss to me.)<br/><br/>All in all the trade off in the slim size for features is totally worth it since the thing lives on my wrist 24/7.  Sleep insights are better, but I find the sleep feature is the least accurate part of the Fitbit line of products.  Bottom line, I would recommend this product.<br/><br/>Update:  It is now Feb. 2018 and my Alta is 9 months old.  It has stopped accurately recording my steps!  It records 1/2 of my steps!  I have reset it 3 times, and recalibrate my stride in 100 steps.  It will not sync my manual addition of exercise either.  Calling Fitbit tomorrow while I am still within the warranty period and hopefully they will replace it.  There are a bunch of complaints about this issue answered by Fitbit on the Fitbit website.  Not good!  I have a lot of bands for the Alta so I would like to stay within the slender Alta format. My Charge never did this, the band just broke and it did not have the heart rate monitor.  I am not "rough" with my trackers, they never get wet or dropped.  Hopefully, the company will stand behind their product.
 Got this as a gift for my fiance. He loves it. Now I'm thinking of buying one for me. The price is so amazing. Especially when they are 20 bucks more at competing stores. Comes very well packaged and safe. You won't regret getting this
 This fitbit lasted me 5 months before it shutdown and could not be reset.  i worked with their customer service department that ran me through a bunch of "quick fix" exercises and sent me an email of things I should try.  After exhausting all of their suggestions they will not return an email and was told on the phone its out of warranty.  Crappy product and service!
 So happy that my fitbit came 3 days before the expected arrival date! I ordered the blue but got the black instead but I also ordered different bands so I'm not too upset.  Works as described.  Would recommend!
 It is now 14 months since I bought this product and another identical one for my wife.  Mine has stopped recording heart rate and sleep tracking data.  Fitbit customer service can't do anything to get it to work.  Out of warranty after one year.  It's now just a decorative bracelet.... disappointed to say the least.
 Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. She wears it all the time, was easy to set up and can last days without a charge. She loves the sleep monitoring to help her know how she is sleeping and loves how small it is as she isn't a big watch person. Very happy with purchase.
 If you’re thinking of purchasing this to track your sleep, don’t. Erratic would be too kind. It missed most of my sleep most of the time; then their customer support kept me jumping through hoops until after the return window had closed. This is NOT a reliable sleep tracker, not even close. Don’t waste your money.
 This was great until today! I purchased it 9 months ago and today I noticed it is not tracking by steps by half. I walked 3.17 miles today but my FitBit tracked 1.8 miles. I thought surely it had at least a warranty of a year....but nope. I only had 30 days to return it. You would expect that an item that is relatively expensive would have more  than a 9 month life span.
 I'm very pleased with this tracker.  The band is a little large for me.  It works but the small band would be better.  I love all the functions though.  It's really motivating me to exercise and I'm pleased that the app for this tracker installed and is working fine on my Kindle Fire tablet.
 Got this as a gift for my mother-in-law. She loves it. Loves the features and said it’s fashionable. I have one as well. Love that it syncs to my iPhone. I can see my calls and messages on display. Highly recommend it.
 Already in LOVE! This is my 3rd fit bit tracker. I upgrade anytime they have a new one. I love the color and the features to this one. I can read texts and see who is calling me from my fit bit. Very happy with my purchase
 This is my first experience with the FitBit brand, fitness tracker. I previously owned a Jawbone Up and I am excited that I made the switch! I enjoy the real time, heart rate tracker throughout the day. I have been using my new FitBit for approximately 3 weeks now, so I have not tinkered with all of the features available to me. I will add that I am happy with this purchase and I look forward to daily use. I will note that the band requires charging after four (4) full days of use, but that does not bother me.
 My old Fitbit that I wore on my pocket finally kicked the bucket so I purchased the Fitbit Alta HR to replace it. It works as expected and I've had no problems so far (other than getting used to wearing something on my wrist all the time).
 From the beginning it was not tracking accurately, steps were way off ( I walked 8 steps while sleeping) for one.  It totally stopped tracking on my app. It was synced and connected to blue tooth. troubleshooted, synced, turned blue tooth off/on etc..nothing.  lost three days of my work outs and all the other activity's.<br/>Sadly it was returned.
 I absolutely love my new Fitbit!!  It's smaller and more colorful than my previous one!  I enjoy wearing it everyday to keep track of my activity and helps me to monitor my health habits.
 I love this fitbit. This is the first one I have purchased so I am not sure what other ones are out there, but I am very happy with this one.
 Perfect for HR tracking, love that I can see my texts and calls on it. If you're not interested in fitness info, this isn't for you though.
 The coral color gets dirty very quickly. I’m very disappointed! It looks brown not coral anymore. I wish I could return it.<br/>Also when I’m working out it just stops reading my heartbeat.
 I had this for about a month and so far I love it. The band is a bit short, but I like it. Also I used to have the older alta and that one broke, I hope this one last longer.
 Don't buy this if you want to monitor your sleep.  And particularly if you get up in the middle of the night for any reason.  It can't figure out what to do with that and so does nothing of any use.  The Jawbone UP 3 was good at this but is no longer an option.
 I've had 3 fitbits and this one is the best of the bunch. Part of that is because the app and excersize auto-detect have gotten so much better that you don't need the bigger interfaces. Every thing I do on my fitbit is through the app now. The alta hr sits nicely on my wrist, it looks and feels light. I had the blaze for so long but it was so big and i couldn't use it in direct sunlight - can't see the display.  The altra hr + the fitbit app is near perfect for my needs
 Much better than my old HR, this Fitbit watch holds its charge a whole lot longer. Hard to see the display outside in the sun. Comfortable, but I have to put a wrist sweatband under it when working out to protect it from moisture. Nice look to it.
 Bought this as a gift for my mom. She loves it, and it was easy to teach her how to use it. She isn't the best at using technology, but this is simple, and effective. I have heard nothing but great things from her.
 Works great for me!
 Got the fitbit because I thought I would challenge myself. I have. I've went from 3000 steps to 6000 daily! Love watching my sleep patterns too
 more stylish (but heart-rate free) version of the older Charge HR, the Fitbit Alta is a winning fitness tracker with solid style appeal.
 I bought this to replace an "Up" and I am a little disappointed that the Fitbit counts when you move your hands. I am a programmer so I am typing all day long so even before I got up I have 2 miles done. I will keep using it but I know it is not as accurate as my old one.
 Great fitbit. Keeps me moving and displays my status throughout the day. The battery lasts between 6 &amp; 7 days. This is an upgrade for me, I had a flex before.
 Overall as expected. Strap is stiff and hard to break in.  No feature for number of flights of stairs climbed. Item sits high on your wrist and bangs against counters and doorways if you don't adjust for its height.
 Works great. My favorite Fitbit yet. The band finally incorporates a standard watch type clasp that is much more secure. A step up from the Alta.
 Item was new as described does all that it says it will do! Item shipped faster than it orig said!! I would recommend this product and the seller!
 Works great. I had one issue with it not lighting up but I plugged it in and restarted it and it has worked fine ever since. The battery lasts about 5-7 days for me and syncs well with my phone.
 Pros: Looks nice and can easily be accessorized or turn it to a more professional look.<br/>Battery lasts<br/>Cons: The clasp  is a big disappointment.<br/>You have to be connected to the internet to sync your data.<br/>It doesn't count stairs nor pushing carts<br/>Sometimes you have to push it hard to read your or check time and then it goes so fast.
 My daughter loves it and wears it every day. She wanted something less involved and smaller than an apple watch and preferred this. She says there's not a thing she doesn't like about it.
 Luv my new Alta except screen isn't quite as bright as the charge and requires a few more taps to show activities than it originally stated.
 I bought this as a gift for my Dad -which is not a techy guy- and he absolutely loves it.
 Works well.  Looks good.  Helps me with my overall health.  Of all the fitness trackers on the market, I believe the power resides in the software (on your computer or smartphone)--not in the actual tracking device.
 At 5’3”, 127lbs, the small fit wonderfully. The rubber band is comfortable and doesn’t slide around when I work out. Watch face is simple and clean. Much more comfortable than the Charge I had before, and smaller.
 Love it!  Finally a band that is narrow with HR.  I have always wanted a narrower band with HR.  I love to wear bracelets and have a very narrow wrist.  This perfect.
 I got another metal bracelet that I like better.  But I like that it does all that it says it will and will give me messages from my phone so I don't miss them.
 I mainly got this to try to track my sleep.  Sometimes it had difficulty with that (though that could have been the band I put on it before.  I have a new band, so we'll see.) but it still tracks pretty well.  It sometimes tracks steps when I'm changing clothes, though, but I guess that's because of how much I can move around with it.  Much better than the Fitbit I had before, though.
 It’s only been a few days but I’m happy with it so far.  It’s supposed to “wake up” to show the time when you tilt your wrist up - it doesn’t always. But am still happy with it and am considering the Fitbit kids versions for both my kids.
 Like the slimmer style...longer battery life...easy charging mechanism.  Does not always show data with tapping it once or twice as it sometimes takes several "hits".  It has been quite accurate in reading heart rate which I watch closely due to having some heart issues.
 Love it! Purchased to replace Surge, was too big, couldn't chg bands. This one is slim, lightweight and has the option to chg bands. Black leather band in pic
 I really love my new Fitbit. The details are exactly as printed. The battery lasts almost the entire week. The only reason I upgraded was for the $30.00 rebate. After waiting a month after mailing I was assured that with the amazon purchase I would qualify. Only to be told no. Please keep that in mind if you are depending on the rebate. Otherwise I really like everything about my Fitbit.
 I have had it for a week now and works great. Love the fact that i can see my sleep patterns thru my smartphone.
 Arrived in perfect condition. I don't use it as much as I thought I would, but has cool features and I would recommend for others. I think it's worth the price.
 Being diabetic this helps me stay on track with exercising.  Counts my step and let’s me know my heart rate.  Even tells me how much I slept.  Good thing to help track your activity
 I love this but it doesn't hold a charge as long as I think it should. I had a Flex and if had to be charged ever other day which is why I got this one. I have to charge a couple times a week which seems a little frequent. Maybe that's normal.
 I absolutely love my fit bit. However, I hate the fact that band get so dirty.  It was black after only one week of wear. The good thing is that you can also buy other bands from Amazon.
 Works great and has fantastic features.Charging system is much improved over old Fitbit. The only problem is that it does not accurately reflect the number of hours slept.
 Bought it for heart rate and sleep.  did something weird to my arm.  I thought I had a melanoma till I stopped wearing it. !!<br/>It did work, but not flawlessly
 I love this watch! I decided to purchase this because my friend had one and I wanted to see for myself. I really like how it keeps track of my heart rate and steps I’ve taken. It’s very easy to use and very comfortable to wear. I even sleep with it! The app is simple and there are many ways to customize your watch.
 Received the Fitbit quickly. It works like a charm. Easy to connect to my iPhone and only needs to be charged a couple of times a week.
 Product has barely been used and will no longer charge. This is the 2nd Fitbit I’ve had issues with. Extremely disappointed. Constantly disconnected when contacting their customer service for assistance.
 Wife had a charge2 that she loved but wanted something slimmer that worked as well. This is it. Easy to sync, use and wear daily. With a few aftermarket bands (easy to change) this goes everywhere.
 I love this!  It helps me remember to get up once an hour to walk and counts my steps. Plus I love the sleep reports and it is so comfortable to Wear. I don't ever want to be  without one.
 I like it, but requires charging a couple of times per week...also doesn't connect to phone. Would recommend the larger one that buzzes when you get a call and has better screen
 I love the looks of this Fitbit, especially since I added a nice leather band. However, I have to charge it every few days unlike my Charge that I only had to recharge once a week. I never really know when I will have to charge the Alta.
 unless you are swinging your hands it doesn't count steps. Walking a dog holding a leash it doesn't count. Holding the handles on a treadmill it doesn't count.
 I actually really liked the product, but over the weekend one side of the clasp broke and I lost it.  Had it less than a year (bought it June 24 2017.  Seems like it should last longer than that.  No idea why the clasp on the side of the electronic part came loose.  Others seem to have had the same problem.
 This item fits perfectly and has been helping my wife track her sleep, steps, fitness level, etc. I would recommend this to anyone. We visited Best Buy to get one, but they had limited stock and a higher price when compared to Amazon.
 I love this! We got one for everyone in the family and it has helped motivate us all to move more
 I love my Fitbit Alta! The pink and rose gold is so pretty! It is very accurate and sleek. I can definitely tell a difference in my motivation to get up and get moving! I would recommend this to anyone looking to increase their daily steps.
 The device itself is awesome but the pink band got dirty looking within about 48 hours even though I really wasn't around any dirt. It just soaks up color from anything it touches it seems and refuses to come clean.  I'd definitely recommend the black bands.
 I was skeptical purchasing one of these after having pedometers over the years...but I really am happy i gave it a try.  It really keeps me on my toes...I'll even spend extra minutes at night walking just to get the last steps in...I really like the food log as well.
 I've had it two weeks and the #$% won't sinc with anything.  i'm not the only one.  if i'd read the actual Fitbit reviews beforehand i would not have gotten it. tsk
 Purchased my first Fitbit in March of 2016. Would not charge after a while. Purchased my second Fitbit in August 2017. Did not use it for awhile because of problems I has to take care of. Now I have the time to use it and this one will not charge. I will be looking for another manufacturer.
 I dont like this as much as I liked my original Fitbit. This doesn't fit as well and doesn't record sleep accurately.
 I like the slim design and useful features of this product.  It really encourages me to get moving throughout the day.
 The hear beat feature stopped working after 1 month. I tried restarting it, not working. No matter whether the heart feature is set to ON or AUTO on my phone, and the Fitbit Alta HR is synced, I strapped it tightly on my wrist, it just doesn't work anymore. The heart beat light is not flashing either. Bad experience, waste of money!
 The Heart Rate during exercise  is totally unreliable, my hear rate is 146 and Fitbit shows 96.<br/>During calm periods and during sleeping it seems OK.<br/>So do not buy it if you want an accurate HR during active periods.
 I vasilated on getting this particular Fitbit Alta HR with the Fuchsia band, and now I am so glad I decided on this one.  I like everything about this Fitbit!  It definitely motivates me to keep moving.
 I'm a FitBit fan, but this product is disappointing. I miss the stair counter, the glass front scratches far too easily, and it's much bulkier. I far prefer the original FitBit One
 No shipping or packaging issues. Good quality. Wife really liked it. Better than just a watch. Makes her happy when reaches daily goals, which makes me happy also. As advertized. Thank you.
 I love my tracker. Works really well. I don’t like wearing watches on my wrist. But this one is so light &amp; small that I can’t evan tell it’s there half the time. Battery life runs for about a week for mine. Very easy to set up. Super great buy.
 Bought this as a gift for my wife. The device is sleek and stylish. Its phone integration via the fitbit app was pretty slick as well. Easy to set up and immediately useful!
 It takes forever for my phone to connect to this Fitbit. My phone has no problems connecting to my car and other devices but it has incredible difficulty connecting to this watch. It's very frustrating. I'm literally holding the phone right next to the watch and it can't find it. It's hard to if the problem is entirely with the watch or partially with the phone but since the phone connects to other things without a problem, I suspect the problem mainly lies with the watch. It's a significant problem.
 I bought 2 Alta HR for my parents as a Christmas gift. They both loved them. They are extremely happy about the reminders to move and about how it has motivated them to walk more.
 Fitbit Alta HR is tracking my sleep pattern and heart rate pretty accurately.  Not too big, and comfortable to wear.  The fitbit Alta HR does steps but not flights of stairs.  So it depends on what you think is most important to keep track of.  The fitbit Alta HR has a nice band with a watch band type of closure with a clasp.  I like this special edition all black.
 I have had several Fitbits over the years.  I like the Alta, it serves my needs and is comfortable to wear.
 Over rated product. I didn’t like how the Fitbit reported calories(very unrealistic). I’ve tried different activity trackers and this one by far my least favorite especially for the price. However I gave it an extra star because The only thing I liked about it was that it let you know when you had a call or text.
 It counted me while sitting, as a step everytime I lifted my arm and stroked my hair. So do not lift your arms, it’ll count it as a step. Totally inaccurate. Returned product.
 Date, date, time, # of steps, HR, sleep cycles. I love it. Could only be better if it was waterproof.
 I love it! Best watch for the person that hates to charge alot. I'm not computer savu and at first couldn't pair it. But found it needed a software update. Then everything worked!
 My wife and mother in law love the new Alta. They're both avid walkers and love the tracking capability. Fit is good. Band is better. They both love the interchangeable nature of the band and options available.
 very limited.  does not allow for addition of less impact equipment (stationery indoor bike etc) to exercise tracking.  does not record steps efficiently. does not track exercise by heart rate. I got this because it seemed simple enough for my needs.  It was simple enough but it did not meet my needs.
 I have no issues with this. I am using it to lose weight and so far it has helped me be more accountable. I have begun taking stairs just to make sure I am getting my steps in.
 I am disappointed in this product. It’s inefficient and inconsistent in tracking my steps. I tried working with Fitbit and adjusted the settings, but it still is not working properly.
 Love this fitness tracker. Easy to set up and add app to iPhone. I most enjoy the sleep tracker and step count!
 I absolutely love this product. I wanted something with the features of a charge 2 while not being so bulky. This is perfect and works incredibly well.
 Super cute but the coral color gets dirty way too quickly
 This model gives you almost the same information of my previous Fitbit flex. You need to touch it hard in order tomdisplaynthenimformation on the screen. I do not recommend it.
 a little harder to use than I expected. plus when I turn over at night it lights up, not fond of that.
 I am in love with my new Fitbit Alta. I had the Charge for a little over a year, but had issues with the band lifting from the sensor and had to get it replaced twice. I’ve had the Alta for a few days and so far so good. I especially enjoy the face that I can customize the bands, the little vibrations reminders it sends and all the cool interactive features the app has (makes getting in shape/healthy easy and fun).
 This was a gift for my daughter. She loves it. The Fitbit products and app seem to work very well, and this particular Fitbit is attractive.
 When I received the alta hr... plastic wrap was not on box, inside box protective tap on back of fitbit had already been removed and barely stuck back on. You could see smudges on screen. It did not have wireless piece in box like picture shows, for computers, which I don't need anyway.  Just shows I paid for new, and wasn't. I tried for 4 hours to set it up. The  Alta hr was listed, but once you click on it... the terms and agreement screen was not there. This was my fifth fitbit... I know how to set it up. The screen on fitbit just kept scanning message for fitbit web sight.  Took forever to receive, send it back this morning. I had purchased replacement bands for this, fitbit bands are horrible,  but I figured ok, replacement bands are better quality.  Very disappointed. Sorry to all those I talked into buying fitbit.
 great size. I think the Heartrate is accurate; but I do think the steps count is slightly inaccurate...but a wonderful size; and easy to read, even for my age 60+ eyes
 My husband gave this to me for Christmas. I LOVE It! Love that it tells my heart rate, sleep patterns, even texts, calendar, and when someone is calling my phone! Good buy!
 I loved my Fitbit, I utilized the heart rate tracking, step counter, text message notifcations, and activity  trackers regularly. Unfortunately this deviced failed after about 14 months of use, which is just outside of fitbits warranty. This is my second fitbit device to fail just after the warranty expired.
 I ordered an Alta HR for my wife and received a regular Alta, which runs about $50 cheaper. So the surprise birthday gift was a complete fail. I'll be sending this back.
 Doesn't have all the bells and whistles of my Blaze, but its small size is perfect for my wife's small wrist and records her activity, pulse rate, and quality and length of her sleep cycle. (And she LOVES the pink and gold exterior!)
 Working well
 sensors work, but you have to learn where to tap the watch for it to move around its function
 It doesn't accurately count steps..misses 25% of mine.  It's also impossible to read the screen outdoors on a bright day, so I need a watch or phone for the time.  I think I'll go back to a plain old wrist watch.
 Was bought as a gift and she seems to be amazingly happy with it! Slim enough to not be a bother but large enough to still display all the important info and to read text messages. The gunmetal color is awesome too.
 Well worth the money.  I wear it all the time.  I was impressed the sleep stage feature. The only thing I wished it tracked was when I workout with weights.
 The Fitbit Alta HR is great. Bought it as a valentines day present for my girlfriend. She loves the sleep features. Only complaint is the color of the wristband is more gray than anything else.
 It is fun, I have the time my steps, pulse, and it is all recorded on my phone..  this one also tells me when I have a text message.
 FitBit just can't get it right for little wrists. It works great but looks stupid because it gapes out on either side of my wrist like every other FitBit out there.
 Ask going strong after a year.  I've had no problems and I wear it every day.  I love knowing how many steroids I'm taking and  tracking my sleep.  I linked it to Yumei scale and Lose It app.
 Works great, and it's a Fitbit so you know what you are getting.  Bought this to replace a different Fitbit model.  Very pleased.
 Great app but lacking features that Jawbone had. Only giving 3 stars because it is extremely uncomfortable to sleep with which is a large pet of why I purchased.
 Works as expected. A little disappointed that it isn’t waterproof, I have to take it off to do dishes or wash the cars. I keep accidentally hitting the screen on things and I’m afraid it’s going to break or get badly scratched.
 Read through the Fitbit forums before you even THINK about buying this overpriced, worthless piece of plastic. SO many issues, so many people ready to tear their hair out, trying to set it up or get it to work.  It won't pair with my iPhone, won't pair with my Mac (and the company actually has the nerve to suggest users buy a $20 dongle to get their piece of cr*p product to work properly.)<br/><br/>The Alta HR stays stuck on the opening set-up screen. Peruse the forums and you'll see this is a very common issue, with this model and others. Unlike some users, I refuse to try all of the so-called fixes for hours and hours. (Who wants to reboot their phone EIGHT times before this thing works? And even if, by some miracle, it does finally sync....how long  before there's another issue?)<br/><br/>The Fitbit Community forum is so poorly designed, I never did figure out how to post a question.  (There's even a section for people who are asking how to pose a question. Gee, so user friendly......)<br/><br/>Ah, I miss my Fuelband. Intuitive, awesome, website worked perfectly. As for the Fitbit, it can't go back in the box fast enough.
 worthless. I could not get it connected after contacting Fitbit 3 times.  Horrible. I am returning it.
 This is exactly what I need to be aware of my physical activity. An eye opener. Easy to use, not complicated, syncs w/my ipad. Watch not heavy. Only problem is being unable to see the displayed numbers in the sun.
 I purchased this Fitbit for my daughter and it quit working in less than a year. What a piece of JUNK. We have switched to a Garmin. I would strongly recommend a different product/brand unless you want to keep rebuying it every six months.  Terrible!!
 Awesome discount and gives me all I need that I had in my Blaze without the music function
 Easy to set up for someone who is internet savvy.  No instructions for anyone who is not.  But, I guess they probably would not be buying this.
 I tried two of these from different places and neither of them worked past a couple days in the sleep monitoring mode. The step counter I suspect was also not accurate. I give up on this model....
 The wife loves it.  much sleeker than the clunky one she had before. straps are interchangeable, so we got a gold band for dress up.  The clip for the charger is much more secure than the old model.
 Don't buy this, the step counter is very exaggerated, it doesn't measure heart rate very well during workouts! The only redeeming factor is the sleep tracker has the ability to track anytime you sleep including any naps. Which I love. Other than that I will stick with my Polar for accurate heart tracking during any and all workouts!
 Love it and using it all the time.. I have improved my daily workout thanks to that little guy.<br/>can't do without it
 I absolutely love my fitbit. Fits my small wrist perfectly and i love the blue/gray band. I ordered more bands which i love. Not fully sure how accurate the step counter is, but I'd say it's pretty close. You will not be disappointed!
 This is my first tracker.  I’ve had the Fitbit a few days and really like it so far.  It took a bit to sync it to my phone but is working great once I got it.  It seems to be very accurate on my walks.  I don’t need a watch since it gives the time.  All in all, I’m very happy.
 I had a Charge first, I liked it better than a he Alta.  The Alta is slim and looks better but not as easy to read.  It's impossible to see in sunlight.  It doesn't count flights of stairs.
 counts steps while driving, not good when your a truck driver
 My second Fitbit and I love the Heart Rate feature, but can be a little uncomfortable to sleep in if you roll over on your arm with it on.
 It tells me who I am and what I'm supposed to do. Small wrist size works well. Recommend buying with magnetic wrist bands too, to class it up a bit.
 Purchased on March 8.  About 2 weeks ago band started falling apart with the slightest bump. .... I actually had lost it and purchased an apt to find it. Fortunately i did find it.  But Can’t wear it anymore since it falls off!
 I like the Fitbit brands, but decided to go with the Versa that came out.  This is good if you don't want the smartwatch.
 My son gave me his old Garmin and I really liked it except it was just too big for me.  I like that the fitbit Alta is small and fits me.  I does have a few more things in the app that are nice.  But what I really miss abut the Garmin is that I could read it out in full sunshine.  I have to not over do and I used to watch my steps to not go too far and trigger my fatigue.  Also I HATE having to bang on it!!  I loved the touchscreen on the Garmin and how simple it was to go through all the menus.  I wish I had known that before I bought this. Are all fitbits made where you have to bang on the thing to see anything?  Super annoying!!! Nothing smooth and high tech about that lack of feature.<br/>Update: I returned this fitbit and bought a Garmin Vivofit 3.  I love it.  It is small, fits my wrist.  I can either rotate arm or double tap to see.  I can read it outside.  I like that I can use it to control my music, find my phone and all the other features the old Garmin had.  Thanks to Amazon for making the return easy!
 Love this Fitbit.  You just need to get used to syncing it from IPhone to watch.  I changed out the band to a metal one and looks great.  I don't have a problem seeing the time like some others commented.
 Had problems with original but Amazon sent replacement and it works great. Thanks
 It's so easy to track your steps, your heartbeat, and your sleep...couldn't ask for anything more!
 I like the slim look, and it helps remind me that I need to move from my desk during the day, among other helpful features.
 Nice idea, counts your hand moving as steps not to crazy about that. Does not always turn on when turning wrist.. Love the idea I can see who calls or text when away from my phone.
 Very nice watch.  Easy to charge and get up and going.  Highly recommend it if you want a small, light heart rate monitor and watch that tracks sleep and exercise.
 Not very responsive to the "taps" needed to wake it up and I don't like the fact that there is no timer anymore (as opposed to my older HR). Wouldn't buy this again.
 Seemed like a quality product. However I am a big guy and the band was just too tight for me to wear comfortably.
 Love it. Much better than my last HR FitBit which started to peel off rubber.
 I’ve had this for two days and it’s really cool!  I love looking at the app to see how I’m doing for the day!
 This FitBit would not charge which made the necessary 'update' impossible to execute due to "low battery".  I returned it and bought the 'Charge 2', it charges and is so far not bad.
 Late post but after having my mom use this product for weeks and tracking her sleep with it she’s very satisfied.
 very good product, haven't had any trouble with it, i do like a lot that i can leave my phone in silent and i get the notification of how's calling on the fit bit, very use full if you have a lot of meetings and want to discretely now if you should take a call or not.
 Needed a replacement band and this one did the trick. It can show smudges on the edges but it just means you need to clean it periodically
 I had the older version of the Charge HR (bigger), but this looks more like a bracelet than a fit bit.  I like the sleek look and the interchangeable bands. More feminine for my body / hand type.
 this was great! then it wasn't.  I have had it about 6 months. now the band is falling apart. if I could get to someone at Amazon I would ask for a replacement because they are expected to last longer than 6 months. I don't do strenuous exercise . haven't damaged it at all.
 Had to return 2 to Fitbit, one just quit working and the other would not sync, but Fitbit took care of both with full replacements
 Fit perfect . Use for sleep records and steps. And resting heart rate.
 Does everything I wanted this device to do: track heart rate, steps, and sleep. The touch-screen isn't very responsive.
 Bands are true to color, sturdy and good price. However not true to size, compared to original fitbit bands.
 Loved my fitbit until I found it seems to be making my shoulder hurt.  Took it off.  I miss it. I wish they made one that didn't effect my nerves so much :(
 Love it track my every move ,band was to big so I ordered the smaller ones and is a lot better..
 My son has this and said he loves it, sleek looking and hasn't fallen apart like our other fit bits that didn't last over a year!!
 This was exactly as described.  I had to order a replacement band because I ordered an XL and my husband really only needed a lg.
 Works as advertised
 Great little tool for tracking movement, heart rate, steps etc!
 This is an upgrade from the Flex 2. Love the HR and sleep analysis and that I can see everything on my hand instead of having to check my phone.
 Great product I just wish I wouldn't have gotten this band. It is very bright and very pink! Thanks k goodness the new Fitbits have interchangeable bands!
 It's been a year since I purchased the Alta HR.  It stopped working on the EXACT date (Jul 20th) of purchase.  To top it off, I can't get product support.  geez
 I'm spoiled with the FitBit One only needing to be charged every few weeks. This one needs to be charged at least once a week.
 I WISH IT WAS WATER PROOF! EVEN THOUGH I SWAM WITH IT ONCE AND SHOWERED 3 TIMES. IT IS STILL WORKING, I TOOK IT OFF QUICKLY!
 Love it!  I am trying to get fit and this is great for achieving that goal.
 We are having an issue with the LED Display, can we return and purchase another one..?
 it looks great and works fine, but I developed a rash on both wrists so I need to return it.
 It is beautiful device but it totally fails monitoring workouts different of walking or running. You can't control the device to monitor different workouts when you want. It has an automatic way that totally fails monitoring weight lifting, body pump, body attack,...
 Love the thinner band . Being able to replace the band is awesome. Just wish the Alta HR counted steps. I love my Fitbit. I hate to take it off to charge the battery. :-)
 Very comfortable &amp; light to wear. Today it said I slept for 10 hrs., but it was actually 8. Previously this feature had been more accurate. Not sure why this occurred. Other than this, an excellent product.
 Great fitbit and watch.  A bit hard to read in bright light.
 The rose gold does get dirty faster because of the light color but I love my fitbit. I don't know if it is totally accurate because I feel I should be a lot skinnier with the amount of calories it says I burn verses the calories I know I'm eating. Overall though it does motivate me to be more active.
 What do I love?  First of all, it's pink (is there any more reason to love this?)  Second of all, it alerts me when I have a message or call so I don't feel as tied down to my phone. I've been using Fit Bit products for years and nothing else beats this brand.
 I love it but I really don't think the heart rate monitor is working correctly. I have walked every day since I got it though!
 Bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it - she really like being able to change the bands which make it look like a piece of jewelry --
 I have been looking at this for awhile. I needed to get back on track and  I was excited that it went on sale. It's everything that I expected and more. I love being able to review my progress on line in a report.
 Luv, luv, luv this Fitbit!!! If you like the regular Alta but wanted it to do more without the bulk, this is for you!  It's helped me track my sleep and with my weight loss journey.  Luv it!
 My granddaughter loves it--she's asked for one for 2 Christmases so we bought it for her this year. She is very happy with it!!
 Didn’t keep count properly. Counting steps would jump from a hundred to 2000 steps at a time,  made no sense.
 been using this for a year already. love it. keeps me motivated and I can challenge friends who also use them.
 Have purchased two. Long time between charges is a plus. App works well.
 I really like the Fitbit Alta the best of several I've tried. I don't like the rubber band, so I switched it out for a pretty metal one through Amazon as well.
 I hate this because I wanted to love it.  I went up from the original Fitbit Flex, which was absolutely reliable going on three years.  I have had this just a few months and no matter how I wear it, I constantly have times where my heart rate is not available.  This is problematic if you want to track your heart rate because of health (as do I) or because of exercise (as do I) and if you want to track your sleep (as do I).  On the latter, if the Alta HR cannot get a heart rate for at least three hours, it does not display the enhanced sleep information.<br/><br/>Aside from only sporadic heart rate coverage, the Alta HR also does not consistently work when you raise your arm and twist your wrist to look at the time and other information.  In fact, now, a few months into ownership, it does not always display with the double tap.<br/><br/>I am HUGELY disappointed in this.  Perhaps Fitbit rushed the Alta HR into production without sufficient quality control testing.
 Working wonderfully!!!  I gave these as gifts, and the recipients are enjoying them thoroughly!
 I 'm glad I got this.I wanted to track REM sleep and distance walked.
 Purchased as a requested gift for you eldest daughter!  She has been a running instructor until recently adding Yoga Teaching Certificate to her resume'.
 Gave this to my daughter in law. She is very satisfied with it.
 had a few issues at first but got it working with a firmware update and she uses it all the time. Best thing I've given her in a while
 I love my Fitbit. From the pretty, neutral color to the tips it gives me regarding sleep, activity and heart rates.
 I really like this fitbit. Although, as I'm standing at the bathroom sink brushing my hair, ingot 15 steps???? Kind of frustrating!!
 I would give it five stars, but the calorie tracker isn't as nice as the MyFitnessPal, and I haven't been able to get them to link even though it says I should be able to.
 Bought for mother in law. She loves it. Works great!
 Got this as a gift for my 81 year old grandma who wanted to have an idea of how active she is. She loves it, thinks it's easy to use and enjoys it. She also can do the app pretty well, too.
 Great
 The fitbit is great, but the display for the time is a mirror image.  I found solutions to this online, but after applying the solution it often reverts back to a mirror image display, which is really weird,  Other than that it is a great product and is being used daily for months already,
 Having the Fitbit encourages me to put more time in my exercise routine and watch eating habits more. The band is slim enough that it does not irritate my skin like the HR Charge did. I recommend this fitbit.
 Slim but still chunky.  This has great features for sleep tracking, step tracking and heartrate.  Changing out the band is easy.
 Great for monitoring heartbeat, distance (walking or running) and sleep.
 Fitbit did not work had to return it after spending a long amount of time on the phone with customer service
 Christmas gift, and person loved. Works great and no complaints, I would recommend anyone getting a Fitbit.
 Unless your wrist is moving it won't count steps, i.e., pushing a grocery cart. Further, loses its' battery charge after 3 days.
 Good but no blood pressure, &amp; a little bulky
 Broke after 1 year of casual use. This is my second Fitbit and will definitely be my last ..
 Gift for wife, she loves this Fitbit with the combination of new gold and silver bands.
 The only thing I don't like about it is that I cannot change what is displayed from the device itself.
 Perfect for tracking workouts and exercise. My wife and I are now challenging each other regularly. Surprisingly good at monitoring heart rate and sleep!
 Awesome, came quick, and works great so easy to use.
 Had to return, stopped working correctly in less than two weeks. Was careful, did not get wet etc.
 It's OK but it does not sync to Google Fit.
 Very useful - helpful motivator and thorough tracker of various fitness elements (steps/movement, heart rate, etc.). I definitely wouldn't be as motivated to exercise/move more without it, and I love it so far!
 It's great. Works as it's supposed to. Pairs well with my pixel 3 Android. Super easy to use and set up.
 Good price, arrived on time, great battery life and easy to use
 I love my FitBit! One less star because my band broke within six months. The good news: FitBit sent a replacement fast and without hassle.
 Because of the large display, I initially felt it was to big for my wrist. However, I have gotten used to it now. I like the sleek design and once charged, it lasts a whole work week.
 Band will get dirty and uncleanable. Otherwise, great product.
 Like the style, ordered more aesthetically pleasing bands
 Bought it and a gift; I have had one for years and loved it.
 Wife loves it and it looks pretty nice.<br/>Only thing is that sometimes you have to do the double tap on the screen a bit hard but not a big deal.
 My Fitbit stopped counting my steps after 3 weeks.  Also, I’ve had difficulties syncing this device with my iPad. I’m returning my Fitbit for a full refund.
 I like it better than the HR I had, bought this because HR fitbit watchband ripped off in less than a year ...at least you can change the watchband.
 Bought this for my wife because her old one crapped out.  She is very pleased with this model.
 Great product.<br/>Timely delivery and follow up..<br/>Good value.
 Daughter Loves it very much... tells time and text so she doesnt miss any its great !
 The Alta HR is perfect for me! Interchangeable bracelets, tracks my sleep, and heart rate, steps, and exercise.
 Awesome sports tracker! I love how user friendly the app is, it has all the important and interesting info you wanna know! Love it!
 Makes wrists itch, band became dis attached from Battery component.
 It takes quite a tap to see the display. But overall the product is nice.
 This was a gift for my mother and she loves it. It was easy for her to jump right in and begin using it.
 Gave to my wife as a gift and she wears it daily.  I would recommend it.
 mine did not work out of box.  returned.
 CNt see the display in the sunlight. Bad enough Inhad to return it. Very disappointed.
 as a busy nurse practitioner,  it's like having a third hand...great help to me at all times.
 What a price. Pleased as a pig in mud.
 Works great so far after 3 months, just a slight drag in syncing.
 I had a Fitbit, she wanted one, she loves it!
 This was a gift for a friend who absolutely loves it!  Does everything she wants and never takes it off!
 Its ability to track sleep has gotten worse over time. I'm not sure how, but it thinks I'm awake for multiple hours when I'm not.
 Best tracker I have used. Replaced my Jawbone(terribly unreliable) and my Garmin( too bulky).
 Gave as gifts for granddaughters and they have tiny wrists.  Had to be put on smallest hole in band but they did fit.  They loved them.
 Rats - the band disconnects from the watch and I lost it!  It fell off at work and someone found it, then fell off again in the street.
 This product is helpful for people trying to move around more. You can track as many things you would like or just the steps you take in a day.
 I love usually love Fitbit products but one of the bands broke on this Fitbit after only owning it for six months. I was in the middle of playing a sport and someone stepped on my Fitbit with cleats after it flew off of my wrist when the band broke. It hasn’t been the same since.
 I bought this for my mom and she absolutely loves it! I read that it got the same reviews as the VERY expensive ones. Very satisfied!
 was too small had to return it didn't fit my sister's wrist which is pretty tiny.
 Excellent step tracker and HR monitor. Also includes coaching tips and encouragement. Also tracks calories.
 This FitBit has changed my life. I’m more aware of my physical health and therefore go to the gym more frequently. I wake up on time thanks to the silent alarms. The design is amazing. The app’s interface and insights are awesome. I tell all of my friends to buy these.
 Love it!  Exactly what I wanted.  Wish it would have come fully charged though.
 Bought this for my wife who wanted one after talking to her friends. She said she really likes it and wears it all the time. She likes when a text comes to her because she keeps her phone on vibrate at work and can still tell when a text arrives.
 Very happy with the size and ability of this Fitbit.  Great item for the price.
 I purchased this for two reasons:  Heart Rate monitor and sleep tracking.  Both of these work just as I hoped.
 I had a Charge HR before this and was happy with it. When this new Alta HR came out I knew I wanted to upgrade. I don't usually go for the newest, latest, greatest model of anything but I felt like this would be worth it and it was. I love the color and the style of the screen. The size works for me but I keep it on the second hold in on the band so I could've gone with the small and it would have been fine. I bought a large because that's what I had before. I really like getting a glimpse of my text messages on the screen. The charge hr didn't have that and it's a real time saver when I can't access my phone and I want to know if the text was really important or not. I don't really miss the button on the side like the Charge HR has as much as I thought I might. I wasn't using it much anymore on my workouts anyway so I could get a more accurate picture of what my body was really doing. I have had a problem with it not recording my runs sometimes but that happened with the Charge HR as well so maybe it's a general Fitbit software problem. I love the fact that the band is interchangeable. My old one wasn't like that. I bought a rose gold leather band to dress it up sometimes. Easy to change out. I clean it from time to time with Aquanil. I use a pipe cleaner to get the holes clean. I like that the time and date pop on screen when you flick your wrist towards you. My other one did that and I was happy when this had that feature too. I find the display bright enough most of the time. I look at my fitbit app more than the actual fitbit itself unless I want to know the time or date. I've gotten it wet without any issues. Same with my Charge HR. I actually wore that in the pool once on accident and dried it off quick when I realized it. No problems whatsoever. This is a high quality product. Glad they had this in fuchsia. My charge hr is purple and both of these are really nice colors. They aren't super bright and go with everything just fine. I bought the screen protectors from IQ Shield and just left a review about how mediocre they are. I really felt like I needed to protect this larger screen and they do the job. You just use up half the package putting them on wrong because they don't provide instructions. I lost 20 lbs. with the help of my Charge HR last year and kept it off! I find it really helps me keep track of my calories and exercise. Very worth it!!!
 To track exercises and steps and sleep
 No complaints what so ever. i bought this for my wife after i bought a charge 2 HR for myself. this has been working as expected and is a nice piece of fitbit. definitely recommend.
 The watch is very nice operation and the battery lasts more than a week and its shape is very elegant fit for men and women
 LOVE IT!!!!  Love the size, the info, battery life, etc.
 Love the small version with the heart rate monitor. Also the sleep analysis is very insightful. Great features for the price!
 I love this watch! Exactly what I wanted to start exersicing and looking weight. Tracks all my stuff and I can view on the app. Love it
 My son is really enjoying his fit bit. He’s 13.
 Doesn't always work, but not bad enough to take the time to return it.  Not a good value
 it tells me who is calling me, it tells me when I get a text along with everything else.  Like it alot
 Exactly what my son wanted for his birthday!
 So happy with this purchase.
 I love the product but am so disappointed that it scratches so easily.  It doesn't look nearly as nice and professional when scratched.
 Very nice trackker
 Nice price, good gift.
 Bought for husband, but sent back because the grey was more purple and the band is more on the feminine side. Bought him the wider Fitbit and he loves it.
 Sync is sometimes unrealiable. I haven't been able to sync for nearly a month.
 Really great Fitbit, I'm very happy with it.  Setup was easy, it works perfectly, and you can even read your test messages on it.  Great product.
 Love it. I had the bigger one which had a few more features, but this one is much more comfortable.
 Waste of my money.
 The fitbit does everything it's supposed to and only needs to be charged once a week. However,  difficult to change from steps to HR to whatever on the fitbit. Also doesn't always turn on with wrist flick.
 Very disappointed🙁. Opened and used Fitbit Alta HR.  I would consider this item as returned and used. I will be returning this item. Not happy at all
 Fab, but the screen does scratch more easily than I thought.
 Gifted, daughter likes it
 Got this to replace my Fit Bit Zip that I had lost, so far I like it.  Measures my sleep which is something I was always curious about.
 Delivered on time as promised. Blue gray is a nice option to standard Black. Easy setup.
 Love the step count and reminders to walk each hour.  Don't like having to tap it so hard to show each option.
 Love it! Very comfortable to wear and informative and the text reminders on who's calling or texting is very handy.
 I am satisfied with this purchase and the item arrived on time and as advertised.
 LOVE this so much, it's super slim and HR monitor is very accurate.
 Gets dirty fast and even with soap and water will not come clean
 Worked as advertised.  I deducted two stars because the band is really inferior for such an expensive watch.
 I love everything about my Fitbit.
 Looks great and works great, easy to use.
 Product was as described
 Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!
 This is life changing. The online community that comes with this product is so supportive. It is fantastic to be able to tap into the wisdom and enthusiasm of this group.
 Love this! I have tried the generic, but finally broke down and spent the extra money. So worth it! =) Thanks.
 wonderful so far so good Ive used it  for  1 day. it was easy to set up. it<br/>tall works 💖
 Sizing is misleading. It said I needed an XL (I measured my wrist) but it is way big. I needed a large.
 I love this.  It helps me pay attention to what I'm actually doing instead of what I think I'm doing.  It was a good investment for my wellbeing.
 Item works but obviously been used. Watch packaging opened prior, watch already set and charger packaging ripped.
 UPDATE: On August 25 the Alta HR died. It was two weeks old. I called FitBit and got someone on the phone immediately. They offered a free replacement Alta HR or 50% off any other product. I decided to get a Charge 2 that will track biking, stairs, uses your phone's GPS, and may be visible out of doors. Great customer support.<br/><br/>There is absolutely no Alta HR Fitbit support for stationary cycling, and marginal support for on-road biking. The app allows you to "Track exercise" only if it is hiking, walking, or running. Nothing else. No bikes, horseback riding, tennis, golf, swimming.<br/><br/>I looked in Fitbit's online community for help and this shortcoming has been an issue for years. Fitbit has done nothing to support indoor riding—or logging outdoor cycling with the app using the iPhone's GPS. This would be a great way to capture heart rate with GPS, but no.<br/><br/>The Alta HR is supposed to automatically recognize outdoor bike rides. But there is no way to initiate and track any kind of ride, indoors or out, via the app. If you aren't tracking with the app, you're not capturing GPS. And tracking stationary cycling is completely out of the question. All you will see is that your heart rate rose for a period of time without explanation.<br/><br/>Need to track bike riding? Better look at a Garmin.<br/><br/>Another problem is you cannot read the Alta outdoors, in sunlight.
 Work s. great
 New to Fitbit and loving it.  This model tracks heartrate and one feature I really like is the reminder to drink water.
 Perfect and so glad I got it
 I loved it so much I bought the same thing for my father.  Fitbit changed my life!
 Works great! now I can see heart rates and it gives me updates on activity! Nice reminders!
 Love it, but i am kind of worry that the heat heart rate stop working and the flashlight . Hopefully get my support and work great again.
 I used this Fitbit for just over a year until the screen went blank. While it still tracks in the app, there's no display on the device. Paid almost $150 for this item, that's not a great return on investment.
 making me work out for now!  comfortable, not as many options as charge 2 though
 Really like this Fitbit.
 Works great
 Still getting used to it.  Having a little bit of trouble having it sync to computer but very happy with info it gives me.
 Great! Was a gift for my mom and she loved it.
 I pretty much wear this every day and every where. Blends in with my work clothes and my at home clothes. I really love the functionalities of this Alta!
 Great value
 Got this for my husband as a gift because he didn't want to invest in an iWatch, and he loves it.
 I would not recommend this product. It charged well in the  beginning, but now approximately 4 months later, the charge does not last a week like it used to. Maybe a few days. That is not the major problem. After a 2-3 weeks (now February), I developed a rash on my right wrist and moved the fit bit to my left. I read the instructions about cleaning and taking care of it......A few weeks ago (March or so) I noticed I had problems with my left wrist. It feels like electric shocks are shooting through it. Turns out it gets better when I take the fit bit off. Not right away, but a few days without it and it feels better. I put it back on and voila - the shocks are back!<br/>I wasn't a fan of wearing this thing all the time, so I stopped wearing it at night in the beginning because I wasn't sleeping well with it on. Now I can't even wear it! What a waste of money. It has some great features, but so many negatives, I am so sorry I didn't return it after the first rash at the beginning of February when the window was still open.<br/>Save yourself the pain and don't buy it. Just exercise - you don't need to his to be healthy.
 Very nice company, the fit bit froze you stood behind it,, thank you!
 LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this!!!  Have been waiting for the HR one to come out in a slimmer, smaller version and it finally did!!!  Love all the things you can track on it.  Really helps me track my sleep patterns now too.  Sync's well with the app on my iPhone and all.  Love how you can enter your food in the app and it keeps track of calories burned and everything.  Love how slim it it a I have very small wrists and didn't want the Charge HR because it was just too bulky for my small wrists.  Thought I would have to go without one, but this is PERFECT.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase of this.
 I find the band annoying. It helps motivate me to walk more. I can see that I sleep better than I thought.
 the feature that allows interface changes is great
 I have only had my fit bit for less than 30 days.  Fit bit has inspired this 63 years young man to walk, walk, walk. As a result I have lost 12 pounds.  I set a simple 20 pound goal and omg, almost on the heals of my goal. THANK YOU FITBIT.
 Arrived quickly and I've been wearing for a couple of weeks without any issues.
 Great product
 Good product
 Battery is already down to only keep charge for a day... No good.
 This Fitbit Alta HR is great! I love that I can check the time, my heart rate, steps, distance, etc. all right there on the screen. I was looking for a Fitbit with the features of the Charge 2, but the size of the Flex 1. This nailed it! It is professional and sturdy!
 So far so good
 Have had my Alta HR for a couple of months now.  App is easy to use and personalize.
 Love the slim design and all the features.
 My wife LOVES IT!!! it’s small !!! It’s perfect!! I had accidentally ordered the wrong size and Amazon Prime gave me a refund and I was able to purchase this one!!! A life saver...
 If this was waterproof, I would give it 5 stars, but having to take it off before showering is horribly inconvenient!
 I have owned 2 Fitbits. This one is the best so far. Everything I need and it looks nice.
 Love it.  Works well, We also bought the silver wrist band to class it up.
 I like the fitbit, but the band broke recently and it won't stay on. For a $100 product, it's hard to stomach buying a new band so soon.
 The band only lasted 3 months. It started to fail from the links to the sensor.
 I love the small sleek design and it fits perfectly on my wrist!
 It is small
 I bought this for my wife as an upgrade to a Fitbit flex. She loves it. It's not too bulky and has tons of band options.
 Bought for a Christmas gift. My mom loves it!
 Love this Fitbit. I have a low pulse so I can see what it is on this
 I love this fitbit! It's way less bulkier than my fitbit HR (I can actually sleep comfortably in it), and I love that you can change the bands.
 The band is so much better than the last one I had.  Likd to see my hb count when exercising.
 👍
 LOVE this! Much smaller than the Charge 2, but does almost all the same things. Fits my small wrist well.
 I really enjoy my fitbit!!  Love the sleeping info. I get with it.
 I bought this as a gift and my daughter just raves about it's sleek shape as her wrist is small and it fits perfectly and of course, the fitbit is the best!
 I like the band better than the regular Alta but this lost its Bluetooth signal about 3 months after starting to use.
 Well made and easy to switch bands.  I holding up very well.  Sturdy, no worries about the Fitbit.
 Much better then previous versions; very comfortable.  Absolutely love the fact that you can change the bands.
 uses it daily.
 As expected
 Works well
 My husband wanted one of these for Christmas.  He is very happy with it.
 The wife loves it! Much better than her previous fitbit.
 I like it's size and shape. I wish it had "steps" instead of "Ks".
 One of the best things I have ever bought. The battery lasts forever and I love the sleep tracking feature.
 Excellent fitness tracker
 This was a gift, but the feedback has been excellent. There have been no issues with it.
 This is the first Fitbit I have owned and it is remarkable.  It tells me everything I need to know.  The only problem I have is getting my cell phone to update my daily steps and other things from my Altra HR.  I have a uninstall my fitbit from my phone and then reinstall it to get things to update.
 Good
 A lot more fun than I expected. Great motivator.
 We bought this as a gift for my mom. She loves seeing how many steps she gets in each day along with tracking her heart rate and sleep patterns. I would recommend!
 Works great. Small fits perfectly.
 Not bulky and easy to use.
 The device acts standard to the rest. The wrist straps are turning blue on day 2!!
 Wanted an accurate HR monitor for exercise without cumbersome equipment. Perfect and very accurate.
 Bought it as a gift and she loved it.
 screen reading is hard to read outdoors = preferred my original Fitbit
 Has never syncd correctly to my phone and now I can't get time adjusted correctly.  Did the steps it said to do but it did not work.  I need to call them but frustrated that it has to come to that.  I don't have much time to call
 I especially love that it is smaller and that you can see what your sleeping habits are.
 As advertised.
 Love it! Especially like the sleep tracker.
 Works great
 My wife loves it! Very successful Mother's day gift!
 I have only had this Fitbit since July and it no longer holds a charge. This is my third Fitbit device to have this problem. I will no longer purchase this brand.
 Upgraded to Alta to get enhanced sleep monitoring. Seems okay. I miss my Fitbit Flex. I typically do not wear watches and strap buckle is a real pain for me to use.
 It looks great and is comfortable to wear.
 Works
 very pleased with my Fitbit Alta.  Love the buckle feature on the band verses the snap type feels more secure!  works great
 They started the sleep stage service on the App, worked for two days. Then it stoped and went back to just old movement analysis style that does not require HR data. Many people are complaining on the fitbit forum, but no proper response from the service person at all. Disappointing.
 I love this FitBit because it fits my small wrist and feels comfortable. I can even wear it with another watch next to it.  It has all the functions I need. It is very accurate - I have worn it with a chest HR and the most they have ever differed is by less than 5 beats per minute.
 This is so usable! It has all sorts of info right there on my wrist. It even reminds me when to feed my cats!
 This has been so helpful in motivating me to do me BETTER and in getting my post-pregnancy groove back. I recommend it to anyone who is ready to challenge yourself to get your health on
 This is my second fitbit and I love it.  Also, you will get great support from Fitbit, very helpful, patient and friendly.
 seems to be very accurate and easy to use, holds a charge for about 4 days depending on how much you have it syncing to the device of choice.
 Excellent Product.
 It's pretty beautiful and stylish... Can be improved the functionality, in the future...
 So much better than the larger fitbit and I having a replaceable band is awesome!
 It's an all around great device... I really like how long the battery stays charged and that it's sweat resistant!
 I like the slimmer line. It seems to be on point and work properly. I had a Charge HR that had some glitches. This is overall more comfortable. I had to adjust to the smaller window but after a week it was fine.
 Sleep tracking is a little off, but other than that it's perfect. knowing what others are doing provides extra incentive to work a little bit harder to keep up or surpass them.
 Exactly as described and pictured!
 Love my Fitbit Alta
 Love it just wish I had bought the scratch guard for the face..
 much slimmer and light weight than the previous HR models
 Battery died after one year
 Love Fitbit, got this one for my mom and she loves it too
 Great buy.  Love it
 It is awesome!  It came quickly, does everything I wanted, and looks great!  Love it!
 Perfect 👌 This is very beautiful... I love this 😍
 It’s a birthday gift for my husband and he really love it. Coworker of him also buy one after seeing him wear two days. It’s definitely a good product.
 Love my new fitbit.
 Arrived well and on time, correct color and size on the first attempt. It helps helps me keep motivated and pushes me to achieve more.
 I't s nice.  I just prefer metal.
 Love all the features of this.  I also love that you can purchase changeable bands to go with any outfit ❣️❣️❣️  I knocked off a star as you can't shower with it on and you need to make sure if you get it wet to wipe it dry.
 The Fitbit has changed my life! I've never exercised and walked as much until now. It helps keep me motivated. Best purchase I've made in a long time!!! I highly recommend it!
 Love the Alta HR! One addition is to make it waterproof so I could wear in pool or shower :-)
 good deal
 The product arrived earlier which was great, in good conditions and the original package, overall it’s good, the reason why a 3 is because it is very hard to press the screen to show you stats, and that’s something to do with the manufacturer and not the seller, although I must say it gets better.
 wife likes
 Wife loves it.  Makes me happy.  Damn thing lies on achievement according to her, but looks good.
 Bought this for my mom and she loves it.
 To  bad I didn't wait a few weeks for Black Friday sales!!
 love it and got the extended warranty too
 She loves it. She also replaced the band with something more practical and suitable.
 Only lasted a year and 7 months. Battery is completely dead. Won’t buy another one.
 A little difficult to see display when outside.
 Love the Fitbit and the band color. Wish it was waterproof, though, as that is the bulk of my exercise.
 I really like this fit bit with its sleep monitor and heart rate. It does what I need it to do.
 Good product.  Keeps me on my toes to get my exercise in each day.  Also tracks my sleep, heart rate, and I can log my weight in the phone app.
 Like it better than my previous ones simply because the wristband stays on.  I kept losing my others.
 My heart races often and this has been great to help watch my heart rate at all times. I have noticed that after a full nights sleep, I am still tired so this has also been good for me to track my sleeping patterns.
 my wife loved it.
 Quit wasting time and money! Just do it! It is worth it! Great, fast service.
 Really enjoying the newer version even though I wished my other had not stopped charging under one year of ownership.
 I love it worth every penny
 Terrible for accuracy when doing high intensity training... i can't return it
 Love the coral color and the band. It has a lot of functions including reading your text messages and monitoring your sleep. Highly recommend.
 Stopped synching after a few months
 Bought as a gift for my mom and she loves it. Not too bulky and perfect for every day continuous use
 Does what it’s supposed to!
 The face is too light and I can not see it when outside, thus the watch part is useless.
 I love my Fitbit, I really do. Only small issue is that the armband seems to be breaking my arm out because the band does not breathe at all. Will have to get a better band, but still a great buy.
 Ordered one for my daughter too.  Nice to share our progress.  She's doing much better than me :)
 Screen fell off after a couple weeks and stopped working
 Great band...works perfect. Thanks!!!
 does not charge every time and if it does charge it last a few days at best
 Lone it
 Great item easy to use!
 excactly what I wanted
 Bought it for my wife's b'day and she loves it. Does what she wants.
 Was never accurate with counting steps, and then stopped working 2 months after purchasing.  Amazon says it is past return window-totally disappointing.  I would love someone from Fitbit to contact me and warranty this product
 I cannot write how much I love this.  The best feature is the heart rate option.
 Summary states it transfer activities; not true-does NOT record biking accurately at all! In addition, impossible to read screen in sunlight-you must use the phone app to do that. Otherwise good and easy to use.
 Compact, good-looking, very useful.  Also displays text messages, but will not display them if they have Emojis.
 AAA+++
 I am very happy with this watch. It is just what I was looking for.
 So far it is working well.  I like the smaller, narrower design - more feminine.  Although I don't have to have the stairs counted, it was always fun to see how many I had done.  Overall I like it.
 Very nice.  Works great. Wish it would pass heart rate into Apple Health interfacevin my phone, but a quality device that I really enjoy.
 love this Fitbit, so easy to use
 Loving the Alta
 Really happy with this purchase. I like the gunmetal side as opposed to the silver colored sides.
 Love my Fitbit!  I wear it except in the shower.  Only wish the battery lasted longer.
 Thank you
 Love it!
 So far so good.  I love how it knows I exercised &lt;3
 I love being able to track my steps, exercise, and sleep!  As a teacher, I like the slim look while being able to see how much I walk around during class. I'm really enjoying this fitbit, and it's inspiring me to be more active!
 love it Still working
 “Wears it to monitor time and exercise” my grandma word for word
 My wife loves this, works well and helps motivate her to get up and move. Text reading is a nice feature.
 Great item love it and fast delivery
 fun to get texts on the fitbit
 Good price, color is nice.
 Gave this to my sister for Christmas and she is loving it.
 Love it
 Got for wife for xmas seems to be qaulity made
 Awesome.
 Was a present for my wife.  She loves it, still holding up after several months use.
 I scratched my screen so I bought this, and it works wonders! It was easy to apply, and it doesn't scratch even when I accidentally wack it against a corner
 Fantastic fit bit !!!! So many nice features and easy to set up for us who have difficulty with technology
 Was a gift for my sister and she is so far loving it!
 So far so good!  I like being able to track my health, and the app is really cool and easy to use.  Very motivational to pay better attention to my nutrition and level of activity!
 pretty and functional - love it
 Exactly as advertised.
 Love it - makes me very motivated to do better.
 The Alta is a light, easy to read and much easier to wear than the larger Fit Bits.
 Exactly what we wanted.  Easy to install/uninstall, looks great.
 Love the new Alta HR.  This is the fitness tracker I have been waiting for!  I have had both a FitBit One and a Withings.  I really prefer the functions of the Alta HR over the One or the Withings I had comparable to the FB One.  Love the heart rate monitoring and the sleep monitoring being automatic.  More customizable display is also very nice.  One thing I wish you could change on the display is how your steps display as 10K, 10.5K, etc.  I would prefer to see the actual number, but I understand with the vertical display, just not possible.
 Nice. Bought for my wife. She's a fit bit chick 4 life.
 I bought this for my husband and he loves it! and I do too, he is trying to exercise more, looking at the facts from the Fitbit
 Really like the band very comfortable and nice looking.
 Love mine. Fits great. Works great. Long charge. Love the text and call feature.
 Fitness
 Functions are good, but it's a bit uncomfortable for sleeping.
 Full-featured top perfomer.  It does everything you'd want a fitness band to do.
 Great product to track your exercise and sleep activities.
 Love being able to track movement, calories and sleep. I also love being able to connect with friends via the app and see their step count. The friendly competition has made me step my workout up!
 Had a hard time syncing with my Apple Watch.
 Good product!
 good quality and perfect fit
 light color band will pickup grime and discolor fast
 I like it ! It's my new toy and I'm so excited to walk and work out know ! It works well and everything is as I expected. The biggest great point is that I can change the band and make it fitting perfectly with my outfit !
 Love it! It is exactly as it looks in the picture, lightweight, and tracks things perfectly!
 Wear it everyday!
 This is my Wife's  third Fit Bit, and this is by far her favorite one. Loves it !
 Loved the Christmas gift
 Bought this for my 21 year and she loves it.
 beautiful
 Love finding a band small enough for my wrist.  Great features
 use it most of the time, it gives me a lot of information
 very good. bought for a gift
 daughter loves it
 I love the Fitbit but I would expect the band to last more than a couple months.  Very disappointed.
 I have one that I adore, so I bought my boyfriend one for Valentines. The only time we are not wearing them is when they need to be charged about once a week or so. LOVE IT!
 Gave it to someone as a gift. On opening the package the unit refused to turn on. Left it to charge and still won’t turn on charged overnight and did reset steps per guide on website, still won’t turn on.<br/><br/>Returning it.
 This was a Christmas present for my daughter she loved it
 I love my fitbit. It helps me to keep moving.
 Bought wife Charge HR last year, she would not wear it, so it's mine. This one she wears !
 Works as expected, daughter loves it.
 great!
 Love the style and quality.
 Love this
 Got this for tracking sleep.  Been able to adjust schedules and getting better sleep.
 charger is very flimsy... i often have to go back to look at my fitbit to see if it has been charged and 80% of the time it is not.
 Love love love fibit alta hr. Nothing bad yo say about this product!
 Item I received was scratched—clearly a used item.  It was also missing the charger!
 It tracks everything! Alerts you for calls and texts. It is great!
 I love my new Alta HR! The shipping was excellent! Everything worked and was very easy to setup.
 Great fitbit unit, easy to setup and start to use.
 I can only say i am enjoying it very much. I personally like seeing the distance i walked in a day, how i slept the night before and my heart rate at different times.
 Beautiful, love it!
 xmas gift
 Forget it trying to read the digi screen outside. Break down and buy the Apple Watch. I did and it’s well worth it. This junk went back to Fitbit.
 Very helpful tracking my everyday steps
 Best fitbit I have ordered.
 item as described
 it works!!!
 I was very disappointed with the steps tracking-it would record steps when I wasn’t even walking!!
 Love it
 This device does some of what the Fitbit company claims, some of the time. As I write this, the Sleep Analysis feature is not working. The reason it does not work is yet another major disappointment which I consider False Advertising by Fitbit. First: the sleep analysis feature is not working because fitbit has a bug in there programming (reported to me by a fitbit customer service person and their supervisor). It has been down for a few days now, even though it had been working fine for the first 8 days since I purchased the Alta . The second problem, and very important for some people, is that you get none of the functionality described for this tracker unless you are connected to the INTERNET !!!! That right: it is not enough to have the Fitbit app on your device (telephone, tablet, or computer). That devise must be connected to the Internet at the time you sync your tracker and for several minutes thereafter. So if you are not somewhere with internet, there is NO syncing gonna happen and there is nothing this tracker can do but collect data (they say for up to 7 days) and tell time plus a few other really basic things. If the Fitbit app was stand-alone, as they strongly imply in all their marketing material, there would be no problem with the Sleep Analysis. But the app does not do the analysis. It only communicates all your data back to Fitbit where the calculations are performed. Like I said, without internet ---- nothing.<br/><br/>There are plenty of reviews which say what is good about the Alta, and mostly I agree. The false representation of the product is just a big deal for me. And the company has a reputation for exaggerating the capabilities of their products. Even the Fitbit website "community area" has many problems noted by customers and the company's response is a variation on "yes, this feature is not working" or "this feature is not working yet".
 Much less reliable than previous Fitbit monitors. Rarely functions as advertised, constantly needs to be restarted, and customer service is non- existent. Does track steps, not good about tracking heart rate.
 works great
 Very difficult to set up.  Instructions were incomplete and so was the shipment, we didn’t receive a dongle.  No problem  Fitbit overnighted a replacement.  Good company to do business.
 i actually really like this. I never was one for wearing jewelry but this is so functional
 Love it! Works well.
 Very nice and does everything I want it to do. The only downfall is that it is hard to see in the sun.
 Only stays chrged for barely 2 days
 serves my daughter well and looks perfect on her very thin wrist... thank you!
 Love it and love the slim look versus the Fitbit HR
 The battery drains way too fast. Beyond annoying
 Wife doesn’t take it off battery life is great
 was a gift and it is doing a great job11
 I upgraded from the Charge HR to this one because it's smaller. I love it.
 I'm genuinely in love with my fitbit. It's a part of my daily routine and I'm constantly improving and surprising myself. I'm a numbers person so it was exactly what I needed to start taking fitness seriously and incorporate it into my life.
 Husband loves it, its easy to wear, easy to use, and isn't intrusive when you sleep.  I wasn't sure how much he'd really use it, but he's totally addicted to it.
 I really like his tracker, however just like other Fitbits I have owned in the past, after a few months it won’t hold a charge. Luckily, they have a one year warranty!
 Wife loves it, tracks heart rate, steps and sleep including Cycles.
 Does everything it's supposed to do and more.  No need for any other fitness, nutrition, or sleep apps with this it does it all, and looks good to boot.
 Love it! Still works perfectly after several months of daily use.
 work well for shooting handguns
 useful if you commit to it but the HR isn't always that accurate
 I use my fit bit daily, it's working out great for me.
 Excellent! Works great and feels great!
 love love love
 I bought this for my wife and she uses it every day
 This was bought for the wife.  She says she's happy with it.
 Liked most - it's a watch.  Liked least --did not count steps correctly and short battery life.
 Awesome! 6his thing is amazing!
 Functions perfectly!
 Like the phone sync.
 I use mine all of the time, but I wonder how accurate the calories burned feature is.
 I use it every single day, and it tracks my sleep really well. The only bad part is that you can only see the text messages, and can't respond.. I still gave it five stars, because I love it
 Works as advertised
 set up and tracking could be better, more user friendly
 Love it....now I have two...charge one..wear one
 GOT THIS FOR MY MOM.  SHE LOVES IT!!
 This is a great product! Does exactly what it says, and is extremely easy to set up. All sorts of on line help and a downloadable manual.
 Does what it says it will do
 Great product came a day Early
 My daughter loves it. Worth the money.
 Love it!
 love this new fitbit!  the only thing I miss from the Fitbit Charge 2 is the tracking of the flights of stairs.  The best things about this model are the thinner band, easier to use band, ability to interchange bands and longer lasting charge of battery.
 amazing
 Setup was confusing and cumbersome. Happy with the product now that it is finally in full use.
 I love my Alta HR.  I was borderline on the size, and I probably could have bought the small, but someone mentioned about wearing the fitbit on my ankle when I cycle, so with the large band, I can put it around my ankle.  I might buy a small replacement band.
 My daughter bought this and she wears it everyday.  Loves using it.
 Parental figure loves her gift. It's a really nice watch.
 Bought it as a gift for my son. He really liked that it was the gunmetal design which makes it a lil different from some of the others.
 Easy to set up. Easy to use. Easy to read. Glad I upgraded!
 Love it!
 Love it!!
 I love this Fitbit, It does everything it advertised. It does have to be recharged about every three days. I do that when I go to bed and when I get up in the morning Fitbit is ready to go!
 Wife loves it.
 This is my 3rd Fitbit since 2013. I love the Fitbit brand, Fitbit customer service, and Fitbit quality. Nothing was wrong with my previous two Fitbits, I just wanted to upgrade - prior to this, I used the Charge HR for a little over a year. Essentially, this has the same features as the Charge HR, but I like the sleeker look, and I LOVE that I can change out the wristband for other colors. I find that, like the Charge HR, the accuracy is excellent, and if I keep my weight stats up, the calorie burn is about as precise as I'm going to get. I've never had a battery life problem, but I charge it routinely a few times a week while I'm in the shower. I don't miss the flights of stairs feature, because I never thought that was accurate anyway. Anyway, I highly recommend this Fitbit!
 Excellent Product!
 Love the Alta HR. Gives an accurate heart rate; I've tested this with the heart rate on exercise machines. Does everything that the normal fitbit does.  They are always adding some extra goodies to the app. Not too tight. Water resistant is the best benefit.
 love all the information it gives me and the reminders
 Black on black.. I mean idk what else you want me to say.
 Love this product!!  Half the price of a smart watch. All the features and it helps me achieve my health and fitness goals?!?  Perfect.
 This is my 2nd go round with a Fitbit. I like the thin/slender style of the Alta HR. Looking forward to purchasing the interchangeable bands.
 Only been using it a short time but so far I'm loving it! The technology has vastly improved over the Fitbit flex.<br/><br/>-The band is totally adjustable and fits great.<br/>-Able to detect certain activities! Outdoor biking, walking, elliptical and aerobics are my main exercise. It knows what I'm doing and automatically records. LOVE this feature!!<br/>-Lets me know that I have a call or text.<br/><br/>Overall, this Fitbit version has most everything I want. The only drawbacks are it isn't waterproof and you have to manually enter the stationary bike. Not a big issue, though....still give it 5 stars. I hope it holds up!
 Loved  it !
 Dies too quick only had it on a couple hrs after fully charging it and it died.
 I loveee this fitbit! Its girlie and perfect for everytime use! I have a surge that i use when i workout .
 After my Charge HR hit the dust, it's great to have another Fitbit to keep me moving. Love the slim size too.
 Love it.
 Love it, so much prettier than the old wide ones. Helps me keep track of how active I am.<br/>So far no problems.
 Very comfortable
 Arrived dead was not quality tested
 I use the Fitbit to track my sleeping and love it.
 Back of watch really irritates my skin after just a couple of hours.
 This is a very strurdy band that will not unhook and fall off.
 I wear it all the time, like a watch!  Love the HR feature! Well worth the price.
 Fits well and looks all right, but broke in less than three months. Almost lost the fitbit as a result. Do NOT recommend.
 How did we ever live without these???
 I'm very disappointed in the accuracy of the Alta.  Simply put, it does not accurately count steps,  especially if you are pushing a stroller, grocery cart, etc.  I have a Fitbit One that is far more accurate. The Alta was consistently off  in my step count by 30-40%. Returned.
 Gift for wife and she really likes it.
 It does not seem to be accurate in tracking steps.
 She's using it every day, &amp; is happy with it.
 In a very short time this device pointed out my poor sleep patterns, and motivated me to move regularly.
 I liked the thin Fitbit and bands.It was very good looking.I also bought extra bands and was very pleased.
 Ive worn an alta since 2015 and it is definitely better with the HR monitor, not sure it is always accurate though.
 great
 Love this fitbit!
 Sometimes the syncing doesn't work very well but I generally love it, especially for tracking my sleep patterns.
 nice form factor.  easy to set up via app.
 I am quickly becoming obsessed with this thing, it works really well.
 Find another product to buy.  Fitbits seem to be made to last less than 2 years.
 I bought this for my partner for Christmas... Works perfectly... Battery life on a single charge is incredible!! Lasts 5-7 days before he has to charge it again....
 It fits as expected and has all the features I was looking for. The only thing I would improve is to have it fully waterproof so I can swim with it on.
 It worked great for several days. Could not reprogram
 Battery life is not as good as I expected.  Upgraded from Fitbit Flex for that same reason as it was getting older.  Alta HR only lasts 3-4 days at most.
 Love my new Fit Bit.
 I just love my Fitbit Alta HR size small in Fuschia :) I have a Garmin Vivosmart HR which I also love but, it's just too bulky for me. I have very small wrists and it just feels uncomfortable for me personally. Since purchasing the Alta HR I have not taken this off other than to shower. This is just so comfortable to wear all day as well as sleeping with it on at night. I did purchase a different band to wear that feels much softer than the one that came with it. As far as accuracy, I really don't notice much difference between my two devices. I do wish the Alta was waterproof and had the ability to track stairs. Other than that, it's just a wonderful product that I am so pleased with :)
 Perfect fit and secure on the wrist without being plastic.  Nice!
 good work
 Love my fitbit! I wear it daily and have gone from a couch spud to walking almost five miles a day! Life changing
 Great
 Kiddo loves it.  She has been using it regularly.
 Good price and the sleep monitor nd heart rate functions are very useful!
 Received new and package in good shape.
 The actual unit is too wide for my five 1/2" wrist. With band it sticks &gt;1/4" out on each side of wrist and sits crooked on wrist.  Have tried 4 different small  bands.  Other item I would change is to add the ability to record Notes on the app.  Had to take a day off because of badly aching feet and a blister.  No place to record why I did so little that day.<br/>Have really amped up activity.  Heart information helpful with my history.  Learned I am well below normal on deep sleep, which not surprising given chronic fatigue syndrome. Started tracking food intake 7/6/17.<br/>Wish it logged all nutrition information.  It only tracks calories and %carbs, fat and protein.  Need separate app if want to track say sodium intake. Or, protein intake to make sure am not getting too much and end up damaging my kidneys.  Too much protein increases appetite; don't want that either. Obviously can't track sugars, carbs, potassium, etc.<br/><br/>Update 9/15/18:<br/>Warning:  All your info goes online to Fitbit including everything you log (food intake, water consumption,  and weight.  Also daily exercise, cardiac, steps and sleep patterns.  No apparent way to block the routine uploads of this private/personal info as I have done with all my other apps. Had another problem with the app today.  Tried to get help via email.  Response I got was it might take 2 days.  So I took off the Fitbit and will look for something else.  Pretty expensive technology for 13 months of use.
 Fits perfectly and works great.
 I've had a few Fitbits in the past, but this has been the best so far. I think they finally learned from their mistakes. Being able to switch out the bands is a game changer!
 Awesome!
 great
 gets you movin!
 Great
 So far so good. I have been using it daily to increase my daily activity. Love the sleekness of the design.
 not happy that it does not track stairs.  Otherwise it is ok.
 still wearing it.
 works great
 Arrrived without a charger- $180 and I have to buy a charger and spend $6 to return :-(
 Pretty band with great quality fits perfect
 love it
 Great item!
 Exactly what I had hoped for and more!
 Love my fitbit. Love the color!!!
 I love my Fitbit Alta HR. It's very comfortable to wear, even when you're sleeping. It makes me more aware of my physical activity levels.
 Bought this for a present for my wife, and she absolutely loves it
 It gets me moving.
 love it
 Fits perfect.
 I really like this!  I had a misfit before--- this is a lot better--- much easier to tell time, better app, I like the sleep monitoring and benchmarking.  It looks great too!
 It’s great tockeepcyou motivated to move more! The Sleep Tracking is a plus! I did not know How useful it is to track your sleep.
 love it... ...totally helps me to meet my daily workout goals!
 Broke after two weeks of wear and I can't return it since the window has passed. I'm so mad!
 The battery life is minimal. Last only a day and a half.
 Just what I needed to keep track of my fitness activity.
 love it.
 I love it
 Love it
 LOVE IT
 I have thoroughly enjoyed my fitbit!
 This has the basic features of a fitbit+ Heart Rate. They show a lot of people in their advertising running, so I want to make clear to others using it for running purposes:<br/><br/>1. This watch cannot really track your runs. It will autotrack anytime you walk for more than 15 minutes (you can adjust this) but it can't show you start and stop point because there is no way to tell it when you started running. I.e if you walk to the track and start running, that's all one exercise. Cannot be used for pacing for this reason<br/><br/>2. This watch does NOT have GPS. This is on me for not doing my research, but to be fair, I don't feel that their website or descriptions make this very clear. Alta and every Fitbit except the $300 does not have a GPS. It uses your phone's GPS and tells you where you went with your phone. It can't tell you distances, etc without your phone being nearby.<br/><br/>So basically- if you have any standard iPhone (I have a 5), every single feature except heart rate and more is right there in your pocket. There is no point in owning a Fitbit Alta if you have an iPhone and are the type of person to be with your phone a lot.<br/><br/>I returned after 1 day and am purchasing a Garmin 35. I wish Fitbit would make a sleek looking running watch (I know there is one, but it is expensive and huge). They have the style down that none of these other companies who do GPS watches seem to capture. $130 for this is a waste.
 Love it
 Works great, Wife loves it.
 So happy that I upgraded from an older model Fitbit.  I love the size.  Battery lasts a lot longer than my old one too.
 This is such a great motivational tool, I love it! I am way more active because now I constantly am challenging myself. My goal to start was 10K steps every day but within a week my goal changed to 20K because it because too easy. I have an under desk bike at work that I use during the day, I work out every day, and I coach basketball, and the fitbit has had no issues tracking any of that. I love that it tracks my heart rate, my sleep, and my steps. I am a huge fan of this and I am sad it took me so long to finally purchase one! I really like the size of this as well. My friend has the charge and much like an iWatch it is just too big of a face for me, so I like how small the alta face is. It doesn't stand out as much and with my rose gold band that I bought it actually looks pretty classy.
 Works great!
 Love the color and people notice it.
 I bought two of them for my daughters and they love them and will not take them off. Very pleased with the results and quality.
 The Fitbit Alta HR is slim, comfortable, and gives me the information that I need. Very happy with this purchase
 I don’t like how it fits my wrist.
 Purchased this for my girlfriend for Valentine's Day. She seems to love it.
 Great product!
 Won’t detect sleep patterns
 Stopped working after 6 months.  I called Fitbit customer service. They were very reasonable.  They provide replacement or 50% off their products.
 Love it!  But you really need to buy the screen protector - mine has microscratches all over it now and no way to replace the glass.  Get the protector from Day 1.
 This was a birthday gift
 This is my second fitbit and I will say the Alta HR is the best.  Love it. No complaints.
 Fits perfectly and arrived as scheduled.
 I love my FITBIT Alta.
 So far, so good!
 Won’t track steps while walking with stroller or pushing shopping cart. Still pretty cool though.
 Works well and syncs automatically.  Fun way to get your steps in every day.
 So far it's ok. Little pricy.
 I love this Fitbit ! Easy to use !
 LOVE IT
 It is more copper than rose gold. The band gets dirty first day i wore it. The Alta hr is awesome though.
 Like helps keep track of how far I walk, works great
 love it
 Worked for 3 months and just died!
 Got it for my wife and she wears it all the time. Seems to be happy with it.
 tracks my steps and my sleep as well as heart rate!  Perfect for what I needed.
 Works great!
 Excelente producto !
 Good price
 A+ Great Product
 Very hard to set up. Technology is very poorly implemented. Limited functionality. Surprised this kind of product exists.
 Good product
 I have really liked the Alta HR. It stays charged for about 8 days and I love being able to see my messages and heart rate. Very happy with it!
 Good device.
 Fantastic!!! Getting one for all my family members. Christmas around the corner.
 Great for my exercise class
 Love my fitbit Alta HR. Completely would recommend this product!
 Very good
 Excellent
 Returned it; didn't realize it couldn't manually track selected activities and the auto-track function didn't meet needs; Got a Charge2 in stead and love it.
 Worth the price. Fits like a charm
 Excellent product. Have not had any issues.
 The day after buying, saw it in sale ):::
 This watch does everything that the Surge does and has a nicer brighter screen. If Fitbit would fix the screen issue they would sell more watches.
 I love my Fitbit!! The size is perfect, it’s really pretty, and the heart rate monitor and sleep trackers are really cool.
 So far so good.  Working fine.
 Truly love this Fitbit! Syncs with my iPhone to alert me to whom is calling or can read texts! Slim &amp; comfortable!
 good product. The only thing is that it has no button for you to start your workout. So its off by a few minutes and sometimes it does not track when you stop running and do weights.
 works great.  tapping between screens i had some trouble.  i have larger fingers.
 I bought this for my lovely wife and she really enjoys it. The color is one of the best for for going with many different outfits.
 Highly recommend. Keeps me accountable with my activity level and exercise. Love that it tracks my overall health, heart rate, sleep cycle. I would be lost without my Fitbit.
 Just as expected. The small fit perfectly. I was concerned it might have to be on the largest notch, but there is actually room to go bigger or smaller with the band.
 great to keep me going.
 Wife loves her Alta
 Only had this a week or so, but so far I absolutely love it. It's amazing how accurate it is, and it's so nice with all the bells and whistles, compared to the Flex that I had before.
 i love the fit bit but band i bought does not hold finish
 Daughter loves it.
 For a tech challenged person this was not as easy a set-up as I assumed.
 The Fitbit came very quickly, securely boxed, easy instructions and I love it.
 Love my Fitbit
 This was a purchase for my wife and it fits and looks great. I will upgrade mine to the Alta HR.
 Provides great information.  Good fit and stylish.
 Nice upgraded Fitbit.
 Make sure you get a screen protector for it. Mine scratched on the 3rd day.
 Longtime Jawbone user, and I'm SO GLAD I made the switch.
 I absolutely love it.
 I love this fitbit. I love the bands you can get and I love how much smaller it is.
 wife loves it
 LOVE!!!!
 I’m loving this FitBit, so happy, does everything it’s supposed to plus it fits my tiny wrist perfectly!!!
 this Fitbit is made to last, Love it
 Loved the smaller version, especially if you have small wrists. Love that I can get my text notifications on the fitbit too.
 Love the rose gold color and I can't love without Fitbit now : D
 Very nice activity tracker and color. Did not want to charge using USB battery pack.
 The rose gold is beautiful!
 Great product love my Fitbit Alta HR
 Great device
 My Fitbit quit working.  It shows that it is charged but nothing comes across the screen anymore
 It's with major sad face that i write this review.  In using my new Alta HR was less than 2 weeks i notice that it does NOT perform the way it should.  The screen is meant to come on if you turn your wrist to look at it, but it only does so one out of every 15 times or so.  In addition you're supposed to be able to get the screen to come on by a double tap.  This only works one out of every 10 times.  Typically I had to tap a good 30 times just to get any response and then it only comes on for a split second and is so fast you can't even read what was on it.  I did days worth of tech chat with FB and discovered that i was wearing it correctly, and that shutting it down did not help at all.  FB did offer to send a new one, but since I'm a long time FB customer I know they will only do this one time for each watch....so I am instead choosing to return it to Amazon to receive a refund so i can purchase a different one all together.  Prior to this Alta HR I owned a Surge and throughout its life I had many problems yet FB wouldn't assist with exchange as they had already done so once.  So I learned that lesson.
 Excellent choice with the HR function. Battery life is long enough to get me through most of the week on a single charge.
 Overall really like it. I use it as my watch and to track my sleep and steps. I like that it reminds you to get up and move if you've been idle too long.
 Just awesome. I love it.
 Love the slim design and color.  Like the reminders to keep me moving.
 I love my fitbit!!! I just don't like how my screen completely cracked....
 half the time it says it cant sync with my android.  so its useless.
 I love my new fitbit.
 The band is the color and weight that I expected. It was easy to apply and that surprised me. The magnetic connection is fantastic. The band is more comfortable than the rubber bands that come with the fit bit.
 This is my second Fitbit and I like  it even better than the first HR.  It is sleek and comfortable and is easier to view with a twist of my wrist.  Also, love the new and improved App.
 Gift for my wife, she loves it!
 Best personal trainer!!
 Great product.
 great fit
 Perfect!
 Was a really nice fitbit!!! Would get again!!
 Love this Fitbit, its small and lite. Its also easy to figure out and I love that it can work as a watch. My mother and I both ordered one and love it!
 A
 Disappointed. Does not accurately track heart rate, exercise time or sleep. No returns after 45 days.  Highly frustrated.
 Love love love the heart rate monitor and new sleep feature!
 I'm addicted!  It does motivate me to do more.
 The only issue that I have is that the clock doesn't always come up when I lift my wrist to look at it, so maybe it isn't sensitive enough?
 Wearing the Fitbit helps me stay motivated to keep moving. I like that it shows my heart rate. I really like it.
 Shipped as expected and delivered on time. The sleep time seems to be a bit off as the total sleep time is low.
 I love my Alta HR. I set silent alarms and reminders. It monitors sleep, heart rate, miles, calories, steps, exercise. The app is easy to use. Would purchase again.
 Simple and easy to use
 good !
 Our granddaughter has thoroughly enjoyed the Fitbit, and it has exceeded all her expectations. Thanks
 Band is starting to tear away from around the device
 good quality works great
 had problems with the watch reading sleep levels at night. too small for a man, imo.
 I love it ❤️
 love it
 Great!
 Great quality I recommend it
 love it
 Call and text Alert is not strong enough. The charge HR was much better
 I use this all the time. I really like its features!
 Looks nice. Like the buckle band. Easy to read
 LOVE IT!
 The product was great until it stopped working. I got it in April and three months later it stopped charging. I tried contacting the vendor about a replacement and never heard back.
 Enjoying the Fit Bit Alta. Keeps me in line, moat of the time. I really like the sleep tracking feature.
 love it.
 I hate the band
 I love it!  It sinks to my iPhone so I can track my sleep.
 Works as expected.
 Much nicer than my old HR.  I like the pings when I get calls and texts. Much more feminine than previous Fitbit.  I got a different band to make it look nicer for work. Love it.
 Having fun with it
 Happy with the Fitbit and the color
 My wife loves it.  It would be nice if it was water resistant a little better.
 Nice fit flexible band. Does not sync well to my WW app.
 I love my Fitbit Alta HR! It is exactly what I needed to keep track of my HR while working out.
 Love my Fitbit! It's great!
 Be aware - it doesn't track floors.
 Love
 Granddaughter loves it!
 dad loves it
 I love it. it really helps keep me on track.
 Love the heart rate feature. Slim.
 Great! Works well.
 Replaced my old Fit Bit Charge...band broke twice and now they no longer make.  This,one has easy on/off band and I can change bands.
 Fits perfectly and works great!
 I love my Fitbit Alta HR! The only thing I wish it had, that it doesn't it the ability to count floors.
 So far like it alot
 I liked it.  But it just died.
 Much better than my first fitbit.
 Easy to set up.
 Great product, would recommend it to anyone
 Perfect size. Exceeded my expectations!
 Received a used product instead of a new one.
 Excellent size for a woman. My wife loves it.
 Good product
 I love this Fitbit !!! It keeps you motivated, and also it monitors your sleep, exercise, etc.and from what I can see it’s been accurate
 I have small wrists.  I found wearing it on my wrist uncomfortable. Also the sleep tracking on my device was inaccurate. Based on the reviews I read it suggested buying a large band so you could also wear it around your ankle.  I found wearing it on my wrist uncomfortable. When I wore it on my ankle, the readouts were very inaccurate.  Also the sleep tracking on my device was inaccurate.  I have a sleep by number bed which also tracks my sleep so I was able to compare.  I would sleep 8 hours and the fit bit would track 5 hours thereby making its readouts inaccurate based on its five hours when I really slept 8.  I'm also not convinced the steps were accurate either.  Sometimes I would be sitting watching a movie, maybe getting up a few times, and then I would look at my Fitbit and I received around 2,000 steps..What??  Anyway, I returned it, not for me!
 Love it!
 Love it.
 I love it!
 I like everything about the Fitbit. I may get some new bands as time goes on.
 This thing is so cool! I have now been challenging myself more and more every day regarding walking and getting more and more exercise! I am active; however, sit mostly for work so I love how it nudges me to get up and walk around if I have been idle for too long. It tracks heart rate, sleep, you can incorporate food and other types of activities that are not related to steps.  I made fun of my parents who had one and am very glad I joined the clan as it is helping me to move more on a daily basis and  as AARP says, (of which I am no where near the age for membership), move it or lose it! Move more I must do!!!
 very good service &amp; exactly what I wanted, thanks
 love my fitbit!
 Didn't receive fitbit hr. Got this instead!
 Love it.
 Truly enjoying the many different features this Fitbit has and the alerts it gives me.  Comfortable to wear and long lasting battery.
 Great watch, keeps track of my steps all day long, Battery life could be better needs to be charged more frequently then a phone
 Wish military time. Larger font size Heart Rate for constant monitoring. Nice to track info.
 Really like the slimmer concept.  More like jewelry.
 Love it!
 I love my fitbit and wear it daily. Great buy!
 works great
 I had a bad feeling when I saw that the box looked like it was already opened and then someone just taped it back and stuck the torn sticker over it. Upon opening it, I found fingerprints/oil on the Fitbit and it has a really dirty band. For $179.95, I was expecting to receive a NEW Fitbit?! Requested exchange already, let's hope the replacement is new... otherwise I want a refund.
 Wear it everyday! LOVE.
 The Fitbit Alta HR is very helpful in getting a sense of how I'm doing with my fitness goals. I like how it syncs with some other tracking apps I use and I especially like all the information the Fitbit app provides. While I know the data in the app may not be very accurate, I believe it gives me some indication about how I'm doing towards my fitness goals.
 Heart rate monitor cuts out during strenuous exercise. If you work up a sweat it is either inaccurate or non functional.
 Tracker works as expected but I think we lost stairs or elevation measure, but still looking for that function, like that feature
 After a month of wearing this (return window closed 2 days prior) this has become increasingly uncomfortable causing sharp pinching on the nerve in the top of my left writs (no other fitbit or watch has ever done that) - so much that I almost ripped it off.  Not sure what was going on, but it seemed like it was "zapping" me.  Now I can't return it.....Very disappointed.
 I somehow succeeded in never losing my first Firbit, a One that I'd had since 2013. But in March it started to count my steps inaccurately, so it was time to part ways. I wasn't sure I wanted a new Fitbit at all, but when the Alta HR came out I decided to buy it. I have very small wrists so the Alta is a great size, and I love the heart rate monitor. I've had the Fitbit for a week and a half and I love it. It's recommitted me to getting my 10,000 steps! The heart rate monitor seems to work very accurately. I'm impressed by how the fitness tracker technology has advanced since 2013!
 The band is nice, just not as large as some of the others.
 the wristband is very weak! You might loose it
 Love all of the wonderful features this Fitbit offers.  Super easy to use. I'm buying them for the whole family.
 Love this easy sync and charge, very motivational to get moving.
 I love my Fitbit Ulta HR. It has a lot of cool features. I love that I can customize it to make it suit me. The notifications at 10 minutes to the hour reminding me to get up and move have been great. I sit at a desk all day so this has help me get a lot more activity during the day. And I feel like Pavlov's Dog because I will walk around my house just to get the fireworks display when I hit my step goal. It's a great motivational tool. I also really like that it works with my iPhone and gives me a buzz and message when I get a text or phone call. The size is also nice. It's slim and comfortable to wear. I bought one for my 10 year old daughter and even though she's a pretty active kid by nature she loves getting the reinforcements too. Highly recommend!
 Love how this Fitbit feels on my arm and it's simple and nice looking!
 When I look at fitbit website..  obviously they don't want to know how they are doing.  I am amazed at how you have to charge fitbit Alta hr.  A clip on charger?  It actually is a clip, like a you would close up a bag of chips.. that you have to match up perfectly to charge.  I am am disappointed .  This was an upgrade???
 Love it regularly wear it.
 Not damaged or fake
 Wonderful product and looks great!
 Awesome!
 Love the color, accurate step count. Battery life about 5 days before the low battery sign starts coming out. The silent alarm sync doesn't always update.
 Easy to wear.
 Just love it!!!! Notifications and alarms are great!
 ordered a new one and the one i got was clearly used. the packaging was all opened.
 Fitbit arrived on time and as described, wife loves it.
 Very happy with order.
 My wife didn't like it because she had trouble reading it.
 Great motivation to start moving more
 Love it. It's the greatest thing ever
 I love it!  To me it's best features are: the sleep breakdown is awesome and the heart-rate monitor if very helpful.
 My wife loves it.
 my step daughter really likes this unit. would buy again
 Wife loved it and uses it every day to track her sleep, steps, calories burned, etc.
 I like the slim profile.
 Wasn't sure this would work for me but after using for several days Ireally like it. Good motivating help and I'm now competing for steps against myself
 This is my third fitbit.  My Charge band broke beyond repair and was replaced by the company with a Charge HR.  The Charge HR was ok but kind of big for me.  I liked the Charge HR features.  I decided to get the Alta as I liked the slender style and wanted to be able to better manage my sleep. the Alta does not have a sensitivity setting for sleep so my sleep stats changed going from 4-5 hours of sleep to 8 hours of sleep.  I like seeing the different stages of sleep and the amount of time in each stage.  I am now tracking my sleep based on stages.  Just not sure how accurate things are.  We'll see as I use it more.  Overall I do like it.
 It was great until the battery died 8 months after I got it.
 Absolutely exactly what I wanted!!!  Love it!!!!
 I love how it motivates me to get up and move...makes me aware of being too still..
 While it did what it does and what it is meant to do, it gave me rashes on my wrist and sadly had to return it.
 Moved up from a Fitbit Flex and love the heart rate function and the display.  Motivation keeps me moving so yes, I love my Fitbit Alta HR!
 Beyond expectations. Love it, especially the sleep stages feature.
 Nice buy!
 I love the color love the different features. I think the tracker may be a little off, but I have found that the others are not 100%.
 This is great!  It is everything I wanted and expected!  I am very happy with it, and everything came on time.
 Fitbit did not work. Had to get manufacturer to replace it. This process took 3 weeks
 Wife loves the Alta and does not wear and tear as quickly as the Surge.
 Ok my hubby bought me a Fitbit back in 2015 and it was too small for my wrist and said it was the biggest size there was, That made me feel pretty crappy and although we adjusted it to fit me, It was still a constant reminder and I began to get bitter of this new "smartwatch" technology. When I saw this came in X-Large I jumped on it. Needless to say this was far to big and it left me confused to how they did their sizing. I proceeded togo to a store which sold Fitbits because I needed to try one on. I learned that there are many other Fitbits out there and the sizing isn't as bad as I first thought so I decided to get a new band and when that band came in I was ELATED! :) SO HAPPY WITH MY NEW FITBIT AND TODAY I REACHED MY GOAL!!! WOOHOOO!!!
 Perfect!  Just what I wanted.
 Love it!
 Perfect to track all fitness goals. Love it!
 Works well but has fewer options than the Charge HR.
 works as it promises
 Super útil
 Very good
 This is a terrific device, and the Fitbit ap is very informative. Love it.
 I love fitbit surge and it is too large and cumbersome. This is perfect and very attractive
 Defective product. Returned
 Love it!
 Very pleased with the product. Performs as advertised.
 Wife loves it!
 I love the HR feature. I check my HR while working out and i will increase my intensity based on my HR. I had the previous Alta and lived it until it fell of my wrist. So I'm happy that this one has a more secure wrist band. The battery life hasn't really improved I'm considering getting a second charger for my desk at work. For me it only last about 4 days.  The battery life is why I am only giving it 4 stars.
 It's ok

 This works well and gives you the information you need to judge your levels of activity. It will get you moving!
 My wife loves this product especially  the step counter.
 Had the Charge HR and switched to Alta and love it.  Less bulky than the Charge HR.
 Love it
 I love it! Color and features are as expected
 Amazing!
 easy to used and calibrate
 I love love love it!!!!! No complaints what so ever!!!
 bought as a gift for my daughter and she loves it
 Just what I wanted
 I do not recommend this product. 1) it is terribly difficult to recharge, once you get the charger in position, and set it down, it stops. A millimeter differential disconnects the charger. 2) The heart rate monitor is very suspect. I was not wearing the device today, attempting to recharge it, checked my phone app and it was giving m a heart rate reading. I plan to trash this one and will not purchase another Fitbit product. I have a daughter (in her 30's) who has the same charging issues.
 Band runs small
 Good for tracking sleep quality. Reasonably long battery lasts for almost a week's time. Stylish and modern design.
 I like it a lot.  Only wish I knew how to better use it
 The item arrived in pristine condition.
 Exactly as described
 Thanks Fitbit..<br/><br/>I just love it.. Looking forward to get the best out of it. :)<br/><br/>Regards<br/>Jyoti
 Very happy much nicer.
 I am a Fitbit fan, have had 3 different trackers over the years.😊
 Love the slim design and all of the features
 Had a charge 2. Very happy with the alla hr
 LOVE IT. This is my 3rd fitbit and my favorite by far.
 Based on reviews, I think I just happened to get one that didn't work as well as it should.  My immediate issue was getting the "screen" to turn on.  Tapping it or lifting/twisting my wrist rarely worked on the first try, and it typically took multiple tries.  I found that extremely frustrating so I didn't bother trying any other features, and immediately requested a return.<br/><br/>Also, I did not request an exchange because I didn't care for how it fit my wrist. I have very thin wrists and I couldn't get it to fit in a way that would allow me to easily see the "screen" (when I could get it to come on).  It always wanted to angle away from my body instead of slightly toward it.<br/><br/>On the flip side, I did like the sleek look of it.
 Very pleased.
 Died within a few months of having it.
 I love my Fitbit Alta! I've had it for 2 weeks now. I've had a Fitbit since 2015 but the Charge HR model. I always wanted something less bulky but with a HR. I was so glad when this came out. It tracks: my heart rate, steps, no floors, distance, burned calories. The one thing that I do not like is that it doesn't have a button like the Charge and can let my Fitbit when I am working out. This Fitbit supposedly auto recognizes when I'm working out but it tends to not recognize when I am. Luckily there is a manual way of inputting my workouts via the app which is a plus. Overall I love it I would totally buy it again
 Fits good and looks nice. The screen after 2 months is totally scratched.
 I love it!! I Love it!! I LOVE it!!! Between the Fitbit Alta HR itself and the Fitbit App, it does everything. Keeps up with my sleep, my exercising, meeting people and us challenging each other to do better. I get encouragement​to keep on going. I just LOVE IT!!! 🤗
 LOVE LOVE LOVE!
 I love my Fitbit.
 The Alra has helped me keep track of my exercises and I love the push it gives me during the day.
 While I love the color and the slim design, which makes it easy to sleep while wearing, I am disappointed with the heart rate monitor while exercising.  I have tried it really tight, low on my wrist, high on my wrist and it never says I get above 120.  Sometimes it doesn't even register.  Also there's no button to begin a workout so when I log a workout it sometimes doubles up.  It is not too user friendly when it relies on a heart rate but doesn't always register it.
 good product
 Surprisingly comfortable, even while sleeping. I have small wrists and initially had some concerns.
 Love it, now I'm competing with my husband to see who's more active!
 As advertised.
 Cool little gadget.
 Exactly what I wanted!
 The Fitbit Alta HR is very easy to setup.
 Love that you can easily switch out the bands.
 Wife loves it
 Could not see LED outside.  Returned /refunded
 Very nice product
 Easy to wear. Not bulky. Attractive with any outfit.
 This is my favorite style yet.
 My wife loves it and uses it every day
 Love it!!
 Love it
 I really love the style of this Fitbit Alta HR, the others are too bulky for me. I do wish this Fitbit did all that the Charge 2 does. I don't think it tracks all my steps, the charge 1 seemed to be more accurate, I also do not believe it has an accurate heart rate reading, and I've compared my heart rate reading to two other devices and the Fitbit was off. The Fitbit Alta HR is super comfortable, as I previously had the charge 1, and it would leave indentions on my wrist and my wrist stayed sore. I also love that I can change the band on my Fitbit Atla HR. I have the color blue/grey and so happy I chose that color, it goes with just about anything.
 Good quality and original. over all i like it. thanks Fitbit
 I love it!!
 Very happy with overall performance of Fitbit.
 Everything I was expecting. I love it
 Love it. Everything I expected.
 Daughter loves it.
 Love it. Just wish it could track stairs climbed.
 So far I enjoy it a lot!
 I like it a lot
 Its awesome!
 What can I say, I love it.  Did my homework before I bought it so I'm good.
 I like it, but I didn't realize it didn't have a timer compared to the Charge HR. It "autodetects" exercise but it won't pick up activities like yoga, and even some barre work. Ultimately it doesn't really matter, but if you need to see exact HR or burn for all activities, this probably isn't for you.
 good this
 love the color and style
 Great Device! First night tracked my sleep better than my Samsung Gear S2. Tracks steps accurately. Great heart rate monitoring, also more accurately than my S2. Counts calories very well. Love this fitness tracker. Love that it vibrates when you receive a text or call. Motivates you to do better. I highly recommend.
 I bought 2, one for me and one for my Mom. My 70yr old Mother loves it, the "get going" feature reminds her to get some walking in!! It is a bit of a pain to get notifications set and working to get them displaying on the Alta and Alta hr, but have read many complaints of this!<br/><br/>Make sure to set notifications on then force stop the fit bit app through your app manager (may take a few times) and reopen the app. I also found I had to set show all notifications on lock screen on my phone notification options to get it to sync to my Alta hr
 great product
 First I want to say that I have not had my Fitbit Alta HR for that long but I did want to post an honest review of my initial impressions of this product. I originally had a Fitbit Flex but wanted to upgrade to something with a heart rate monitor to track my resting heart rate and my heart rate during cardio to ensure I was reaching my target zones<br/><br/>1. Appearance - I bought the Gunmetal Special Edition tracker as I liked the way the black on black looked. It appears very stylish and looks higher quality than my Fitbit Flex that I had prior to this one<br/><br/>2. Display - I like the options for the display as I have the convenience of a watch and my heart rate at first glance. I can also see my battery level, steps taken and distance by tapping on the display. I will say though that the display took a little getting used to. You are supposed to tap the screen twice to get the initial display and then tap it again to scroll to the other screens. I am so used to swiping on a touch screen to progress to the next page that I had to stop and remember that the Fitbit did not work that way. Also sometimes you can tap it to wake it up and nothing happens. It seems like you have to tap it just right to get it to wake up<br/><br/>3. Step tracker - Just as accurate as the Fitbit Flex I had<br/><br/>4. Heart rate monitor - This is where things get a little tricky. My resting heart rate seems to be pretty accurate (I compared it to manually calculating my heart rate as I did not have another device to compare it to). However, I've found it is not very accurate when doing cardio, depending on what type of workout you do. I did a lot of research before buying this product as this was my main reason for upgrading. Everything I read stated that Fitbit claims it has accuracy within 6 bpm. However other reviews stated that the more complex the workout (where your arm does more inconsistent moving) would throw it off a lot. I've tested this on three different machines at the gym and compared them to the machines heart rate monitors. I know that the heart rate monitors that are built into the machines at the gym can be inaccurate but it was the best thing I had to compare it to. On the step machine, it is off by A LOT. My heart rate on the machine shows an average of 157 bpm but the Fitbit will only show on average of 86 bpm and sometimes it wouldn't even register. That's a huge difference. I've also tried wearing it on different wrists and on different positions on my wrist to improve the accuracy but nothing seems to help. The instructions state that you are to wear it about two to three fingers width from your wrist bone while working out to get the most accurate results. Tried that too but it did nothing while on the stair machine. I will say however that when I compare it to the rowing machine and treadmill, the Fitbit is only about 3 bpm different from what the machine says. Just be aware that depending on the type of workout you do will affect its accuracy. I'm also not thrilled where it has to sit on my arm/wrist to get an accurate reading as it's not a natural place where you would wear a watch/tracker but I'm starting to get used to it<br/><br/>5. Charging cable - I'm not thrilled about this design. The best way to describe the charging cable is that it is a butterfly clip that attaches to the back of your device but you have to line up two metal pins exactly or else it will not connect right. Feels very clumsy and cheaply made<br/><br/>6. Band - The band seems to be higher quality than the standard one that comes with the Fitbit Flex. The one on my Flex had to be replaced every couple of months as it would rip from having to take out the sensor to charge it. I don't think I will have the same problem here but only time will tell. The clasp is also higher quality on this one<br/><br/>7. Heart rate zones - I really do like this feature. I have my Fitbit linked to MyFitness Pal and it accurately shows me what portion of my workouts are cardio vs. fat burn. As long as you are accurate when entering your start time and duration in MyFitness Pal, I feel like this will be accurate for most workouts. However, due to the Fitbit Alta HR not accurately tracking my heart rate during my workout on the stairs, I don't have that data for those workouts which is disappointing to me<br/><br/>8. Sleep cycles - One great upgrade is how they track your sleep cycles. My Fitbit Flex tracked how many hours slept, restless minutes and times awake. With the Fitbit Alta HR it does that plus tracks your deep sleep and REM sleep which was huge for me. My Fitbit Flex was showing on most nights that I got enough sleep. However I would still feel tired most days when waking up. With the Fitbit Alta HR, I found out that even-though I was getting 8 hours of sleep a night only 12% of my sleep was a deep sleep and 3% was REM sleep. Everything else was light sleep. According to my doctor and the research I did, you should have about 25% deep sleep and 20% REM sleep per night. No wonder why I was so tired all the time. I am not sure how to fix this quite yet but I think the data will be helpful when talking to my doctor about ways to fix it<br/><br/>9. Alerts and notifications - I like the feature of getting my call and text notifications on the screen. It is also great with text messages that you can select the option to see who the text is from and at least the first part of the text message. It helps me when doing cardio because I can see if it is something that can wait to respond to or if I need to stop and address it right away. Also if I have my Do Not Disturb on, it won't alert me. However I have found that this feature does not always work correctly. Sometimes it just vibrates but gives me no indication if it is a text or call and if it is a text, who it is from. I really wish this could be more consistent. Also, if you are on your phone doing something else (like reading an e-mail), it won't give you a notification. This is something I wish it would do as it would prevent me from having to stop what I am doing to toggle to my text messages but I guess that is just laziness on my part<br/><br/>10. Silent Alarms - I still can't get these to work correctly. I have set three so far to test it but none have gone off. When I double check the app I find that the alarm had been set but it is always showing it will go off the next day even when I know for a fact that I set it for that same day. Not a huge deal but if you use this feature I recommend you set a back up alarm<br/><br/>I do wish that this was water proof but its not a deal breaker for me<br/><br/>Based on all of these items, I am not sure if this is worth the price tag but it does have some features that I love. Just keep in mind that this is not always accurate
 Lost 8 pounds in the first week.  It just helps so much seeing everything as you do it.  The only knock I have is the Fitbit app doesn't seem to sync between devices.
 I love my new fitbit
 Battery lasts a long time. Tracks sleep, steps, calories etc.
 Love it!  Why did I wait?
 This is my first experience wearing a Fitbit and have been very pleased.
 I love it!
 Very good my wife loves it
 I have owned virtually every fitness tracker made.  From the original UP disaster through a WHOOP and everything in between.  I've owned various versions of the same model.<br/>Currently my two favorites are the Garmin HR+ and the Fitbit Alta HR.<br/>The Garmin has built in GPS where the Fitbit has tethered GPS.  Both are reasonably accurate HR monitors, though neither can compare to a chest strap.<br/>My opinion is that if the fitness tracker is consistently higher or lower than the strap, that's great for a wrist monitor.  I liked the UP3 because it used impedance to track HR rather than optical.  But UP is kind of a dead end since they are no longer manufactured.<br/>Fitbit has always had the best infrastructure.  Garmin is pretty close.  Fitbit needs to open up their code a bit and make their bands swimmable.<br/>I currently prefer the Fitbit to the Garmin, but it's a close call.
 Wife is very pleased with her fit bit. She did have a charging problem. Fitbit fixed the problem over the phone! I am not a hi tech person. Somehow they could access her watch thru the internet, found the problem, and fixed it . I was amazed! Tech support was excellent. We did have to leave our name etc with the company rep. Our call was returned promptly.
 A MASSIVE disappointment.  I have owned a legion of health devices--including wearables and most specifically wrist wearables... this costs actual money to not measure much in the real world or deliver much of anything it promises other than the time of day.  The metrics it delivers are wildly inaccurate and the device is not particulary smooth to interact with either --for anything but the most basic pre-determined values and is pretty much impossible to meaningfully tweak or adjust to make up for its shortcomings.
 Fits as described!
 Keeps me motivated.
 love it
 Great product Love it
 Disappointed that I could not get started with my fitbit without the dongle.  This fitbit cannot get connected to your computer without this wireless piece and the fitbit website says you can buy one.  I contacted fitbit and they were nice enough to send me one so I could get started without any extra charges.  I hope the company has changed their packaging.  It does not make sense to package and sell it without the necessary parts.  Other than that I am very happy with my fitbit now!
 For my first FitBit ever, I was happy that they came out with a new FitBit and that it came in rose gold! I was ecstatic! It was on pre-order so when they let me know that it had shipped out, I was even more excited. I received it in the mail today and it looked exactly like the photo, I was in love with it and setting it up was even easy! After wearing it for 8 hours, the edges of the band turned black! It did not look appealing and it not look pretty anymore! This was a BRAND NEW BAND that they just came out with and it turned black! I reached out to their customer service via chat and at first, the customer rep "Marlon" told me that I didn't need to return it to the warehouse because it was just an issue with the band and that I can keep it. Then she comes back to tell me that I have to return my band before I can receive the replacement and that I was responsible for shipping their defective band! She also told me not to wear dark clothing and I didn't even have dark clothing on and why can't I wear dark clothing? I even tried to wash it off but it wouldn't come off so it was definitely an issue with the band. So I love the thing and how it works but I am not happy that I will have to provide shipping and be without a FitBit for 10-20 days! That is ridiculous! I've included pictures for you all to look at. I just got it today and it already is stained. Do not get it! You will end up with a black wristband after a week, I'm sure and pay more shipping and handling to get the replacement. Wasted my time and money! The Rose gold edition also cost more and I don't know why because obviously the quality is lacking! Customer service is also in India so good luck trying to get customer service.
 The fitit shows me a lot of things but it has problems. There is no way to see it when I'm outside in the sunshine.I have to tap it lots of times to get it to light up. I wish I could just tap it and it would light up.  Maybe there is a trick to it.  the directions say tap at the bottom by the band. Anybody know the way to get it to light up every time? I like the way it goes off when I reach 10,000 steps and I like taking my pulse during Jazzercise and such.
 This newest purchase 4 stars...This post is about a second Fitbit Alta I purchased. I bought this one for my husband because he liked mine so much. On this order the only reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because the color is more gun metal. Mine is black and didn't want to have to worry about being confused whose was whose. It says blue/gray, but it's not. Other than that my husband loves it and we are glad we purchased it. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Fitbit-Alta-HR-Blue-Gray-Large/dp/B06X3Z13PM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fitbit Alta HR, Blue/Gray, Large</a><br/>On this purchase 5 stars...I just got this a few days ago and I really like it. I am 55 years old and I am about average when it comes to being tech savvy. I found the fitbit to be easy to sync with my phone, and I like all the things I can monitor with it (steps,sleep, calorie intake by logging my food and I can set goals with it). My husband is even impressed with it. I am really happy that I purchased it and wish I had purchased one sooner.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Fitbit-Alta-HR-Black-X-large/dp/B06XCH3FDX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fitbit Alta HR, Black, X-large</a>
 OMG I love this!!!! I am OCD so I have become a little obsessed with it, always trying to make sure I get my steps for the day and meet my water goals. It has all kinds of great workout suggestions and hikes that you can take. Of course you have to use your imagination for the hikes but they are fun to set as goals for your day. I would recommend this product to anyone. If you are using it for swimming make sure you buy the Fitbit Flex which is waterproof.
 Really happy with mine. Had it for about 5 months now and its holding up beautifully. Still charge it about once a week and the battery seems to be holding up about the same. Gets wet from time to time doing dishes and working out and that doesn't seem to bother it at all. Wish it read my heartbeat more consistently during workouts, but that's my only complaint. Sometimes it just can't seem to read it, no matter how I adjust the band.
 The technology is an impressive innovation, but needs refinement.  It's a great motivator to keep apprised of your activity, and perhaps prod you into being more active.  It can be used to log weight loss/gain.  It can't be relied on to accurately interpret your exercise.  On several occasions it logged 'stairclimber' when I wasn't on one (maybe I ran up the stairs in my home?), and it failed to recognize bicycling.  The display on the watch is nearly useless outside as it is only viewable in dark shade.  The sleep monitor is an interesting function, but difficult to tell how accurate it is.
 I bought this to replace my Charge HR. The size is perfect and the display is perfect. I didn't realize that it doesn't count steps, but that wasn't too much of a sacrifice for everything else about it. If I had to recommend one for the rest of those looking for a fitbit, I'd definitely recommend the Alta HR.
 Gave it to my partner who loves it. Great for someone who likes to use apps to help them lose weight and track exercise. This integrates well with My Fitness Pal, and my partner, who likes to do weight loss by numbers (counting minutes active, steps, calories) has been able to lose 75 lbs over 4 months. The gadget sends reminders to exercise (if you set that up) and that really seems to have made a difference.
 No 'workout' mode or button to start workouts!  Not sure who this activity tracker is for. It will track steps but there is no way to tell it you are about to workout. There is no workout mode to show you how many calories or what distance you clocked during a workout. If you have a Charge, Charge 2 or Blaze you know what I mean. No button to start workouts on the Alta like those other models. Bought to replace a worn out Charge. Had to be returned.
 This is for "her", she loves the slightly smaller size to my Large version and says the band is just right (I opted for a leather one). Been waiting for this fitbit for years!
 This device has been the perfect piece of technology to keep me on track with my health and fitness goals. It has a sleek, fashionable look that I can wear with most any outfit. It maintains a battery charge for about a week, then only needs about half an hour to recharge. I have reminders set to alert me when I need to get up from my desk and get some walking steps in, which helps me from being too hunched over a computer all day. The app works great on my iPhone. I was reluctant to use the food tracking, but have found it to be extremely easy to use. In the almost two months since buying this, I've lost 20 pounds.
 Love it but started sleeping with it and woke up one night with my arm aching.  Decided to stop sleeping with it and haven't had the ache since.  I am not sure whatever reads your heart rate is good to sleep with every night.  Works great for exercising.
 My wife loved it. It inspired her to step up her work out game. So now she only spends 4 nights on the couch watching the TV instead of 5 nights. I'm not one to talk because i spend 7 nights on the couch. Hopefully she doesn't buy me one. I'm content spending my nights on the couch  and i don't need to know that my resting heart rate is 175 beats per minute. I don't need to be judged for my life choices. Anyway....great product! buy it!
 Love the FitBit, hate the band. I thought the band would be one color and the unit another. Instead the band is a gray/blue that looks purple. Had to buy a new band
 We bought a copy-cat first at about half the price.  After days of frustration we returned it and bought this one instead.  My wife's been wearing it everyday since.  Do yourself a favor and get this original the first time and avoid the cheaper copycats.  It's not the same.  This one works exactly like it was supposed to.  Heart rate feature is nice addition.
 Love this fit bit, it is very easy to set up and it is comfortable to wear. Battery keeps a long charge.
 Replacing an older Garmin Vivo fit.  This Alta HR is great!  Love the hourly reminders when I've not hit my target steps.  Sleep tracker is great to help me see that I'm actually sleeping more than I thought and more quality sleep especially when compared to "normal for my age".  LOVE having time and date avail by just bringing up my wrist and easy to read.
 Beautiful, arrived fast! 1 day ahead of schedule, very surprised. Easy integration and fast setup. Slim look and gorgeous fucschia color isn't too bright and bold  nor is a subdued hue.<br/>Comes with charging cable and not a wall port, that you must find yourself. Simple USB connection though!<br/>I love my fitbit! Now to lose at least 10 pounds!
 A perfect upgrade from the flex. All I wanted was the clock feature but I've come to rely on it for ever day wear. The small size is comfortable and wears well. I don't get it wet for anything so I can't say whether it's truly waterproof because I don't want to  risk it. Workout time doesn't bother it when I'm sweating and that's good enough for me.
 It was defective.  I sent it back and will not purchase another.  I spent over an hour on the phone with Fit Bit to determine that!  A waste of time and people don't need this sort of thing.  Just walk! use a watch!
 I graduated from a Fitbit Flex 2 to the Alta HR and am happy I did! I wanted a visual to check my stats instead of looking at the app on my phone all the time. I was happy with the Flex 2 while using the app but this is so much better! Love it!
 This is a great idea....I mainly use it for pulse/sleep mode.....The pulse meter is very accurate...I  take my pulse using a timer, and then check the Fitbit....and the results are the same....Also, I find that the sleep mode is accurate....I remember waking up at a certain time and the  Fitbit is right on...gives me an idea of how much deep sleep I am getting.....(not much!)...I also use the steps to try to get some walking in during the day...So far...so good....<br/>I would recommend this Fitbit Ata HR...
 this is an awesome product,, it reminds you every hour to get up and move,lol,, it keeps track of everything you eat and drink and walk,, you must work out at least 15 mins..  per excersie for it to record it.  I strongly recommend it..you will stay on your toes and learn to eat better and properly drink the right amount fluids per day...
 This tracker does not track my steps accurately.  I had the flex which I never had a problem with but with my new Alta HR I barely reach my 10,000 goal each day even though I walk the same route everyday as I did with the flex and I've added walking 30 minutes to an hour on the treadmill each day.  I would not recommend this product.
 It's beautiful :) Alta HR is lovely and thin, and most people don't realize what it is. As a first time "activity tracker" user (and a not very active person), it has enough features to keep me happy. It doesn't have a built in GPS, but I think you can track your route with the App, if you take your cell phone with you. I have trouble synching it to my Huawei cell phone, I have to force sync it whenever I remember. And there is a compatibility issue, so I don't receive notifications of sms e.c.t., but it doesn't hassle me. The compatible devices list is on Fitbit website, I just didn't think to check before buying - so not their fault! It's great that it tracks sleeping habits, and the App gives you clear feedback.
 just started to lead a healthier lifestyle and try to get fit and lose weight in the process and this product is a motivating factor to get up and get moving. when I workout I like to see my heart rate go up and down and based on this I can decide whether I need to increase or decrease the intensity of my workout. Automatic tracking of the exercises and calorie counting and sleep tracking are all excellent features of this product and so far I love it.
 The alarm and sleep tracker are my favorite features. The step tracker is not so good. It counts a step every time you move your arm so by the end of the day i have at least eight thousand steps even if i don't do much walking. It's very deceiving.
 I have the Charge HR also which tracks heart rate (HR) and my exercises.  This one does not track exercises.  Returning to the company for an exchange.  I have a friend who had an Charge HR too and she feels the same way about this one.  Just doesn't track everything as efficiently as the Charge did.  Disappointed in this purchase.  Sleek design is main plus for this one.
 Bought this fitbit at the end of April. I took exceptional care of it and by November it died completely! It should last more than 7 months. It is also past Amazons return window. Definitely stay away from this product. My daughter has had a Garmin Vivofit that has been going strong for 3 years. I would get that instead!
 Great product! I went from being a teacher to having an admin job, so that has killed me as far as movement throughout the day. I bought this to remind me to get up and walk and it has been very helpful. I love the color of this band-I have about 8 others, and wear this one most often as it seems to be the most neutral to the colors I consistently wear.
 Got it last night!! So far so good. I wear an apple watch and I had the flex 2 on my other wrist, because I have so many friends that use fitbits. I missed having true 24/7 heart rate monitoring!! So, I grabbed the Alta Hr.  It is small and cute, however, not as cute as my flex 2, but I am happy to have 24/7 heart rate monitoring back. The apple watch only takes my heart rate like every 5 minutes throughout the day. What would be perfect for me would be the flex 2 HR!!! I wonder if Fitbit will ever do anything like that!!! I am happy so far with the Alta HR!!!<br/><br/>I added some pics for comparison with the fitbit flex 2 next to the Alta Hr!! Take a look for size comparison!!<br/><br/>I got the small, My wrist measures just under 6.5 inches, and I am on the very middle slot available on the Alta HR!!
 Super cool! Good looking, functions are awesome, battery lasts almost 4 days, can change the wrist bands and have multiple fashion combinations, excellent app and activities reports, including sleep time... the only one thing I miss from my previous Charge model is the floor monitoring.  FULLY RECOMMENDED!
 I am loving my newest Fitbit...I had the Charge HR but it started to fall apart, and after the super-glue fix failed to work I ordered the new Alta HR.  It's perfect.  It's lighter, thinner and much more attractive than the Charge HR.  The best part is the ability to change bands.  I ordered a stainless steel replacement band for $13.  It's easy to switch out the bands, and  is perfect for a night out while still getting credit for my steps.
 I love this fitbit. This is probably my 6th, since I’ve had a few either die completely or not hold a charge. It gives you so much more information than the Fitbit flex. It keeps counting past your goal and displays all the things your phone reports. I wear it to sleep.  Neatest of all is that it shows text messages and phone calls. That was an unexpected treat.
 Sleep and exercise recordings are inconsistent, despite reboot downloads--seems to be system problem so Alta HR turns into a mere toy without any consistency.  Have had 2 others but this one goes into the trash and no more FB.  This was less than 3 months old so it is a rip off imho.
 This is smaller than my previous fitbit.  I like the size better.  It does everything I want it to do except track steps in the grocery store.  It will not register your steps if your hand is stationary, which is why I only gave it 3 stars.  Other than that, it's great.
 Works great! Love the app for it too. It's easy to read. Love that it has reminders and alarms you can easily set right from the app to go off on your wrist...very convenient. I like wearing different colors and styles of bands and this band is interchangeable.
 I am one who had the Fitbit Alta before this HR Alta.  Hands down worth it.  Love the heart rate and sleep stage details of this HR alta Fitbit.  A far superior device.  Happy customer.
 The fit bit is easy to sync to my phone. I love that it monitors my heart rate especially when working out. The numbers are easy to read...anyone trying to get in shape or back into shape this is a great product to keep you on track &amp; motivated.
 I was debating getting a FitBit for a very long time. However, upon getting my FitBit, I am extremely glad that I purchased it. You can download the app to help monitor other things than what pops up on the screen. I quickly became addicted to my FitBit.
 Positive market reviews. Delivered as promised, on time. Perfect gift for our daughter (mid 20's). Will debate buying one for myself.
 I wish it didn't sit weird on my wrist, and it could be a little more comfortable.  Also, you even though it tracks your steps, it doesn't display that.  You have to log on to your device.  Otherwise it's a fun little device.
 Gave a 3 for only one reason, tapping. You tap and tap and mostly the info doesn't show. I had a Charge HD and liked very much except the band. It was sweaty and that's why I got the Alta with a metal bracelet. I was unhappy enough to return it. Recovered Charge 2 has a button and can accept a bracelet. Very happy.
 Love love love ❤️ this little device! I got the magnetic metallic fully adjustable band to go with it. Tracks my sleep. Heart rate. Steps. Has vibrating alarms and notifications. (The vibration is very light however and can be missed.).
 It would rate 5 stars if you could read the dial in the sun light.  I would love to be able to use it as a watch, but the screen disappears in daylight.
 I bought this for my girlfriend  and I can say is the tracking is unaccurate, the band gets dirty easily, the watch gives you your notification when  it feels like it . Overall it is an aesthetically boring watch
 Great after finally getting it to setup with our computer. The folks over at fitbit support are great to work with.
 Happy with my purchase.  Comparing this to my husbands Apple watch, I really like the size of this and it does everything I need it to do.  I've been wearing it around everywhere and going to sleep with it on for the last couple of weeks without issues.
 The auto time zone function took 3 whole days to catch up with current time zone on both the coming and going trip I just took.....very disappointed it didn't auto reset like my apple watch!
 Disappointed in the dial.  Very hard to see the numbers.  Stop working after five months.
 Very disappointing.  I've had a Charge HR that I loved , but I bought the new Alta HR because it supposedly measured sleep cycles.  It doesn't.  Only once since I got it has it worked.<br/><br/>Worse, fitbit customer service has been very poor.  I was told last Saturday that my case has been referred to "higher investigation", whatever that means.  However, in spite of numerous efforts to contact fitbit,  by both email and phone, I get nowhere.  They just recount my contact information and then tell me the matter is in "higher investigations "....but they don't tell me what that means...if anything....  I do not recommend this item and at this time this company.  I will update if that changes.
 This is my third fitbit and second alta. I love it. The coral color is very nice and blends in better with skin tone than the blue I had prior. Size is great and it works as expected.
 Quit taking a charge less than 2 weeks out; quit holding the correct time after only 4 days. Couldn't adjust; no customer service that was helpful. Returned.
 Absolutely wonderful. I love that it tracks my steps and my heart rate. Also I love the sleep tracker! This this has gotten me to want to drink more water and exercise more. It's a great motivator
 which for that price it included step counting and others. i like that is slender but you will miss out from what the larger one has to offer.
 Love this Fitbit. It has everything I need without being bulky.
 Great product with interchangeable bands.  Easy to set up
 Band dirty and worn out in multiple places, obviously used before, even though advertised as "new". Very disappointing.
 I've had this for a week. Very easy to set up using the droid app.  The color is more of a subtle purple color than blue-gray. Really happy with this purchase.
 Love it! The sleep function is very accurate. Only thing i dont like is you can't pick the type of exercise (like the Charge 2) and it is often times wrong at selecting the right exercise.
 I really enjoy my fitbit its very comfortable and easy to charge.  My purchase was well packaged and arrived on time I recommend this seller to all.
 They work as described. The heart rate tracking feature is nice, as well as the sleep stages. I do wish they had kept the stair counter.
 I love this but my band broke 2 months in of receiving the product. Will this special addition band be replaced by seller or will I need to buy a new band on my own?
 WOWSERS, this is great!  I love the interchangeable clock faces and animations.  So cool for such a small device.  Worth every penny!
 Love the new Fitbit! Works great, fits perfectly, tracks everything I wanted to track. Perfect compliment to my fitness regiment.
 Rest/sleep calculations were very wrong. That and the constant hr were the reason I got it due to health issues.
 I wish it had come with instructions to maximize my use of it. Otherwise it is very useful and forces me to walk rather than sit. Great for the health.
 Love this watch. The app for my phone is so helpful in tracking what I eat and drink. Just what I needed.
 I love my Fitbit it is so small and thin. I use it everyday!
 I got a used watch and not a brand new which was what I paid for. The watch has a small scratch on  the screen plus plastic bag in which charger cord was packed came opened. Very frustrated.
 i wish i researched to find that children are not allowed to have a fitbit account.  The device is hardly useful without an account
 This has been a great tool for getting back on track with walking and just moving more often.
 I love the Fitbit Alta HR!  It performs exactly as described and helps keep me aware of my activity level.
 She love it, it was hard to get it away from her for review.  maxxmentum on you tube.
 Treated with tender care by mature woman, this Fitbit worked less than 6 months.
 It hurts to wear. I've tried it several times, but after a couple of days I start getting zapped. I won't pay for pain.
 Awesome, best FitBit I've owned yet. Love the heart rate monitor, it's a must
 Love it but also sad that it doesn't have the stair feature like the Charge HR.
 First off I want to say, please make sure you have a separate E mail for everyone in the immediate household. Dealing with them to clear the old  of all its data and give it to another family  member or a friend seems to be a real issue. I am so disappointed in their customer service to help. I may end up returning the new one and forget it. I really like my old one, but there are use issues!  I may update this if I get these issues resolved. If there are other fit bits in the household, Note: You will need a separate e mail for each if you want stats and want to sync. This can be a little challenging at first butFitbit's customer service is great. Also if you change models and want another family member to start fresh (i.e. wipe out old data) you will also need their help. The Alta HR does not have the same charger plug in as the Alta. I found some of the things the Alta HR and the Alta tracks, totally useless. I honestly know how much water I drink daily.  But the reminders and Motivation it provides is helpful. The leather bands are very comfortable. The rubber ones are not!
 Had it for a few days now. Appears to work as advertised. Fit is good.
 I love almost everything about this new Fitbit! The only problem is it grossly over-estimates my step count. I used to wear a Fitbit One in my pocket or on my bra, and that one had a more precise step count. This one counts steps whenever I move my arm (like when I'm folding clothes or doing dishes), so it looks like I crush my 10,000 steps a day. Also, when I lift weights it may count steps but show no activity in that feature, even if I feel like my heart rate gets higher.  But luckily, I have a realistic idea of how much activity I get in a day.<br/>I really love the sleep tracking! I'm a nerd and I like seeing the different sleep states. This is my favorite feature! It hasn't motivated me to get more sleep, but now I know why I'm so tired all the time :)
 I love my new Alta. I had a Charge 2 but really like the design of the Alta and the fact that you can change the bands. Ordering online was convenient too!
 Awesome!! Love it! Makes me get up and move!!
 Love it! This is the best one yet of the fitbit family. Great tracker.
 Got this as a gift for our daughter-in-law.  She loved it.
 Love it!
 Love my fitbit! Tracks steps and sleep and looks cool!
 Very nice to know many data from daily life
 Bought this for my grandma and she is enjoying it
 I like it! I’d give it 5 stars if the battery would last a little longer.
 Well made item much more reasonable than the OEM ones
 Doesn't work with Windows 10.
 I was so excited to get this. It was easy to set up and I immediately started to wear it. Shortly after wearing it, I noticed a pins and needles kind of feeling in my wrist and hand. When the pain started to go up my arm, I removed the fitbit. I looked up this problem online and it seems a lot of people experience a weird sensation while wearing this fitbit. The most common response was to adjust the fit of the band. I followed the instructions on how to wear it and tried it this time on my right wrist. The pain then started in my right wrist. I then had my husband try it and he also said that it was a weird feeling and his wrist is sore after wearing for just a few minutes. So back it goes. I'm really disappointed, I was really looking forward to this.
 will not connect to blue tooth
 Small and out of the way.
 I had the Fitbit Flex for a couple of years and then it died.  I was satisfied with it until it died.  Then I decided to research what was available.  I tried the Charge 2 but it hurt my wrist and wasn't comfortable.  Tried both the small and large.  Was then trying to decide between the Alta or the Apple Watch 2.  I really wanted the heart rate feature the most.  I finally decided to go with the Alta without the HR and then the Alta HR came out at the same time and I was delighted.  I have had it for about a week and I absolutely love it.  It is extremely comfortable.  The band is softer than the Charge 2 band.  The face isn't bright enough to read the details when you are out in the sun.  This doesn't bother me one bit because I typically have my iPhone and can turn it on to get the same information.  I feel Fitbit really did a nice job this time.  It only took five months of investigation and trying things out before I made my final decision.
 with the times....
 Solid quality
 Had to order another.  This one was a dud.
 Wife loves it, it was an upgrade from a cheaper model. Still easy to use and set up.
 Wife seems to be happy with it.  It charges quickly with the included inductive charger and lasts for several days.  Display is daylight visible.  It is at least shower proof without issue.  It has been tracking accurately so far and sync has not had any issues.  So far, this has been a really good tracker.
 It is just  what I wanted.  Have been wearing it every day since it arrived.
 I love my Fitbit
 The fit bit Alta is comfortable for everyday wear and tracks your steps, active minutes, heart rate and sleep. I love it!
 Love it!
 Good
 love it!!!
 I love it but the box is making me confused, according to the reviews it is not water resistant but on the side of the box of mine it says water resistant"
 nice
 Love it
 Looks good, and easy to use!
 Did not work out of the box
 exactly as advertised
 This fitbit does everything you could hope for: steps, exercise, sleep pattern, alarm clock, heart rate manager......
 I really like the concept of these fitness bracelets.  The biggest problem for me is that there are actually adult people that have child size wrists and I happen to be one of them.  This was just to bulky for my wrist.  I wish they would come out with a smaller one that has all the same features.  Unfortunately I had to send it back.  It hurt my wrist to wear it.<br/>The app is wonderful though.
 Disappointed that this version doesn't count the flights of stairs.
 Love it.  Great choice.
 False readings.  The Fitbit counted arm movement as steps while standing still not walking. Not very accurate.  Disappointed.
 I got both this one and the charge 2
 Good product.
 If you’ve never had a different tracker that is more accurate you might not even know the difference but having the Charge HR for 2 years this is severely inaccurate in comparison.<br/>The automatic workout tracking can be iffy, it tracks when it feel like it and a ometimes misses one even when it was a really high intensity exercise it should have recognized.  Sleep tracking is night and day different from the Charge as well and the Charge seemed more spot on. The sleep stages feature is cool but not sure how accurate it is.<br/>It’s nice to swap out wristbands and the smaller style is less bulky as well especially if you wear it to sleep.  End of story, if you can handle the slightly bigger size go for the Charge HR instead for better results.
 Very easy to use - works well
 This is my first tracker and I have been enjoying it for a week.  However today, it just decided to take steps away!  Walked an hour, up over 5K steps and 3+ miles, then looked down an hour later and I'm at 2K and less than a mile??  No I didn't take it off, it's fully charged and I didn't do anything weird with it.  And it's done it again later in the day.  Doesn't make me happy for something brand new that I paid $150 for.  Probably sending it back and looking for something else.  Anti-motivation!<br/><br/>Update 4.12. I read that when you add a step based exercise, the app removes those steps from your daily total. Why? Anyway I can work around that. Now though the heart rate monitor is showing I'm at super max heart rate for looong stretches during mild exercise which can't at all be the case
 Had a real hard time setting up, after several attempts, had to return
 Love it!
 The price was high
 Keeps me motivated to move and I love how u can track ur food, water and sleep.
 So far, so good. Very simple to set up and make adjustments
 I do like how sleek this device is and I think that the community is great.  However I am not a bit happy with the battery life since it says 7 days but mine wants to be charged every 2 days.  Also to turn off an alarm or to see anything more then the time, I practically have to hit the device to get it to respond.  Just tapping it twice as instructed does not work.  Now if those issues were resolved, I would absolutely love this device.
 Love it!  The only thing I miss is the stairs. So easy to use!
 Love my Fitbit!
 Bought this for my girlfriends birthday. She loves it!
 I had the UpBand from Jawbone for the last 4 years.  After the last one that died, I decided to try Fitbit since I have heard a lot of good reviews.  I must say, I should have tried Fitbit years ago.  The features are so much better and I love the heart rate function and the challenges it gives you.
 Does more than I expected.
 Amazing product.
 DOA - doesn’t charge or give any sign of life.
 Wife loved it, still learning everything it will do.
 Enjoying it tremendously!
 No issues works perfect
 I was so excited to upgrade after having my Fitbit zip a year, however I ordered this and after getting it all set up I put it on and noticed it was hot like burning my wrist then shooting pains going up my arm. So I turned off the HR (heart rate) off because I'm not really into this feature anyways let it set for 20 minutes to cool down put it back on seemed cooler then it started getting warm again even with the HR lights off I'm so disappointed.
 Took a while to figure out where to tap it.  Some people say to tap where it meets the band but I find tapping on the side in the middle works best for me.  Flicking the wrist doesn't always work.  The alarm vibrations I sometimes feel and sometimes don't.  It never wakes me up so I can't use it as an alarm for getting up in the morning and I rarely feel the 10 minutes to the hour buzz to get moving.  It's a nice fancy pedometer.  I do like the heart rate and sleep data.
 This is working so well!!!  I love having a better record of my sleep.  I am going through the Sleepio.com program, and this is a much easier and much more accurate way, of logging my sleep.  It does have to be tapped pretty solidly to respond, but turning my wrist up works well and it fits really nicely.  I have it set to auto-track certain workouts, and I can't say that I've seen that happen very well, but I do have it linked to MyFitnessPal, so it may just need to be manually done due to that.  I got this last week, have worn it actively since, and am JUST now getting the notice to charge it.  This is my third FitBit, after trying two Jawbone UPs.  I am comfortable remaining with this company.  I'm so very pleased!
 Love it
 The Fitbit Alta HR is a relatively new fitness tracker that is very comfortable and unobtrusive. It is an excellent tracker for providing detailed information about your nightly sleep and can automatically track your exercise without requiring input from the wearer. It does not have GPS capabilities so there are some limitations when making a route. Since it is so new, a firmware update would help with tracking steps accurately and I expect one to be released soon.
 Totally disappointed.  My Alta HR arrived today. Opened the box and tried to turn it on but there was no display. The app recognized the device but no battery charging sign, no display when tapped and no numbers to setup the device. HUGE disappointment.  Returned it right away and plan to replace it with one that hopefully works
 I received my order on July 7th. On July 23rd my Fitbit fell off on my wrist. I have called Fitbit and was on the phone for more than one hour. Customer services were very unprofessional and rude. I was accused that I lost the device on purpose.  They offer no support or solution. Be warn, don’t purchase Fitbit, unless you are wealthy and is able to throw $150 in the wash.
 3 stars because the screen scratches incredibly easy!
 Guess I shouldn't give one star. Came on time, but does not work. Will not power on or charge up. I have Fit Bit Alta, so I familiar with the device.
 The display and features are wonderful but am so disappointed it scratches so easily.
 The Fibit Alta HR has been great so far.  It tracks what I need which is heart rate/calories burned.  I did not give it 5 stars due to the fact that it struggles to track heart rate during HIIT workouts.  It seems to track fine for the first half of the workout, but then gets glitchy.  It tracks no problem when I go for a run.<br/><br/>As a side note, I scratched the screen of the fitbit while playing with my 18 month old.  I was catching her as she went down a slide and the face of the fitbit scratched on the plastic slide.  I was a bit disappointed in this considering I do not think I was playing that rough.  I had only had it for 4 days.  I called fitbit customer service and I was really disappointed.  First, the guy I spoke to had very poor communication skills, I could hardly understand him because he was slurring his speech.  In addition to this he basically told me because I scratched it I couldn't get a new one under warranty.  He offered no other suggestions or help.  SO...I contacted Amazon customer service and it was EXCELLENT.  They had me return my damaged fitbit for free and sent me a new one using next day shipping.  No issues.  Fitbit dropped the ball on this one but I commend Amazon for fixing things!
 Bought the new Fitbit Alta HR after reading pretty decent reviews. Was disappointed when it did NOT work straight out of the box and needs to be returned. Fitbit will not charge and shows battery dead display and doesn't change when plugged into charge. I am not happy after spending almost $200 on what I thought was a good product. A simple google search for "fitbit not charging" revealed 1000s of others will the same issues. Fitbit needs to fix there products! Not happy...
 Accidentally showered in it a couple times and now it doesn’t work anymore. Why even make a fitness tracker that you can’t wear all day to track all your movements.
 Good tracker help me track my calorie intake and my calorie burn
 absolutely love everything about the fitbit alta hr
 Got this for my wife for our anniversary. She loves it.
 This Fitbit was so inaccurate from the start. My wife wanted to keep track of her walks and she would go 5 miles but this would register 1 to 3 miles. Terrible method of sensing distance or footsteps. All the physical information was inputted exactly, too.
 Why send me a product that I want to use right out of the box and it has a completely dead battery? I haven’t even been able to use the thing yet. I’ll try to remember to update this review once it is actually charged. So far it’s been 45 minutes and it won’t even turn on<br/><br/>*update- after resetting it three times, it works for a day, then Inhad to reset it again. Now I’m having problems getting it to charge. It is also like wearing a digital turd on your wrist with a well designed app. The Alta itself is wholly unresponsive, rarely allows me to read a text message, barely respond to taps, and rarely activates to show me the time when I raise my wrist. I’m not really a fan of this thing- I like the idea of it- how it should work. Love the app though.
 Love this fitbit would not hesitate to buy again!
 Finally, Fitbit has fixed the ridiculous design flaw in the old Alta -- the clasp that easily came undone, causing the Alta to fall from the wrist, unbeknownst to the owner.  I just lost my Alta this way, after dropping and almost losing it many times.  I bit the bullet and spent the $150 on the new Alta HR, because I really like the heartrate function.  One problem:  Fitbit has changed the configuration of the old charging cable, so that you can't use the old Alta charging cable with the new Alta HR.  This is super annoying, since I have three cables for my lost Alta --  and now they are all obsolete.
 works g reat
 good.
 Just received this band as an upgrade from the Jawbone UP 2. Looks great and is of much better quality than any of Jawbone's bands. The time shows up when I move my wrist toward me. But I am having trouble with the tapping for stats. It takes several taps to respond and tap through. Though, I have learned to tap really hard for the screen to wake. My last band required just a light tap, so this band will take some getting used to. The level of tapping required does not make it very discreet for checking the time. An update featuring a setting for adjusting the tap sensitivity would be a great idea.
 the charger did not work and not charge noe what shall i do plrase
 I'm new to the fitness tracker craze, so the new Fitbit Alta HR is my first such device. So far it has been fantastic. I absolutely love the real-time heart rate monitoring, and I love the automatic exercise detection modes. Today, for example, I got up from my desk and did a 1-hour power walk during my lunch break. When I got back to my desk, the Fitbit app on my phone was already showing that I exercised for 1 hour, correctly tagging it as walking, showed a graph of peak, cardio, and fat burn durations, heart rate graph for the whole hour, calories burned, and more. I'm quite impressed. I also like the food database which seems just as comprehensive as one of my other favorite apps (FatSecret). The sleep analysis mode is pretty cool too, it has been getting my sleep start/end times perfectly and shows that I tend to wake up a lot at night (something that I already knew, but cool to see when and how many times).
 Not as good as my previous fitbits. But, Fitbit is sending a new one.<br/>They are a good company. !
 Bought the Alta hr, plugged it into my computer but it wont pair with my iphone7 and it wont even do anything on the fitbit itself. Will be sending it back.
 I have the blue/grey model. Love Love Love it. Purchased the rose colored (which I think was slightly more expensive) for my teenager. It was beautiful for a day or two until the band started to discolor:(
 The device itself is nice. Small, lightweight, and comfortable.  However, the step count is inaccurate - it counts about 5% high according to my count check.  The software that you download to communicate with it is simplistic and childish. I don't like it at all. 1) the data category icons displayed on the dashboard are goofy looking and look like they are designed for children? We're dealing with quasi medical information (heart rate, calories, etc).  It should be presented in a more scientific manner.  2) The graphs are not to standards and lack refinement.  The abscissas and ordinates are not labeled properly causing unnecessary confusion and subject the interpretation to error. 3) The flow of information is not arranged logically, 4) the software is not intuitive to operate.  I had to refer to the "help" sections (which are illogically arranged) to figure out what was meant by some of the data presentations.  The software "cheapens" the exercise experience by treating the data funny.  It makes me feel like I'm wearing a toy instead of a serious tool.<br/>All in all this is not a product for someone who is serious about their health.  I'm sorry I didn't look elsewhere and study competing products.  I have more confidence in my $12 Omron device/software and I can get a quicker, more useful, more accurate view with more confidence of my health data.
 I've had other fitness trackers before and none compare to the fitbit Alta. Others are big and bulky but this is really slim and perfect for everyday use. I love that it shows text messages and phone calls on the screen, it's very convenient. I also love that it motivates me every hour to get up and move around. By combining this exercise with a healthy diet and my weight loss &amp; detox supplement <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/dp/B06XKSBLYL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nutratech Atrafen Pro-3 in 1 Blend Provides Weight Loss and Appetite Suppression,  A Daily Dose of Probiotics for Digestive Health, and an Entire Body Detox and Cleanse</a> I have lost a bunch of LBs!! The Fitbit Alta is also a great Fitness &amp; Sleep tracking resource. It has an easily read small LED screen to see time, Steps, Calories, mins of exercise, etc. you do still have to go to the Fitbit App to see Sleep status info &amp; expanded info on your exercise, but it still is a very good product. Has 5 band colors now, but more coming soon. Wear it all time and it is awesome!
 It caused wrist pain. Apparently there have been a lot of complaints of wrist pain, bruises, cysts, etc with the Alta hr. I returned it to Fitbit for a full refund. (The pain has nothing to do with the Fitbit band.)
 Nice
 My Fitbit One recently died and I thought I would try the new Fitbit Alta HR. I was interested in a heart monitor and something with a few more smart features. I am very small so I ordered the small size with the small band. The band was far too large for me and projected nearly an inch above my wrist. Additionally, the band got in the way while I was typing. Even attaching it properly (with 1-2 fingers of give in the wrist), it was physically uncomfortable after just a few minutes. On top of the physical discomfort, the heart rate monitor seemed faulty. I am very fit and active. My resting heart rate is in the 50's. It continually read my resting heart rate as the mid 90's. I returned it the next door and ordered another fitbit one.
 So far I hate this thing because I cannot get it set up.  The set up app just takes me in circles.  Then I am told I need a dongle, what next??  I have had this fitbit for 2 weeks now and have not been able to set it up.  And yes, I am  techo savvy.<br/>Update: got it set up but it won't track my sleep cycle. I was interested to know my stages of sleep and it does not track that. I wake up and there are already 600 calories on my Fitbit tracker, and 200 steps. Am I sleepwalking and snacking??  It is hard to find answers to my questions. I am not impressed with this device.  I really, really wanted to love this thing, but I don't. I remain frustrated.
 I've been a member of the Fitbit community for well over a year now, making the switch from my Misfit Shine (mainly switching because of a work promotion). I recently bought the new Alta HR from fitbit.com but was hoping to return it and purchase the special edition rose gold version. I contacted customer service to see about doing this. Mind you, the original Alta HR I bought has been unopened and I am willing to pay the difference for the upgraded color. I was told that I am unable to do this because the edition I would like to purchase is a special edition (even though it is exactly the same minus the color). The person answering my questions was pleasant enough but unable to tell me why this matters other than it is "different." I was not asking for an even exchange and understood there was a price difference. This is where I have trouble understanding why fitbit.com will not take back an unopened item for a customer to repurchase a more expensive model. I was told that this issue would be directed to a higher level of service. After waiting a week without response I emailed Fitbit and again asked about the return policy. Once again there no reason as to why I cannot return the original purchase to repurchase a different model, only that return policy states it can be returned/exchanged within 45 days for a different color or size. I still have yet to find a place to leave a review, other than specific retailers. This, I guess, should have been a red flag. If a company doesn't trust reviews to be directly on their website when purchasing a product then there may be something wrong. After researching a bit I've noticed many problems with the new Alta HR listed in the community section, step count, calorie count, charging, etc. Guess my run with Fitbit is over. I will be switching back to my Misfit which has a more accurate step count, looks sleeker, and is waterproof!
 I like my Alta HR....up to a point.  I find it discouraging that it doesn't recognize my household maintenance and yard work as activity.  If I am not walking, jogging, or doing gym exercise for for more than ten minutes (minimum) it does not reflect my activity.  I'm 81 years old.  I just raked the heavy debri out of my 65 foot garden.  I was breathing heavily, walking back and forth, and raking up larger and larger piles of debri.  I worked for about an hour.  When I finished, I looked at my Fitbit.  Sure it recorded all my steps.  But when I checked the activity it said I didn't do anything... "Let's get going"!<br/>Phttttt to you, Fitbit.  Very disappointing.  There's no motivation there.  You need to add a few more items to your activity list!  At my age, I don't expect to be out on the road, jogging.  But I do plenty of moving around and exerting myself in my home and yard.  In that respect, I'm doing at least as much as any 30+ year old doing the same things.  Give me a little credit for that!  Otherwise it's a great tool! 😊
 I have had my Fitbit Alta for 2 years.  Up to the last couple of weeks, I loved it.  However, at about the two-year mark, it started to shut off without notice.  At first it was showing that I was only getting about 3 hours of sleep (on and off) a night -- in reality it was shutting off.  I did the proper charging and resetting it.  It began to shut off once a day.  I would have to charge it and reset it several times each day.  This has been going on for two weeks now.  I contacted Fitbit and told them all the steps I had taken according to what was specified on their website.  They ignored what I said and had me follow the same steps again and reported my results (again) to Fitbit.  What Support came back to me was, 'sorry, but your Fitbit is outside of the 1 year warranty period', but here's a 25% discount on your next purchase of a Fitbit and the discount has to be used in the next 30 days!. I was shocked by how cavalier their attitude was, so I checked the Fitbit Community Post and was surprised to see that there were so many others who had a similar problem with their Fitbit at approximately the two year mark.  They were also offered the 25% discount.<br/><br/>Even with a 25% discount, it makes no sense to buy another Fitbit device if there are no assurances that it wouldn't fail again in two years.  For my money, I would rather spend a few more dollars and get a device that is reliable.  The sad thing is that I bought three others as gifts (I bought mine from Costco, one from Sam's Club and two from Amazon).  I will be embarrassed when theirs fail at the two year mark.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I would NOT recommend a Fitbit.  I recommend looking for another company's device that does the same thing (or more).
 I researched for months and debated the use of a Fitbit and was gifted one for my birthday so thought awesome let’s give it a go! I’ve had it 2 weeks now and enjoy it a lot. I find it comfortable, lightweight and changing the bands are awesome. It doesn’t bother me in my sleep which is a huge plus. The app is awesome and my favorite part. The Alta HR has the sleep tracking and it’s really cool. I feel like my heart rate stays pretty accurate and I think my steps are for the most part. The only time I notice it not being as accurate is when I’m doing things like pushing a grocery cart or stroller. I think it gets way behind which is unfortunate because as a mom of 4 I’m almost always in motion that way pushing one thing or another so I do wish it recorded better there, although it’s hard to really say how far off it really is, for the most part though it’s not bad! I enjoy the movement reminders, the customizable goals etc. Over all it’s a cool device. I debated hard on the star rating because I do love it and I think for the less active this model is great, like for older people or someone more concerned with walking and getting reminders, I think I just need an “upgraded” model to suit my needs. For instance I expected this to have more exercises than it does. So I never feel like my calorie and sometimes activity monitor is accurate during exercise. I’m also not thrilled with battery life. I was expecting a good week from the battery but I’m charging every 3-4 days. I also don’t care for the “tap” to see mechanism. It takes way too much effort to scroll through my stuff and 6/10 times when I bring my screen up to check time it doesn’t turn on. I realize it’s not a real huge deal I just wish it was a little more sensitive to that and to touch. I hate having to hit just the right spot to scroll. So for me who enjoys more weight lifting and resistance type training, who is more active and also a mom I think you should get an upgraded model with more options. If you’re looking for more streamlined pedometer, HR tracking and basic cardio exercising this is a great device and I think any Fitbit is a good choice for anyone. This model in particular is not right for me.
 I ordered my own Fitbit Alta HR 2 two weeks after my husband's arrived. Even though I hate watches, I was quickly sold on its ability to track steps, monitor my heart rate, provide sleep data, AND deliver real-time notifications for text/calls from my phone. His watch performed so well and it seemed like a great option for my needs, too!<br/><br/>Before purchasing, I read on the box that it was compatible with iPhone and Android phones, but I later found out the hard way that FitBit's marketing is very misleading... It turns out that this device is only compatible with SOME Android phones, and that list of devices is short.  If you take away one thing from my review, CHECK THIS LIST BEFORE YOU BUY!!!] While the watch worked great with my husband's iPhone, it did not have compatibility with my Motorola G5 Plus. In the end, I found that I could get it to sync manually each morning by "forgetting" the watch in my Bluetooth settings and then relocating it (which takes forever), but this meant no real-time notifications from my phone.<br/><br/>I initially had hopes that Fitbit was working on a fix for this, that it might be just a temporary snag. But visits to the Fitbit community message boards quickly taught me that the company is aware of these problems and aren't in any hurry to fix them. I was frustrated to have spent so much money on a glorified pedometer and even more angry with Fitbit's lack of concern for their consumers. After filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau for deceitful marketing (which was closed without resolution since they can't make FitBit change their packaging), I was contacted by a Fitbit representative who wanted to smooth things over. Not once did he acknowledge that their marketing was dishonest. Not once did he offer a helpful solution.<br/><br/>In summary: This is a well-made watch with lots of potential, but it is only performs the advertised features if you have a compatible phone. If you've got an iPhone or a high-end Android device, you're probably just fine. But if you don't, be sure to check their compatibility list!!! My experience with Fitbit has shown me just how little they care about the user experience. I learned that once they have your money, you should expect only superficial assistance from customer service. Bottom line: This whole ordeal has soured me on Fitbit as a company. You can be sure that my next fitness watch will be purchased elsewhere, from a company with transparency and integrity.
 Awesome Desing classy look but I CANT READ THE SCREEN WHEN I AM OUTSIDE THERE SHOULD BE BRIGHTNESS OPTION THATS WHY USELESS and it is not waterproof. There are couple features should be like a basic timer.
 The Fitbit Alta HR, at the time, was the only Fitbit product to support HR and pedo, so I begrudgingly bought for a gift and subsequently received one a few months later.  I wear it every day to show my appreciation of the gift, but this thing is worthless.  The accuracy of the steps is unacceptable and no way to calibrate. It displays 18.3K steps instead of actual 18,349 steps.  WHY? A few years ago, I had this cheap, POS $10 quarter-sized pedo that registered and displayed the steps as I was taking them.  This Fitbit cost over a hundred dollars!!  I don't know what it's doing when I'm taking steps. The lousy Fitbit app takes its sweet aye time fetching data from device, so I can't dial up activity after walk and check out stats.  Isn't that the point???  The "customized" display options are restrictive and do not show enough information- this is a glorified clock- I should time/date/HR.  No.  I only get 2 out of 3.  And the "feature" that "wakes up" unit when I flip my wrist to show time does not work unless I over-dramatically flip my wrist or tap the stupid screen several times.  Woops, tapped too many times and went past HR screen. The display is not visible outdoors, just not bright enough.  The HR monitor is erratic- I'm walking 5 mph and the display says 78 bpm.  Um, no.  I'm exercising, but the real workout is trying to get the display to wake up and show me something and hopefully I don't tap past the screen accidentally.  When I look at the display, it should show me EVERYTHING- time, HR, steps, and battery.  The feature that scrolls partial text/email when one hits my phone... totally worthless.  The Fitbit app... utterly useless.  How long do I need to wait for steps/activity to appear? Sad thing is, this was a replacement because the first unit wouldn't sink to my phone. The only characteristic that keeps this from being a terrible product is it's water resistant.
 I have had my Fitbit Alta HR for a little over a month. I LOVED it at first, but now I realize it was a waste of money. While traveling in Florida my screen spontaneously cracked without impact or an accident. I contacted Fitbit and they refuse to help with a repair and replacement, claiming a cracked screen is not covered under their warranty. They offered a lousy 25% discount on a new one, which is absurd. Why would I spend money on another Fitbit if they make a defective product and won't stand behind it? If you look at other reviews and the Fitbit community forums, you'll see this is a VERY COMMON problem and they offer the 25% discount to everyone who contacts them with the issue, despite the customer service agent claiming she had to "fight" to get me that.
 I've been using Fitbit since it came out 5 years ago. Overall I've always had a pretty good experience and no technical issues with any of my devices. I recently got the Alta HR in the Rose Gold edition and am disappointed that the band started to show discoloration within the first week of wearing it. My thoughts are that it's being stained when rubbing against dark clothing, because it's on the top of the band, not the area that touches my skin. I wore an off-brand silicon band for years (in light pink) that never discolored, so it's definitely an issue with the material they use.<br/><br/>Anyone willing to paying extra for a "special color" is going to care about this, so I see it as a big oversight. Also, I would have liked the "rosegold" hardware to be more of a pinkish hue like other rosegold electronics. Be aware that it is a true copper rosegold, not pinkish.<br/><br/>I gave a 4 star rating because they are sending me a replacement band. I expect I will have to get an overbrand band in the future, but maybe in the meantime I can see how it does when I'm not wear dark clothes with it.
 Let me start off by saying I have a FitBit Charge HR2 and love it. I got the Alta HR for my wife for Mother's Day. She had been working out a lot recently and I wanted something that we could use to compare stats and have a friendly competition now and then. She loved the Alta, it was a big step up from her FitBit One and even though she got a rash from the band she still loved it, replacing the band with a stainless steel one. There was one small problem. For the past two years she had been constantly emailing FitBit asking them to fix her account, she could see her step count but no one could see hers. The response was the same every time, that FitBit was aware of the problem and that they were working on it. Now, two years later they still haven't fixed the account and the very reason I bought the Alta, to encourage each other and challenge each other to go farther is impossible. Hence the two stars, pretty good product, terrible tech support. Buy at your own risk.
 Love it! It's slim and feminine. My only complaint is the blue gray color is a bit on the purple side. Won't let me post a picture. 😏
 My wife had this for, perhaps, 9 months and today it simply died.  She didn't get it wet, bang it hard or otherwise abuse it.  She just removed it, plugged it into the charger and when she went back to put it on, it would not wake up or respond.  I noticed it was quite hot after being attached to the charger, so apparently something has gone wrong.  Unfortunately, both of us have had poor luck with long term reliability of Fitbit trackers.  She's had three other models prior to this one and they have all died.  I currently have the Charge 2, which is still working (knock on wood), which I bought to replace the previous model whose band became unglued and fell apart.  At least my Charge 2 and my wife's Alta HR have replaceable bands.  However, as stated, we have spent plenty of money buying various models of Fitbit trackers, just to have them die (typically) within or just over a year of use.  Her comment today was "I'm done with these."  So they've lost one customer and they have another whose opinion of their products is deteriorating rapidly.
 For the most part, I like my Fitbit Alta HR. I even bought two more for a couple of my daughters for Christmas. If I would have done more research, though, I would have purchased something else before shelling out all this money. I had noticed from the time I purchased it in May of 2017 that the heart rate was way different from the heart rate handles on my Octane elliptical. Of course, now that I’m focusing a lot on how many calories I’m burning, I am mystified as to why I am only burning on average 125 calories while doing a 21 Day Fix cardio workout when other women burn 300 or more. Clearly the discrepancy on the heart rate is skewing the calories burned. My most recent workout the elliptical measured 154 bpm while my Fitbit read 118. I then checked my pulse manually and it was the same as the elliptical reading. While my Fitbit is accurate while resting, it is WAY off during exercise, usually by at least 30 bpm. I do wear it on the snuggest setting so it is not moving around at all during exercise. My biggest irritation with this is not getting an accurate calorie burn count due to the hr being so far off. Also, if I didn’t know how my body feels when I’m getting up to peak heart rate, I would think I’m not exercising strenuously enough, which could be dangerous,
 First,  the FB is good for tracking steps, sleep, exercise, heart rate, and the food and water you post in it.  BUT,  if you change your goals, all past data will change to be based on the new goal.  If you were on "maintenance" and switched to "lose weight",  then all past data goes from "goals met-green" to "you ate too much-red"  or any other similar change in goals.  This applies to all goals: steps, food, water, or sleep, etc. It's discouraging. Many people have asked FitBit to fix this and FitBit always says it is "under consideration".  According to the community page on their website,  it has been "under consideration" for over four years.  I tried to ask them about this on their Facebook page and instead of just listening, they referred me to the community page.  I did post, but my comment got moved to another section and it was just buried under reams of other people asking for the same fix on this and other random comments.  So, just fyi, don't expect any customer service concerning the way the product is programmed, only the mechanics of the product.  I don't know why they won't make the change.
 The heart rate monitor ROCKS. The sleep monitor works great and I love the in depth charts stating the cycles. But, I'm a Fitbit veteran, and the main reason for my purchase was the step count feature.<br/><br/>This feature sucks eggs. It's terrible, you have to "walk firmly," or deliberately swing your arms a certain way for the steps to count. It's not nearly as accurate as the lower end Fitbit models that I've purchased before. Forget about counting casual steps.<br/><br/>I did a test, walking 100 steps 20 times. Each time, the step count was off by anywhere from 25-50 steps off each time. I'm not at all sure why the reviews on this product are so high on Amazon. I don't think I received a lemon, and I don't think that I'm "walking incorrectly." I'm fairly sure that I am awesome at walking upright, so I don't think it's user error.<br/><br/>The tap screen feature and the raise the wrist to activate... not great either. This is a huge purchase, and at a 150.00 price tag, it's just not accurate enough to justify the price. I will be returning this product.<br/><br/>IF YOU PURCHASE THIS MODEL, do yourself a favor. Take a good 40 minutes out of your day and really test this baby out with the step counter before the return period expires. I hope you have better luck than I did.
 I bought the Alta to replace a disintegrating Charge HR (HR band not replaceable).  I super glued the HR and it still works.  I've used it to check the accuracy of the Alta.  I wear one on each wrist.  Today.. Fitbit Charge HR showed 12,050 steps... Alta showed 9,032.  Synced....  HR rolled back 3,000 steps.. what the Alta was displaying.  I trust the HR more than the Alta but I've had it so long and can't return the Alta.  If they could fix that, it would be great.
 I specifically bought this tracker (from Wal-Mart) because of the detailed sleep data but unfortunately I rarely get it. When I do it is usually wrong labeling much of my awake time as light sleep. If I try to alter to correct it the detailed data disappears and all I get is simplified.The really weird part is that if I subtract time it also alters the sleep graph for the time I slept dropping off the graph REM or deep sleep for periods of time I did not alter. So sleep tracking is pretty much useless.<br/>Step tracking is also off. It constantly overestimates my steps despite my having put in my correct stride length.<br/>Exercise tracking is good for my elliptical workouts and walks. It does not pick up light weights but by moving my arm a certain way I can get it to count leg lifts but I can also use the same technique to lie flat doing nothing and move my arm and it counts as steps, thus cheating (I don't just proved it in a test).<br/>My now defunct old Jawbone UP24 was far more accurate workout and step wise as was the sleep data though it was not as detailed. Thanks for running them out of business with a lawsuit Fitbit. Even the Misfit Ray I bought for $20 on sale is more accurate though again less detail. But what good is detailed data if it is wrong.<br/>I have contacted Fitbit and shown them detailed screenshots and they will not admit to an error in their sleep data algorithm despite clear evidence I mentioned above. They just have me reset it and that solves nothing. Save your money and buy a simple tracker. The HR isn't worth the price.
 I had a fitbit one for 6 years and it has been fantastic.  I finally decided to upgrade to one with a heartbeat sensor and purchased the Alta HR.  However, after wearing it for one week, the screen became scratched and actually chipped during what I consider normal use.  Maybe fitbit has gone with cheaper materials to try to continue to make a profit.  I think I will try a different brand of tracker due to the poor quality of the one I just spent a lot of money on.<br/><br/>As for performance, the step counting matched my fitbit one, but the sleep function was not very good.  It showed me going to sleep at 8pm because I sat for half an hour.  Also, the heart sensor was not able to get very good readings.  Half the time, it was displaying a heart rate that was 1.5X my normal rate.  I also had problems trying to turn the display on and miss the button that my fitbit one had.<br/><br/>If you do purchase the alta-hr, I would recommend purchasing a protective cover in case you bump it up against a door frame or piece of furniture while wearing it.  Also, invest in a screen protector.
 I was surprised at how disappointed I am with the Alta HR. I expected better. It's good enough to keep, but I can't say I'm pleased with it. While it's attractive, the display is unreadable under normal outdoor daylight conditions, and you really have to smack it to wake it up and change the display. Moving your wrist to look at it often does not activate the display as it should. The display is quite limited too, and the rubbery wristband tends to get sweaty and give me a rash. As a watch, the Alta fails. As a vital stat tracker, it's passable. For some reason, the sleep data is not shown on the watch, only the app. Sometimes the sleep tracking fails to work right, but usually it provides a lot of information. Same for the other data it tracks. Battery life is poor -- a week at best before it needs a recharge, but at least it charges quickly. The charger is a non-standard piece of hardware that is easy to think is connected when actually it's not.<br/><br/>UPDATE (October 2018) -- The major design effect with the Alta HR is the wristband. Regular wear and tear will stress the rubber that locks around the monitor's metal clasps until it tears a little. Then the wristband will pop off a the slightest pull, and you may lose the whole watch. Losing expensive Bluetooth-equipped hardware is frustrating. A built-in finder or panic mode should be part of the Fitbit app. Your best hope for finding it (when you know it's nearby) is to sync and set a silent alarm (the only kind it has) through the app. Then listen for the monitor unit vibrating.
 My Fitbit Alta HR came without the USB and wouldn't connect. Returned for Charge HR 2.
 The heart rate sensor on this is way off. It shows a way higher heart rate for me then I actually have. My resting heart rate range is between 48-68 and this shows between 78-88! I've used it for about a month now and I like it for motivation for steps and activity but the Vo2 health score is really discouraging when it's based off the faulty heart rate reading it gives. I think the poor reading actually gave me anxiety for a bit until I took a few self readings manually and then was reassured at my annual doctor appointment. For a tracker that has "HR" in its title it should be more accurate. PS.. I am wearing it right. ;)
 This is my second Fitbit.  I won't buy another.  I used to track my steps with my phone apps, but didn't carry the phone throughout the house and noticed I do a ton of walking inside the house.  So I got the fitbit.  REGRET it.  I noticed it wasn't hard to get to 10,000 steps every day and couldn't figure out why.  Even when I had the flu I was doing a hell of a lot of steps and hadn't moved off the bed.  So I opened the fitbit app on my phone to watch the counter while doing whatever I might do.  Turns out that rubbing lotion on my legs and feet will count every stroke as a step.  Scratching my dogs back or chest will count every stroke as a step.  I now know why I am not losing any weight after dropping to 1300 calories a day and "walking" 10,000 steps every day.  I was so proud of myself, and now just disappointed.
 I am pretty disappointed with this gadget.  I would never buy it again, or anything else from this company unless there is a complete turnaround in quality.  I will stick to my polar chest strap for HR and Endomondo/Strava for the rest.<br/>My complaints:<br/>1) It consistently under-counts my steps, logging only two out of every three.<br/>2) It is worthless for registering high intensity heart rates.  I am talking 30-40 bpm too low as compared to a polar monitor with a chest strap.  Snugging up the wristband and putting it higher on my wrist did little. I finally followed one internet tip and put it in my exercise bra, which gave me much better readings.  HOWEVER...<br/>3) The fitbit then didn't recognize the activity, so I had to manually log it.  When I try to do so through the app on my phone, it crashes EVERY time I try to type anything under "distance"  a required field] and kicks me completely out of the app.  I can add the activity, but only through the computer.<br/>4) The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that I could finagle the HIT heartbeat and it does keep track of sleep cycles.  HOWEVER, since it does so poorly tracking everything else, why do I suspect the sleep cycles are no better?
 My Fitbit was given to me as a gift, so I tried my hardest to like this product. I failed.<br/><br/>This is possibly the most disappointing and broken piece of electronics I've owned in the past decade. It is simply incapable of tracking heart rate accurately. As I exercise, compared to any cardio equipment's built-in HR monitor, it's usually off by at least 40 BPM. Sleep tracking is hit or miss -- about one in five days will track incorrectly, and it's convinced that I'm waking and happily counting my steps as I st at my desk. It's completely broken, and I haven't even covered the totally buggy Android application. Also, It just stopped syncing with my phone.<br/><br/>Please, don't take my word for it. Just search these phrases and see for yourself:<br/>"fitbit sleep data duplication"<br/>"fitbit HR heart not working"<br/>"fitbit wrong steps"<br/>"fitbit not syncing"<br/><br/>Notice that these posts are going on for 2+ years!<br/><br/>I know it seems like I'm bashing this device, but I an trying to be as objective as possible. I tried hard-resetting. I tried the various positions and tightness settings suggested by Fitbit. I even tries wearing it for days on end so that it would "learn" my habits. Nothing worked. I wouldn't buy this product for negative money.
 I got this on Amazon Prime sale and it was a huge mistake to be honest. This thing is supposed to be a fitness tracker yet it doesn't even do that properly. Let me count ways in which this thing fails:<br/><br/>- Doesn't track any exercise where your hands aren't moving. In other words outdoor cycling? Nope, sorry.<br/>- Doesn't track almost any kind of indoor exercise. Tracks treadmill, but is awful at it, more on that below.  Your heart rate is in the 180s?  Sorry, that must be your resting heart rate. Better luck next time.<br/>- Is utterly useless for tracking your heart rate. Readings can be off by 40-60 bpm. Was showing me a heart rate of 100 when my Polar chest tracker was showing 160<br/>- Silent alarms, the smarwatch-like functionality of this tracker is awful and unreliable. Sometimes the alarms simply don't fire for no reason despite being synched and switched on.<br/>- Battery doesn't last anywhere near a week that the company advertises.<br/><br/>Fitbit got sued for selling these and now I understand why firsthand. They are demonstrably awful.
 I absolutely love my Fitbit except for one thing-the beautiful pink band that came with my rose gold Fitbit is turning blue/grey after just one week of use. I just went on Fitbit's forums to see if there is anything I can use to clean it other than what I've already tried only to find that this is a common problem and that the only solution is to buy a dark band. I wouldn't have wasted the extra money for the rose gold if I'd known it would only last one week.
 Steps are racked up when I'm moving my hands. Very disappointed to spend $150 for a defective gadget.
 &lt;333333 absolutely love this. I am medium boned and thought maybe this wouldn’t fit, but it’s purfect! No bruises and it pretty accurate even on my non-dominate wrist. I love the app and the community, completed my first work-week challenge. No excuses, it gets my butt moving and the battery life is killer! I can keep this on for a few days and I’m like “woah...it’s still going!! My Scribd app take up more Bluetooth power than this.”. The sleep feature is awesome as I see that I may need to purchase a new bed since I’m awake around 15% of the night (no bueno). To reiterate, this product is the sh*t &lt;3.
 Many things about it are good but I am waiting for it to break and I will buy the larger model. Sleep function is very useful and interesting. There is a helpful and clear read out on your phone each morning. Steps function seem accurate as does the heart rate.<br/><br/>The profile is slim on your wrist, not large like an Apple watch<br/><br/>Downsides: You absolutely can not see the display when you are outdoors, even on a really cloudy day. No way to see your steps while on a walk, even if you put your coat over your head to make it dark or stand in the shade of a tree.<br/><br/>Steps, heart rate etc. only stay on for two seconds or so then go dark, then you have to tap through the whole cycle to get back to the one you want. Frustrating. You should be able to go to the function you want like heart rate, press and hold or something and make it stay on as long as you want.<br/><br/>It is not water resistant so has to come off in the shower, washing dishes etc. Timex figured this out 40 years ago. Why is it not waterproof?<br/><br/>Just to read the time you have to tap on the face sometimes four or five times to get it to come on. Shaking your wrist as they recommend works about 25% of the time, if that.  Frustrating and clunky.<br/><br/>All in all not worth $100 plus. Spend more and get the larger face and the better functionality.
 I bought my small Alta HR last July. For over a year I have lived this device and it’s features: it is intuitive, tracks my heart rate, syncs with my weight scale, analyzes my sleep, tracks my monthly cycles, and a full battery charge typically lasted about five days. It’s small, sleek, and doesn’t look like a fitness tracker, especially with a stainless steel replacement band, so I don’t feel like I’m being judged for wearing it. It holds me accountable if I sit too long, challenges me to meet and exceed goals, and even reminds me to feed my dogs with programmed twice-a-day alarms. I have loved this tracker so much that I’d almost admit to being addicted to it, if I were the type of person to admit such things.<br/><br/>Based on features and my experience with the tracker prior to this week I would give it five stars, however, I am leaving a one star review because this week everything went downhill.<br/><br/>It started a few days ago when the usual five days worth of charge was only lasting half a day or so. You can imagine how annoying it is to have to charge the device twice a day. I read several forums where 1000s of people had complained of the same issue and I went through all of the official (and unofficial) troubleshooting suggestions.<br/><br/>During this I realized that it appeared there was something off about the display - it’s hard to determine exactly what, but it looks like either moisture or failing pixels/leds. So I researched and troubleshot these issues as well. Nothing helped: repeated “resets,” twelve hour charging cycles, and two days in a bag of rice. The device has never been submerged in water and has had normal to delicate wear for the last year. As of this moment a full charge is lasting less than three hours.<br/><br/>I contacted Fitbit customer service and was told by “Zen” that because I’m a few weeks outside of the one year warranty I’m basically stuck with zero options other than buying a new device (with the predicted yet insulting 25% discount). Guessing from the enormous outcry about issues with Fitbit products, I can only assume this is planned obsolescence. I won’t be buying another fitbit product and I strongly recommend you do extensive research before committing to a purchase of your own. There are too many fitness tracking options on the market to deal with the Apple-esque forced replacement bs that Fitbit is serving up to otherwise loyal consumers.<br/><br/>Bottom line: great design and features undermined by poor quality and no accountability.
 I will never buy a product from Fitbit again. In November of 2016, I bought myself a Charge HR that stopped functioning properly within a matter of 6 months. For a faulty device, Fitbit will offer to fix your device/send you a refurbished one OR give you $50 off your purchase of a new device. Because I wanted something thinner for my wrist, I decided to take the $50 and ordered myself an Alta HR in Gunmetal in May 2017. I used my Fitbit every day, and recently, the band of my Alta HR broke at the point at which you're supposed to be able to change bands. This means that the device comes apart and falls off my wrist if I accidentally apply any pressure to it. Because this happened literally 2 weeks to the date after I purchased my Alta HR and the 1-year warranty has technically expired, Fitbit won't do anything to fix the situation. Two devices breaking over the course of two years is an indication to me that this isn't good quality tech. I'd suggest looking elsewhere for a fitness tracker.
 The Alta HR is one of the first fitness trackers I've owned, and a month later it's still going strong. I would have definitely loved to purchase an Apple watch but Fitbit seems to be the best option for people on a tighter budget.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>+ easy initial setup<br/>+ has a simple clock<br/>+ app is typically easy to navigate<br/>+ easy to sync to app<br/>+ reminders to get up and walk (+ vibration)<br/>+ heart rate tracking is not far off from the tracking my treadmill and chest strap have.<br/>+ battery life is decent, I work 9-10hr days at times and the battery easily makes it through a day of being worn.<br/>+ able to swap out the band for either size, or different types of supported band designs/styles<br/>+ for someone with small wrists, the small fits just right and can be adjusted<br/>+ seems to withstand some abuse<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- no included replacement bands<br/>- one charging cable included, also a little too short<br/>- no stair tracking<br/>- no screen cover or sleeve for protection<br/>- sometimes hard to cycle through the display on touchscreen<br/>- step count can sometimes be inaccurate (more on this later)<br/>- POOR customer service (more on this later as well)<br/>- only adds a few features from the standard Alta, costing much more<br/>- can be a nuisance to wear to bed for sleep tracking<br/><br/>To touch up on those two cons:<br/>1. The steps aren't always accurate, at least depending on what you're doing. For me, I work at a hotel and do both room cleaning as well as laundry and it tracks my arm movements (folding laundry, cleaning, etc) as steps. So the first day I used this at work, it claimed I ended the day with over 25,000 steps. That's definitely way over what I did walk, and because the app factors in steps into calorie counts it may say you burned a couple thousand in one day. This could be combated by wearing the band on your leg but that'd be pretty uncomfortable during a long day on the job. Likewise, if your heart rate goes over a certain threshold during the day it may think you've been doing a work out.<br/><br/>2. Fitbit's official customer service is perhaps the worst I've dealt with in years. First, there's the forums where most of the time a community member will respond and it's hard to ask any sort of question there. Second, e-mailing and/or calling. Not worth the trouble unless you have a serious issue or concern. Third, and worst of all is their stock. I originally ordered an Alta (non-HR) during a Black Friday sale, very early on, and despite all that the shipment was on back order until December - but finally Christmas came and I got an e-mail saying my band was expected at the END of February. I talked to support and they couldn't really do anything, although it was very easy to cancel my order and buy elsewhere (unfortunately at a higher price).<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------<br/>Overall a great buy. I am by no means a health-nut, I'm actually trying to gain weight but it's interesting to visualize how much moving around I do per day.  I would definitely purchase one of these during a sale, because otherwise you're paying full price and you might not like the watch that you get. Finally, of course, I would advise you buy in-stores, Amazon, or anywhere else besides the official website for Fitbit.
 This is my 4th Fitbit. Unfortunately, I lost my Fitbit Alta -- no more unsecured clasps for me! I treated myself to the Alta HR special edition rose gold.  I love everything about it except that fitbit does not make replacement bands for the rose gold hardware.  I've searched Amazon to no avail.  This is disappointing and it is the reason I didn't give this product five stars.  If you're going to make a rose gold product, you need accessories that match.  I am still on the hunt for a replacement band (don't need it yet, but know I will....plus I like the variety of switching bands.  If anyone knows where I can get a replacement band for my rose gold special edition Fitbit with the rose gold secure clasp as shown in the original Fitbit product picture, please let me know. In terms of performance and quality, everything else is great!
 I have had the Fitbit Alta HR for nearly a week now, and while I mostly like it. I might be inclined to be more generous with the rating had I not been a Fitbit Flex user for the better part of the past three years, but that experience left me expecting more. Here’s where I think the Alta series, and the HR are missing the mark.<br/><br/>First off, for the HR it does a terrible job of measuring my max heart rate.  I’ve tried numerous positions and band tightness on my wrist over the past week, and feel lucky when I can get the FB to register triple digits on my heart rate. The most I’ve seen it measure is around 124 when I know I was well into the 150’s, and this requires having the Fitbit turned so the display is on the bottom of my wrist. It seems to measure resting heart rate just fine, however.<br/><br/>The inability to measure my max heart rate anywhere close to actual is a major drawback to this model, but there are four other areas in the user experience where I think Fitbit missed the mark with the Alta series.<br/><br/>1 - The time period the display is on is just a bit too short. I understand that turning off the display quickly helps extend the battery life, but not if I have to tap it on again to finish reading the data. Coming from the Flex, one didn’t need much time to register 1-5 dots, but with actual numerals there needs to be more time for comprehension of the information. Perhaps another 1/2 to full second of ‘display on’ would be helpful.<br/><br/>2 - With a full display, why round the steps to the nearest 100? I understand having the dots on the display as a throwback to the beginning, but surely you can do better than 8.1k for the number of steps. Why not just show the number of steps?<br/><br/>3 - It would be nice if on the Resting Heart Rate screen that Max heart rate could be shown as well. That would be a more useful metric than just knowing my resting heart rate, which is where I am most of the day.<br/><br/>4 - I have found that the Alta works better for me with Quick View off. The reason for this is that it tends not to activate the screen consistently or quickly enough for me, leaving me in one of two situations - I’m staring at a blank screen because I think it will come on in a moment, or I’m in the process of tapping to wake the screen when it comes on, and I now have tapped to the next screen instead of the screen I want to see.<br/><br/>Not sure what you can do about the HR monitor’s accuracy, but I would hope that the other areas I mention can be improved with software updates.
 Received as a gift. Absolutely loved the sleep tracking and heart rate functions but after wearing for almost 2 weeks,  I started having pain under the fitbit area and strange twitching along the outside of my forearm.  This was definitely related to wearing the fitbit as it subsided once i removed it. Found several other people complaining of similar issues in fitbit community boards.  Sadly, I returned the alta hr because wearing it constantly is the only way it makes sense top use it. :(
 Had this for a little less than a week now and am very impressed by the capabilities of this watch. It is able to track specific excercises automatically and is much more accurate than other fit watches I’ve used. The app is really what is where it’s at. It tracks everything in great detail: types of excercises, calories, heart rate, and for the ladies, a period tracker which is freaking fantastic. It also has free excercise videos and other helpful tips for keeping in shape and eating healthy.<br/><br/>I took one star off for the charge function though. You have a unique charger that you pretty much have to take with you in case your battery runs out (it lasts about a week). It’s not a fast charge and takes over an hour to charge fully and that special charger is a bit inconvenient. I had a cheapo Fitbit knockoff before I got the real thing and it had a straight usb plugin charger so *cough* maybe Fitbit can look into those charging functions?
 Do not, and I repeat: DO NOT buy this Fitbit solely because of the pink band. This band will be discolored in a matter of days &amp; be a completely different color in a few weeks. The Fitbit tracker itself is really nice, I love mine. But I had to change the band within a few weeks because the pink band would just not come clean (and I’m a really clean person). Yes to Fitbit Alta HR, no to the “rose gold” edition.
 I bought this in August 2017. For the most part it has been a sturdy, reliable tracker. Lately I notice it’s having a harder time picking up my heart rate, despite regular cleaning and charging.<br/>I’m not particularly gentle on my devices, this has had a fair share of bumps and dings. About 6 months ago something finally damaged the display, but only left a small crack, the fitbit itself, and the screen, still works normally.<br/>The original band was not comfortable, so I purchased a magnetic band that was more adjustable and less sweaty.<br/>I would probably buy another one, but I’m looking for something more water resistant and that could track swimming.
 My Alta HR arrived defective in a couple of ways - it wouldn't sync (which renders it useless for 75% of what you're likely buying it for), it wouldn't turn on with double-taping the screen, and it was very inconsistent in turning on when flipping your wrist.  The best things I can say about it are that it was very easy to switch watch bands and the heartrate monitor for the one day I used it seemed accurate to what I know my sitting heart rate to be. But the flaws are overwhelming and given I've seen others online with similar complaints I doubt mine is just a "lemon" so I returned.
 If you're looking for a sleek &amp; slim ped counter with some fun extras, this wrist band might just do the trick.  On the other hand, if you're into serious training and expect precision you should look elsewhere.  I enjoy the app that accompanies the Fitbit product.  It's simple to use and there are a lot of fun features to play with.  Joining challenges with friends helps to inspire some friendly competition and the Fitbit, in general, does provide motivation to stay active.  I like the sleep feature, and when at rest the heart rate monitor feature functions well. The downside of this product is that the heart rate monitor is basically useless when it comes to mapping serious training.  A simply Google search for "Alta HR heart rate monitor reviews" will provide you with plenty of data to back up my claim.  During activity, the HRM feature is truly a guess.  I've been wearing mine now for almost a month, working out 5 days a week and I've yet to register a heart rate above 145bpm.  It's very inaccurate when tracking workouts and different heart rate zones.  Although I do appreciate the "Fitbit fad" in regards to helping people get more activity in their day, the precision of the product is seriously flawed and you can find better alternatives available in the the marketplace.  Unfortunately I will not be a long-term Fitbit user.
 As much as I want to love this product, I can only like it. Mine looks beautiful as I purchased a wristband for it that makes it look a little more lady-like, however......<br/>I am constantly looking at the app to make sure that my steps are being recorded and in a lot of cases they are not. I like to see the steps progress as I walk while looking at the app and in many, many cases, the numbers do not progress and even after the sync it doesn't update.<br/>It's happening way too often and I would like to see a little more accuracy from this product.<br/><br/>I hate to give a not so nice review, but I also don't like to feel like I am not getting the quality that I paid for.
 I mostly like this fitbit, just disappointed that the auto tracking of exercise stopped working on mine over a month ago. Also it does not accurately measure distances walked, even with the gps on. I use the Pacer app while on my walks to get an accurate distance and walk/jog at least 3 miles every day, and 6-7 on my days off. I go to check my exercise goals, there is nothing recorded and it says "your goals are toast this week". I have been messaging fitbit and they are no help. After all their suggestions such as restarting and lowering the time threshold for auto recognition of exercise, all they could tell me is put it on the other wrist. How about admitting your product doesn't work as described?
 Although this tracker was a bit too bulky for my taste, I ordered one anyway and started using in in early April 2017. By early May 2018 the product had malfunctioned. The two green lights that measure heart rate went wacky; one of them went dead and the other became so incredibly bright that I could no longer wear the tracker to bed or in movie theaters because my wrist glowed bright green. The always-on bright green light also caused the battery to go dead about three times faster than before. I contacted FitBit customer support and because it had been over a year since the purchase date, the best they could do for me was offer a 25% discount on a new tracker. I declined.
 I've been using this Fitbit for about a month now. I originally wanted one to count my steps for fun. But my favorite feature is one I didn't anticipate. I'm terrible about keeping my cellphone on me at home so I routinely miss calls and texts. Not anymore! My Fitbit will vibrate on my wrist alerting me to look at it and I can see who's calling, or read the text immediately. This has also been handy while driving.<br/><br/>You can easily change out the bands. Here is mine with a leather band I bought here on Amazon.<br/><br/>And the last thing I like is the fun alerts challenging me to walk x amount of steps.
 This my second Fitbit and my first with the HR function. I like the size of it, and I wear it in place of a watch. This new tracker has failed more often than the old one - it syncs really slowly, fails to record any activity several days in a row and then needs rebooting. The HR feature works okay, but you can forget getting an accurate recording of your sleep patterns except once in a blue moon - and if you get up in the middle of the night it throws the whole night off. Text alert feature also isn’t working right. When the Alta HR works, it’s good, but have had it it less than 9 months and the band is already broken where it clips to the watch. Fitbit needs to give this model an overhaul - chat community is full of customers trying to figure this stuff out, when it looks to me like a really glitchy device.
 I upgraded from a diff brand. This tracks my sleep so much better, does heart rate, it also does date/time and steps. I’m so impressed with it. Its narrower-which i have small wrists And wanted something wouldnt look bulky-this is pretty unobtrusive. I’m super impressed with it. Holds charge about 4-5 days and sends me an email when battery running low.oh and i’m down 3 lbs and sleeping more since wearing it-because its showing me my sleep
 As a long time user of the simple Fitbit Zip for tracking steps, I thought it would be cool to try the Alta HR to add heart rate features (for my workouts) and see what the sleep pattern feature was like. It took me 24 hours to figure out that the Alta HR cannot replace my Zip for counting steps -- the Alta is completely inaccurate. It overestimated my daily steps by at least 25%? It was counting steps when I was sitting, unloading the dishwasher, typing, and conversing. Some reviewers talk about the fact that it doesn't count steps when pushing a grocery cart. Far worse is that it's counting steps when there are no steps! If you're trying to get 10,000 steps/day, for example, do you really want to be kidding yourself?<br/><br/>The heart rate measurement during my workout seemed fine.<br/><br/>The sleep monitor was interesting, but I'm not yet sure what to do with the information. It's not like wearing a sleep monitor can force your brain to get more deep sleep, etc! I'd imagine for anyone with primary insomnia, in which you're already consumed with sleep-worry, this feature could be the devil.<br/><br/>So, I'll probably go back to my good 'ole Fitbit Zip to accurately track my steps and perhaps use the Alta HR during workouts. Verdict is out on the sleep monitor.
 Purchased this device at Fred Meyer. It was extremely expensive for something so inaccurate. It inflates steps as it logs steps when I am knitting. I figured it might be OK because at least relative. Not so. For the second day in a row it failed to log my active minutes on the treadmill. Thirty minutes yesterday registered as zero. Thirty three minutes today registered as twenty two. What a racket. Save you money.
 My favorite things about Alta HR:<br/>- continuous heart rate monitoring: I can look back on the days where I really did cardio<br/>- sleep tracking: Fitbit knows when I've been bad, and who knew that having a beer would raise my heart rate all night long?<br/>- having to charge it only 5 times a month. I hate charging things, it is a relief that Fitbit lasts a week.<br/><br/>Now that the Apple Watch 3 is out, I've been tempted. What keeps me loyal to Fitbit is battery life. Apple Watch must be charged overnight, so it can't track sleep.
 It works better than expected
 Bought this as a replacement for my 5 year old One after I washed it. Not as accurate in counting steps as the One. I am a crafter and when I sat down to crochet, it started giving me steps! Is apparently counting wrist motions that are not tied to a body movement. Although the concept of getting credit for running a marathon while making an afghan is interesting, it's just not for me. I walk my dog on the same route every day, and the Alta HR counted hundreds more steps than I have ever seen before. It also credited me for an elliptical workout, I have no idea why it saw my walk as that type of exercise. The Alta HR does not recognize flights of stairs. I had assumed (mistake on my part) that it would have the same functions as the One. I am very disappointed that Fitbit does not offer a clip on device with similar features. Guess I have to look elsewhere.
 I got this for my wife as a gift. Just after a year the LED display dies. After reaching out to customer service, they inform me they don’t have repair centers, but I am welcome to buy a new device. They offered me a discount as consolation...but it ended up being a few extra bucks off from the promo they were offering site wide. After spending close to $200 on their product, I would have hoped it lasted more than 13.5 months.
 I love the size of the Alta HR.  My wrist size is right on the line between small and large, so I got the large after reading several reviews.  Fits perfectly!  Everything has been very easy to set up, and I like the fact that you can so easily change bands.  My only question is -- how the trackers records steps.  Swing of the arm??  I wear it on my left arm and was wondering if when I'm working with my golden (leash in left hand always) I'll have to switch the Fitbit to the right.  Sounds like a dumb question, but I bought the Fitbit for a purpose, not just for its' good looks. :-)  I want to make sure it's doing it's job.
 I have loved this Fitbit until a couple of days ago. I purchased it in July and have NEVER disconnected the band off the actual Fitbit. A few days ago I was just doing my thing and my Fitbit fell off. I noticed the band had disconnected from the Fitbit. I reconnected it and since then it continues to just fall off. Im really disappointed in this. I am going to try purchasing a new band but for $150.00 (I see its on sale for $100 now) I would hope it would have lasted a little longer.
 Watch-like closure and very light. I like the grey color which is accurately presented in photos. However I don’t trust the counting of FitBit Alta - don’t trust the heart rate, calories or steps. None of them. I wake up and it already shows I walked 600 steps when I haven’t gotten out of my bed. Says I burnt 500 calories first thing in the morning. I have been warned that it’s calories burnt while in sedentary state but that’s not what I want - I want calories burnt DURING a workout. There is no way to change this in settings. App is not very helpful - it advertises their other app, FitBit Coach excessively. Sleep feature is interesting. That’s about it. For the price, not worth it.
 Got the Alta HR (not from Amazon but this is the same model) as an upgrade from a cheaper fitness tracker, mostly because the cheaper tracker relied on a lousy app. The device itself wasn't bad but the app made it very frustrating to use.<br/>The Alta HR app works great and the device seems to work fine after 2 months. The biggest drawback in my mind is the charger. Lame. Instead of using a micro USB port like the rest of the world they have provided us with a proprietary cradle device. The device is integrated with a thin, cheap, 12" cable to plug into the USB adapter for power. It's too short, it's thin enough to damage easily, and there's no upgrade option (you can't swap it for a better, longer cable. Overall the design of the charger is just dumb and it causes unnecessary hassle.
 This is garbage. It doesn't sync half the time. The support is terrible. The sleep tracker only tracks sleep about 60 percent of the time. The heart rate monitor randomly skips intervals of recording. To get it to sync anything, I have to sync it four or five times in a row. The tip feature does not work, so I have to tap it hard every time to even get it to show the time. Do not waste your money. I will most likely return this.
 I bought this primarily for the sleep tracking capabilities.  However, it was disappointing that 90% of the time, the sleep tracking does not work and only offers a "simplified" tracking.  The simplified tracking is definitely not accurate, as it says that I'm sleeping when I'm clearly awake, and vice versa.  I tried to follow suggestions on their web site, but none of them worked.  I contacted their customer support, and they just repeated the suggestions on the site.  After I had explained to them that I did this already, they just sent back a message apologizing for the inconvenience and closed the issue.
 I have pretty small and bony wrists and unfortunately, the Fitbit was pretty uncomfortable any time I turned my wrist.  The face of the watch was too long and the inflexible connection from the strap to the face was too stiff to allow for a comfortable fit.  The feature that turns the watch on when you look at the watch was also pretty inconsistent - it didn't work about 30% of the time and I had to either tap the watch or try turning my wrists a few times.  The blue-gray color is really nice and neutral.
 This is my third Alta, so I'm hoping the third time is a charm.  Previous Altas, inspite of not having been misused in any way, developed problems after about a year -- not holding a charge, counting backwards (decreasing step count) when the battery was getting lower (but not low enough to need charging), failing to sync with my phone, etc.  I received this new one about three weeks ago and am very happy with it so far. New features my earlier Alta didn't have include heart rate and detailed sleep information, both of which I appreciate. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this new Alta will outlast previous ones.
 I bought this when my Charge died, and I liked the idea of a slimmer FitBit so I could wear my nice watch, and have the FitBit on the other wrist. I love the size, but was a little disappointed to find the display and functions are a little different. Steps are rounded up to the thousands (so 5426 steps would just say 5.4K), there isn't a stopwatch or the ability to set it to monitor different fitness activities. It also doesn't count stairs. So I'm still getting used to its limitations but I still do like the skinny size.
 I bought this for my daughter for a Christmas present.  my problem is this.  now it is 3 months later and the step counter doesnt work.  it will show that she has walked 1000 steps for example and an hour later it will show she only walked 250.  it jumps inconsistently back and forth and does not accurately display the correct amount of steps.  Now it is past the return window.
 I was excited about this band, but quickly became disappointed. One of the important features it lists is its smart tracking of exercises including bicycling. After a few bike rides that were not tracked at all, or not accurately tracked. I got concerned, and thought I might be doing something wrong on my end, even though my understanding was that it should just automatically detect it and track it.<br/><br/>Naturally I began searching for information, which led me to threads on their page of many people having the same issue. Outside of that, the band is just fine. If you don't care anything about that, you'd probably be happy with it. This however was a deal breaker for me. After about a week I returned it, and ended up going with the Garmin VivoSport, and for my purposes it seems vastly superior.
 I liked how well it was constructed. It was easy to take the straps off and charging unit came with it so you didn't have to bother with the straps.  The straps are nice but unusually small. For a woman, who's only 5'4", the strap was a bit short.<br/><br/>It's a bit frustrating if you want a very simple tracker. Personally, it was a bit too much.<br/><br/>Mostly, it doesn't sync with Apple Health. You have to buy an app for it which I wasn't expecting.
 Received the Fitbit Alta HR to replace the Zip. Took some adjusting to get a comfortable fit as the Fitbit is quite long and the band is inflexible (I have a small wrist.) The most annoying thing is that you have to tap it about 100 times to get the step counter, etc, to show. Aggravating. Based on another reviewer who said it didn’t count when pushing a shopping cart, I put it in my pocket for shopping time and it seemed to work well (Like the Zip). I can work with the fit but the difficulty in pulling up the step count costs this review two stars.
 Their cheap plastic charger that's held together by paperclips eventually snapped. Customer service doesn't do anything. Even though European countries get a two year warranty, USA customers have to pay a premium price for 1 year warranty. I don't understand what we're getting for $130. A cheap Chinese device with zero support?
 My friend had a Fitbit and convinced me to buy one and I’m literally in love with it I’ve been losing weight and I love all the different things you can do with it! It shows your sleep your exercise how many steps you take and your heart rate. You can also do challenges with other people that have them which is very motivating for me.
 Was so excited to Pre Order this Fitbit and even paid quick shipping, 3 months it has finally arrived, After day 2 of wearing it  Im very frustrated at the endurance of the strap, despite cleaning per Fitbit recommendations the strap is destroyed and all I did was wear it to work in an office. I have tried cleaning per fitbit cleaning instructions with NO LUCK. It literally looks like a pair of jeans rubbed against it and got it dirty! This was waste of extra money to have this Rose Gold Alta HR  poor quality, users should be advised of the high level of staining with this particular one.<br/><br/>I am also noticing its counting several steps while I TYPE! My old fitbit DID NOT do this! I had a fitbit Charge... I am so disappointed in this item. Save the extra MONEY And dont purchase this.
 This is my first ever Fitbit, so I'm new to having a fitness tracker. I never wear watches/bracelets and I got used to the feeling of wearing it after one day because it's not too bulky. I thought I would have a issue sleeping with it on, but none at all and it's VERY accurate on how much I wake up at night with the sleep tracking! I didn't know you burned so many calories when you slept, because it starts over at 12am each day and counts your burned calories throughout the entire day instead of just when you workout. I think the step counter could be a little better, because if you are waving your arms in the air it counts that as steps even if your not moving. That's why I took off one star, plus you can't really see it in full daylight because it's not very bright. I love that it has a water intake and food intake part on the app because you don't need to use a separate app. I set the alarm on it to wake me up at 6am every morning, and so far this week I've only woke up to it once because my cat wakes me up before then so it's a little hard to test that feature, but it did wake me up that one time I actually was asleep. I love the notifications, when your out and about you don't always have to stare at your phone wondering if you heard a text or call. My last test with it to see if it works good was working out, I did a 30 minute Jillian Michaels workout and it recorded all of it! Although it was counted as active minutes and not a actual workout, which I read was a issue some people have with fitbits but it doesn't bother me much. All in all I love it!
 I purchased this for the heart rate tracking, which it does not do properly. I get my HR range into 150-160 and the Fitbit only shows as low as 93 or as high as 134, all while wearing it at the recommended position. I also tried repositioning it on the inner side of my wrist, where there is much less hair, and it made no difference in accuracy. The only reason it has 2 stars instead of just one is because of the other features, but the accuracy of those are also questionable at best.
 it’s a shame that Fitbit doesn’t stand behind their products on clear factory defects. My first issue was with the Fitbit Alta watch which got so hot while on the charger in the middle of the night that it nearly went on fire.  I am thankful that I woke up to check on it before it burned down my house.  It took them 5 months to finally replace it after sending it back and answering multiple questions back and forth.  Also, they sent me a replacement that didn’t even turn on.  Now, a year later I have a useless Aria scale.  The thing just constantly goes in a loop of “step on, thinking”.  This thing has cost me almost as much in batteries(which I have to replace every two weeks) as I have paid for the scale.  Once again, after going back and forth with support for a month worth of questions they finally tell me it is out of warranty and there is nothing they can do.  Why not just start with the truth.  Is your item older than a year old?  Than we do not stand behind our products.  They are disposable
 I purchased mine from a local store. Had lost several fitbit ones and wanted something more secure. Seemed OK at first, but felt heavier on my wrist than I hoped for. The big issue was when I would shake my hand it would count steps. I tried changing the settings for which hand it is on, but it didn't help. I.have been hesitant to buy a wristband tracker for this reason. For the price of it I would expect it to not do this. With the jobs I have, this will not do. I returned it and am going back to a cheaper version that I liked better.
 Wow, it tracks my bike commute, which is an improvement over my previous garmin device. Awesome.  Too bad it doesn't get the distance, like through my phone gps.  I will update this review to 5 stars if you can achieve that functionality.<br/><br/>These things need to be submersible.  Garmin's devices do it and these need to too.  I would be curious what the reason is for not going after waterproofing these to 10ft or so.<br/><br/>love the advanced sleep tracking.<br/><br/>the design is stylish.
 We couldn't download the soft into my computer yesterday. There weren't any instructions. We fought with the website for two hours. I'm returning it back today. My Nike watch worked a lot better than this one did. Still sad from experience.
 Arrived on time safely packaged. Got this for my husband as a little surprise because his old fit bit fell off his wrist somewhere. I have one myself and it is the best thing ever! You can track what you eat easily by scanning your food items, easy to track your water intake, cool challenges to stay motivated with your fit bit friends, but most of all I love how I can see who texts or calls me just by looking at my fit bit. I use it as my alarm in the morning,and everything. It's definitely a great product.
 Overall this is just ok. The screen is practically impossible to see in the sun. The wake up function of turning your wrist works less than half the time. Worst part is the interference with Bluetooth headphones. When running my sound would get all choppy on two different pairs. Then just sitting at work my music would cut out. I told my phone to forget my Fitbit and no more issues. Overall I wouldn’t recommend this and I’m considering trading up to a smart watch or ditching this altogether.
 This is a fun gadget, but there are a lot of things about it that are weird. It doesn't show the screen if I flip my wrist, it doesn't vibrate but maybe once a week. AND it doesn't count your steps at the grocery store?! Lame! So even though you know you put on ten thousand steps going from one end to the other it won't count them... Sad<br/>It synced up easy with my phone tho, and keeps track of most stuff pretty well.. It's an OK gadget
 I purchased this through Fitbit.com, but thought I'd review here as well. I'm a first time fitbit user, and really like it so far. The size is great for a petite wrist, doesn't feel too bulky or heavy. I really love the rose gold as it looks more fashionable, however, the pink band is already starting to get discolored around the edges, so buyer beware there. I'm unsure how accurate the heart rate monitor is, but the steps and "Active minutes" seems fairly accurate, it has encouraged me to keep moving when I feel like sitting! All in all a good product.
 This product is simple, but is very helpful and has more customizable bands than any other smart device for your wrist.<br/><br/>I was looking around for a good step-counter and other data collector and honestly, the other products from Garmin are SOLID and offer amazing data. But, this Fitbit by far has the most selection of changeable bands. I bought my wife the rose gold and gold bands and she loves the look!! This is great for any minimalist.
 My husband loves its features against it's more slim profile. It has him very conscious of his activity and walking. However, this is a replacement for the original which was defective and didn't work. As is the case with almost anything, the are the occassional  lemons, and we  got one. But Amazon replaced it promptly and this one works great -- as it's supposed to ...... as expected.
 This is my first Fitbit and I'm happy I made the purchase.  Setup is simple and the wristband is comfortable and slim.  I like the heart rate feature and the sleep tracker.  The only thing I wish is that I could change the screen sensitivity on the device.  Sometimes when I tap to waken the screen, I need to tap a few times or bring my wrist down and flip up to activate.
 I used to love this product, until it died shortly after the warranty period.  My fitbit completely stopped working in Dec 2017, after in use for just over a year.  Customer service has been giving me the "run around", getting me to take all sorts of photos of the product, for months on end.  Now they refuse to even service the product and are telling me to buy a new one.  I bought this for when it was just released and expected this to last longer than the warranty period, looks like I was wrong.  I will NEVER BUY a fitbit product again.  I hope this serves as a warning to anyone who wants to buy their products.  Might work great for a short period of time, but don't expect it to last long.
 Love this alta fitbit. It was shipped qui kly and I got the gray blue a d it goes with everything. I had a flex and loved it but decided to ypgrade. I love that this tells time and texts and much more. I highly recommend
 Within a week of wearing this, the screen was already covered in scuffs. I ordered a screen protector, but the damage was already done. I expected it to be a lot more durable. That being said, the functionality is good. A note on the sizing: I was right on the line between this size and the next size up, but this one fits great. I wear it on the 4th hole usually
 Had the charge 2 but it was a little bulky. Alta hr feels great because it's barely there/less noticeable. I think this would be awesome for a mom with young kids to have. I am a nanny and I love having the text/call notifications so I can tuck away my phone at the park/on walks or during playtime but if anything is important I have the notification. Love seeing how active I am each day. Unless you care for knowing calories burned , sleep stages, and heart rate I would skip the hr feature and just have the alta
 I love everything about it.  There are just two areas that I would like to see improved.  You can't see the clock or any of the readings in daylight and that makes it difficult when you are out and about.  Also, the Fitbit would be more comfortable to wear if it was more contoured to your wrist.  Everything else was just as described.  I love the sleep app and how it breaks it down in stages.
 I was really looking forward to receiving my Alta HR.  I had ordered it through Amazon, but because I wanted the gunmetal, it was going to take 2-5 weeks.  So I cancelled Amazon and ordered it straight off of Fitbit who had it in stock. It arrived 12 days later (thanks FedEx).<br/><br/>I have had four Fitbits over the last few years starting with the Flex, then the Charge, the Charge HR and now the Alta HR.  Each time "upgrading" because of features.  I was hoping the Alta HR would be as good as my Charge HR, but smaller.  Well the Alta HR was not only the most expensive Fitbit I have purchased, but also a big downgrade.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is how the notifications are displayed. These include the call, text, calendar, move reminder, silent alarm notifications.  This was one of the reasons I upgraded to the Charge from the Flex.  The notification would simply display accompanied by a vibration.  On the Charge/Charge HR it has been wonderful to notify me when my phone is near but not on me, or when I don't feel/hear it ring in my pocket in a loud situation.  The Alta HR only vibrates and you need to initiate the display by either tapping it or have Quick View enabled and turn your wrist (anyone who has used Quick View knows that it never works on the first try.....or second, so you sit there flailing your wrist until it shows up).  The Charge/Charge HR would just display the number as soon as the call came in and that was great when I didn't have both hands available, or my hands were full but I could still see my wrist to see who was calling in case I needed to answer my phone.<br/><br/>My next complaint is the vibration is way too weak.  This makes the notifications that much worse.  I wear the Alta HR tighter than the Charge HR because of how the holes line up to the clasp and I barely feel it.  Not only the call notifications, but the move reminders and silent alarms I have set up to remind me of things go unnoticed even after the 9 minute snooze.  I just happen to feel something very slight when I realize it's the Alta HR going off.  There is no way I would ever use this to try to wake me up in the morning and I am a light sleeper.<br/><br/>These two complaints are totally software related.  I contacted Fitbit to see if any changes were coming to either change back how notifications were displayed or the strength of the vibration.  They stated that these changes were made because of feedback from customers.  Rather than giving options they changed them for all their devices moving forward.<br/><br/>For look and feel, I was hoping for something smaller.  Although it is not as wide as the Charge/Charge HR (original version) it is taller off the wrist and more cumbersome.  I find myself bumping it against things more.  The Charge/Charge HR would taper toward the edges where the Alta HR is more squared off and sticks out like a sore thumb.  It may be smaller, but it feels bigger.  This is probably something I could get used to as long as I was satisfied with everything else.<br/><br/>I am really torn because I really like the Fitbit app, challenges, badges, etc. and with using it for many years it has been great. But these unnecessary changes to their new models signify the direction they are moving forward and make me want to start looking at other brands.
 Had one of these (not purchased from Amazon) for about 3 days, I went on a hike and it never tracked anything. Sat down on the couch that night and worked fine. Went on a leisurely walk and once again failed to record any activity, returned to the couch and magically started working.<br/>The app works well but the hardware is total garbage
 Wildly inaccurate. Won't track my steps if I am in a store, then showed I walked 300 steps walking across the kitchen.  I have restarted it several times with no improvement.  Sorry I wasted my money. (Note: I did not purchase this through Amazon).
 It does most of what it claims, but "compatible with iOS" is a little misleading. It's PARTIALLY compatible. It doesn't connect to Apple Health. There are third-party apps to do that, and I've paid for two that don't fix the issue. This isn't a "closed Apple ecosystem" problem, because anyone can get developer credentials to do this. This is a fitbit issue.
 Unless you are only using this indoors, stay away. The display can't be read outdoors even on a cloudy day. So you can't read the watch or check your steps or heart rate unless you duck inside a building. Basically, it's useless.<br/>  I discovered it's a known problem (a quick websearch will confirm), and Fitbit has no fix for it.
 I’d have given this Fitbit 5 stars if it had lasted. Worked perfectly for 15 1/2 months and then suddenly the HR lights wouldn’t shut off and the battery would drain in about 2 hours. I tried everything on their support page and nothing worked. Contacted support and was told your Fitbit is over the 365 days so it’s no longer covered but they would offer me 25% off of a new one from their store. No offer of a paid repair service, just an ‘I’m sorry you had this trouble”.
 Getting this thing to sync with my phone is a nightmare. I've tried turning Bluetooth on and off, restarting my phone, restarting the Fitbit, force closing the app, turning on the "always connected" and "keep alive widget" settings, and removing the Fitbit from my paired Bluetooth device. Sometimes one of those things will work, but it usually doesn't. So you can't see how well you slept, or your heart rate history. If you want to change the alarm (or turn it off) it had to sync to do that. The device cannot be turned off or factory reset. A product that doesn't work 80% of the time isn't useful.
 I have had this tracker for 6 months now. I currently get about 36 hours out of it before it tells me I need to charge it. Battery life is fading FAST. I used to be able to charge it once a week. Love the size and the features, but it is a real bummer to have the battery dying on me frequently now.
 I love it, all the features are perfect. It looks nice, very discrete. My only complaint is the way the screens cycle. Sometimes tapping the darn thing just doesn't seem to work, mostly when I'm exercising and getting sweaty, but sometimes also when I'm just lounging around.
 I like the device. However the responsiveness of the screen was poor. Very flakey. Then it stopped syncing with my phone.  Called support the were not very helpful. Said my Moto g5 plus was not on thier compatibility list. So they couldn't support it. Yet they claim it works with andriod.
 Love this new Fitbit.  All the upgrades to the HR are awesome. Love the feel of the band and size.  Also the where you can change the bands. I appreciate that I can see my text messages on my fit bit also the change to the pulse heart rate. I  definitely recommend purchasing this or upgrading if you have an older fit that model.
 How do I do less than 1?  I thought it would be a great smaller fitbit--there is a new and not working charging system that of course does NOT work with prior system and I have had mine charging for 34 hours and it still shows low charge.  I didn't want an APPLE watch--but selling all my fittest on  eBay and moving to APPLE..better customer service (who can you talk to on fit bit? only people who want to sell!)  I have had and bought for others 10 fitbits--it over now.....the new product is not better.....dont pay the price.
 The watch can tell the time. However, it tells me I am walking when asleep, I am asleep when awake, and never tracks my activities despite showing that I had a cardio heart rate for 30 mins. It only tracks activity if I have walked for more than 30 mins. When I contacted their customer service they were rude and completely useless.  I would recommend you purchase a different watch and save yourself the frustration.
 Step count is generated by wrist movement, so brushing your teeth or keyboarding can incorrectly increase step count.  I think it loses heart rate accuracy during intense cardio workouts,  indicating lower than actual heart rate.  It is also almost impossible to read the display in bright outdoor light.
 Got this as a birthday present and I Love it. my original flex needed to be updated so  I got an apple watch and loved all the features it had but hated how big and bulky it was on my small wrist and when I switched to a Samsung phone it was unusable. This fitbit is an great blend of the two, small like the flex and features like the apple watch (like texts and calls from your phone, heart rate etc) and compatible with any smart phone with a fitbit app. Great little tracker! Love fitbit.
 I really live fitbit.  This is my 4th one (I've lost 3 by falling of my wrist😩) This one is an upgrade for me. I went from the Alta now to the Alta HR. I think it may be defective because when you swing your wrist to look at it, it's supposed to show the display..but mine doesn't. Other than that everything had been great so far. It does well with HR, steps and sleeping tracking. I guess I'll have to contact Fitbit about this glitch??
 The X-Large is really big.  I'm using it on smallest setting and I'm a big guy at 6'2".  There should be clearer instructions on gauging what size to buy.<br/><br/>Also the sleep cycle monitoring is not working.  Shows that I'm sleeping 1 hour a night or not at all.  This is one of the main reasons I got this model to track sleep patterns.
 I bought the Alta HR when my Charge HR died. I has pretty much all of the same capabilities but it looks so much nicer. When I first put on the Charge HR it reminded me of the ankle things that people on house arrest have to wear. The Alta is more like a bracelet and I can change out the bands. The battery charge also has held for over a week when my last one would die after a day or two. The only thing I miss is the button on the side so I could track specifics during a workout but now I have to open the app to see the stats and it only starts tracking if you workout for at least 10 minutes. Overall I love it.
 I was given a Fitbit Alta HR as a Christmas gift and have been using it for the past few weeks.<br/>Pros:<br/>- Slim design that won't get in the way and looks good with outfits.<br/>- Easy to use. I am no technology geek but the Alta HR is easy to navigate and the app is easy as well.<br/>- Even if you are not an athlete a Fitbit is an awesome idea. Reminders to move are helpful on lazy days and you will wish to reach fitness goals.<br/>- Clear presentation of stats; no BS, you know exactly where you're at and what your fitness levels are.<br/>- Favorite features: phone notifications and sleep tracking. Your phone must be in close range, but sometimes I won't hear my phone go off but my Fitbit will buzz and let me know. Tracking sleep is awesome, you can discover your body's sleeping habits and notice what needs improvement/more regularity.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Sometimes during workouts it will register arm movements as steps or miscalculate, but even this is not too frequent nor detrimental to overall stats.<br/><br/>I love my FB and would recommend one for anyone looking!
 I have loved FitBit for years, but as a creature of habit, I haven’t automatically upgraded to the newest. However, I am glad I did with the Alta HR. I still have the option of wearing it as a watch and counting steps and fitness minutes. The added features of heart rate graphs and more detailed sleep information are very informative, even for someone using them as a basic health guide, like me. I love the ability to easily swap out bands, too.<br/><br/>Very worth the price. Definitely worth the upgrade.
 It's my favorite yet. I've had one of the originals and two charge HRs and they both only lasted for about 6 months before I effectively peeled the back off with the charging cable when I went to disconnect it. This one fits like a glove with it's charging cable and is much more slender. I've only had it a few days but so far, so good. Fitbit customer service is the absolute best. Now if they'd only make a nightshift version of the app that doesn't chastise me for not getting enough sleep.
 Much sleeker design and similar functionality as the Charge HR.  Plus - the removable/replaceable bands allow for versatility and eliminates a major flaw with the charge HR.  Only negative - it doesn't count the flight if stairs, but that wasn't very accurate before anyway.
 Game changer! No complaints! High quality. Detailed analysis live. Keeps me on track and shows instantly where I am at each day (as long as I accurately enter correct food consumption)<br/>On its own- great heart beat, sleep tracking, calories burned, syncs great with the Fitbit scale. LOVE IT!!
 I bought this fitbit for my son and he wore it for a couple days at school. One day he came home and said that he did not like it. I asked him why. Then he told me. Turns out that when you hit a thousand steps you have to look at the phone that you bought the Alta HR app on to see the exact amount of steps you got. Once you hit a thousand steps it only shows 2 numbers of your steps. I was very disappointed.
 First of all this is not a watch, is a fitness tracker. If looking for a watch-like device, look for the new Fitbit Ionic or an Android smart watch.<br/>With that said, Alta HR has a sleek design with exchangeable bands, I swapped the regular plastic band for a leather one from the regular Alta. I like the fact I can wear my regular steel watch on one wrist and the tracker on the other.<br/>The sleep tracking feature is very round and sufficiently informative. I like the resting heart rate feature too. Does not feel bulky when exercising.<br/>Planning to upgrade to Fitbit Ionic.
 I love the Fitbit.  But I’m going for the HR.  I am a nurse and heard it has saved peoples lives!!! The only problem is I have the smallest wrists and the small is still so big for me but I’ll deal with it.  It is very motivating.  I wish I could add my walks to the day if I forget to wear it at 5:30 am!!!
 I wear an Apple Watch everyday, and I love it to death, but I like the automatic sleep tracking that Fitbit offers, as well as continuous heart rate tracking, so I bought this for that exact reason. It out performs my expectations. It's small so it doesn't look like I'm wearing two watches, battery life is fantastic, and the sleep cycle tracking is unbelievable in how good it is.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. Give it a try!
 This is the first Fitbit I own and it works well so far. I love that it can track sleep and heart rate. These are important day to day metrics I would look at and during workouts. The only thing is that the calories burnt seems off. I mean if I really burnt 2000+ calories in a day I would be super fit by now.
 I LOVE this Fitbit. I had the old Charge and it was held together with super glue. I emailed Fitbit and asked about my warranty and told them the state of my current Fitbit Charge. Customer service was absolutely amazing! They have me 25% off, even though my warranty had expired so that I could purchase the Alta HR.
 I absolutely love this fitness tracker; it is  a HUGE upgrade from my Garmin Vivofit 3! It has so many more features on the tracker and in the phone app and is totally every penny that I paid! The bands are very easy to change so you can have a new look every day.
 I received this for Christmas and researched to see that a lot of people liked the Alta. I originally got it for the sleep and step characteristics. However I didn't like I had to use the app to put in when I sleep because my schedule varies so much (hence why I wanted this feature) and I wanted to keep track of the stages of sleep I hit.  All it showed was asleep and awake/restless. Restless usually coincided with me getting out of bed not simply being restless.  I also didnt realize it didn't have the heartbeat function which was my bad and not that of the product or seller.  The first day I charged it because it was dead when received the battery lasted a day.  The second charge lasted maybe 2 going on 3 when we decided to return it. The return was simply because it didn't have the bells and whistles I originally wanted and again that was my fault and not that of the product except for the battery life.  Which could have been a fluke since it was dead when I received it and may have needed more time than the 100 percent it read stated.  I liked the fit,  the ease, and the app was user friendly.  The snaps were at times difficult but that's trivial and easily worked around by duct taping it to my wrist. Worked like a charm.. lost some hair but who really likes to shave..am I right girls?
 Has one fatal flaw - it is very difficult to see outside.  If sunny out, forget it.  Even on cloudy days, it can be difficult to see.  I returned mine (purchased at kohls to get kohls cash since price was same as amazon) and purchased the charge 2.  The charge 2 has all of the same features as the alta HR, PLUS a few the alta HR doesn't.  I didn't really care too much about the extra functionality the charge 2 has, but the screen is definitely brighter and the font is such that it is more easily readable outside.  The charge 2 really is only a bit wider than the alta HR anyway - plus, for what it is worth, my wife told me the alta HR looked to feminine on my wrist and that the charge 2 looks better.
 My new FitBit Alta HR (Black, Large) has done what no one, not my spouse, doctor, or mom could accomplish: make me later my eating and exercise habits! It's amazing how this small piece of wearable tech has forced me to consider my lifestyle. I love it so much that I just purchased and am eagerly waiting for my new FitBit Aira scale!
 Love this helps me to be more conscious that I need to move and how I sleep.. Update the screen was easily scratched and cannot seem to come off. Thought this was made of a harder material
 I will never buy another product with a proprietary charger.  I travel frequently and the special charger is just one more thing I must remember to pack.  Every other device I own uses a standard charger.  I recently bought a $39 fitness watch because it comes with a band that connects via usb.  Goodby fitbits.
 It won’t track my heart rate when I exercise! It just shows “- -“ where heart rate should be. Best part is one time I took it off and it said 68 once it was OFF my wrist.
 Better than I expected, love the functionality
 Adjusts easily.  The first time or two you use it, it's difficult to snap close.  After that, easy peasy. I hate the metal buckle of the original band so this is perfect for me.
 excellent non-stick pan!
 It's cute, functional, and sleek, but be aware that there is no workout mode if you're coming from the Charge HR. Unfortunately, I didn't do my research and as that's the main thing I had my Fitbit for I'll just be getting a replacement band for my Charge
 Got this for my woman(Wife), she loves it. Works through water, sweat, and tears. She/I like how more detailed and in-depth it is itself and on the app. Also really like how it doesnt count steps when driving.
 I had a fitbit Charge HR that I absolutely loved… Purchase this because you can color coordinate the bands.  This one does not count the flights of stairs like the Charge HR did, but  sometimes the Charge counted your flights of stairs and sometimes it didn't, so don't really think I'll miss it. Have only been using this Alta HR for two days but so far so good
 I had a small issue wearing my Fitbit Flex on my left (non-dominant) arm whenever I wore a wristwatch.  I had to change the wrist in the Fitbit app.  Not a big deal, but I forgot to do it more than I remembered to.<br/>The Alta HR stays on my left wrist - I just turn my wrist and there's the time and my heart rate. Tap the face and I can view all my stats!<br/>The wristband is a little bit on the ugly side (that's why 4 stars instead of 5), but I've ordered a more wristwatch-looking band.<br/>All in all, I'm happy with the upgrade!
 This is a garbage product from a company with garbage customer service. I've had to replace the unit twice and the band 5 times since owning it. And the most recent time the band broke, the company refused to replace it because it was out of the ORIGINAL warranty. That is, the band broke within warranty, and then the replacement broke 6 months later. This company embraces the motto "planned obsolescence," building products they KNOW will need to be replaced. Would NOT recommend.
 Love the new improved Alta hr.<br/>Heart rate, better sleep reports, more options.<br/>Hope the glass doesn't scratch &amp; battery lasts longer. It is water resistant, or so they say.<br/>I've had it one day, will see and update as time goes on!<br/>Cheers!
 The actual Fitbit Alta part works great and I love it, but after less than one day of wearing the pink band it was completely discolored and despite trying to wash it as advertised I cannot remove the stains. I would recommend buying bands that are darker in color.
 Brand new sealed product works great great price
 I own this device and its terribly underfeatured. It tracks your steps and heart rate well but thats just about it. Fitbit should bring back Pebble!!
 Customer service is great at offering speedy replacements but the devices should not fail so frequently that most Fitbit users I know are on their second units in warranty. I love the functionality but I'm not confident my replacement will last any longer than my original unit.
 This thing sucks. First of all, it does not record the proper steps. They tell you to reset it and adjust the strides. Even after doing that, the step count is off or sometimes it doesn't even record anything. It does not have the ability to leave the display on while working out so you cannot see anything while doing cardio unless you keep tapping the watch. Most of the time the watch doesn't even turn on. Maybe mine was defective but people on their website had similar experiences. I returned it and will stay away from fitbit in the future.  Save your money and go for something else.
 I bought the Alta HR for my Mom to replace her Flex.  She's so happy with all the added features, especially the alerts for phone messages and calls.  She likes the buckle wristband, and how long it holds a charge.  I might buy one for myself!
 Great Idea, compatability issues<br/>Check the list of compatible phones before buying this. Got it for mothers day. It's going back.
 LOVE IT!!! I went feom the OG fitbit to this one, let me tell ya....it’s what I’ve always dreamt!!!
 Just started wearing this yesterday, although I woke up and it said I walked 84 steps this morning. Nope, just woke up and walked maybe 10 steps. What am I doing wrong? I did have my phone off all night. Is this the reason, and my sleep was not tracked. Help this newbie.
 Great device! Has been working really well. I apparently take less steps with think one than with my Charge.
 Love the Alta, love the app, takes a little bit to sync, battery might last a week for me.
 I bought this on prime day and I’m<br/>Loving it I just wish the band was a little more comfortable and breathable, but that is what they make add on accessories for. I do wish amazon offered the purchase of an extended warranty for it.
 This is the second one in two years.  Each time the band separated from the Fitbit.  The first one was replaced free of charge but the current one has the same issue after less than a year.
 The heart rate monitor stopped working within a year and the battery did not last long either. Very disappointed. Also it paired with my phone, but not with an iPad, we tried everything, it still did not.
 I have purchased two of these and both resulted in the same issues. Will not sync with my iPhone7. Wifi, Bluetooth restarted phone and tracker... all the troubleshooting. Even called Fitbit support who told me the device is broken. Both units?? So disappointed and frustrated.
 Oh my god the pink band stains so easily. I wore this for less than 12 hours indoors and it's all grungy now. Do not order the pink!
 Disappointed:  first one was scratched and second one the band was dirty/discolored with blue markings as if someone had worn it previously.
 This replaced my Fitbit Charge HB... love it!!!  I wear it all the time.
 I wear it everyday and am amazed how many steps I do. Great to have.
 My Alta HR went 8 days on it’s first charge. I like the tracker but not pleased with the sleep tracker. I don’t feel it is recording accurately.
 Great product, fast shipping. Using it to push me to be more active and view my sleep patterns.
 Great product as long as you only need it to last 6 months. I'm no hard core athlete or workout fanatic.... 6 - 9 months every time, I have to go back and fight for a new one. I'm done fighting. I was the final hold out in my Zumba class but now our entire class, and several neighbors have given up on this very short lasting product. Keep looking.
 Easy to setup and use. I find that using the Fitbit Alta HR really improves my overall awareness of my movement during the day, and the quality of my sleep night.
 I love Fitbit products and this tracker is no different. Would recommend to others.
 Does what I got it for. Only thing I don't like is the letters are SO SMALL!
 Just received this today and it's amazing.  So much more comfortable on my wrist than the Charge 2. Really looking forward to using this.  The coral is a great color for Spring/Summer.  Also, purchased one as a gift for a first time Fitbit user.  Can't wait to switch up the bands (ordered the fuscia.)
 I love it... Mostly. It can track my heart rate when I'm resting pretty easily and accurately but when I work out it sucks at tracking it. My heart will be moving at about 130 bpm but the tracker with say something like 70 or 80
 Great for tracking sleep. Basic features. Works well as alarm clock in the morning. HR monitor works.
 My first fitbit was a HR ,it was given to me.I lost 25 pounds!I have 25 more to go so I bought the AltaHR,I keep track of everything, and that my friends is the secret to lifestyle change.Thank you FITBIT
 Got a good deal on Prime Day for my boyfriend’s birthday. He loves being able to track his sleep and his steps!
 Keeps track of my everything. Heart rate, Sleep Steps. It's great!
 I love this fitbit. It is my first one and is so accurate.
 The battery doesn't last very long, but it's fine.
 Got mine on prime day at a good price.  Love the slim size.
 SUPER FAST SHIPPING , HIGHLY RECOMMEND
 Got an Alta HR on Black Friday 2017 for $100, which was a common deal among all major stores, and quite a major discount. I absolutely love it and have been checking the stats constantly.
 Ridiculous that you cannot make out ANYTHING on the screen outside.. sunny, cloudy, makes no difference. You can’t see anything. You’d think Fitbit would have a brightness feature when outside.
 Product was fine until the battery started to keep dying after nine months.
 Comfortable band, easy to sinc with mobile devices, versatile in tracking activity
 Works great, fast set up.  As they keep making them they are getting smaller and smaller, but definitely still room for improvement on the size.
 I love it all.... especially track my sleep and it Vibrates when I get a Phone call!!!
 Just what I wanted.
 It’s not water proof. But it works well
 Replaced my Charge HR with this and I love it. It's smaller and has a nicer display that is easier to read. I also like the hourly reminders to move. I hope it lasts longer than my last two Charge HRs (that only made it a year before failing or falling apart).
 Love it, it looks good and fits good.  Helps me be more mindful of my activity by alerting me to get up and move.
 Works great ,very easy to hook up with my phone
 I got this as an anniversary gift and I love it. It's cute sleek and easy to wear. The battery life lasts a long time. It's nice to know your heart rate both currently and in your sleep. I really enjoy it.
 Amazing I didn't but it off of amazon but instead at target the device is great and I love that it can track my sleep by just my heart beat so I'd you want to see if you want the regular Alta verses this one I recommend this one the Fitbit Alta hr
 Excellent deal on Prime day. This has a sleek design and fits well.
 Perfect step counter for me. Very clear display of time and I love that it glows in the dark.
 Love my Alta HR.
 Wouldn't start back up after it made me do an upgrade. I took it back to the store. Don't have time for all that.
 works as should.
 It is on the fritz after one year
 I ordered it in July. The band broke in November. No recourse since the return window is only 30 days.
 Seems to work well but I've had two previous models of Fitbit's that continuously fell apart and broke. Fitbit is now taking up to a week to agree to replace them
 This would get a 5 but I am having difficulties syncing my texts to the device.  My calls come through fine. Otherwise, great product!
 So far so good- upgraded from the Alta to the Alta HR- like what I’ve seen so far!
 Just on line with customer support.  Apparently fitbit does not consider new iPhone a supported device.  Stopped working in 10 days.
 Love it! Total fitbit addict now.
 LI've it, very thin
 I am still learning how this works and how to read all the results
 Would buy again loved it
 We from the charger hr to this and I'm sooo regretting it. I miss my old device big time. This one feels like it does half of what he other device did👎🏻 Not happy
 The Alta HR is our third generation of Fitbit. My wife &amp; I love the features and the app, but the Charge HR came loose from the band, so we're anxious to see if the replaceable band will finally solve that issue.
 Screen SCRATCHES VERY EASILY! Buy SCRATCH guard!!!
 Alta HR comes offers valuable additions. Display includes resting heart rate and battery status. It doesn't earn a top rating because perhaps to include its additions on a smaller, lighter display, it has removed the flights-of-stairs counter.
 The band on this fit bit broke just like the other one I owned.
 The most comfortable device I have used. Does everything I need without being over complicated. Doesn’t need to be charged very often which makes it very convenient. Perfect for my needs
 The device is blocked out of the box and requires a Bluetooth com with a compatible Mobile to be usable. With my Windows 7 PC I can simply not use it. An additional special Dongle seems to be required but there's no mention of it in Fitbit manual, so not garanty that would even work, took me 2hr to figure out what was wrong. TOTAL WASTE OF TIME ... another total design non sense :  The device cannot be switched off, and neiter can its Bluetooth, which incidentally means NO AIR TRAVEL on many flights ... I'm getting a Polar A370 instead.
 Love the sleekness of it.
 Have a Fibit Blaze , but wanted a sleeker look.  Love the Alta HR! A few less features than the Blaze, but still a great tracker.
 Easy to get switched from my original flex to this new alter HR. I think I'm going to love it.
 Works as advertised. Size chart was correct. Holds a battery charge longer than specified.
 Loving it
 It's as said
 Loving it so far! It's very light weight and until it vibrates for a notification, I forget I even have it on.  Screen is nice and bright and easy to read.
 Love it
 WARNING!!! Expensive junk. Strap breaks and has been redesigned. The strap breaks around one year after you use it. And then they refuse to replace it. GRRRRR! Many other models have serious charging problems. Read reviews and fitbit forums before you buy! DON'T BUY IT!!!
 Love munch Fitbit!
 So far I love it. I wish the battery lasted a little longer. But I can't have everything.  I'm so happy I can have heart rate monitoring without having to get the giant Charge.
 Make sure they ship this with a dongle so you can use it with your computer.
 Great size, works just as well as the larger Fitbit charge HR
 got rid of apple watch 2 as was so inaccurate and expensive. Hardly used any of the apps, such a gimmick. Now I can wear my swiss watch and fitbit at same time. This is how it should be. Most folks buying apple watch is to show off, but who wants to wear a watch made in china!! PLUS alerts you of calls, texts etc
 It's of good quality and perfectly fits my requirements.
 Don't waste your money!! Dies in 1 1/2 years. Fitbit customer service is not helpful and refuses to replace it at no charge. Waste of time and money. Very disappointed.
 I'm enjoy my fitbit. The sleep reading really help meet my goals along with the fitness.
 A must have!
 Love this. Reminds you to meet your goals. The sleep analysis is another great feature
 Lost stopwatch and flights of stars but a slimmer package. Hopefully this one last more than 21 months like my charge hr.
 Horrible customer support - broke and rather than returning to Amazon, I tried to work it out with Fitbit. They just spun their wheels and its been now weeks and no clarity on when I will get it.
 I love the sleep and heart rate graphs that the Fitbit Alta HR has. They are a great way to put health in perspective,  beyond that there are tips they provide to each individual off of that data!
 Awesome device
 I really like my Fitbit Alta hr! The style and size is nice. But I really like my charge hr better!!! This one does not tell you the floors climbed... and I loved that with the others....
 Great product.
 Hard to tell what size to buy
 I love my Fitbit!
 Excellent product, helps me monitor my sleep well, as well as, push me to stay in shape.
 Got it today. Totally worth it.
 I had great success for the first 8 months - did everything it was suppose to do.  Then went to charge it this week - completely dead - So I went out and bought a new charging cord thinking perhaps the original one died.  Nope - still dead.  Of course I threw out all the paperwork so returning it was not an option.  I guess I can return the charging cord.
 Love my Fitbit Alta hr. So light you don't even know you are wearing it! Only con; Doesn't count stairs
 I’ve had every Fitbit except for the the Blaze. I love the size of the Alta HR. However, I dislike that it doesn’t have the steps feature. The other thing is I enjoyed being able to tap my other Fitbit to whatever workout I am doing such as treadmill or weights. This feature should be added to the AltaHR and I’d give it a perfect 5 stars so without I’d have to only give it 3 stars.
 It's perfect!!!
 Just great. Had my first Fitbit Charge x 3 years and finally upgrading... love the Alta and ability to see texts right as they come in.
 Replaced my Charge he with the Alta HR. I like the style and slimmer Alta. Also like the motion with my wrist to show date and time.
 Amazing I love it
 it works well. i like it.
 Beautiful color palet.  Easy to change band.  Accurate step count.  Love this new fit bit
 Love it!
 I’m a athlete for almost 20 years, this is bye far the best product I have ever owned. It’s basically water proof, shower,hot tub, lake no problem. It keeps track of everything and I just love it..... buy with confidence this is a great product.
 Out of all the fitbits I have worn this one is my favorite
 It is a very nice product and it is very comfortable
 Great product.  Definite upgrade from my Fitbit flex.
 I love my new speak Fitbit!!
 Love Love Love this little tracker!!!
 fabulous
 Love iy
 Love this Fitbit out of all my previous ones! The Heart Rate factor brings in a whole new level of data about myself.
 Love it!
 Great for tracking, a step up from the normal Alta.
 The product is very nice and have a great design and good quality material. But the main reason I bought it is because it is small and I could use it on my right wrist and retire my apple watch and get back on using my other watches on my left wrist.<br/>Unfortunately one of the features that I most use on the Apple Watch is the Smart Notifications, specially for the WhatsApp notifications.<br/>Since the Alta HR is the latest release on the FItBit family, and I read before that some of the Fitbit devices already had the capability on displaying the smart notifications, including WhatsApp I didn't check if the Alta HR had it... Judging by the price, that is not cheap at all, I was expecting it to have all the features that the other devices have.<br/>I can't understand why it doesn't have this feature, since it has a good screen to show text messages, so why it doesn't show the notifications???!!!<br/>Thinking of returning it...
 Love it
 Its good but comes with poor band. Band starts moving once you unbuckle it
 Really enjoying the product. I was satisfied with their custom support service. Recommend it to others.
 Love my alta. Love checking my heart rate :)
 Works amazing
 Great help with customer service to set up fit bot
 Amazing tracker. Love the comfort and looks. Sleep tracking is awesome
 Wow. Should have got one of these a long time ago.
 Love it! I've been wanting it since it came out
 i hate it it came broken
 I love it
 I love it!!!
 I purchased the Alta HR to replace my Alta which was damaged from a bicycle accident.  I have owned a Fitbit device since March 2015.  I love the Alta HR especially the Heart Rate and the detailed sleep feature.  I highly recommend buying a fitbit.
 Love it so far
 Love it so far! Matches w everything
 Love it
 Cool beans
 Love it!!
 Doesn't work. Heart rate reading is off when comparing with heart rate of medical grade pulse oximeter
 Calories burned is way inaccurate by a lot!!
 Even though it costs $150, and is arguably the same size as the Charge HR (in different dimensions), this tracker does not keep track of floors.<br/><br/>I can't even bring myself to write much more of a review.  This is day 1.  The tracker irritates my arm the same way that the Charge HR does, so I ended up keeping it in my pocket most of the day.<br/><br/>The interchangeable bands are great, and easy to take off and on.<br/><br/>The description needs to call out the fact that this does not track floors.  The FitBit experience drives around counting steps and counting floors.  There are as many badges for stairs as there are for steps.  How is it possible that a brand new FitBit offering does not track floors?
 I have the old Charge HR and this is a nice upgrade from that. My only complaint is that it doesn't always respond when I turn my write to check the time and I have to tap on it like a mad woman to get the time to appear. Other than that, it works great. :)
 The face of this item is made by very cheap plastic. Very easy to get scratched.<br/>Also the display is not bright enough for the user to see in outdoor. If there’s sunshine, good luck!
 I had the Fitbit Charge 2. It was too big and heavy for my wrist. I ordered the Fitbit Alta HR and just love it!<br/>the slim size is awesome. Does not bother my wrist, I forget I have it on.<br/>I am a senior and comfort was very important to me. This is great!!
 It has the heart rate, steps, sleep functions it will track and inform you via your phone app. Just smaller good for a woman.
 Hot it for my mom, she loves it! Helps to encounter to stay active. Only thing she doesn’t like is the band rubs on her wrist sometimes.
 Favorite Fitbit. Love the small thin design for a woman. I have an I watch but wanted something to track my sleep at night. Good battery lifeZ would buy again
 Bought one for myself and one for me. Love them both. Price was best I could find. Works way past me expectation. Have paired with Renpho digital scales for a well rounded physical health program. Super product!
 Quit working within a year! Fully charge and depletes within an hour - customer service is no help. Really really ticked that it stopped working!
 It was all good but after &lt; 3 months, the wristband became loosen and kept on falling out (It may be defective as only happened 1 out of the 3 devices I got at same time) Can no longer wear it. Contacted Fitbit customer service. They said it has already expired the return period and they have no inventory for wristband except for the pink color. So take it or leave it. Speechless.. I really expected better service from Fitbit!
 My Fitbit is my workout buddy!
 I’ve had this since July and it just started to not hold a charge. It’s march, so it didn’t last even a year! I can’t figure out how to fix it, or even if I can. Very disappointing. Before this happened, I loved it!
 Nice if you don’t want the bulkiness of the Apple Watch but still wanna track workouts
 I like this fitbit but there are a few issues I have.<br/><br/>1. Somehow when I wake up in the morning I always have about 60 or so steps on recorded. I know I don't sleep walk so I'm not sure where it is getting these steps.<br/>2. The strap flips out a lot<br/>3. It doesn't always light up when I turn my wrist toward me or double tap. Sometimes I can't get it to light up for four or five tries. It can get very frustrating.<br/><br/>Although, I do like to be able to track my steps for the day and sleep patterns. Not sure how accurate it is but it give me goals to work towards. It also give me reminders and goals too. I feel as though there are better fitness trackers for cheaper.
 I had a Charge 2 HR that I liked, but hated how far above my wrist it sat. I bought this one hoping it would have a slimmer profile, but the second I put it on I was INSTANTLY disappointed. It is smaller width wise, but sits so high off my wrist. It catches on everything - my shirt cuff, pants pockets, etc - which means it digs into my wrist uncomfortably. I hate how high this is and am so disappointed that I have to pay return shipping for something I didn't even have on for 5 minutes. I'm returning this and buying a normal Alta right now.
 I bought this fitbit one year ago and it won't charge anymore.  Very disappointed that it didn't last long.
 Good quality and seller was prompt and easy to work with.
 I should have paid more attention to previous reviews. They were correct. I have the FitBit since Feb 7, today is Mar 19<br/> It will no longer sinc with the app ony phone, in fact it quit doing it a week ago. It no longer shows the time with a movement of the wrist.  It is truley not worth the hefty price. Very disappointed. The FitBit name use to stand for quality.
 This was my first Fitbit. I selected the Fitbit HR because I wanted an accurate heart rate monitor and auto recognition of my workouts. When I received the Alta HR I downloaded the App on my smart phone. I was impressed by the application and how easy it was to set up and use. I am a fitness buff and have used a chest strap for years so the first thing I did was take the Alta HR to the gym and compare its heart rate reading with my chest strap. The Alta HR failed this test as it was rarely even close to my chest strap heart rate. The reading would freeze for a while. Sometimes it would not read at all, and sometimes it would give a heart rate reading that was 50 - 60 BPM different than my chest strap.<br/>I next checked out the auto recognition of exercises. The Fitbit App allows you to set up auto recognition for several types of exercises such as running, walking, elliptical, etc. At first I was impressed with this but quickly realized it was basing the auto recognition solely on movement and vibration sensed by the Fitbit. It was not taking into consideration my heart rate. For example, when I was riding a stationary exercise bike it would not auto recognize my exercise, even though my heart rate was elevated as much as 2 - 3 times my resting heart rate. I could hardly believe they did not have an auto exercise recognition option based on heart rate. My expectation was that I should be able to set one up such that if my heart rate was over some threshold (such as twice my resting heart rate) for more than 10 minutes it would auto recognize a cardio workout. Then if my heart rate dropped below a lower threshold (such as 1.8 times my resting heart rate for maybe 5 minutes) it would auto recognize that my workout was finished. Seems pretty simple but I was disappointed to find that heart rate based auto recognition of exercises seems to have escaped Fitbit. This is surprising since the main feature on the device is reading your heart rate.<br/>I finally called customer service in case I was missing something and maybe was not using it correctly. I was impressed by the fact that I was able to talk to real person and they seemed responsive to their customers. However, I was shocked by the lack of knowledge of the person who happened to answer my call. For example when I expressed my concerns about the accuracy of the Alta HR heart rate monitor he told me that lots of things affected my heart rate and that as my level of fitness improved my resting heart rate would increase, which of course is backwards. I was left wondering if this individual knew anything about fitness or exercise and how he became a customer service agent for an exercise monitoring device company.<br/>I ultimately realized the Fitbit Alta HR was not going to meet my expectations so I decided to send it back. Fortunately I had ordered the unit from Ammazon and they promptly facilitated the return and gave me a full refund - no questions asked.
 I like that this is very slim, lightweight, easy to put on and off, and attractive.
 Normally I would give this product 4 or 5 stars, but due to the fact that the battery life degrades far too quickly, I can not. I was hoping to get a couple years out of this, but after having it for only 9 months, this Fitbit can't hold a charge for a full 24 hours. This has been a chronic problem that hasn't appeared over night. I've noticed it dying faster than advertised as little as three months after buying. Unfortunately I am being tempted to avoid the Fitbit brand because of this.
 Bought after researching newest fitbit offerings. Has the cardio features I need at a better price, and is sleeker than the newest model w/better battery life. Liking it so far!
 There are better watches out there that cost less.
 I really like my Fitbit! I wear it every single day and use it for exercise tracking, sleep monitoring, and my general watch needs. It has also gotten me to be a bit more discipline with my workouts (check heart rate, amount of time spent resting between sets, etc.)<br/><br/>However, the thing I love most about my Fitbit is the silent alarm! My SO is a very light sleeper and even my phone's silent alarm wakes her up (vibrations on a nightstand is loud enough to wake her up but doesn't do a thing for me). With the silent alarm on the Fitbit, I'm able to set alarms without worry that they'll wake her up!
 Love my fit bit!
 I have been wearing a Fitbit for the past 18 months and appreciate all the functions. Decided to upgrade to a Fitbit HR. Love it so far and also purchased 10 assorted color wristbands for variety. Would recommend Fitbit to anyone who wants more ability to track their daily health information.
 Great product! Great Fitbit quality. Wife loves the size and user friendliness! Highly recommend!
 I wanted a product that would provide heart rate feedback and good activity monitoring. Unfortunately the heart rate capability failed after 4 months. There was no damage to the watch, such as impact, submerged in water or anything else. The step counter is an approximation as well as distance covered. The fitbit alta was used a lot on a measured course and was usually 15% off, high or low, for distance and steps. This would seem to make the calories burned an approximation.
 I like the product for the first 10 months, then it quit working.  As a 45 year old teacher who is not very active wearing in gently and takes good care of it, no excuse a product does not last one year. If you do buy one but an extended warranty.
 Pros: Measures heart rate, and sleep patterns. Encourages activity with a vibration and a message. Cons: Pedometer is inaccurate (measures wrist movement while sitting).
 Return window is saying I cannot return after March 3 and it’s March 12 and the Fitbit won’t hold a charge. I need a replacement but it’s not clear how I do it. I’ve been using it every day and have done nothing different and in fact just had one sent to my mother in law. I’d rate it a 4 out of 5 if it was working so for now it’s a 1.
 I got this FitBit as a Christmas gift for my mom. She loves it, and it was just what she wanted.
 The Smart Track function stopped working within a month, and judging by a Google search, this is a common problem. I have to manually input my workouts in the app to get my workout credit for the day, which is the reason I got a wearable: so I wouldn't have to manually input anything.<br/><br/>Long-lasting battery can go 1.5 weeks between charges. Syncs with my phone well. About 1/4 of the time it doesn't turn on by tapping easily. Has gotten buggy to the point where I had to do a complete reset of the device and the app. Overally, too buggy to purchase again. Will keep using until it dies, then try a different brand.
 Been a fan of fitbit every since I got my fitbit flex which I loved so much. I had to upgrade after a few years because it wasn't working properly. So I chose the alta hr because of its sleek look. However I had many issues with it which customer service was able to fix. One thing I don't like it that the screen gets scratched so easy, I tried covers and screen cases but it just didn't look right. I wish I could wear it would without a case like my flex. That's why I'm giving it 4 stars.
 Always a winner I’m hooked on Fitbit products. I like this one as the HR is accurate, the steps keep me challenging myself.<br/>I did end up returning it because it took too long to receive. In the end I ordered from another site.
 Charging this fit bit is difficult! ☹️
 This stopped working after two months  I liked being able to check my pulse but it was hard to get it show information
 My wife loves it, but has one problem.  If you allows the battery to die, she has to go through the process of linking it to her phone again.
 I originally really loved my Fitbit. I even bought a magnetic wrist band because I didn’t like the one that came with it. All was fine for about 9 months. The battery lasted for a solid 6 days.<br/><br/>Suddenly one day it started dying within a day a two. Then within 24 hours. Then within a few hours and now it is completely dead. After much online research, I discovered this is a very common problem. I wish I had known. I am currently working with Fitbit directly as it has a 1 year warranty. I’m hoping they will replace it.<br/><br/>My advice is don’t buy this one. Google it and see the many many complaints about the battery and find a different option.<br/><br/>UPDATE: customer service at Fitbit was incredible. They are replacing my Fitbit at no charge to me so while I am still disappointed about the well known battery issue, I have increased the stars because of the excellent customer service.
 So happy i got this fitbit i love to know how many steps i take a day i have a Samsung phone and it has the fit tracking on it but i dont take my phone everywhere i go so it was hard to see how many steps..<br/><br/>I love the sleep tracking and i love the silent alarm ive turned all of my alarm off on my phone n just have them on my fitbit its so much nicer waking up to that then a loud alarm.<br/><br/>Since ive got it ive had my phone on silent since my fitbit tells me for text and calls no need for my phone to be loud . I work tomorrow for the first time since ive got it so cant wait to see how many steps and so on with it..
 Like it
 I really got this to track my sleep more than anything - and it's amazing, specifying the amount of your sleep time spent in light sleep, REM and deep sleep.  I like the fireworks show it performs when you cross 10,000 steps in a day, too.  Get a pack of assorted band colors and you'll have a tracker that is actually a fashion statement for a very low investment.
 Purchased after shopping for the best price. I love that I can swap the bands. The Fitbit keeps you honest and was an excellent tool for my 40 pound weight loss!
 It is a nice one and works well
 I thought Fuscia was hot pink- It's a great device and I love the features. I'm enjoying it,  even if it is purple.
 The charger is hard to get plugged in right and it doesn't tell you with a display that it is charging, except initially. Otherwise it does the job.
 Love this product. Not big or too small. Love that it pairs to my phone to notify me of calls and texts when my phone is no where near.
 I hav e not had a new fit bit in a few years. I like this Alta:<br/>-sleek, smaller design<br/>-ability to set silent alarms<br/>-ability to see calls/texts coming in from your phone, or not-&gt;customizable in many ways<br/>-longer lasting battery than my old version, even better than my phone.<br/>-easily used with the free app, to track and monitor:<br/>•sleep!!!<br/>•food<br/>•activity<br/>•reminders to move<br/>•water intake<br/> This may not be as exchitjg for others gay have upgraded each year. But if you don’t, or have never used, trust me, you’ll love it!!!
 I am disappointed with this product. I thought being from Fitbit, it would be accurate. Sadly it is not. I have tested it several times. I have counted 300 steps and it said 250. I walk a marked course. I have to walk almost 1.2 miles before it says it's a mile. My heart rate when walking is wrong. I checked my pulse after walk, got150. The Alta said my highest rate was 134. I had a cheaper UP move which was very accurate, unfortunately it fell off while kayaking.
 i ware it everyday
 It is nice that it tracks sleep and heart rate.  The band cracked within three months but still held until about 6 months.  Contacted fitbit to get replaced.  Apparently they do not do XL bands any more.
 Love this Fit Bit.  Like that you can personalize the screen.  Like that you can see weekly progress etc.
 I've had this Fitbit for 15 months, right outside of the warranty window. Today, it burned me!<br/>I do not shower or swim with it. I keep it dry.  I wear it with a little bit of room, not too tight or loose.
 I have been wearing this monitor for a few weeks, and it just isn't accurate. I fence, the kind with the swords, and it consistently shows my heart rate at around 110 bpm. I can walk up a flight of stairs and achieve that same heart rate. I'll do burpees for a minute and feel like I am going to keep over from the exertion (I never claimed to be in the best shape) and the Fitbit thinks I'm going for a brisk walk (90 bpm). I would not recommend this Fitbit to anybody who would like the ability to distinguish the difference between walking to the john and running from a hyena.
 Excellent as usual from fit bit. I just wish they were waterproof...
 I did a lot of research and this was rated the best on several consumer sites. To my surprise I was able to find it the cheapest here on Amazon. Have had and used for a month now and my research paid of. I love it. Accurate data and easy to use.
 Perfect
 lOVE LOVE LOVE IS all I can say. It looks good, it works great; battery last a long time....get text messeges and call alerts!
 Perfect fit of a fitbit for me! I've had it for 3 plus months now, and haven't had a problem I couldn't fix with it! Battery lasts for several days, charges decently quickly, my favorite tracker by far. I have recommended it to several people. Tracks just enough to keep me health conscience without too much extras for more cost. Only downside is it is only water resistant, not waterproof, but I haven't had a real issue with that yet. Even accidentally splashed it a bunch while doing dishes and it is just fine.
 Great
 Band doesn’t hold up and and keeps falling off. This problem started only 5 months after purchase
 This Fitbit meets my needs to track exercise, heart rate and sleep, and it cost just over $100.
 This is my second as I misplaced the 1st. I like very much being able to select the level of steps to chose as my goal as I'd been ill during the past year and now need to set a lower goal than before. I DON'T want to use all the available features such as tracking all my daily habits and NEVER want anyone else having access to them so it's nice to be able to disengage those features. I like being able to note daily calorie consumption as I become more active again. I'll increase my daily step goal as I become more actice again.
 It is requiring a firmware update, but the app fails to update the firmware. I purchased a dongle to update it from my computer, but the app refuses to recognize the dongle.  My return window closed while I was waiting for the dongle. WASTE of money. Can't get it to work. Should have ordered straight through the fitbit website.
 The Fitbit Alta HR is a masterpiece of design and function. The heart rate function is surprisingly accurate. When I compare the HR on the app to my Life Fitness chest strap, it is spot on to the digit. The app is the star, though. It provides not just data, but insight into what the data means. The Alta HR is well worth the $. Now as to the band; Horrible. It has been decades since I had any sort of rash on my skin. Within two weeks I had an aggressive rash under the band. I did some research and found this to be an extremely common complaint. Why the company hasn't replaced the band material with something more inert eludes reason. My recommendation is to buy the Alta HR and a leather replacement band at the same time. The Amazon's choice leather band is very reasonable and high quality. Would have been five stars without the band issue.
 Really happy with this purchase! Glad I didn’t cheap out and buy another brand.
 Love my fitbit
 Perfect gift to loose weigh wife love it
 Use mostly to track sleeping.
 I love the size and doesn’t feel bulky at all. The steps are def not as accurate as it should be (unless I’m sleep walking, it will say I take ~50 steps upon waking up!). My favorite part is the sleep quality feature— measuring sleep quality keeps me more accountable to sleep sooner and the silent alarm is great. My second favorite feature is the heart rate measurements— let’s you check when you’ve reached “cardio” and “fat burning” rates on the app.
 I purchased one of these directly from Fitbit, used it for less than 36 hours and immediately initiated a return.  For starters, but Alta HR will monitor a heart rate even when it isn't on your wrist.  I purchased a small clip holder for this so that I could clip it on to my pants to use as a traditional pedometer since I already knew that wrist readings were not going to be accurate.  Imagine my surprise when I went to check my steps and the device was still recording my heart rate even though it was inside a silicone holder and three layers of clothing away from my skin.  Must be some kind of amazing technology that fitbit has invented that allows it to do this.  Even after resetting the device per fitbit's instructions it continued to read a heart rate while sitting on the kitchen counter and inside my pocket.  Even when on the wrist and monitoring your heart rate properly the reading isn't close to accurate.  The nurse at my Dr's office took my pulse as part of routine check in before I saw my Dr.  The Alta HR said my resting HR was 90.  The nurse measured it manually at 75 and the O2 meter she put on my finger measured it at 77.  Measuring it myself with a stop watch and my finger on my wrist always showed the Alta HR as being at least 15 BPM off from my actual reading.  Sometimes it would show my pulse as being over 130 while I was just sitting on the couch watching Netflix.  If you're trying to take your heart rate manually, good luck because the display is only active for about 3 seconds.  To take a manual pulse reading you need 30 seconds.  I find myself constantly tapping on the Alta to get the display to light back up to monitor my heart rate.  A huge pain and not accurate at all.<br/><br/>The sleep tracking isn't accurate at all.  The device said that I slept for 8.5 hours with 71 minutes of awake time.  When I went to bed at 10pm and got up at 6 am, I'm curious to know where the extra half an hour came from.  Additionally if I was only in bed for 8 hours and was awake for 71 minutes, how did I still sleep for 8.5 hours?  When checking the device on the app in the morning it did manage to show the times that I was awake reasonably accurately.  For instance, I know that I got up up 1 am to use the restroom and the app did reflect that.<br/><br/>As for counting steps, you're better off getting a 15 dollar mechanical pedometer from Wal-mart or something.  When wearing on my wrist I'd walk around and count 100 steps.  Sometimes the Alta HR would record 95, sometimes it would record 110.  Which isn't too bad for accuracy.  But, if you have something in your hand, forget it.  The device relies upon wrist movement, and fairly active wrist movement.  If you're carrying a grocery basket, shopping bag, glass of water, magazine, etc it won't count a single step.  If you're pushing a shopping cart or a stroller, again, it won't count a single step.  If you're walking slowly up a grocery aisle or across a room, not a single step.  If you have your hands in a jacket pocket because it's 15 degrees outside and you're walking across a parking lot, not a single step.  But, doing th dishes recorded a little over 300 steps, folding laundry was about 200 steps and taking a pizza out of the oven was 8 steps.  If I took it off and put it in my pocket, or in the belt clip the device was a little more accurate, but still not anywhere near 90%.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this device but just couldn't after witnessing how inaccurate it was just trying to perform basic functions.  After showing a heart rate when it wasn't even on my wrist it because incredibly difficult for me to trust anything the Alta was showing me.  Not being able to record my steps accurately when a cheap pedometer can do better just showed me what a waste of money this thing is.
 Bought it form my husband he loves it
 I received this Fitbit Alta hr at the end of December. Today it just stopped displaying anything.  It still syncs up with my phone but nothing shows up on the Fitbit.  Of course the window to return just ended. Will not purchase anything from here again.
 Very comfortable.  Sits right below my wrist tattoo so heart rate reading is not the most accurate but it does read it.  My tattoo is multi-colored and over the location recommended for reading heart rate.  The Alta HR does NOT read my heart rate through the tattoo - but I expected that when I made the purchase.  Overall, it's working really well for me.
 I like this fitbit, but love the Fitbit Versa that I bought for my husband.  This fitbit tracks my sleep (my favorite function), steps, etc.  I can add my activity and food intake, but have not to date.  I got it at a great price so it was well worth the money.  If I were to purchase another fitbit, I would have gone with the versa.
 I have a higher than normal heart rate so I was looking for something to monitor it with. I came across this pretty thing and I am absolutely in love. The app is super easy to use and helps keep me aware of my movement throughout the day. I work at a desk all day so the reminders to stand up and take a few strolls has already made a difference. By tracking my calories, water intake, and steps I've lost 9lbs already. I love it so much I bought my mom the same one!
 My old Alta HR lasted 3 years, so this is a replacement.  Love this fitbit💕
 looks good. works well
 Would like more sensitivity on the screen. Like the notices and alarm settings. First one wouldn’t charge after a week. Called and had replacement in three days. This one is working great. No problems.
 I've had my Alta HR Fitbit for just over a year and I can no longer use it. I have attempted to troubleshoot the flickering screen issue, but nothing has worked. Not a good investment.
 Very suitable
 Love my fitbit
 Plastic band broke within 5-6 months and not repairable. Useless. I find it interesting that in Europe they get 2 yrs of warranty, but only 1 in US.
 This is my third fitbit product I have gotten and its the worst.  Its completely useless for exercise. It won't pick up my heartrate half the time especially while I am working out. I have done all the steps to try to fix it but nothing.  And I can't return it due to policy 🙄
 easy to use
 Accurate, charge lasts 3 days, easy to use.
 I like the size, but wrist band makes my wrist sweaty and itchy
 Every month or so fitbit will lock your account claiming "someone has tried to access your account", they do not reply to questions on this, but they lock you out.  For some users it takes as long as a month to regain access to use the watch they bought.  No one needs this- fitbit has no business locking you out of your account (and thus your reports/progress/etcetera), but they do it and if you push back you hear from some guy named "ahmed" explaining how they want to help you secure your account.<br/><br/>My account consists of a login name, a (I hope) encrypted password, and how lazy I've been.<br/><br/>There is no reason at all they keep locking users out of their accounts, they don't store any useful information- if you go fitbit, prepare to be highly disappointed with their service.  I know I am.  It has gotten worse and worse.  Every 6 weeks they lock my account/ability to use my (very expensive) device.<br/><br/>Update: fitbit contacted me to explain they do have personal information.  At one point I entered my height, and a fake weight.  Still don't think someone "allegedly" "trying to access my account" is a reason to block access to a $200 watch I bought.  Without their online service, no reports, no weekly comparisons, no notifications when the battery is getting low.<br/><br/>I'd rather they drop the security BS and just act like a company providing a service instead of over-zealous security enforcers.
 Works great
 The Fitbit is excellent, but I have had to get a second band due to it falling off. Poor band design.
 Use my fit all the time. Tracks my sleep and walking. I manually put in my cycling class. I get a weekly report. Works great
 The item is fine, a tracker that actually fits my small wrist, with excellent features.  The bothersome thing is that the box had been previously opened.  The tracker strap was unfastened and laying haphazardly in the box, and the packet the charger had come in was ripped open and under the charger.  Maybe someone bought it before and returned it for some reason, but at the price I thought I was buying a new item.
 I am disappointed with my Fit Bit Alta.  When you are sweaty the heart beat no longer calculates.  You have to remove the band and dry off your arm and the inside of the device.  That seems to defeat the purpose.<br/>Also, my band broke after just 6 months.  It won't stay clasped to the device anymore.  Very disappointed.  It should be replaced in my opinion.
 Very useful
 Almost exactly 6 months after purchase, the fitbit started just constantly cycling through the screens. Troubleshooting said to restart the fitbit, which I did. Now its just dead completely. Avoid buying, pick a different brand.
 I love it! I love being able to read the comments, text messages, etc.
 Absolutely love my new Fitbit! It gives me greater accountability to myself and encourages me to get moving. I have learned about my sleep patterns and tied it in to my Bluetooth scale. Wish I had bought sooner!
 I love my new Fitbit. It’s my first one and I’m glad I chose this one. I like being able to tell my steps, heart rate, and progress toward goals. I also like having the time and date visible. In my line of work, I sit still most of the day. It has served as a motivator to get my steps in, which helps me be less sedentary.
 I was hesitant to get a fitbit, but after having it for almost a year now I love it. I very much enjoy all the different features on the app and the ability to change your band.
 I've been wearing this approximately 10 days now. I'm not at all impressed with it. It didn't come with a manual on how to use the device. After a few hours of reading online forums I was finally able to get it synced with my Note 9. "Up to 7 days of battery life." That means if you dont use a single feature it will last 7 days. My primary reason for getting this Fitbit was for the sleep tracking. I am a VERY light sleeper, so I am restless most of the night. This device has made my sleep worse. When I move, the watch lights up and wakes me. To remedy this I have to put a piece of black electrical tape over it.<br/><br/>You'd think for a "Fitness Tracker," it would be waterproof. There are $40 cheap trackers on Amazon that was waterproof. Even the cheapest of smartphones now are waterproof, so why not this Alta HR?
 As far as tracking steps, this product is perfectly appropriate. The HR feature, however, is a bit of a mess. I’ve had this Fitbit for about 6 months and workout 5-6 days a week. I’ve tried all of the adjustments (tightening the strap, moving the device up my wrist, etc.), but sadly no trick seems to give an accurate heart rate. I have a wide range of physical activity from long runs, HIIT, kickboxing, tennis, and soccer. Even when I manually record my heart rate (I’m a physical therapist- I know what I’m doing), it may be around 190-200 during peak activity and I’m lucky if the Fitbit reads at 140. My VO2 score is technically poor according to Fitbit, yet I’m highly active and in great shape.<br/>I like Fitbit otherwise, but if you share a main goal of an accurate HR feature on your fitness watch, I would absolutely spend your money elsewhere.
 Love the Fitbit, hate the band. It’s honestly garbage. I spent extra for the rose gold/pink and am mad I did so because within a few weeks the band became stained and looks super dirty and gross. Even following the Fitbit care and cleaning instructions, it got dirty and cannot be cleaned. I’ve tried everything and it still looks disgusting. I’d hoped for the price that the band would at least be good quality.
 Works well. Battery last a couple days before you have to charge. The heart rate didn't always work right.
 Gift she seems happy with it
 I bought the pink rose gold and love the color.  I really just need a basic device to track steps and help me move more throughout the day but I also like the heart rate feature and the sleep pattern.  I love that you can just hold up your arm like you are looking at the time and the screen shows automatically without having to touch the fitbit.  I have it set to show the time and my heartrate.  I think it is a good buy so far but may eventually want to upgrade and get an apple watch, for now I really like this.  I can also see my texts scroll across the screen which is handy if I don't have my phone near me I am aware I have a text and can grab my phone to respond.
 Girlfriend loves it
 I wear it almost every day. Reminds me of walking and not sitting for too long.
 Just stopped working within 6 months of having it
 Wife likes it a lot. Monitors her sleep and her steps.
 I like the Fitbit HR but the band is kind of cheap. I ordered another one to replace the band.
 Bought in July it’s now early January and it already broke. The band broke off and I can’t wear it. I’ll try to contact Amazon to see if they will stand good for this.
 Very happy with this model
 So far so good. I love that it tracks my sleep.
 Love this a little more than my first fit bit
 Was bought as a gift for my nephew and he absolutely loves it
 My son loves his fitbit. Great size for a super active person.
 These are easy to use but the magnet catches on everything.
 Bought for my wife she loved it
 Liking this fitbit very much!!! The strap is much improved compared to my old fitbit HR. The display is challenged with the slim design which works for me - I'm not really interested in reading much on the screen but liking the gentle notification when it tells me I have a text, call or need to move. I've been a fitbit customer for about 6 years and this is my 3rd device. The other two are still working but have been sidelined as newer models offer even more benefits.
 Exactly what I wanted.  No issues. I like that it tracks my sleep and heart rate.  I can access my texts and alerts through it.  I also get a notification when someone is calling me.  The band has broken twice since I purchased this.  Fitbit has a one year warranty on it, so I was able to have it replaced for free.  The way the band is made seems faulty to easily break, though.
 This is great.  My wife can easily do 6000 steps per day without even leaving her rocker.
 Not nearly as robust as my Garmin.<br/><br/>1) Any fitness tracker should be ok to wear in the shower.  I've been wearing this one in the shower, and if it dies, I'll get another Garmin.<br/><br/>2) No "find my phone."  Seriously?!?  Come on, Fitbit!<br/><br/>3) Doesn't include notifications from 3rd party apps that I use everyday such as eBay.  Not cool.<br/><br/>4)  Can't set "sleep times" to turn notifications off.  I've read it is supposed to turn off notifications automatically when it detects you're sleeping.  Good in theory, but not trustworthy in my opinion.<br/><br/>5) Trying to see what time it is at night is a pain.  My Garmin, I touched to my nose or tapped with my finger.  This darn thing is too hard to activate when I'm sleepy and groggy.<br/><br/>In short, NOT impressed.  This device is lacking and not well thought out.  A huge disappointment.
 A Christmas gift for my mother. She loves it. Very well sized on her petite wrist. The screen is small but still visible.
 Love the Fitbits, this one is even better than the Fitbit Alta because I can track my heartrate as well. Always great products, highly recommend them!
 Grandma loves it; easy for a 70 year old to use for steps and sleep tracking!
 I didn't realize how much I would love this! A friend of mine got the Charge 3. That gave my husband the idea that I might like a fitness tracker. I was underwhelmed when he surprised me with one (not a Fitbit). After a couple of days of use I realized I really liked having a fitness tracker and the accountability and tracking it provides. However, the heart rate monitoring was not super accurate and a lot of the features didn't function properly. So I returned it and ordered the Alta HR because I liked the slim design. I've been using it for almost a month now and I absolutely love it. The heart rate monitoring is really accurate and so is the automatic exercise recognition and logging. The sleep monitoring is pretty accurate as well, it even knew when I fell asleep on the couch and then got up to go to bed. I can't say enough good about it. If you are thinking of getting a fitness tracker, don't skimp. Just go for the Fitbit!
 Updated wife's fitbit, with the small size Altra HR. She seems to enjoy. Good price and on time delivery.
 This tracks what you want. Can select what's imported to you. Has tips and facts that help educate you on fitness and sleep.  Bonus:  put a text messages on your readout!
 What I wanted.... needed... was something to help me better understand how I was sleeping.  I've had troubles for about 7-years now.  I've been on various medications to help me fall asleep (Ambien), or stay asleep (not Ambien).  I don't know why my troubles started, but they were pretty serious.<br/><br/>Now things are much better, but I remain medicated each and every night so that I might sleep.  I'm afraid to not take the meds in fear I won't sleep, which means I won't be heading to work, which one must do.<br/><br/>So I began searching for the least expensive route for sleep monitoring and settled upon this version of the Fitbit.<br/><br/>I've had it for almost a year now and can report it does exactly what I need.  Beyond all the other things it can monitor, the sleeping data has been the most helpful.  I can only assume it is accurate/reasonably accurate, but if it is then it strongly suggests I'm sleeping very much like most men in my age bracket.  Granted, I'm sleeping like them with medication in my system, but at least now I can see that I'm not missing out on sleep that my peers are getting.  Because they aren't either!<br/><br/>I'm certain if I were interested in monitoring the other things this device can do, it would be helpful there as well.  It's small, lightweight, unobtrusive.  The syncing software and such is really better than I expected.  The quality of the device is good, but let's not kid ourselves:  it's a bunch of plastic and rubber.  Longevity probably isn't in it's game plan, and this makes sense to a certain degree.  As technology moves forward I'm sure they can make newer versions that are lighter, have better battery life (this one is pretty good), and monitor more things and do so more accurately.  That's the march of progress.<br/><br/>But I have found this unit to be more than adequate for my needs and feel it was a very reasonable price-point.  Certainly wearables such as the Apple Watch can do so, so much more, but they also start at much higher price points.
 I purchased this to see what kind of sleep I was getting...who knew I would end up loving all the other features so much!!!!
 Works as expected
 Xmas gift , assume it’s going to be ok
 I love this so much, I got one for my mom and my mother in law for Xmas. Seems to be accurate and I love all of the features.
 Got this as a gift for my wife. She uses it daily and has been enjoying the features it provides.
 Great gift for daughter.
 I love the small size of the Alta.  I replaced a defective Apple Watch and prefer the smaller size of the Fitbit Alta.  The battery life is a real plus.<br/><br/>Setup and integration with my iPhone was seamless.  I was able to use my Fitbit account from my old clip-on Fitbit.<br/><br/>I can read my texts and see when I get a phone call or have an appointment.<br/><br/>I hesitated to purchase this product as it does not measure flights climbed, but overall it is providing me with the motivation I need to exercise.<br/><br/>The band is somewhat clunky for a tiny wrist and I have already ordered a couple of replacement bands.
 Love it
 I have been shopping for a new Fitbit and wanted something that was not big and bulky like my old Fitbit Charge 2 and this is perfect and comes with lots of options for different color bands as well!
 Tracker seemed to work properly for most of a day.  The heart rate measurement then became intermittent, often showing "--" on the tracker display.  Varying the tracker position on my wrist and the band tension did not correct the problem.  Took off the tracker for a few hours, and when I put it back on the flashing green lights on the heart rate sensor did not turn on (heart rate sensor setting in the fitbit app was "Auto", so the lights should have turned on automatically).  Battery showed about 90% charged.  Performed the troubleshooting procedures given on the Fitbit website (involving resetting the tracker using the button on the charging cord and changing the heart rate sensor setting in the fitbit app and then re-syncing) multiple times.  Green lights never came on.  Returned product.
 Love it
 Really liked all the features and the way to customize it but the HR model is thicker than the Alta model. It hurt the top of my wrist when I fastened it (not tightly). It hurt the top of the other wrist too, so it’s not my wrist being weird. :)<br/><br/>The Alta does everything but the heart rate and isn’t as thick. I tried on my friend’s regualr Alta and think it will work.
 First of all, I love my Fitbit Altra HR, Fuchsia, Small (US Version) .  I ordered it on November 23, 2017.  One side on the strap keeps falling off.  I lost it once, and was lucky to get it back.  Not sure what you can do.  Please get back to me.  Carol Arvilla
 fits great and easy to use
 I use this every day, only take it off to shower and swim. Works as it should and very comfortable. I was on the edge between the small and the large size so I sized up and just tighten the band.
 Update: Now on my second replacement within the year. Have also had to replace the band twice,<br/><br/>I love the data the fit bit provides and I think it has a sleek, wearable look. However, after six months the strap broke and after seven the computer portion died and would no longer charge. Fitbit replaced both at no cost, but it was incredibly frustrating to have to go through the process twice after not purchasing the product long ago at all. I will not be buying another Fitbit product. However, for now, this does what I need. I just wish it counted steps when on a stair climber too!
 Love my fitbit, works great and does what it's supposed to. I wish it was shaped differently, it's a bit long for a small wrist. Band is horrible, had to order a different band, one that adjusts more easily/quickly. I had originally ordered this on prime day, Amazon changed the delivery day, and since it was amazon delivery, I had to change delivery myself, because they don't ring a doorbell or care if no one is home, just leave it out for anyone to take. Then Amazon 'lost or damaged' it and told me if I still wanted it, I would have to re-order it myself and ask for a refund for the cost difference! I did, that took 4-5 emails to get the correct refund from it. The process of getting this was very frustrating and I was really just glad to finally get it.<br/><br/>********edited to add: this did not work for long, I hardly used it, just a couple of times a week on the treadmill, then I stopped for awhile, tried to use it again and can't get an accurate heart rate on it, not even close to an accurate heart rate, that's how I know it's crap. Total crap. And this thing has no idea when you're sleeping...
 Love it!
 perfect
 I love my Fitbit.  It is really keeping me motivated.  Wish I had bought on a long time ago.
 I have found that while resting the HR monitor works quite well.  During exercise it is way off.  During rigorous exercise I have consistently found my HR to be sometimes 40 beats a minute higher than what the Fitbit says it is when checking my heart rate manually. All the other features are great but for tracking your heart rate during ex excise it sucks.  Fitbit even has a lawsuit against them because of the inaccuracies of their heart rate monitors.
 Love my new fitbit.  I loke how the new one tracks my sleep and tells me how deep of a sleep I am in and how long.  I have bought several Fitbits and this one is my favorite. I like how you can change out the bands too.
