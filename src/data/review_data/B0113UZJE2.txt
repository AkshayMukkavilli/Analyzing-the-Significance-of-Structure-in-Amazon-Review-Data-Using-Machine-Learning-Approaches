 This scale is terrible. It is true, you get what you pay for and I only paid $8. The weight reading continues to move up and down. I used a calibrated scale side by side and weighed 4 grams. This scale went back and forth from 3-5 while the other one gave exactly 4. Honestly wish I had spent a little extra money on a better scale. I work in law enforcement and need more precise weights than +/- 1.
 I received my sleek new digital scale today and figured I would be good to go for a long time. NOT ! Got the batteries squared away, read the rules and started weighing things. Then everything changed. I tried weighing 4 grams of a powdered herb. It would not weigh 4 grams. When I got to 6 grams it started weighing. I tried resetting, repositioning the batteries, you name it I did it. It would not weigh under 6 grams. So I'm going back to my old retro kitchen aid scale and giving this thing to my daughter who said she will never be weighing grams. So much for the future.
 Not sensitive to low weights. The scale is almost useless for measuring out spices and yeast and other items which are in the low single digits of grams. You can only work around it by putting something heavy on the scale (like a plate), then putting the measuring paper on top of that and then pouring on the ingredient. The last scale I bought from Amazon did not have this problem.<br/><br/>The scale is also grossly imprecise, on the order of 10-20%. This can be tested easily - put a cup on the scale and measure a significant amount of ingredients, say 14 grams of salt and 6 grams of sugar. Remove the cup and put a different cup on the scale, tare the weight, then pour in what should be 20 grams from the first cup. It will come out WAY different.<br/><br/>This scale is basically trash. The last scale I bought from amazon was routinely accurate to within 1%.
 I considered long and hard about how to rate this product. It is designed to do one thing, weigh small amounts of food. It is aesthetically designed well. And that is as far as it goes in delivering on its intended function. The "tare" or zero function is coupled to the measuring function. Meaning, when you put a dish on the scale then zero the display, the resulting value will include the weight of your finger pushing the button. The product fails to do what it is advertised to do; accurately measure the weight of food. The designer must not be an engineer. I would recommend another product to weigh food. I will be returning this and finding a better product. When I do I will update this review with my findings. (I gave it two stars because. It looks nice)
 I meal prep and I bought this to weigh out all my food for the entire week and then cook. The one day I cook a week I use this scale for maybe a half-hour in total on time. I turn it off and then the next week I go to turn it on the batteries are dead. I've changed the batteries everytime I use it essentially. This thing drains the battery even when not in use.
 Bought this scale to weigh my litter of puppies. It's fantastic so far. I just put a plate on it, tare the plate, and then set a puppy on it. Works like a charm. Would definitely recommend it. Plus it's very nice looking. Great for the kitchen if that's what you're buying it for.
 We have to measure our cat food accurately by weight.  This scale is Not accurate.  We need a weight of .5 ounces and the scale has a reading capability of 2 digits for ounces.  However, it could never read .50 ounces.  It kept jumping from .49 to .53.  It can't tell if it's .50, .51 or .52.<br/><br/>Then at .49 ounces, I removed over 6 pieces of food and the weight did not change at all.  It read .49.  Then when I removed the 7th piece it dropped to .46 ounces.  Not good for our needs.<br/><br/>In other modes it did the same thing.  small adjustments did not register.
 Worked great for about 6 or 7 months. After that, the scale would only display the unsettled/uneven error. I absolutely loved this scale, so I'm really disappointed that it had such a short lifespan. The piece-of-junk Walmart scale that this scale replaced was many years old, and is still working to this day. In fact, the very day that this scale failed, I pulled the hideous Walmart scale out of storage. Started right up, worked like a charm.<br/><br/>Easily would have been 5 stars if it would have lasted for a reasonable period of time. Such a shame.
 Really would give it 3.5 stars.  It's a good scale.  But, a major design flaw, in my opinion, is the button to switch between grams to ounces is located underneath the scale.  So you have to pick it up and then 'feel around' for it.  If they had put it on the face of the scale with the other buttons, I would have given it 5 stars.
 Easy to use, pretty accurate scale, love the way it looks (very sleek and easy to clean since its a stainless steel top)<br/><br/>The only issue i had is looking at the actual read out... Since the entire thing is pretty flat on the top, if you place any sort of decent sized bowl or plate, it completely obstructs the digital screen. You end up having to see if you can push back the bowl and get a look at while bending over to look under the curve of the bowl or placing a thinner box and the plate or bowl on top of the box.<br/><br/>Honestly the scale would have been 5 stars but the fact you cant see the display without going through a mission is pretty annoying.<br/><br/>EDIT: After giving it 3 stars Etekcity contacted me to let me know that they had a larger version and sent it free of charge, it was the <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Etekcity-Digital-Kitchen-Scale-Multifunction-Food-Scale-with-30-Wider-Platform-11lb-5kg-3-GP-Batteries-Included-Stainless-Steel/dp/B01HNSRYAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale Multifunction Food Scale with 30% Wider Platform 11lb 5kg, 3 GP Batteries Included (Stainless Steel)</a>, which pretty much negates the issue I mentioned above. And after I looked it up they have a newer version of the one I was sent that has the read out to the side which seems even more practical.<br/><br/>For customer service alone,  I had to raise my initial 3 stars to four!
 I had been looking for a kitchen scale for a while, most were too large, too complex or just too expensive. As an afterthought  when ordering other non-related items, searched and found this Etekcity compact scale. So for the price and free shipping, why not?<br/><br/>The scale it well boxed, engineered and manufactured, and using it is simplicity itself. Even the 2 AAA batteries are included. Just pop them in, press the right-hand "On" button and voilá.  The left-hand button changes the units. Especially handy is the simple tare-weight setup. Press the "On" button to turn on the scale, place a plate or bowl on the scale, press the "On" button again, and the scale is reset to zero so you can accurately weigh, for instance, 100 gms of chicken, cottage cheese, hamburger or strawberries so you can verify your nutrition requirements.<br/><br/>For sure I will be ordering more of these Etekcity scales to be shipped to family and friends for birthdays and Christmas. Also have several other Etekcity products on my "Wish List" to combine with my next Amazon order.
 It's usable, but it's so slow. And the accuracy is questionable. I had a pretty old Weight Watcher's glass top scale I bought many years ago that finally went kaput, and I bought this because it had an options for ml as well as lbs.oz as opposed to just oz that still go beyond 16 (math is not my strong suit. Who wants to figure out say you need 1.3 lbs of something, but it only goes up in oz so you have to convert? Ugh.) Anyway, it struggles with accuracy in the way of slowly adding something, say sugar, when you're close to what you need, and the scale doesn't move at all and then suddenly jumps like .4oz. It's just kind of a pain, and I wish I would have spent a few more bucks on something potentially quicker. It might also be easy to clean, but it seems to hold onto everything, like the steam ring from a hot bowl, or condensation and always looks immediately dirty even if food never touched it.<br/><br/>***EDIT 12/15/18***<br/>Changing rating to 4 stars. The company reached out to me and offered me their newer model of the same scale for free. I am also removing the .4 oz complaint because yes, it's true that the scale states it goes from 0-.4oz like that, and I'd forgotten that bit (when I bought it I didn't think it would be that big of a deal to me but it turns out I still don't like it. But I *was* warned). Anyway, the newer model is MUCH larger size-wise, which helps when you have a bigger bowl to weigh. The numbers on the screen are much larger and it gives little symbols that tells you what unit base you are using. The one downside is that they got rid of the two decimal scale weight, which wasn't necessary but I still liked that feature. The scale is still thin and light, and actually bigger than I would prefer but it's still quite nice. Plus, the company was great at reaching out to me to rectify the issue, so A+!
 This product is very affordable and has been accurate in all of the tests that I have done.  The sleek design and large display make it perfect for me, as I can easily fit it anywhere in my kitchen and see the display without trouble.  I'm very pleased with this purchase, and with the warranty I'm not concerned about how it will perform in the coming months.
 I purchased this item Sept 28th 2016 and got it Oct 1st.  I opened it up to make sure it was not damaged in any way and turned it on.  I then put it away and never used it.  I got it out on January 31st to check the weight on a rifle part and got different readings.  Depending on where I placed the item it measured anywhere from 3gm to 12gm.  I emailed Etekcity with a video showing them what it was doing  at 11:08am and asked for advise.  Without any hesitation they responded at 2:06pm for me to send them my order number from Amazon.  I emailed it to them at 3:44pm and got a response back at 4:39pm saying they would be sending out a replacement on February 1 and would take 3-6 business days to arrive and it wasn't necessary to return the defective unit.  On February 2nd the new one arrived in the mail.  I immediately opened it and tested it with the same part and moved it to 12 different parts of the scale.  I got the same measurement no matter where I place it.<br/><br/>All in all I am totally pleased with this scale and especially pleased with their customer support.<br/><br/>I give the scale a 5 STAR<br/>I give customer support 10 STARS.<br/><br/>Recommend this company to anyone looking for a scale at a decent price.
 I bought this scale for two reasons: 1) to measure ingredients for baking (whole grain breads) and it works well for that and; 2) to measure small quantities of  dry ingredients for fertilizer used to grow hydroponic vegetables. The fertilizer is measured in grams and the instructions give you no clue as to how to switch between US and metric (Hint: there's a button on the bottom) and once in metric, the grams don't weigh out in decimal so if you need 3.5 grams you're screwed because you either get 3 grams or 4 grams and when measuring small quantities for 1 gallon batches there is a HUGE difference between 3.5 grams and 4 grams. Having said that, it makes you wonder where their rounding is... is anything over 3 grams considered 4 grams? If it doesn't register as 4 grams until it's actually 4 grams, when it says 3 grams it really could be 3.9 grams.  My point is, if you need accuracy, get a better scale.
 It worked until it didn't.  For a KITCHEN scale you'd expect it to be able to handle a small splash of water here or there, or a minor spill when pouring something and weighing it.  Nope.  A few drops of water got onto the digital display and it was dead.  There are plenty of other GREAT kitchen scales available that ARE waterproof for the same price.  Get one of those.<br/><br/>2 stars instead of one because it works and it was a nice scale until it died.
 REVISED REVIEW (Original review below)<br/><br/>I'm revising my original review because I feel that the manufacturer has been less than truthful in its advertising and how they approach customer service.  My main complaint centers around the accuracy of the scale.  After I posted my review here the manufacturer e-mailed me and offered to send me another one of their scales (for free) that was slightly larger, stating that it could solve my issues.  When I examined the specs of the other scale it stated an accuracy of 0.1oz/1g whereas this scale states 0.01oz/1g.  I was confused as to why a scale that was listed as only being able to measure to 1/10th of an oz. was more accurate than one that can measure to 1/100th of an ounce.<br/><br/>I didn't want the manufacturer to send me a free scale (with ulterior motive perhaps to post better reviews??) if I didn't think it was going to help.  After I relayed my concerns back they replied with the following:<br/><br/>"I am sorry for the confusion caused to you.<br/>For the B0113UZJE2 scale, " 0.01oz/1g" means that the screen can display the number of digits of the readings, for instance, it can read 6.35 oz, don't read 6.3 oz, it can read 6g, don't read 6.3g, measuring range 3g-5000g. it can register when the additional weight is more than 0.03 oz(1g)<br/>For the B01MXYQOFS scale, " 0.1oz/1g" means that the screen can display the number of digits of the readings, for instance, it can read 6.3 oz, don't read 6.35 oz, it can read 6g, don't read 6.3g, measuring range 1g-5000g. it can register when the additional weight is more than 0.03 oz(1g)"<br/><br/>Now the broken English is difficult to understand...so much so that it is hard to even make the distinction between can/can't/do/don't(s).  But in the larger context of this and previous emails, as well as their reply below it seems clear that this scale is not accurate to the 0.01oz it advertises.  It would appear that they are judging accuracy simply by the number of digits that *can* be displayed and not in how accurate the scale/pressure plate sensitivity is.  I believe they should amend their product description and all associated documentation to be very clear as what they have posted now is clearly stating this scale should be accurate to 0.01 oz.<br/><br/>Additionally, even though I have explained the problem multiple times they either don't truly comprehend (thus a language/customer support issue) or they are truly trying to divert the problem with their scales.  I know 100% that this scale can read the weight, because it does eventually adjust to the small increments in weight that are added/subtracted.  It is just that it takes either a few extra seconds to adjust and, in cases where it doesn't adjust automatically it takes either placing or removing a larger weight on the scale to get it to reset its reading.<br/><br/>For example, if I had 2.35 oz of blueberries and I add one at a time it does not always move to 2.42, 2.51, 2.63, etc.  Instead after I add the fourth blueberry it will jump from 2.35 to 2.72.  However if after adding the second blueberry and the scale still reads 2.35 I remove the bowl and place it back down (or push down with my hand and remove) then when the scale adjusts it will read 2.51.  Therefore it is clear the scale can measure in these increments, it is just that the pressure plate has some sort of calibration problems.<br/><br/>Curiously enough after I explained the problems and they tried to justify the issue I responded that if they truly believed the other scale would solve my issues I would be happy to give it a try.  Their response now was instead of sending me the scale I should simply return this one to Amazon since it was in the warranty period.<br/><br/>I guess they don't feel that their scales can pass muster on what they seemingly were designed to do.<br/>I very well may research the other options here a bit more and send this one back.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW<br/><br/>I purchased this scale after reading reviews for several here on Amazon.  I paid $11.89 for it.<br/>We bought it to help measure food for calorie counting.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>Good size - relatively unobtrusive on kitchen counter.<br/>Nice finish - stainless steel finish wipes clean and matches other appliances<br/>Easy to use - Two buttons, figured it out in seconds without reading the manual and without having used a scale like this before.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>Accuracy issues - While overall it seems to function well (though I haven't yet tested it against any other calibrated systems), it seems to act funky when changing small degrees of weight.  For instance, let's say I have a handful of blueberries inside and it states 2.05 ounces.  If I throw another blueberry in it doesn't always change the weight, even though the blueberry weighs .05 ounces.  If I take the whole bowl off the scale, or if I push on the scale with my hand to increase the weight and then let it back the way it was it will then show as 2.10 ounces.<br/>So, it seems it has issues adjusting always to very small changes in weight without first manipulating it with a larger weight change.<br/><br/>Display is hard to read - If you look at the display from an angle it can be very hard to see unless the room is dark.  When I have a normal sized bowl placed on top the rim of the bowl covers the display so I can't look straight down on the readout, I need to look at an angle.  The light from the lit LCD numbers bleeds to the rest of the display causing the unlit parts of the display to display this bleeding color.  This makes it hard to read if there is other ambient light in the room without going down real close to the LCD and trying to adjust the angle.<br/><br/>Overall for $12 this will be worth the money if it lasts and since I don't have much to compare to I'm not sure how bad these issues are.
 After shopping around for a kitchen scale, I purchased this Etekcity model. It has proven itself durable and reliable for my needs, which are fairly light. I use it once or twice a week for weighing out baking ingrediaents. It is sleek, lightweight, and cleans up easily. Easy to use.  The insert mentioned it was not for commercial use, which ought to be obvious. But for occasional use in the kitchen, it has been perfect. A very good value.<br/>(This is a non-monetized review. I received nothing in exchange for posting this review. This is simply my honest opinion of the product I purchased here on Amazon. Reviews posted in exchange for goods or money skew the entire system of customer reviews, and I am against them.)
 I think "hate" is too strong a word.  The issue is that this just was not a good scale.  I bought this for my buddy and I to measure out ingredients to make beer.  Yeah well, this scale doubled the amount of time everything took because the only thing consistent about it was how inaccurate it was.  We'd weigh something, tare it, re-add the item to double check and the scale gave a totally different reading.  We would add a container, tare it and then slowly add (malts, hops, etc.) stuff to the container and the weight wouldn't change until suddenly the number would jump around, far exceeding our target weight.  I'm sure a lot of other customers had a good experience with this style scale and that's great, but this scale did not do what we needed it to do and it made for a frustrating experience.  I would very much like to return this product.
 OK- so I purchased this scale for coffee pour-overs. My main concerns when looking for the right digital scale is the following<br/>-Accuracy- This scale proved to be extremely accurate within .05G differences on weights above 15G. Below 15G I found the scale to be off with a flux of 1-2G. For me this is ok, as 1 cup of coffee is about 25G of ground coffee. 4 stars for accuracy.<br/>-Aesthetics- Black and Stainless with a bright LCD backlight. Looks good in my kitchen and in the office (I bought 2) 5 Stars here<br/>-Ease of Use- One button function. Easy peezie- 5 stars for ease of use<br/>-Duration stays on- This is a big one for my coffee peeps. The screen stays lit for 10 seconds and the scale shuts off after 60 seconds, personally if I am brewing a large batch I like to let it bloom for 90 seconds. To keep the scale from "going to sleep" I find myself tapping the scale several times during the bloom in order not to lose my reading. -3 stars for duration on on.-<br/>Overall I recommend this scale whether for coffee, portion control or... whatever else you need to "measure" HA!
 My scale is 7 days old today. Worked great until tonight. Suddenly measurements are extremely inaccurate. I've tared scale and swapped batteries. Still measures up to 5 oz with nothing on the scale. Would not purchase again.<br/>UPDATE:<br/>Etekcity replaced my faulty scale. No problems since. Thank you Etekcity.
 Got this for my wife for Christmas as she has the old old scholl spring scale that only weighs 2 lbs. This is great small size, height is 1/2 inch or less, nice display but you need to be inlinw with it, so if you have something big taking up the scale and over the display some, its hard to impossible to read display on an angle. Very accurate, we weighed 5 bananas individually, then all at one time, it came to less than one once difference so Im impressed. It would have gotten 5 stars, I took 1 off because you are to beleive its a SStop but its flimsy plastic made to look like steel. Took another of because it s a soft top and scratches super easy, we put a plastic  milk jug half filled on it and rotated it and lifted it up a bit while doing so, it left circular scratches that wont buff out , they look terrible. Its not sitting out and is nearly always stored away but a plastic milk jug should not be able to put deep scratches in the top. I would have gladdly paid more for a thin metal top as its easier to clean, stronger but you are able to sanitizes steel or tin but its not so eash to sanitize soft plastic, if this breaks down Ill be looking for a metal top scale. You also need to use it on a hard surface of the readout will be wrong.
 The product is awesome, easy to us and relatively slim and light. Scale is also easy to clean and customer service is top notch. They stand by their product as they help me immediately solve the little problem I initially had with the scale. Scale is also accurate and consistent. I would recommend placing the item to weigh at the center of the scale. However, placing what you want to weigh even at the sides gives you the same result. Thus, scale is really sensitive.
 Bought on October 10.  About a month later it started randomly having error messages and not coming on. Changed out the batteries it came with with brand new ones. Now when you press on, it’s a mystery what you will get: (a) an imbalance message; (b) rapidly randomly flashing numbers that you can’t stop; (c) a blank screen. Or it just won’t come on, which is more often. VERY frustrating when you have all your ingredients out and are about to make a ciabatta ferment from a European recipe. Even more frustrating when the item is only 2 months old and the “product support website” given by amazon leads you to a 404error message. Not a happy customer.
 <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Etekcity-Digital-Multifunction-Food-Kitchen-Scale-Stainless-Steel-11lb-5kg-Silver/dp/B0113UZJE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Etekcity Digital Multifunction Food Kitchen Scale,Stainless Steel,11lb 5kg, Silver</a><br/>This scale is great as far as working for its intended purpose as a food scale. The stainless steal looks nice on my counter and the light up display is easy to read. The functions to change between lbs, grams, etc. offers more options than my last food scale which broke.<br/>The only complaints I have are that the display disappears too quickly and i have to "wake it up" when i leave things sitting on it because i'm still adding stuff. Another complain is the batteries that came with the scale were no good and kept slipping out of place so the scale didn't work. I just replaced them with regular Duracell AAA batteries and it was fine after that.<br/><br/>I currently live in Guam temporarily and this product got "lost in the mail" and I didn't receive it for over a month. Long delivery times are the norm because of living in Guam, but this took even longer. I contacted Amazon telling them that the "track your package" said "lost in the mail" and they immediately refunded me the full amount. 2 days later, the scale finally arrived. I contacted them and told them to recharge my card because it arrived and they did. The whole process was pretty seamless considering it was USPS' fault.
 ***UPDATE***<br/>Etekcity contacted me shortly after I posted this review and offered to replace the malfunctioning scale no questions asked. I was informed that there is a 1 year warranty on the device and that they were willing to even go as far as refunding me in full. I asked for a replacement scale and believe that they will be sending that out to me asap. Great customer service on Etekcitys behalf! If the new scale works without issue, I will further update my review. Thanks Etekcity!<br/><br/>Worked great for the first few days, very accurate. After about 3 days I had to view the LCD at a sharp angle to read the numbers, and I didn't really think any more of it. Today I got it back out after it sitting idle for a couple weeks, and the LCD backlight came on but I could not read the digits from any angle. I tried 2 sets of new batteries and got the same results. I have owned this for just a few days shy of 2 months and it is no longer functioning.
 Update 2/2/2018: Etekcity customer service contacted me on their own and sent me another unit that works great. Thx Rose, my confidence is restored. Changing review to 5*<br/><br/>product arrived on time but was not packaged good inside the box. Had fingerprints all over, the sticker on back of scale wrinkled. But what really upset me is the scale is wobbly no matter how I place it, it's uneven which makes measurements inaccurate and could spill the measured product. I expected more from Etekcity as in general I like their products and quality and own several of their electronics, this was a 1st for me.
 First time it happened I blamed it on myself for leaving the scale on, but after replacing the battery and putting new ones I noticed again a few weeks later that the batteries were completely drained and the scale was not turning on. It is very unreliable and can not return since it is passed one month period.
 I tested the accuracy by placing a dime on it and it registered 3 grams, which is a bit on the high side, since the TheUSMint.gov says the current dimes in production weigh 2.268 grams.  Once I put a different dime on it and it registered 2 grams.  2 grams is a rare reading and the lightest it reads appears to be 3 grams (shows 0 g when dime is on the scale).  Does not appear to be sensitive to anything below 2 grams.<br/><br/>I placed 2 dimes on it and got two different readings (4 g and 5 g), which is pretty accurate, since two circulated dimes should weigh almost exactly 5 grams.<br/><br/>I'm not weighing fine powdered substances, such as drugs, so I'm okay with it not being sensitive for ultra-light weight stuff below 2 grams.  If I was, I'd be looking into a scientific scale.<br/><br/>It works fine for weighing letters to make sure they weigh 1 oz or less.  Over 1 oz. requires an additional ounce stamp.  I tend to put extra stamps to make sure important mail gets delivered.  This scale should save me money but not over-paying for postage.<br/><br/>This scale could work as a postal scale if you place a light but sturdy square block of some kind on the scale (such as a yoga block) and tare the wt and place the package on top of the block weight.  This way you can see the LCD display without the box blocking your view.<br/><br/>Tip: This scale needs to be placed on a very leveled surface for accurate readings.<br/><br/>I would have given this 5 stars if it could weigh 1 gram items.
 I purchased this item March of 2018.  The unit had been performing very nicely until about one month ago when the display started to, well, not display, at least not clearly.  At first I thought it was the batteries, so I replaced them. No.  The batteries were fine.  The numbers do not show completely.  The grams, ounces, pounds feature was and IS a very nice one.  Now, I cannot tell what unit of measure is being calculated.  I love the look of it.  Sleek, shiny, very compact and light.  However, if I cannot use this as intended, it is now a very chic paperweight.  I will be contacting the company on Monday.  The company is open Monday through Friday from 9 to 5 PST.  There is a one year warranty on the unit.  I am hoping to see what might come of this.  I shall update in any case.  I am hoping this was just a faulty unit.<br/><br/>Once again, LOVE the look, the style, the size, the weighing options, the battery life and the light weight.  The only negative thing, and it's a big negative, is the faulty display.  Other than that, I would give this a higher rating.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading.<br/><br/>**Update 07 March 2019**<br/>I was in contact with the company and explained the situation.  I have to say that the company ETEKCITY was very, very accomodating and understanding.  After I provided them with the information they requested, they very efficiently and expeditiously sent out a replacement unit.  This unit, so far, is working quite well..  I am more impressed with the company.  The company representatives were very, very pleasant.  Barring the very small hiccups regarding some product confusion, they did their best to make the entire return/exchange process as painless as possible and, for that, I thank them very much.  As of today, I would purchase more products from this company.  I thank ETEKCITY very much for all of their help in solving my issue.
 It is not working at all now. I changed batteries and that isn't the the problem. I have an error msg on screen.  From day 1 it was not accurate. For example if I was trying to weigh 5 oz , but got 5.4 oz I took a portion off the scale it still reads 5.4 oz. So I  take off a tiny bit more and it reads 4.1 oz. So I add on trying to get it to 5 oz. Add back all I had on in the first place and it reads 5 oz. What?! Oh, and just forget about grams!  Yeah... it doesn't weigh correctly.
 This scale looks great, is thin enough to stay with the cutting boards and easy to use.  I'm trying to lose weight so I'm weighting everything and this scale is perfect.  I set a small bowl on it then zero out the weight of the bowl and off I go 2 ounces of grapes. The other great feature is the changing of ounces to grams my Good Thin crackers has a serving at 30 gr and with a push of the button OZ becomes GR.  Now I know some reviews check that the weight is correct but I didn't do that I feel it's a scale and should work as a scale. I'm ordering another one as a gift for a friend
 Piece of junk out of the box. I bought this to accuratly measure coffee for my espresso machine (my machine works best at 14.5 g or approx. .5 oz). Worked OK first time, but the second time it would not respond as I added coffee to the filter basket (stayed at zero). I tried it again two more times with the same result (stays at zero). It's either defective or this scale does not respond to small weight / weight changes.<br/>BTW... This does scale only reads grams in full 1 gram increments. It does however, read ounces in fractions... makes no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>UPDATE July 16, 2018...<br/>Etekcity contacted me saying they have an improved model and sent one for evaluation. Sorry, but this is no better that the one I bought last year. I measured out some coffee, the sale read 14g... I removed the coffee from the scale, put it back on the scale, the scaled read 12g! I did this several times, same inconsistent result. I also tried my 100g calibrated weight... The scale read 99g, second try read 98g... Need I go on?<br/>I appreciate Etekcity for trying to make things right - thank you. BTW I have one of their electronic bathroom scales - love it - work great!
 I bought this scale to measure some of the food I was eating while on my calorie deficit diet.  It works great.....I love that I can add any container on it and it tares easily.  The scale is easy to read and easy to manipulate into grams/oz/lbs etc. Its kindof a no-brainer tool that I leave on the kitchen counter. I used it over Christmas to weigh my meals and it really helped in my calorie calculations.  I use myfitnesspal and if you are serious about counting calories you should consider investing in a food scale of some sorts...otherwise you're eyeballing it.  I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I had been under-estimating my weights for some of my favourite foods :-). This scale was priced right....I've tried Etekcity products in the past and I've always been satisfied.  I didn't really care what it looks like as long as it did what it was supposed to.....this one looks good so thats a bonus.
 This is the scale you want if you're looking for an all-around best compact, sleek, basic food scale. What sets it apart from the myriad other scales on Amazon? It does the same thing as all the others, at roughly the same price (a couple bucks cheaper, which is great) and includes batteries, and AAA's at that, rather than the expensive and hard-to-find CR2032's etc. that some scales use, which is a plus.<br/><br/>The reason you want this is its overall attention to the small details. It's super thin; I literally just stick it in my kitchen drawer on top of the ziplock bags and it fits unassumingly right in there. It's got a uniform, stainless steel surface, which just makes it look and feel good plus minimizes the effort put into cleaning it. Backlit display is nice. Auto-off feature is essential; if your hands are dirty and occupied when cooking, it sucks having to hit a button to save battery - just leave this one be and it goes back to sleep like a good little scale. And finally, it does the standard g/oz/lboz but also does mL, which I haven't used but can see coming in very useful. (assuming your liquid is roughly the same density as water)<br/><br/>Great scale. This is the only one you need. Forget about the ugly and less-functional scales on the front page. This does the job quick and simply and doesn't break a sweat.
 I have purchased several Etekcity products through Amazon, including two (2) of these Digital Kitchen Scales - one of which I kept and the other was a Xmas gift. This Kitchen Scale is remarkably well-engineered and accurate (100% Test/Retest Reliability) - even with something as small as a plastic water bottle cap!  I would highly recommend this scale for any application that requires precise measurement of weight - especially for those of us on strict portion-controlled meals to regulate blood sugar, lose weight and/or any other "intake" malady. The TARE function is extremely useful and is remarkable that the Etekcity Design Engineers had the forethought to include this functionality in the device.  Etekcity also "goes above and beyond" by including pre-installed batteries with their devices - which are insulated with a plastic strip to maintain shelf-life (charge). Again, their forethought is of the highest caliber.  Nice Work, Etekcity!
 I received this scale the other day and was pleased with it.  I so far haven't used it extensively but I plan to use it for baking and for weighing food to control portion sizes.  It is incredibly lightweight and not exceedingly sensitive, but it certainly works for my purposes.  However, I was prompted to write this review when I received an email from Etekcity customer service asking how I liked my purchase, listing some of the FAQ's and offering assistance if I needed it.  I can't think of ANY product I've ever purchased where this happened, regardless of price, use, etc.  Anyway, if you're looking for a basic scale for normal baking and food weighing needs, I think this will meet your needs.
 **Update #2<br/>I received the replacement quickly, and have changed my review to 5 stars! Now that it's working, I can see that it's exactly what I was looking for. It's extremely light weight, and it stays surprisingly accurate after multiple uses with varying weights. It is strong enough to weigh everything for food prep, and I even checked it by building bowl tower (because why not?). My stacking skills ended before the scale's weighing capabilities. Great product, especially for the price. I highly recommend!<br/>*Update*<br/>After my feedback, I immediately received a message from the seller apologizing for the inconvenience and offering help with my device. He said that not moving the scale to a flat surface immediately after installing the batteries could cause the error I was seeing. Unfortunately, this wasn't my problem, but when I responded with that he told me a new scale would be on its way to me as soon as possible. I look forward to getting my new scale in the mail, and when I do I'll update my review again!<br/><br/>The scale was not working when I received it. It only reads "unSE" on the display. After some digging online, I decided to replace the batteries to see if that would fix it. I did that, and it still had the same problem. I tried to return the package, and the window to return had already closed. Now I'm stuck with a nonworking product.
 Using a 500g calibrated weight, this scaled read 496, then 497, then 496, then 497...you get the idea.  It was probably a fraction between the two whole numbers.  I set a tare and reweighed with the same weight and got the same reading. My older Escali scale read 500g dead on, and my new pocket scale (because you never know when you'll have to weigh something when you're out) read 500.1.  I didn't totally flunk this scale as far as rating it because it is nice, thin, and easy to clean.  Since I know it displays a lighter weight, I will just allow for it until I can figure out how to calibrate the scale, which is not the same as setting a tare (as some have previously said).
 We bought this scale in Feb 2017 &amp; used it several times a week with no problems.  Last week it started acting strange (like fluctuating the weight readout on numerous foods without anything being touched) &amp; giving a general error message.  I changed the batteries hoping that would help, but the problems persisted until finally only the error message would display.  This scale only lasted 7 months with careful use, so I definitely do not recommend it.  Now to find another brand.
 I've been looking for a scale to weigh meat and other such items for my freezer meals. It's kind of difficult to eyeball a pound of chicken. This scale weighs in ounces, grams, and pounds. The scale is small, thin, and unobtrusive. The whole thing is 7.1 x 5.5 inches so the part you put the food on seems kind of small but I haven't had any issues with that. I'd rather have this smaller size than something that is huge and hard to store.<br/><br/>It has a lighted display which I like and the "tare" feature which allows you to put a bowl or container on it then zero it out to only weigh the food. Obviously when you are weighing things you don't want the weight of the container included, so this is a good feature!<br/>This scale would also be great for those who are watching their food intake as it makes it fairly convenient to find out exactly how much food you are eating...and believe me, it's usually more than you think!<br/><br/>This may sound ridiculous but I was excited that it came with the batteries to use it. If you are anything like me, batteries disappear quickly in your house (remotes, gadgets, clocks, THIN AIR) so this was one thing I didn't have to worry about finding before I used it.<br/><br/>All in all this is a great little scale at a very good price!
 So first off, this is physically awesome and feels great.  I do feel like the screen times out too quickly.  There's a chance I got a weird one, but mine won't update as I add small amounts of weight to it, and I have to tap it to get it to start thinking again — even seconds after adding something!  It also kept thinking between 21 ounces and 24, which is ridiculous (if I had been between 21 and 22, I could understand, but between 21 and 24???).  The lag makes this incredibly difficult to use for measuring resin.
 Due to prior reviews Purchased this upgraded one. It does stay lit while I add food to empty dish to get correct ounces.<br/>So far it has worked great!
 Nice, inexpensive, easy to use scale. Some reviews have complained about the backlighting being hard to read and that the auto shut off seems inadequately short, I have not even noticed these things, the lighting (brightness and contrast) is perfectly fine and the amount of time the scale stays on without any further stimulus has never posed a problem, even when having to slice some chicken to add to a pile already on the scale. One trick I have found is that if you need to use a container and are thinking of using the tare function, if you use one of those small deli containers (like you'd get potato salad in) it weighs almost nothing so even if the scale did go off in the middle of a weighing you just pull off the container, hit the button again and you're on your way without having to empty the container. I leave this on my counter at all times, it's size is not a problem even in a relatively small galley kitchen such as mine, although I will admit that I don't live in a world where my kitchen counters are all cleared off :D I prefer things ready and available. Enjoy!
 It works fine for larger weights where a little imprecision is acceptable (if you're weighing a pound of ground beef, etc.), but i use this for home brewing and I need something that can weigh more precisely. I use it to weigh hop and water additions - and while at times it can get you "close enough" it's not accurate. I can try to get 0.50 oz. and it'll ready 0.49. I'll add 2-3 more hop pellets and it'll stay the same. I'll 2-3 more and it'll jump to 0.53 oz. I'll take 4 off and i'll stay the same, etc.  I'll take my cup (weight) off the scale, give it a shake and put it back on and it will read 0.55 oz.<br/><br/>And it's inability to read smaller than 4g is difficult too when working with small doses of water additives.<br/><br/>Like I said, if using for larger quantities where you can be fine with being off a bit go for it! It still gets 3 stars from me, but it's not great for smaller quantities.
 This only gets a 1 star from me because the lighted weight goes dim way to quickly for me.  I place my empty bowl on the scale, clear the weight so I can have an actual weight of what I’m putting in my bowl (minus bowl weight). By the time I put my dogs raw food in there and walk away to get something else to put in the bowl it weight amount goes dim and then when I try and tap on it it resets itself, I think, I don’t know. I’ve had it for several months now, using it twice a day and still haven’t figured it out.<br/>Unless you are very focused and have everything you need to put on the scale immediately I would not recommend this scale.<br/>Plus side, light weight, easy to clean and just the right size I needed. Too bad the main function doesn’t accommodate my needs.
 I've been considering getting a kitchen scale for awhile, and the price on this model was too good to pass up. I have done a little bit of testing on its accuracy and whether it gives the same weight for a specific item each time (e.g., an unopened can of soup) for a week. I can't find fault with wither the accuracy and reliability, which is great!<br/><br/>The scale is fine for my needs at this time, but the surface area might be a bit small for those who need to weigh larger portions or use a scale more often than I do. For example, a medium-sized plate covers the controls and window, so you may need a bit of practice to do the weighing before the scale turns off. But I knew what I was getting from other reviews and the product description, so I am not disappointed: I bought an accurate scale at a great price that is less than ideal. I'll spend more when I need "ideal."
 I found myself needing a small scale more often than expected - for weighing outgoing mail, portions, or for being curious if something I bought was correctly weighted by the manufacturer. This scale has served me well so far. The reason I am docking it a star is for the following:<br/>1) The buttons are part of the balance - meaning that if you are switching between display units, the readout will jump all over the place, since the weight of the (surprising amount) of force you have to apply to the button adjusts the scale's readout.<br/>2) Pretty crummy viewing angle on the display. I'm tall, and have to lean directly over the read-out to get a clear display. I imagine if you are short you'd be irritated by having to stare straight down at the unit (assuming it's resting on a countertop) to get an easily readable display.
 Have purchased Etekcity  products in the past. Never a problem. This small scale is exactly what I needed for rare occasions. Once in awhile, a recipie will call for a certain amount of ounces of something. I have to wing it. That is the past, as I can use this scale. Has nice tariff feature as well. Lighted LCD with easy to read numbers and auto shutoff of light and unit. All for 10 bucks! Nice stainless flat top. Bear in mind this is a small unit so don't expect to weigh a 20lb turkey on it. Small bowls or measuring cups, etc. Purchased 2 bags of coffee on Amazon. One had reviews that item was only 11oz not 16 (1lb). Both bags when each was placed on scale read 1lb 5oz (which included the bag). Very nice product
 I wrote a negative review previously, as this scale only lasted 3 months under my very active conditions. I used it for measuring materials for my products, and used it often.  Though I am still unhappy about having to buy another new scale so soon, I am very happy with Etekcity's customer service.  They reached out and cotreated my problem. Bravo to them!<br/><br/>Previous review:<br/><br/>I bought this scale 3 months ago, and it's already broken and unusable.  I am not entirely sure what happened to it, but I cannot get it to turn on except by taking out the batteries and putting them back in.  And I can't get it to tare.  It makes it quite difficult to measure my ingredients to make product!  Not only that, but from day one, it never accurately registered anything under .2 oz, which I bought the scale for the hundredths place accuracy, so that was a letdown.  It also seems to jump from certain numbers (like it would go from 1.48 to 1.52 without hitting anything in the middle ever).
 Accurate, easy to use, and nicely priced. This scale checks all the boxes when it comes to what I wanted.<br/><br/>Simple to use, it can easily be zeroed with bowls and measuring cups on it, in order to get accurate readings on anything you measure. Switching units is quick and easy and it offers a wide range of the most common units of measurement you could want.<br/><br/>The scale is light and low-profile, so it fits in any kitchen drawer with ease. Turn-on time is quick, though it would be nice if it waited a bit longer before powering off itself (it can also be powered off manually if you don't want to wait the few seconds for the auto-off to kick in).<br/><br/>Overall it's a great scale that does most everything you could want around the kitchen. While it may not support really heavy weights, it'll meet the needs of 99% of us as we cook up something tasty for ourselves and the family. I highly recommend getting one for your own kitchen.
 I am diabetic, so measuring my food is extremely important to me.  All others I have had in the past were almost useless.<br/>The mechanical ones, the scale was either too big or too small and VERY inaccurate.<br/>All of the electronic ones were hard to use.  If you try to push a button, it changed the weight and the scale would think I was wanting to weigh something (not turn on/off or change a setting).<br/><br/>On this one, the buttons are on top, but sectioned off from the scale, so you can do what ever you want in a instant.<br/>This is so easy to use and reads perfectly.  It is a game changer!!!<br/><br/>Easy to clean, easy to use, can handle any reasonable weight - what else can you ask for?
 This is a decent scale, if you don't take seriously its claim to measure to a hundredth of an ounce. (It actually jumps four hundredths at a time, and it's not exactly consistent about where it lands.) The big problem comes if you have a large bowl or plate to weigh. The dish will cover the display! And even if it doesn't actually cover it, you still can't read the LCD display at much of an angle. (My solution is to place an upside-down yogurt container on the scale and tare it, then put the dish on top of that. But it's a hassle, and not particularly safe.) The upshot is, buy this only if you're sure you won't be weighing anything large.
 I use this scale mostly to measure out hops, sugars and water chemicals for home brewing. It is not accurate (ever) or even consistent. For example, if I measure out 5 U.S. quarters, I should get 1oz.  Instead it displays .98oz(sometimes .95 others). 1 quarter = 5g but 2 quarters = 11g.  I don't trust this scale for precise measurements but only ballpark.  On the positive side it is a nice design and fits neatly in my kitchen drawer.  If you're looking for accuracy, look elsewhere.
 I gave this 5 stars because of value for money, not because it is the perfect scale.  It is a great kitchen scale and it's compact size give it advantage in the "putting away/storing" category.  I love the ability to change units on the top of the scale (my last scale had this feature on the bottom and it was a nuisance).  The tare function works very well and it doesn't take long to establish (so long as you aren't moving things on/off the scale).  The only real challenge I have encountered is that I often plate my food and measure as I go (using tare to reset after each ingredient is added).  The issue is that even my smallest plates don't fit without covering the display.  It's a compromise of the size which again works great for storing.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Nice easy to read display<br/>- Auto-power off (dims first, then turns off)<br/>- Relatively good looking (it's not Williams Sonoma, but its under $20)<br/>- Compact size for storage<br/>- Easy to use Tare function<br/>- Low price<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Compact size for measuring items on a plate<br/>- Feels a little cheap in your hand (remember it is priced this way)<br/><br/>Again, overall for the price, this can't be beat.  This replaced a much more expensive scale which I had many more complaints about.
 I bought this to measure the weight of yarn skeins to estimate how much was left.  It works great for that purpose, but I've also found lots of other uses like weighing thick envelopes to see how many extra stamps they need, and of course it's come in handy as a kitchen scale.  It doesn't take up much space and I haven't needed to change the batteries after many months, though I don't use it daily.  The most useful feature, is being able to set a tare weight so I can measure things like flour or dry pasta without including the container.  I haven't had it long enough to comment on durability, but it seems to be made of sturdy stuff.  The instructions that came with it were adequate.
 Dropped my old scale so needed a new one and decided to try this one. It works well overall...I just have a few minor complaints.<br/><br/>- I don't like having to hold the power button for 2 seconds to turn it off. My old scale was just push to turn off without holding.<br/>- It only registers weight of at least 3g...my old scale registered any weight, even 1g. This may not seem like a lot, but with certain ingredients it could make a difference.<br/>- Sometimes the weight reading changes by a few grams. For example it'll tell me the weight of something...then I'll pick up the item and put it back down, or move it around on the scale, and the weight could change by a couple of grams. Not a big deal...more of a minor annoyance.
 The accuracy of this scale is not very good. I bought it mainly to weigh coffee for making espressos. The weight reading can drift. I use the tare function to zero out the weight of the filter basket before adding the coffee . The same filter basket will vary one or two grams in weight, and if I leave an item on the scale the weight can change by + or - 1 or 2 grams over time!. Soon after I bought the scale I wrote Etekcity about the problem and they thought something had gone wrong with the electronics so they sent me a new one. However, the new one is acting the same way. I even bought (through Amazon) a set of calibration weights in grams to test the scale and the readings are not on the spot with the calibration weights. I would not recommend this scale for someone that needs accuracy. On the other hand, I only have praises for the Etekcity Customer Service. They are top notch and responded quickly to my concern right after I bought the scale in February, and now. They aim to please the customer, and issued me a refund for the inconvenience.
 Good simple and inexpensive scale.  I got this to do baking, and some of my recipes are in grams, some in ounces.  This scale allows me to switch easily.  It also allows me to tare easily, so I can weigh multiple ingredients into a single recipient.  Less dishes to wash!  This is small and lightweight, but big enough that I can place large bowl on it and still see the display.<br/>The display is bright and easy to read.  The back-light does turn off after about twenty seconds, but as soon as the weight changes, it lights back up.
 This is a new, updated review to reflect a response from the seller:  I was originally very unhappy with the scale as I am used to using a very high end scale from a large company that sells expensive blenders; think demos at large warehouses, hundreds of dollars, starts with the letter "v", yeah you know the one. I love that scale because it measures in very small increments which is why I don't love the Etekcity scale. However, with that being said, that's a personal issue and not everyone cares to measure in increments smaller than a gram so, it will work for most people as you can see by all the rave reviews. If I had read the specifications on the scale, I would have known this prior to purchasing. I do use this scale for travel because it's very light weight and easy to pack. Plus, I will always have it as a backup in case my fancy scale every gives me any trouble.<br/>Regardless of my own personal frustrations, Etekcity's customer service took the time to reach out to me and apologized for the inconvenience (which was my fault, not theirs), addressed the reason for my frustration and offered to make it right. Having experienced their excellent customer service, I felt it was necessary to update my review. I'll purchase from a company that takes pride in their products and customer care any day.
 I bought this to weigh my food. It looks high quality and modern and is easy to wipe off spills. I like to put my plate on the scale, and then weigh the food as I fill my plate. My only complaints is that with my dinner plate on the scale, I have to try to view the display from an angle, and due to the backlighting (or whatever you call it) it's hard to read at an angle. So then I'm trying to angle my dinner plate and still balance it on the scales and get a good reading. Not a deal breaker though. I still like the scales.
 New review  based on new scale sent by Etekcity]: The new scale is great! The backlight of the display stays on much longer (20+ seconds) and the entire display does not shutoff prematurely (it stays on, I'd guess, for more than a few minutes). Etekcity went out of there way to contact me, apologize for the previous model, and I was sent a new scale. Much, much, happier now with the product as it can be used for its intended use: making coffee with a Chemex. Thank you Etekcity!! Great customer service; apparently a great company as well!!<br/><br/>Old review: The display shuts off after about 10-13 seconds (it first goes dim after 3-5 seconds). What a terrible, terrible, feature. I get that the manufacture is looking to save the battery/save power. However, this is an insane inconvenience especially for someone who uses this for a pour-over coffee/Chemex. Bummer.
 I wanted a compact size scale for travel. I own a larger size scale in this same brand and like it very much so I thought that this would be a safe bet.  I tried it out for a week but found that there were several issues with it, so I sent it back.  The machine turns off too soon was my main complaint, so I had to start over with my calculations right in the middle of weighing my food. Secondly, when you put a plate on the scale it totally covers up the window display.  It was a nice compact size, and it has a nice look about it.  Also I did like the digital display as it was very bright and easy to read.
 Update 5/9::<br/>Etekcity reached out to me regarding the issue and sent me a replacement. I've been using it since then and it's a great scale. Right on point with the measurements and I really like the options for selecting different metrics. I use it almost daily.<br/>I'm very impressed with the sellers customer service. I would most definitely purchase from them again.<br/><br/>Not an accurate scale!! Was frustrated to find that this scale was off. I reset it multiple times and used it on various flat surfaces (dining room table, kitchen counters, etc). Some times it was right on, and other times it weighed slightly under.<br/>Overall this scale is unreliable and therefore useless .. I recommend this scale for those who are looking for a rough estimate.
 This is an updated review for this product.<br/><br/>On my initial order there was an issue with the unit where it'd drain the batteries while in 'off' mode, but customer service was quick to send me a replacement. Now unfortunately the replacement was a different, slightly bigger, model<br/>(EK6212) but I can say that the original worked just fine (I'd pop out the batteries and pop them back in during use). I've used the replacement model as well for the past few days and it's working wonderfully.<br/><br/>Really nice scales and I love how easy they are to clean.
 Use tare function, just hit on/off button, add 1 oz. BAM...(accurate to 0.01 oz. weight,).<br/>Now, I haven't had (shall remain nameless or they will erase this review)  to weigh this year, but someone wants, (gots) to know, will it weigh 1 gram?<br/>I put a Sweet &amp; Low packet (weighs 1 gr.) on there, Nothin', put two on there, Nothin', but 3 showed 3 grams weight, so there you go folks.  Mine was on one of those 44 minutes left to buy at $10.00 specials and they even give you FANTASTIC batteries, better than alkaline.<br/>If this helps you, you should check the helped me out button, just kidding, have a good coffee.<br/>Edit the following day,<br/>they give you a business card with  ...] home page and they will send you FREE products to demo/ test ride.  I applied (I know that part sux) for the water test quality kit, no not a ph meter, but tells you accurately any? contaminents in a sample (standing) water .<br/>Guess it's a new product and we all know what happened in Flint, MI.
 this thing weighs my food. and anything else i want to weigh. unless its too big. then i dont use this to weigh it.<br/><br/>dont weigh super big stuff on this thing.<br/><br/>weigh stuff like: a cup of rice. a bowl of cereal. a scoop of protein powder. a dash or two of paprika. a container of onions. a cup of onions. a whole onion. a slice of bread with the crusts cut off. a scoop of peanut butter. a bowl of frozen broccoli. water for some reason. your hand. pocket change. a baby kitten. 2 baby kittens. your special coconut sauce for lunch.<br/><br/>do not weigh: a dog. a gallon of milk. a bowling ball. yourself. a single strand of spaghetti. sauce that is not held in a container. stuff that is already labeled with the weight. your girlfriend while you shake your head disapprovingly. air. your self worth. pros and cons of said scale.
 This Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale is a nifty item that does what it says it does.  With a sleek modernistic design, it fits in nicely into any kitchen inventory.  Powered by two AAA sized batteries (included courtesy of the producer, thumbs up for that!), the neat LCD light up screen further adds on to its aesthetic appeal.  I have not had this product for long, but the timer function does help out with conserving battery power should I forget to turn it off.  Moreover, I appreciate the simple two button design to tare and change measurement scales, its low profile and makes a clicking sound to confirm you have indeed pressed it.  A simple feature, but nonetheless well done.  Being a kitchen device, don't expect to measure items that are less than one gram.  If you desire to, then this product is not the one you want (talking to you science egg heads, haha).  However, for those simply wanting to portion out foods, ingredients, or whatever other small object you wish to measure out it sets out to do its goal quite nicely.  Again, revisiting the sleek design of the scale, it should be mentioned that its sheen surface makes its easy to clean should it get dirty.  Additionally, its compact size in terms of depth (that of a small children's book; a little more or less than half an inch) as well the surface (no bigger than a small notepad) allows for effective storage.  Lastly, the $12 US dollar price tag at which this product is offered is great for what it does.<br/><br/>Probably the only grip about this item is the short light up timer.  While effective in highlighting the numbers, the 20 second timer is much too short for those who need longer than 20 seconds (coffee people reviews, *cough*).  However, it should be noted that the scale still measures out whatever item is on its scale until whatever is on there is removed or the scale remains inactive (just a tad hard to see).  That being said, the light interface turning off may (pardon the pun) potentially turn some customers off.  One could make an argument that this is a design flaw; however, this maybe for the conservation of power as to not kill the battery quickly.<br/><br/>For the TL;DR people, here's a simple list of pros:<br/><br/>Pros<br/>- Small compact design for effective storage<br/>- Sheen surface allows for quick cleaning<br/>- Digital readout is clear and lights up<br/>- From what I can tell is quite accurate in measurements (NOTE: does not measure items less than 1 gram)<br/>- Simple two button design supports taring function and changes in measurement (grams, lbs, etc)<br/>- Comes with AAA (x2) batteries, and the device is not a power hog<br/>- For the low price of what it does, its a great buy!<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- If you're the person that's picky about things less than 1 gram, this device is not for you<br/>- Depending on the customer the 20 seconds of light may not be enough time for desired use<br/>- For it size, some may find it difficult to measure wide items (such as plates) as the object itself will most likely obstruct your view of the interface<br/><br/>All in all, this product does what it says it does.  Small, sleek, efficient and simple.  Get those things right and its really hard to call this product defective (unless you get a lemon! Haha).  I would highly recommend this scale for those who just want a scale that works, but also looks cool sitting on your kitchen counter.  My final rating leaves it at 5 stars, otherwise my only gripe is the light timer issue (maybe rather than have it on the whole time responds when the weight changes significantly?).
 Scale will no longer zero out. I put brand name batteries in and still doesn't work. You would have thought the product would have lasted at least a year!?<br/><br/>CUSTOMER SERVICE gets 5 Stars!!! My scale suddenly stopped working and after contacting Amazon and the Supplier, I received a new one.<br/><br/>So far working like a charm, if this one lasts I would upgrade my rating to a 5
 Though I used it only once (and will again today), I LOVE it!!! I have another one, non electronic, bought about 35 years ago and failed miserably<br/>several weeks ago when I used it to make bread with a new recipe. It was so bad that I decided to buy a new one, namely the Etekcity Digital Multifunction Food Kitchen Scale. When it arrived, I used it the following day. The instructions were well written and the scale easy to use. The four ingredients that went into the bread were weighed exactly as the the recipe indicated. LOVE the "tare" feature since weighing ingredients was so much easier and quicker! My husband said that the bread was the BEST I had ever baked out of thousands the past 50+ years! I anticipate the same results from now on because of my new scale.
 My day job is in a clinical lab - I measure stuff and take pride in my accuracy.  I got this for kitchen use and expected marginal accuracy.  I was very surprised at ease of use, durability and above all - accuracy.  I have access to NBS traceable standards and decided to check this out (at the lab) when I got it.  Ended up showing it off to my colleagues.<br/>I make the best pour-over coffee you can get...and my secret is perfect ratios of water and coffee, combined in a reproducible manner...using this scale.  I laugh every time - starts my day perfectly.
 This works but the older model is slightly better. If you’re putting a plate on this it can cover the screen as the angle of the lcd is just not well thought out. Changing the setting from oz to grams is also not well thought out. You have to click a button on the bottom of the device.<br/><br/>The older model did not have these issues. It also came with a bowl where this one did not.<br/><br/>I will say that mine came with a second set of batteries. I know some other reviews mentioned not having it included so I thought I’d mention that mine did.
 Scale was great when I got it but batteries died after a handful of uses.  New batteries did not wake it back up.  Too cheap to bother dealing with returning it or trying to get it warranted.  But it was really useful / easy to use while it lasted.<br/><br/>Update 3/10/2019: so this just happened. Etekcity reached out over a year after I purchased the scale and offered to replace it free of charge because of the battery issue which they read about in this review. I had long forgotten about the old scale. Got the new one in last week and it’s nice - better than the amazon basics brand I’ve been using because the Etekcity one has a larger, easier to read display. Hopefully this one won’t have the battery issues. Thanks Etekcity. Changed stars from 3 to 5.
 Previously I had this specific kitchen scale for a few years but after a recent move it's gone missing, might have left it behind or it's in a box I have in storage.<br/><br/>I buy ground beef in bulk at Costco and I also buy cooked turkey breasts and boneless hams at Costco to slice and package for lunch meat, which are much healthier and considerably cheaper than pre-sliced lunch meats.<br/><br/>I vacuum seal the ground beef in 1# packages for the freezer and use an electric slicer to the turkey and ham then package that in 1/2 pound packages to freeze.  This scale takes the guesswork out of figuring out how much to put into each package.<br/><br/>The readout is clear and bright, it's very easy to switch between grams, ounces and pounds or switch to metric measurements if you want.  I've even used it to weigh envelopes or smaller packages for mailing.  It's easy to keep clean and storage is a breeze.  The unit can be turned off manually or it will turn itself off after a period of time of non use.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this product.
 I dropped my old digital scale and had to buy a new one. This one looked stylish (always a plus) and easy to use so I bought it. It came in two or three days and when I opened the package I was pleasantly surprised to see a clearly written manual. The scale is even easier to use than my old scale and measures in oz/gr/ml/pounds and is accurate to 1 gram or .01 oz. Accuracy is important to me because I do a lot of baking and as a trained chef go by weight not volume. I gave the accuracy a run for the money and weighed the warranty card, then added the manual, and then the product invitation card, all in grams....it didn't miss a beat and measured easily and quickly to 1 gram. I like it already. Price was a factor in my purchase and this one was only +/- $13.00 so at this price I'm hoping it's durable.
 I wanted a little kitchen scale for the occasional recipe that called for ingredients by weight as opposed to measured by cup, teaspoon, etc.  Looked at the store first and found scales that weren't as nice and cost twice as much or more.  This is the first kitchen scale I have owned, and I am surprised how often I grab it and use it!  I measure quite often for recipes or for tracking calories and nutrition on an app I use.  I would say I use it nearly every day.  The scale seems to perform quite well and accurately.  It is extremely simple to use which is great, I was a little concerned it would be difficult, but one button turns it on or "tares" it.  The other button simply changes the units of measurement.  The only issue I have had is when I sometimes add a very small amount to the scale it doesn't seem to register at first, but this is only for things smaller than a quarter or a cashew, which for my use is plenty accurate.  Very pleased with this purchase and the great price.
 This brand name sells the EK6015 under two different ASINs on Amazon.  This one, and also B07FWSZ56T.  The biggest difference is the B07FWSZ56T ASIN has the milk/water measurements, which I did not want.  I specifically purchased this ASIN because the advertised units are "g/ oz./ lb(oz.)/ ml," whereas the B07FWSZ56T ASIN advertises the units as "oz / lb(oz.) / g / ml(milk&amp;water)."  Both ASINs have the same manufacturer model number, EK6015!  And I received the one with the "oz / lb(oz.) / g / ml(milk&amp;water)" units!  I did not want this one!
 I needed a food scale in order to measure the ingredients for my baby's homemade goat milk formula. I found this on amazon and decided to go with this. I am happy with the purchase. Upon arrival the scale was packaged in a simple cardboard box with Styrofoam protecting the edges. Set-up was a breeze. I simply removed the plastic tab from the back to allow the battery to work with the device. This scale has a several measuring units. You can switch from ounces to grams and pounds and milliliters. This scale is easy-to-use and is now a part of my everyday usage.
 Finally bought a kitchen scale after thinking about it for a long time. Wasn't sure it would get a lot of use. I've had this for  less than a week and have already used it a ton. Sleek design, super easy to use, store and clean.<br/>I was pleasantly surprised by how many roasted chickpeas were in a full serving and did a more precise job of breaking the 4 lbs of ground beef purchased at a big box store into 1 lb portions to freeze. I've been using it enough that it's still on my counter and hasn't been tucked into a cabinet.
 The scale is quite small, measuring roughly 8" x 6". Its very light, so easy to move around to where ur cooking/measuring. The buttons are not the nicest, but have a good tactile feedback.. For some reason, I was under the impression they would be touch and was a tad disappointed that they were not. I like the fact that it has regular AAA batteries as opposed to the tiny cells in other such scales and the "faux" stainless steel look is nice too. Matches my appliances<br/>As I dont have any reference scale to compare the accuracy against, I just put a small plastic measuring cup on it. Hit the on button to tare back to 0. Then filled it with water till i hit the 40ml mark. The weight fluctuated a bit between 40 &amp; 41g before setting on 41. So about right with 2.5% error. Again, i was just spotting the 40ml mark with my eye, so it could have be closer to 41 ml. Which is pretty much all the accuracy I need, so keeping it. All in all, its about what you can expect from a sub-15$ scale.
 I was very excited to get my new scale, you see a scale is crucial to my food program. I had been using an old scale that would turn off after a very short time.  I used the scale for a couple of weeks when it just started to not be accurate. I would put something that I knew weighed 4oz and the scale showed much less. It is extremely important that my measurements are correct.  Then the scale died.  I replaced the batteries and it still would not turn on.  I left it alone upside down for awhile and it turned on, but when I tried to use it, it turned off and would not go on again. I've kept it because I have hope it will work again and I haven't gotten to the post office.  It also took some time to learn to use.  Sincerely,  Janice Nesson
 This scale was everything I wanted at a low price.  It easily fits into the drawer, has the tare button (which was a must), and can weigh items up to 11 pounds.  I buy in bulk and I'm working on losing weight - two things that having a good electronic scale comes in handy for.  My old WW scale was shot and it only measured up to one pound.  This one is just what I needed.  I did keep the old clear containers from me WW scale because of the small surface area it's easier to see the print out on the display.  This is something to keep in mind when looking to purchase this scale but wasn't a concern for me.  The small surface area is the trade off of having a small easy to store unit.  I may feel differently if I had more room to keep it.
 It was a good scale for Weight Watchers. However, it lasted less than 1-1/2 years. It died unexpectedly with an error code that wouldn't clear. The scale I used prior to this lasted 4 years.<br/><br/>Update June 2018<br/><br/>I am updating my review as requested multiple times by the vendor. Due to my 2 star review, the vendor reached out immediately and provided me with a new scale, even though it exceeded the 1 year standard warranty by 5 months. When I received the new scale, it came with a warranty card where if I register, I can get an extended warranty for free (total 2 year). I guess I missed that on the first one. I appreciate the fact the vendor provided this new scale, but I also feel the multiple emails asking me to update my review was a bit much. I only log in to do paperwork and write reviews once a month. As for the scale, I am upping my rating to 3 stars. I didn’t notice it with the old scale, as I do the new, but I find it hard to read the display until you are hovering right over it, which is hard to do when you have a larger plate on it and trying to view at an angle. Over all the scale works fine where utmost precisions isn’t necessary—fine for weighing food for Weight Watchers, but I wouldn’t use it to make soap.
 Great scale. What I especially like is you can put a plate on it, click it back to 0.00 and then put the food on the plate to get an accurate measure of the food only. Using the scale regularly, along with diet app, helped me lose 20 pounds. But, then I stopped tracking and gained the weight back. Sound familiar? Such is life.<br/><br/>Quick tip: Wrap some cling film tightly around it. You can use a blow dryer to shrink wrap the film. Doesn't effect the accuracy and keeps the unit in mint condition.
 What a cute, easy to use food and liquid scale. Had no idea when I purchased it that it would become such a favorite. I have an older scale that still works, but find myself reaching for this one. The learning curve is simple. It  does a beautiful job zeroing out the bowl I use for food that I have to measure for one of my cats and it is helping her get healthier. I find myself more conscious of sizes and portions of food for the family. Love it!.
 After reading some reviews, I came to the conclusion that a lot of people really do not read the manual. "For battery power conservation, the display backlight will automatically power off after 20 seconds of inactivity. Additionally, the scale itself will automatically power off after 2 minutes of inactivity."<br/><br/>The **backlight** turns off after 20 seconds, BUT the scale is still on and still shows what you're weighing. Overall, an excellent, extremely affordable scale to help beginners transition into eating healthier.
 Works very well. The only thing I'd change is that I wish it wouldn't time out so quickly. Sometimes I need to add or take out material to reach a particular measurement, and it times out before I finish. Then I have to empty the container and start over or else the tare function renders the measurement false.<br/>When used correctly though, the tare function works great and I really like that feature.<br/>**Easy** clean up. I use this in my kitchen for baking as well as in my "art studio" (ha) for mixing paints.
 Update -  I tried switching the measurement from ounce to grams today, and the scale went crazy. Numbers started jumping all over the place and then went to zero and wouldn’t say anything. I took the batteries out, which seemed to reset it, but then the same thing happened again. Been acting crazy ever since.<br/><br/>This is the perfect little kitchen scale, especially for the price!  Don't waste your money on more expensive high brand name scales, because this one totally gets the job done.  It's not too big or too small, and looks nice enough to leave sitting right on the kitchen counter.  And I love the fact that it turns off automatically (I would forget to turn off previous scales that I have used and would burn through batteries at a ridiculous pace.)  Definitely recommend!
 It is hard to imagine this is the first digital scale I have ever owned.  I bought it to measure out ingredients in grams for European recipes and just to be more accurate in general.  Today we were weighing lemon zest in 10ths of an ounce.  I find the display easy to read; it is well lit for nearly any conditions.  Some others have mentioned battery life as an issue but if it comes to that what's a couple of batteries?  Having only had the scale for a couple of weeks I can't talk about durability, but it looks good.  I can't compare it with any other since it is the first one I've owned but it is my general feeling this scale will serve my modest needs for a long time and I'm happy to own it.
 My initial impression of this device is that it is not only innovative, but extremely clever.  It is WELL constructed, easy to use and has features I have never previously seen on a scale.  I think this is a quality product form a quality company.  It allows for measuring fluid ounces by weight for milk and for water (wonder if there is a difference between "skim milk" and "whole milk?"  Wouldn't hesitate to purchase this again.  Even came wit an extra set of batteries in addition to the ones installed.
  08/06/18] Updated from 3 to 5 stars.<br/><br/>Etekcity reached out to me and offered me an updated version of the digital scale free of charge. I was impressed to say the least that they listened to my feedback. They've increased the timeout to 30 seconds. This is much better for the pour overs I've done. Also, the screen is much brighter which is an added bonus. Build quality is great, really can't complain! Happy that Etekcity reached out and gave me a replacement to try without me asking; customer service done right!<br/><br/>Old review:<br/>I use this scale for pour overs and, for the most part, it is good. I feel like the time out is way too short. I liked to do a staggered pour over so if I go and walk away while the coffee is draining, it is off by the time I come back for the second pour. When I turn it on again, it is automatically tared so I don't know how much water I have left to add.<br/><br/>Other than that, it is sleek and nice. Better timeout options (or perhaps even just an on/off switch) would bring this to a 5/5.
 I use this scale in the kitchen so that I can track how many calories I'm eating. I had one before that I liked but the max weight was too low and I kept having to weigh things in batches. I am really happy with this purchase.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- I didn't even notice the description said it was backlit. That was a nice surprise and it works well.<br/>- Extremely thin and very accurate. I have a set of calibration weights and it was spot-on from the factory.<br/>- All you have to do is take it out of the box, remove the pull tab from the batteries, and you're good to go.<br/><br/>Con:<br/>- Only one, and it wasn't enough for me to take a star off. The buttons themselves are actually part of the scale. They have a nice feel to them and everything but when you press on them, it actually causes the weight to go up and then back down. The scale measures quickly though so I haven't found it to be a problem at all.
 I have no complaints about this scale. I have nothing to compare to but it seems pretty accurate and it's easy to use. You can change the metrics which is helpful. It's also light weight so I've brought it with me when I was house sitting and it's easy to transport.<br/><br/>Before I purchased the scale I saw that some people were complaining about the display dimming but it doesn't bother me. I would rather save battery. The light does dim if you put a container on the scale but you're still preparing your ingredients but when you add weight to it the scale lights up again so it hasn't been a problem for me.
 THIS IS NOT A GOOD SHIPPING SCALE.<br/><br/>I repeat, if you're trying to weigh poly bags or packages that are BIGGER than this scale. You will not get an accurate measurement. Fetch out the extra $8 and get a full size one.<br/><br/>I weighed a box that was a couple inches bigger than this scale and it weighed in at 2 pounds when it was actually 4 pounds. You can only measure things that fit on the scale itself.<br/><br/>NOW THAT WE HAVE THAT OUT OF THE WAY.<br/><br/>It's PERFECT for weighing things in the kitchen. It's PERFECT for weighing small action figures.<br/><br/>It's very precise and basically works for weighing anything that'll fit on top of the scale.<br/><br/>It comes with batteries which is awesome, and it weighs in four different measurements.<br/><br/>5/5 stars!
 I purchased this on July 17,2017 and now all I get is a unse error message. It was working great for the 3 months it lasted but very disappointing that it had a error message so soon and then there’s no information in the manual how to fix. Sad.<br/><br/>Update: I was contact by Etekcity who gave great customer service in replacing the original purchased scale. With that in mind, along with the scale working great I’ll increase it to 4 start review.
 This scale was probably one of the smartest household purchases I made this year. We got this for about $13, and is used absolutely every day. We have had the device for about 6 months and it has functioned absolutely perfectly for us.<br/><br/>It is very accurate (it seems to be exact with basic measurements I've tested). The tare feature makes it easy when you need to measure multiple items for a single dish or container. Just fill until you have the correct weight, tap the tare button (power), and start adding the next ingredient. Plus this scale supports 4 different measurement types which should cover all the bases. We have never had an issue where we couldn't get the measurement we wanted.<br/><br/>It has definitely helped me lose the 25 pounds that I have lost in the last 3 months by allowing me to easily weigh everything I eat. This allows much more accurate tracking when you are counting calories as all serving sizes on packages have a weight as well as volume.  Where we get in trouble is when we use a "cup", yet we either overflow the cup or the measuring device is not accurate. This scale allows you to get the weight to within .01 which is awesome.<br/><br/>Icing on the cake is that the device has a backlit display which is really nice at night or in the early morning when it could be harder to see the display. If there was any con for this device, I would say that it could be a little larger, but that is really nitpicking and the device cannot be marked down for not being something it was never advertised as.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you are looking for a good scale to weigh your food (or anything up to 11lbs for that matter), look no further. This scale has more than lived up to our expectations and I would definitely buy another one in a heart beat.
 I didn't open/use it right away. Unfortunately I waited too long to finally open and start using it and it doesn't even work. It turns on and that's it. It shows zeros but if I put anything on it, nothing happens, it just "goes to sleep" because there's no activity on it while I'm standing there TRYING to weigh something!<br/>I'm well past my return date and over my warranty date. The most expensive piece of trash I've ever bought, very disappointed.<br/><br/>UPDATE - December 2018<br/>After posting the above review the company emailed me directly and offered me a brand new scale free of charge, even tho the first one was WAY past the return or warranty date. I waited until I received the scale and tried before updating the revie and I have to give it 5 starts because not only does it do exactly what it says as far as weighing food but the customer service was incredible. Thank you!
 I am stunned by all the good reviews this scale received.  It is wildly inaccurate (when it works at all). I'm filling small bottles with exactly the same amount of liquid &amp; getting readings that vary by 25% or more (in addition to being incorrect anyway). It is worthless - super disappointed.
 I love this thing! I use it AT LEAST 3 times a week.<br/><br/>It's perfect for folks who do meal-prep, or who are just looking to be more precise with their measurements. It is quite small so if you're cooking for a lot of people, spring for a bigger scale. But for my purposes, this scale is excellent.<br/><br/>I use this scale mostly to cut up my chicken breasts into equal portions. The scale measures in ounces, pounds, grams, and milliliters.  My favorite feature is the tare function, which allows me to zero out the weight of a plate or container, displaying just the weight of the food I put on the plate, and not the plate itself.<br/><br/>Design isn't that important to me on things like this, but I love the sleek steel look of the scale. The buttons are easy to press and the LED display is easy to read. And it hardly takes up any room at all!<br/><br/>I would recommend this scale to any meal-prepper, baker, or even casual at-home cook.
 The only reason I didn't return this was because we went on vacation the day after I received it and I ran out of time. I'm not sure if it wasn't calibrated right or if it just doesn't work. I bought this specifically for weighing postage to be mailed off and this never gave me the right weight. I tested several different items in my home just to make sure and it was always off, by almost an ounce. Not to mention, it is tiny and not exactly big enough to be weighing large packages with. Even though, in the description, it says it is for postal. I wish I wouldn't have wasted the money because now I'm stuck with it.
 I was completely amazed when I opened this up and began to use it.  I was way less than $20 and worth more than the ones at local retailers that are selling for more than $40!  It came quickly and is working great.  And check out the 5 year warranty.  What's not to like???  here is a tip that will help you get the most out of it.... go to a home improvement store and get a 4" PVC coupler.  stand it up on the scale and tare it out then put your bowl or plate on top and tare that out.  You can weight big things and still see the display!!!!
 First off I Loved this!!!  This was a great product until the display had issues.  Now when I place food/Item on the scale half of the numbers are visible :(.  I was able to use the scale for a few months before this happened and now I have been using the scale for a few weeks guessing what the weight of the food is. I have tried changing battery's, shutting it off and turning it on, nothing fixes this issue.  I can not play the guessing game any longer because I know that I am guessing wrong some of the times and lets face it, it was the purpose of the purchase of the scale in the first place. I need to be as accurate as I can, so I am looking for another scale :(  bummed
 I use this all the time for things that I sell and ship through Ebay. Works great and seems to give accurate measurements as I have had no issue with the Post Office since using it. While it is small you can still weigh bigger things with it by pressing the zero key while the item is on it.<br/><br/>While I haven't yet, I strongly look forward to using it to measure the weight of my coffee grounds to help make the perfect cup. :)<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend especially for those hoping to save money.
 I have owned many, many kitchen scales. What I uniquely like about this one is:<br/>1. It's light<br/>2. It has an automatic battery-saving "screen off" function while in action, but does not forget the weight of whatever is on it during its nap—as soon as the weight changes or you remove an item from its surface, it flashes back on.<br/>3. It has a sleek, smooth, easy-to-clean design.<br/>4. It does not appear to be any less accurate than super accurate scales I use that are more sensitive—and I certainly cannot say this of every scale I've ordered.<br/><br/>I'm buying another now for a vacation rental we maintain.
 Excellent product and service. The scale arrived quickly, was packaged appropriately, and works really well. I like that I can weigh out portions either directly on the easy to clean stainless steel surface or use a container with the easy to use zero function. And the customer service department sent a follow up  to your purchase email that had a list of frequently asked questions - some of which I hadn't thought of but am pleased to know the answers to as I am getting even better use of the scale. Definitely five stars!
 This scale is light, durable and has a beautiful stainless steel finish which compliments any stainless home appliances.<br/><br/>The buttons which operate on/off, reset the tier weight and switch between units of measure work fine but feel a little clunky. It almost feels like you don't know if what you pressed registered with the scale.<br/><br/>The price was extremely reasonable. Given the quality of the stainless and LED you'd think that you'd been given a secret deal or something.<br/><br/>My ONE major gripe with this scale is that it doesn't add a decimal to weights in grams to also count milligrams. This means that any weight measured in-between grams DOES NOT move "the needle" on the scale until it reaches the next gram. For example, if you are looking to dial in to 19.5 grams or 18.3 grams exactly, this scale only displays 19 or 18 grams. If you are looking for finer weight precision (in grams anyway) you'd better look for another scale.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I bought this with the intent to measure coffee beans and dialing in to the exact milligram is helpful when measuring beans and sometimes water. If seeing the weight display for milligrams doesn't matter to you then this is a great kitchen scale.
 A food scale is a MUST if you're dieting.  No matter how often I'm sure I know a portion size (after 50 years of dieting) when I put the item on the scale I've always gotten fooled by the fudge factor.  With a scale you know how much is going down the pie hole.<br/><br/>This scale has a nice large platform, you can factor in a tare weight and the readout is easy to read.  The price point is far less than you'd expect to pay for a kitchen scale of this quality.  I'm very happy with my purchase.
 I hated that scale when i received it. It was way too sensitive, the numbers kept moving around and the display would turn off within a few minutes of inactivity, nothing compared to the previous scales that i used. Well so I thought, with more use, I understood how the scale worked. The display didn't turn off but simply the back light did but the weight of the item was still visible. If i double tap the scale it turns on right away. I now use it for all my measuring. Only thing is that i'm wishing i'd ordered it a little bigger. I will check for a bigger size
 Love this scale!! I bought it so I could measure ingredients for making homemade soap. Although I haven't had a chance to make my soap yet I have tried it out with small objects to see how much they weigh and it works really really well!<br/>If you are looking for a good kitchen scale this is a GREAT option for you! Great price and great quality!! Even comes with a warranty and batteries which is always a plus!!
 Absolute junk. Arrived dead and wouldn't weigh anything just stayed at zero. Friend of mine had ordered the same thing although hers managed to work, but wasn't anywhere near accurate and the screen stopped working. Clearly others got theirs to work and left good reviews. But there seems to be a recurring issue in quality and accuracy with this
 It is perfect, this is what I've wanted.<br/>I've  hesitated to buy the digital scale cause I was not sure the accuracy and thought it could be easily gone out of order.<br/>But I needed one cause I have to make vegetable soups every other day containing exact amount of diverse vegetables for my health condition. (For preventing cancer). Then I found it on my online community site. I was wondering how come it is so popular and has so many good reviews. And now I can tell why.<br/><br/>First, it is compact and shallow so it doesn't need much room for kitchen. And the stainless still surface makes it easy to clean. And the functional factor, which is the most important, it is very accurate and sensitive (I put a little strawberry several times to test it). besides, it has many fuction. The best part for me is that now I don't have to bother to google to converse the units while cooking with this quick unit conversion. (oz, ml, lb, g)<br/><br/>I should have bought it ealier, I  have used a little, plastic, non-digital scale so far. Less accurate and easily dropping foods not having enough space to put it on and hard to remove stains.<br/><br/>And the customer service, which is the important part also, is excellent. An email from them after it was delivered, was very touched and it felt like I got individual care. I think they REALLY care for the customers so their product must be good accordingly. That's why I wrote this review (as a mom of little two babies I usually don't have time to write it). Hope all the luck to this good company.
 Excellent little scale which fills our needs perfectly as we weigh out &amp; measure primarily Custom Compounded Looseleaf &amp; ground herbal Teas along with quantites of herbs &amp; spice blends, mixs &amp; single herb/spice items. Couldn't ask for better, &amp; Tare comes in handy when changing zip lock bag sizes on products.<br/><br/>This scale also augments our postage scale, when more precise implementation for shipping, like International postage weights are needed.<br/><br/>Nice workable product for the money, We'll be back for more when we expand.
 I bought this scale because I wanted to use it for weighing/measuring breastmilk. I like that it has a "milk" setting. I zero the scale with an empty milk storage bag, then I weigh my storage bag of pumped milk, and I can write exactly the amount of milliliters or ounces on the bag label. I love the convenience and precision.<br/>I have also used it for random kitchen measure while cooking.<br/>This little scale is awesome. It's easy to use. It's lightweight and small. I am very happy with this purchase!
 Nice scale. Great price. Works as expected and I really like the tare function. Measures milliliters, grams, ounces, and pounds with ounces.  Some of the reviews say it doesn’t accurately measure small amounts. I found that you need to be sure the scale is on a level surface and be a little patient when adding or subtracting very small amounts - it will adjust to a full gram difference (but doesn’t show fractions of a gram difference) but it may take a few seconds to reflect the change - you may have to try twice. I’ve had no real trouble getting the scale to respond to small adjustments (1 gram) in weight. I think it’s a great scale for the price and easy to use and store.
 Perfect for my purposes.  I needed a scale that would weigh in ounces for shipping items sold on eBay and for weighing my backpacking gear.  I have found it to be easy to use and accurate yet it takes up very little space (no more than a small tablet).  It turns on and off easily, uses common sized batteries (AAA), has an easy to read display, and changes between units it's simple.  Very happy with this one.
 No, I didn't expect it to work for 10 years, but four or five would have been nice. On month 15 the scale started giving error codes when turning it on, or zeroing  it out. Sometimes it got stuck on "grams" and resisted a change to ounces. Also, it is quite small. Good for tucking it away, but bad if you have a  medium sized  container; it will cover the scale entirely so you can't see the screen. Pay little more for a sturdier product!
 I hate this scale. It’s very inconsistent with its measurements. I can tare the weight, pour of cup of peanuts in, and it’ll still say zero. It’s got a bunch of fancy ways to weigh things, just stick with something simple. I wish I would’ve gotten something simple but not pretty enough to leave on the counter. If it’s on any sort of incline, it won’t read either. And when you take your product off the scale, say you just set a whole banana on it, it’ll give you some goofy number so you have no idea if the grams you got for your banana are accurate or not. Look elsewhere for a good scale.
 I use my Etekcity scale to weigh out coffee grounds. It worked well for just over two years (I bought it in late 2016), but the display was becoming very faint, so I replaced the original batteries (two AAA). I was never able to get the scale to function again, even after trying multiple sets of new batteries. I called Etekcity customer support and they sent me a new scale, even though my scale was long out of warranty.<br/>Incidentally, one of the reasons I originally bought the Etekcity scale is that it takes easy-to-get AAA batteries, unlike many other kitchen scales, which use flat batteries (like the kind in watches and car key fobs).
 I bought this food scale almost 4 months ago with the intentions of using it to measure out my meals and make my weight loss journey much easier. I have used this scale every day since then to log my foods and it has been such a life saver! I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable and easy to use kitchen scale. The battery life has also been amazing as I have used the scale multiple times a day and have still not had to change the battery. Overall I am so happy with this scale and hope to use it for a long time!
 Love this scale. I have 2 other ones but this one is the best of all. Love that it it has ml option along with the oz &amp; lb. It quickly turns off automatically when not in use to save batteries. My other stay on for about a minute or so before turning off and have to replace the round CR1026 battery which I never seen to have on hand. This one uses 3AAA batteries that I always have around the house. It is also thinner than the other and looks really nice as well to leave out on counter.
 This nicely designed scale looks good no matter what area we use it in. The packaging was excellent and it came came with I well-written users manual. We use it for cooking, calculating postage and measuring small items in DIY projects.  The low profile always easy storage.  Although we have not thoroughly tested the accuracy, it checked out well measuring several known volumes of water. We haven't used it enough to comment on battery life.
 For the money, this scale is fantastic. I was searching for Christmas gifts and found this product to be just what i wanted to get for a bunch of different folks on my list. I ordered four of them and after seeing how it performs, I'm going back to get more. The scale has a very sleek design, all stainless steel, with a very modern look.  The backlit LCD read-out is very appealing and even batteries were included.  I tested the scale on various items in the kitchen. I especially like the "tare" feature where you can place a container on the scale and then zero it so that the scale only reads its contents. Very slim and unobtrusive package that can store easily anywhere in the kitchen. But, honestly, it looks so good that I may just leave it out on the counter.  Bravo to Etekcity for coming up with a winner.
 This is a nice scale overall.  We find it to be accurate and easy to use out of the box.  There is only one issue, which could be solved in a number of ways.<br/><br/>I track all my nutrition by weighing everything I eat.  Typically at a meal this means to zero the scale with a plate on it, then add the food and measure.  Because this is a very small scale, if you put anything but a small plate on it you won't be able to see the reading.  This could have been resolved by making the reading angle downward from the scale instead of facing straight up.  Another solution would be a "hold" feature where after removing the plate of food the reading would remain for a few seconds.<br/><br/>We have gotten used to using small plates to weigh before transferring our food to dinner plates.  This is a bit more inconvenient.  If you don't mind this, it's a decent scale.
 I loved this scale.  It was cheap and it could fit anywhere because it's small.  That being said, I had to get a new scale after like 4 months because it started flipping out on me.  It'll start reading off random number when I'm trying to weigh things or just not turn on.  I tried changing the battery but that wasn't the problem.  BUT I think for the money it was worth it.  I recently bought a new, more expensive scale.  If that one breaks in 4 months I'll be mad but for the price of this scale I didn't care.
 the reading doesn't not register right away, it takes more than 3 seconds. plus the weight is not precise.<br/>I had tried weighting both container bowl and sugar separately, and later by putting both on the scale and used the TARE function to see if the scale gives out the same weight. it's off by a small amt. like .3-.5 oz. it's okay since I am using it for larger volumn item, so half oz of sugar or flour isn't a big deal, but if i am using it for baking powder or something that require precise measurement....it might give your baked goods a total different texture. But again, if precise measurement is not the issue, I could have continue using the measuring cup method....instead of using a scale.<br/>The appearance is really slim and pretty, smaller than I expected, but definitely space saving
 first, when i place my glass 2 cup measuring cup on the scale i get different readings dependent on if the cup is in the exact middle or slightly left or right, front or back.  second, this scale is small - so small you really cant place a small plate on it and still read the display.<br/><br/>If the scale cannot be accurate if the measurements depend on the exact placement of what you are weighing.
 I'll be honest and say that I haven't put this thing through the ringer. I try to be careful with all of my electronics, so I can't speak to it's durability. It works well, measuring with exactitude whatever I place on it, and it looks nice. I don't mind leaving this out on the counter because it goes well with the stainless steel appliances and looks sleek as hell. It was affordable and definitely worth buying in order to perfect my baking.
 Even a SMALL amount of water will destroy this thing, and it's hard to avoid moisture in the kitchen. I put a handful of strawberries on it, and some of the juice got onto the surface, and it was ruined forever. Customer service said they would send a replacement, but three weeks passed and nothing came. When I asked them where the scale was, they told me they'd run out of them and said they'd expedite the replacement. Well, I got it two days ago, and today I spilled a little milk on the counter, and...my new scale is ruined.
 Scale arrived ahead of schedule, in good shape and properly packaged. This scale is very small (5.5" x 7") but accurate. Not suitable for larger items needing to be weighed. I will be shopping for another scale with a larger (10" x 10" +) platform! I also note that after using, there is not a way to turn it off, thereby extending battery life, must rely on self shutdown and that lasts for well over a minute or so.... Overall, a very nice scale for very small items and containers.<br/><br/>Add-On Note: Holding down the ON/OFF Button on the left side for about 4 seconds, turns of the scale. "My Bust!"
 Right out of the package the buttons were worn but product was new (funny). Turned on the scale and it read unSD. Looked it up and it was a code to recalibrate. Followed the instructions to recalibrate and when I finally got the thing to work, the numbers kept increasing, even though there was nothing on it. Returning.
 This is a nice small scale that mostly suits my needs as a homebrewer weighing out hops, and other brewing ingredients. The problem I have with it is I find that the scale is inadequate in measuring small volumes.  For example if I'm looking to add 3 grams of calcium chloride I'll often find that the scale registers 0 grams until I add enough to have the scale read 7 grams.  I then have to sort of divide that in half to try to get the 3ish grams I'm looking for. All in all I think this scale used in the kitchen would be fine 90% of the time but I am trying to get very exact measurements and this scale doesn't really cut it.<br/><br/>*UPDATE*<br/>Customer service from the company Etekcity, reached out to me and sent me a new scale (free of charge) which is accurate down to measurements of 1g which is much better for my purposes.  I was surprised that the company would go that far to ensure the happiness of their customer. As i stated originally the first scale I purchased would be perfect for probably +90% of kitchen use and for the price really is a nice product.  It just didn't fit my needs but now the company has fixed that.
 This was just a I-am-tired-of-looking-at-reviews purchase, and I haven't regretted it! I needed something accurate but didn't want to pay more than $25. I read mixed reviews on so many different scales I finally just randomly chose something because it was a good price, the right size and features, and wasn't reported as awful. I've been very impressed! It gives consistent readings no matter where you place your item. I've never had more than a one gram variance- if that. Though small, it handles larger items well. I usually just choose a tapered bowl with a small bottom surface, and use the "tare" feature. As with any scale, treat it carefully so the "feet" don't get knocked around because these are really the scale's sensors. I store mine in a small unused space by itself, and I'm confident I'll get many years use out of it!
 Small very easy to use scale. I wanted a small scale to use for Ebay shipping purposes. Regular mail scales cost much more. This little scale has a nice digital read out and two multifunction buttons. You hold the left button down to turn scale off. I like that the scale is light in weight, but gives enough surface area for things other than food. I weighed several things in my kitchen for accuracy. I even weighed Alexa; Alexa said the unit weighed a little over 2 lbs. The digital read out said 2 lbs 5 oz. I'm never going to use the shipping kiosk at my local post office again. That unit told me my 10.5 oz package weighed 1.11 oz (that is insane and I surely have been ripped off by post office in the past). I'll trust this little scale from Etekcity over the post office.
 I am extremely happy with this little scale.  I can weigh candle wax for making candles, rocks for tumbling, and actually use it for measuring portions of food :-).  The tare feature is really neat.  You can just put your container on the unit and press tare and it will zero out the container weight, then you add whatever you want to measure.  The scale came wonderfully packaged and protected and is very sleek and compact.  The Etekcity Digital Multifunctional Food Kitchen Scale is a recent purchase, so I haven't used it a long time yet.  If it should prove unworthy, I will update this post.. but it looks like a quality product and I feel it will be very durable.  The price was great as well.
 I ordered this to measure out servings of nuts, cheese and other healthy snacks based on gram weight. I initially tested the device by weighing pre-measured commercially packaged products. The scale was accurate to the gram in the half dozen or so tests I ran. The advantage I hadn't realized is that I can weigh a dish on the scale and re-push the start button to zero out the weight of the dish. Then I add my almonds until I hit my target portion weight.  Excellent!
 This is a great kitchen scale. One of the good features is that it takes regular AAA batteries, not those weird little button batteries like most of my other scales. It's about half the size of my previous kitchen scale, and stainless steel, which looks really nice if you leave it sitting out on the counter. The biggest feature is that it easily switches between ounces and grams right on the front of the console. My previous scale either didn't have that feature, or I couldn't figure out how to switch over to grams. If you are measuring food for keto or using European recipes, this is very important. I am so glad I bought this cute little scale. If I have any issues with it, I will update this review.
 **UPDATE**<br/>The kindly reach out to me to attempt to resolve the situation. I had already thrown the scale away and Etekcity still sent me a new one and a newer model as well. It’s been working perfectly and i am very happy with th level of customer service provided.<br/><br/>Have had this scale since October 2017 and as of yesterday doesn’t work anymore. I really loved it and use it everyday but it decided to stop working. I tried following the manual instructions to re calibrate it but no matter how many times I’ve tried it just scrolls random numbers on screen. I need to weigh my next meal and now I’m forces to run to the store and buy a new one now. Would have loved it much more if it lasted at least a year.
 It's very sleek, but the decimal point measurement isn't very accurate. I bake bread by weight, and have found that I can get a different weight for the same amount of ingredients depending on if I was adding or subtracting to try and get to my ideal quantity. If you're weighing out 24oz of flour it's not such a big deal, but when you're trying to get your yeast quantity correct it ends up feeling a bit like you're winging it. I'd probably return it if I still had my original packaging.
 Purchased this several months ago, and wanted to use for a while before reviewing.  If you place anything on the scale besides something very small, you cannot read the display.  It is too flat.  Put plate or anything like that, and you literally cannot read the display - then when you lift the item, the reading is gone.  A waste of money.
 Even though this scale is much smaller than by old one, it is much smarter! I love how I can set a bowl on the scale, tell it to ignore that weight and then add items to the bowl. It is very accurate and I am impressed it can measure liquids. I am very pleased with my purchase and the fact that it came with batteries so I could start using it right away.
 As someone who was just starting to count calories, I needed a scale. Someone on Reddit recommended this one by Etekcity, so I scooped it up without much hope because of the cheap price tag.<br/><br/>However, I am OBSESSED. It's gotten to the point where I weigh every single thing that I eat (I use it for every meal). I personally don't need a scale that counts lower than 5 grams, because I am using this for food, and who really eats anything less than 5 grams? I sure don't, so this is perfect for me.<br/><br/>I especially love the tare feature for when I am making overnight oatmeal. It is SO helpful to be able to weigh out each ingredient individually while still in the same bowl.
 This is a beautiful device. I tried it out weighing everything from a nickel to a dozen apples. It came in right on the money with the nickel (5 grams) and with the apples as well. I weighed the apples all together and then individually; the individual weights added up to the exact weight of the total (as they should but on some scales don't). It's handy, stores easily and weighs perfectly. What else could you want?
 This is an attractive consumer level scale.  It matches the Stainless Steel espresso machine.<br/>It has been a week and it still works.<br/>It has a tare/on off button and a units button providing grams, ml, oz, and Lb-oz.<br/>It is quiet and punctual.<br/>This replaced another brand scale of similar size.  Most of these type devices suffer because the LED readout is facing up.<br/>A large bowl makes it difficult to read the LED.  Again this is common.<br/>I may be wrong, but it appears that this device has sensors at each of the four foot pads instead of a floating sensor on the top surface, meaning the scale has to be on a flat surface to sum the mass at each foot pad.  For someone weighing an espresso shot it makes that a challenge if one can't get all four feet under the spout. Wedging it in sideways (see photo) works for me, but beware.<br/>Also, for small masses such as 18 grams of coffee beans, this device is not accurate or repeatable enough.  Placing a 30 gram portion cup and 18 grams of coffee beans on the scale several times, readings would vary by 1-2 grams which is fine for me but there are fanatics out there that want a device accurate to tenths of a gram.
 So far; this is the scale I have always wanted for the home..  I have used a set of laboratory weights to verify its accuracy; and find it to be within plus or minus 1/100th of an ounce, up to 2 lb..  That's amazing accuracy, for the price.<br/>I particularly value the "tare" function.  Place your container on the scale, hit the Z/T button, and it zeros itself..  Then you can add contents to the container, and read exactly the weight you've added..  It also "holds" that tare weight, for multiple uses..  Very helpful.<br/>Can't remember if it's waterproof..  No sweat.  It doesn't notice the sheet of ClingWrap that I cover it with...<br/>Of course, as with all precision electronic gadgets; age may show changes.  We'll see..  -pp
 Etekcity's digital scale is a simple product that works as advertised. This scale is great for weighing out food, however the base is a little small for some plate sizes. The item looks clean, modern and pleasing to the eye. The only slight downside is the screen dims in seconds sometimes not leaving sufficient time to record the information displayed on the scale. Very good value for the price.
 Purchased this scale a few months back and just opened it today - it's missing one of the feet - so the quality control on this may be lacking<br/>The QC Pass 02 sticker is right next to the missing foot<br/><br/>Other that that is seems decent - Ill find some type of stick-on thing to use for it and replace the feet<br/><br/>Update:<br/>So it has been quite a while since I posted this review originally.<br/>The scale has worked fine with the fix I made to it and we use it all the time to potion out snack etc.., but I recently heard form Etekcity and they sent me a replacement.<br/>Since the product works well, and the provide excellent service I have upped my rating on it.<br/>I have purchased other products form Etekcity without issue (lanterns, doorbells, etc..)
 Works great, looks great!<br/>Wonderful gift!<br/>Added Bonus for me is.... now I have proof that not only are products packaging shrinking.... But the contents inside are not the at listed on packaging!!!! This gadget is very handy to see how you are vetting ripped off and to then buy the produced ts that don't false advertise. I have switched to liquid coffee creamers because the powdered creamers are a few oz less than stated.
 I love the easy way you can change from ounces to grams to milliliters. The display is very clear. The main drawback for me is that plates will completely obscure the display. So, if I want to add items to a plate for weighing, I need a small bowl on top of the scale and weigh items that way,, then transfer them to the plate. It's a minor inconvenience. However, I think I'd chose a scale with a bowl on top.
 Bought this product for my wife and she loves it. She's been dieting and part of the new diet includes measuring things out which caused the need for the scale and I'm happy to say that this has met all of those needs and then some. The price point is great as it doesn't exactly break the bank and falls into a happy medium. Another big plus is that it does let you zero out once you've set your bowl or whatever measuring device/utensil on top of it to make sure that you get the exact measurement that you're looking for. She's used it everyday since we got it and we haven't to change the batteries yet, so you won't have to worry about it chewing up and spitting out batteries quickly. Great product.

The first I received wouldn’t register any weight until almost an ounce. I replaced batteries and tried on multiple occasions over a few days with no luck. I requested a replacement and it arrived very promptly. This one is even less functional- I’ve tried it on every surface and it has been at room temperature for hours. I have to practically punch it for it to even recognize any weight from my hand. Now I have two broken scales, how fortunate.
 Very dissapointed, I will be returning. I just received this scale in the mail today. It is consistently weighing things as being over 1oz heavier than they actually are, and the calibration feature will not work. The "code" freezes and never goes on to calculate the zero weight. I wonder how many people using this scale have actually done repeated tests to make sure that the weights they're seeing are accurate?<br/><br/>Two stars because if it did work properly, I think it would have been perfect for my purposes.
 The Etekcity Digital scale seems accurate. I don't really use it so much for food, but am always weighing small hiking and hunting items that go into my pack. It adds up fast so shaving a few oz here and there helps. To measure larger items, under 11 lbs, I found a couple pieces of 1x1x4 inch stirafoam from a product book in my office. They don't even register a weight on the scale. This allows me to put whatever will balance across the two pieces on the scale, and that can be fairly large if careful. Weighed my small hiking first-aid kit the other day, (approx 2x5x8 inches). Came up at 26oz and I was able to trim that down to about 22oz. Hey that's nearly a 1/4 lb. It adds up fast. Scale sells at a very reasonable price for what you get and it qualifies for Amazons Prime shipping. Time will us how it holds up over time.
 As others have mentioned, its very small which makes it really easy to store.  However, being so small is a downside when I need to put a plate of something on top of it since the plate obstructs the screen.  If the screen was tilted down at an angle so that you could look under the plate while it is resting on top of it, it would be perfect.  For the price, its a small detail that I can live without.
 Perfect kitchen scale for counting calories. I’ve never had to diet, but my doctor wants me to lose a few lb’s, and so I’m trying to count calories, and learn how to track what I eat.<br/><br/>I love that you can measure ml volumes of water, milk, etc.. by weight. This is very handy when adding water / milk / soy milk to a smoothie / blender cup. Not too small to be usable, but small enough that it doesn’t take up valuable kitchen counter space.  I’m really glad I bought this.
 Great lightweight scale with a njce weught range.  I've been using a scale with much less capacity for the past 8 years.  That's why I switched to this one.  I have a weight calibration set and this scale was as close as I would expect.  I noticed some reviews complained about the scale always shuting off every 10 seconds.  That's not true. e.g.  The backlight shuts off in "tare" but still has the 1st weight in memmory.  However, why is there a "ml" setting.  Is that for a European thing?  It doesn't bother me but there were a lot of comments unanswered regarding this on Amazon.  A quick answer would help you PR.  The scale is easy to handle, clean and stires in clear sight.
 Great product, you can change to different units, i have been weighting baking ingridients and it came out very good. I would recommend to anyone are using grams for the baking instead of cups...<br/>Update<br/>The first one is not good but the replacement work well. Thanks for great customer service, they stand behind the product of company and give a great care to their customers.
 I loved this little scale. It is beautiful and sleek on the counter. Used it for about a mon h with no problem. However, I was measuring soup and spilled liquid on the scale and then I tried to clean it. It seems that the liquid seeped into the little openings in front, and now the scale doesn’t work. So disappointed because I really love the look I and ease of this scale, I’d recommend this, but be aware to not spill liquid on it. If you can avoid it, then this scale is great.
 This scale is not accurate at all!!!!!!!!!!! I am not sure if I received a defect but the scale couldn't detect small amount. It had to be a large amount for it to work. So if you are measuring very little salt or other ingredients, look for other scales.
 Perfect scale for the kitchen because it is small, but mighty. This scale easily changes functions between oz, ml, g, and lb. The tare function makes baking and measuring out dough a breeze. It is a no-brainer system because there are really only two buttons to press and maneuver between. I highly recommend this little machine because it doesn't take up hardly any kitchen space, but it gets the job done and has excellent weight capacity.
 my scale has stopped working already. I have had it for about three months and have not used it very often at all It sat on a dry counter, never got wet or dropped. The display, before it quit entirely, gave an error message that was not addressed in the owners manual. It is not the batteries. I was finally starting to figure out how useful this thing could be. I was using it more and more. Would have been happy to give it a great review before this morning. Once again I am reminded that it is so much better to give a review after you have lived with something for a while. How legit are reviews that are given as soon as the item comes out of the box?<br/>UPDATED on 4 APR 2017- After seeing my review Etekcity contacted me to inquire further about my problems. They also informed me of the 12 month warranty on the scale and sent me a new scale in 3 days! Excellent customer service moves this review from a 1 star to a 5 star.  Thanks-
 I originally gave this product one star because it stopped working after four months. The company contacted me asking about the issues I experienced. They immediately sent a replacement free of charge. The new scale is working very well even storing it on its side and not flat. Fantastic customer service and a company that stands behind its product.<br/><br/>I’ve had this scale for four months. I like the design and it’s easy to fit bowls on top for weighing. Problem is the scale stopped working multiple times and has now quit completely. I changed the batteries multiple times. It will not turn on. Has anyone else had this problem? Is there a way to get it to start working again?
 I love that you can easily zero scale out with a bowl or plate on it. I love that you can change the units easily and that you can shut it off or just let it time out on it's own.<br/><br/>The only drawback and it is minor os that the readout is difficult to see with a very large mixing bowl or large plate but I have found if that is an issue to use something to raise the bowl or plate up like a small book or a smaller bowl.
 I have had this scale for about a week. When I first took it out of the box, I was confused on how to set the scale. I expected it to be more complicated than it actually was! However, all you do is press the Tare/Zero button, and it turns on first to Tare (where you measure the weight of the container before subtracting the contents) and wait several seconds until the screen turns to zero. That's when you put your food on it for weighing. It is so easy to use! You press the second button to change from grams to ounces to milliliters to pounds. This scale is small and it will remain on my kitchen counter. It is easy to wipe off if foods leave a residue. I bought it on sale--a real bargain, especially compared to the non-digital food scale I bought for twice as much that is so hard to read. I am very pleased with this product.
 This thing has a tendancy to get pretty dirty.  One day when i was cleaning it with a wet paper towel i guess some water got into the "feet" and caused it to give error messages when trying to weigh.  I took it apart, removed the battery, and shook it out and left it to dry for a few hours and it started working again.  So i guess be careful when you go to clean it
 So very excited I ordered this Etekcity Digital For Scale.  It works like a dream. She's precise. And even with liquids combined with dry. She's sleek, barely noticeable on my counter. Very easy to use. Digits are easily readable and I don't even need my reading glasses to see the numbers. A breeze to wipe clean. She's lightweight so you can move her around to any counter. Love it!
 Actually I like everything about the product. My favorite is the feature that lets you put a container on the scale first and then push the button so the scale takes that weight off and then you can put the food in a get a accurate reading. My other scale back in Mi. will not do that. I like the look, it is easy to clean.
 This scale is great for any increments over 3 g. Anything less than that and it will not register correctly. This means some baking ingredients cannot be weighed properly here, if they are not in excess of that 3 gram increment. This affects accuracy greatly. It does work with tare very well. However, even when I added  small amounts, it took until it hit 3 g or more before it registered the addition. This means weights may be off by that amount.
 I use this with my 8-cup Chemex coffee maker and it's been working great. I love how sleek this is and the stainless steel looks nice among other appliances. My only issue is that the display does not stay on for very long, and when it does go off, it zeroes out the weight when it turns back on. Be aware of this if you're using it and need to remember weights at different points - such as when making pourover coffee. It's easy to clean and the buttons are tactile - they actually push down instead of just being touch sensitive - so you can't accidentally press them!
 I have had no problems with this scale. I tested with items that I have weights for, and the scale was right each time. Its sleek, and fits in my pantry drawer in the Styrofoam bottom for protection. I did have to play around a bit to zero out after placing a bowl on the scale. I do like the idea of having the metric weights as I have been converting UK recipes! This is a great feature..
 This thing is not accurate and does not consistently weigh things.  After taring, sometimes it does not recognize small weight added to it (under three grams).  And upon reweighing the same item, it will provide two different.<br/><br/>DO NOT BUY
 It doesn't take much space and its read-out is very clear in any of the unit types you wish to use. One problem will be if you have something large. Any large object will cover the read-out screen. You can get around that by placing a cup on it, weighing the cup and then placing things on or in the cup. A little subtraction shows you the correct weight.
 A little bit smaller than i was expecting but otherwise a good product that works as advertised. great for the cost. however, i will say it appears that the scale does not work perfectly when trying to measure out the last gram of a 250g recipe call. i will keep slowly adding and it wont change and when it does it adds about 5g. not a huge deal just keep your eyes out for it.
 This product is a joke lol. The instructions clearly state that the scale should be placed on a flat surface; however, upon doing so I was shocked to see that the 'legs' (for lack of a better term) were totally uneven. As such, the 'scale' rocks back and forth on counter tops,tables etc. It's a pity that I missed the return window on this. I am totally dissatisfied and and utterly disappointed. I don't know if I just happened to get a defective product, but either way this item is virtually useless. I would rate it as HALF A STAR if I was allowed to. The Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale Multifunction Food Scale was a complete waste of my hard earned money. Scales are measuring instruments. Therefore they need to be as precise and accurate as possible, not finicky and unpredictable.
 So far it works as advertised.  I've had a couple scales and this one is attractive and seems well built.  I like it.  I have another scale that measures down to .01 grams, but only goes up to 500 grams. I use this scale when I don't need such a fine measurement.  I haven't used it much, but have had other scales and think I could recommend this one too.
 Great for dieters or anyone who wants an inexpensive, reasonably accurate scale. Works well as a postage scale as well. It looks great sitting on my kitchen counter and takes up minimal space. It has a neat feature that allows a container to be placed on the scale before the food is put in. With the container on the scale, simply turn on the power button and the scale automatically zeros out the container, handy feature, no subtracting required!<br/>  To get the best accuracy, It is important to place the measured quantity close to the geometric center of the scale, as stated in the instructions.
 Complete piece of garbage. Stopped working after less than a month and a half. Turn it on now and it reads "un5E" and then switched to "CAL" and then nothing. Putting in new batteries does not fix it, nor does any combination of pressing the buttons. Listen, I know you are probably cheap like me and don't want to spend too much for a kitchen scale, but it's not worth the time waiting to get this, and then the frustration when you are trying to weight your ingredients and end up ---- out of luck and have to wait till you can go to the store tomorrow and get a real scale. Save your time, money and outrage and buy a better scale.
 i should have bought this many many years ago because it is so helpful in counting calories !  i can finally eat single servings as recommended on nutrition labels! if you ever bought potato chips or doritos then youd know you cant count all the chips since some are broken, well this scale measures the broken chips so you dont eat more then you should! just turn scale on weight to see 0  and place plastic container on scale and wait to see the weight, and press button on scale to reset weight to 0 and you can put food in the container to measure its weight.
 UPDATE: Etekcity offered to cover the broken scale since I was still in the one year warranty. Great customer service. As I mentioned in my orginal review as posted below, I liked the scale to buy a replacement from etekcity and will like continue to do so.<br/><br/>Worked great for a few months then just broke, kept displaying an error. New batteries didnt fix it so ended up tossing it out. I bought the next model and so far working quite well.
 I've wanted one of these kitchen scales for years and just never bought one until your great sale price. I just got it today and already love it. I love the feature that you can automatically subtract the weight of a container holding what I need to measure - that is just great! Thanks for a wonderful product!
 I loved the design of the item and the fact that it is not bulky, blue light appealed to me. But this scale is worthless. It does not show the proper weight, goes from higher number to lower while I am adding food. I thought it might be a glitch...nope, it is not a glitch. It does it 95% of the time.<br/>Update: though I wasn't happy with the product, I must say that their customer service was outstanding. I changed my review to three stars. After my review a rep contacted me inquiring about the details and offered either to replace the  item or a refund. I chose refund. They refunded the money immediately. I think they do care about the customer satisfaction, and this is so important. Any product can have an issue, but not every company will work with you or even be concerned about it. I would give 5 stars for customer service. Hope the product will get better.
 This thing rocks! We use it to weigh horse food and supplements and this baby takes a beating. Its stored outside in a covered barn but completely exposed to changing temps and works like new. Only compliant is I didn't realize how small it was but that was my fault for not looking further into the description. I would certainly recommend
 So far, so good!  We have made two batches of French macaroons and measured every ingredient successfully and easily on this scale.  It is pretty, easy to use, and seems accurate.  We tested that by measuring a few ingredients twice just to be sure. Mark from customer service just followed up with some helpful hints - but we had already figured them out. It was a nice gesture anyway.  A great scale---my husband said his scale in a laboratory was much more expensive -
 I have used this scale continuously for months now.  The large digital display is easy to read night or day.  It is very accurate for weighing those small items.  The different modes are very convenient and can be switched between with something on the scale.  The tare feature works well.  Several times I've set something on the scale, tared it, added something until I reached the desired weight, tared it again, added something else until I reached the desired weight. It has an auto-shut off feature for the display to save on batteries.  I'm still using the original set that came with the scale.  It is small enough to store almost anywhere and lightweight.  Easy to clean with just a damp rag.  If I'm doing messy or oily foods, I just cover it with a piece of plastic wrap, tare, weigh, remove, wipe and it still looks like new.
 This scale was inexpensive and seems to work pretty accurately.  My main problem is that it is so small when I place a regular sized dinner plate on the scale I can't see the numbers... I think their newer model has a larger surface area.  I decided to save a few dollars by ordering this model. Wish I would have gone for the upgrade.
 This scale is primarily used in our kitchen for measuring baking ingredients. Small particulates, like flour and sugar, often gets stuck in the gaps near the buttons. The buttons are not sealed, and liquid might be able to get in if any is spilled. We use care when using this product, so no damage has occurred with any stray liquid.<br/><br/>When using this in conjunction with bowls, the digital readout can be blocked. A better design could possibly put the display on the slanted surface.
 I have 0 complaints about this scale. It's quick, easy to use, feels like nice quality. It cleans up well. I never realized how much I would use a scale like this until I got this one. Now I won't be without it in my kitchen. I use it for portioning for my meals and doing exact measurements for baking. I've had it a year and never changed the battery, it is still just like new. I love it!
 I like this product very much. And though it quit working in about 4 months, I got the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE ever!!!!  I called Etekcity &amp; quickly spoke to a REAL PERSON!!  I was NEVER put on hold. After a quick email to verify my purchase &amp; address, I was sent a new scale in less than 2 weeks. NO HASSLE at all. This is how a customer should be treated!! Thank you!
 I had no expectations with this scale when I ordered it. I needed a back up for a trip I was taking and figured I would throw it away when I was done.The price was just too low to expect much. I was wrong! This scale is very well made, clear to read and simple to use. The instructions (it's a scale I know) were in native English not translated from Chinese, and the quick tar feature is key. I have to admit I will use this scale right alongside my other one that I spent five times as much on. I would strongly recommend.
 An okay scale while it was working. The display shut off really quickly, which is frustrating. I don't want to waste battery power either, but I would weigh an item, glance at the paper, and it would turn off by the time I looked back. Unfortunately I didn't get a lot of use out of this scale. It broke after three uses. I used it to weigh my dog's food, which I prep a week in advance and halfway through the third week it stopped working. I get an error on screen "unSe" (I think) and it won't do anything else. Replaced the battery and still got the error. Waste of money.
 Great for the price.  I use it for measuring my coffee beans for espresso and coffee.  It is sometimes a little "sticky" when I pour the beans into the container (love the tare capability!) until I get the right weight, but then I need to remove the container and put it back on a few times to make sure that I'm getting the same reading each time.  When I put the coffee in a scoop at a time, it's much more consistent -- it doesn't like small changes.<br/>Edit -- I just wanted to point out that I'm measuring to the gram -- that's 0.035 oz!  I'm looking for quite a bit of accuracy!
 As I got interested in my diet, it becomes necessary for me to have a scale such as this in my kitchen. Before, I had only had the old fashioned analog kind which are not very easy to read. This is great because not only does it calibrate down to hundredths of an ounce, but it also converts from ounces to grams. I also like the TARE function so that you're can weigh food in a dish and get the correct amount. Easy to store, very intelligently designed. I've had it for about 4 months, very satisfied.
 Just received the scale and I like the sleek design and size for my counter space.  Easy to clean top of scale and easy to use all the functions. They are just what I need as far as the tare function and unit conversion which I use sometimes. Love the auto off and also ability to turn off manually. I have been weighing my meals on scales for over 7 years and have had a variety of them over the years so it only got 4 stars as I don't know how long the scale will last. Very easy to sign up for extended year warranty using the red laser scanner app.
 This little multifunction scale is a nifty, versatile addition to my kitchen.  It measures up to its advertising.  Its size makes it easy to store, or if you like, sit out on your counter without taking up much space.  Its capacity enables you to use reasonably sized containers to measure out significant quantities used in most kitchens.  The container may be tared so you don't have to subtract its weight and units of measure are easily changed.  I have even used it for small postage items.
 This scale works well for my needs - mostly weighing individual pieces of chicken/meat before freezing. I do wish it had a larger surface (an inch wider, an inch and a half longer), but I should have looked at a ruler when reading the dimensions.<br/>I can't say if it's absolutely, perfectly accurate, because I haven't tested it and it's not a major requirement for my needs, but it seems on track.<br/>It uses 2 AAA batteries, which is a major plus.  I had a scale with a large button battery and had nothing but trouble with it.<br/>This scale is very easy to use. There are actual buttons to turn on/off and change weight measurements.  The display turns off rather quickly and I thought I had to turn the scale back on, but discovered the display returns once you put something back on the surface.<br/>All in all, I'm happy I bought this scale.
 Works great, compact, uses AAA batteries, not the disc batteries which I never have on hand...  The only ding I have for this product is the digital screen - it is difficult to read from any angle other than looking right over the top of it.  This is minor, as I almost always place the scale right in front of me when I am using it, but there are those times I try to weigh something from afar (arm length) and it is hard to make out the weight.<br/><br/>Overall, I love how small it is and it is perfect for what I need.
 I needed a scale that could provide me readouts in different units, that was not too big and was easy to take out, put away, and read. And I had to be able to tare it out.<br/>This little unit is ideal for me. It seems accurate down to about 3 grams. I can set a bowl on it, tare it, and add ingredients to get all the measurements. I don't know that I'll ever use a measuring cup again, now that I know what 1 cup of milk weighs in milliliters!<br/>It is a steal for the price, and I want to give them to friends and family as gifts!
 Hard to use. Hard to see what you are measuring. Poor at measuring small quantities. General accuracy and percussion questions.<br/><br/>The one thing that I like is the height is limited so storage is easy. However the footprint doesn’t make up for the struggles of using something that should be simple.
 I do like this scale, I didn't realize how small it is. You can't put anything too large on this. I bought this for meal preps for my dogs food. I put a  oblong16oz container (like the Glad reusable containers) on the plate to weigh the food, anything much bigger than that you can't see the LED display. Good value overall.
 If you’re ok with a fluctuating readout with an error margin of 4-5 grams, this is the scale for you! In our kitchen, 5 grams can be the difference between molten lava cake and a soufflé. Also, this scale is simply not willing to register anything under 4 grams total weight.<br/><br/>On the pro side, while NOT working as advertised, it does look good doing it. Or not doing it.
 I am writing this review as I am finishing portioning out my meals for the week and it is very easy to use. Two simple buttons, one for on/off/zero out the scale, and the other to change the units either grams, oz, ml, or lboz . The scale is so sensitive that I coughed near it and it registered my cough. It is very easy to use and while it has a shutoff button, it also turns off automatically. I have noticed that it does tend to turn off faster than I would like and that is the only reason or me deducting a star.<br/><br/>So far I am very satisfied with my purchase and will edit my review if anything changes.
 I purchased this product in late January,  did not start using it until mid February.  It's now mid March and the buttons on this are totally unresponsive.  I cannot tare or change the measurement off of ounces.  Tried to follow the product support link,  but that was broken.  Buyer beware.
 I don't have a  whole lot of experience using kitchen scales, that said I am liking this one quite a lot more than my old scale. It seems to be accurate and is easy to read. Those two things alone make it a winner with me. It is easy to clean as well, and takes no space at all for storage.
 The scale is excellent for the price. It's easy to use, has a nice finish and a big screen. I had an issue with the scale at first where it wouldn't properly return to 0. When I zeroed the scale it would fluctuate between -15g and 5g when it should have been reading 0. I contacted Etekcity who promptly replied and tried troubleshooting with me. After they determined I had a defective unit they sent a replacement that arrived very quickly. The replacement does not have any issues like the first one and always reads 0 when it should. Etekcity stands behind their product and will make it right if there is an issue. Don't hesitate to pick one of these up!
 This scale worked great for a few month. I have not even had this over 1 year.  Today I went to weight some deer backstap  mean and I was getting a error. I tried to reset it and replace the battery's same error. I got so mad at the scale I just tossed it and it broke in 3 to 4 parts. I know I should have contacted the saler but still. Less then one year of use and it failed. I will nore buy this again for buy from the same seller.
 This scale is easy to use and helps keep me on point with the amount of food I am consuming.  I also helps me with portioning the make ahead  recipes I put in the freezer.<br/><br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Etekcity-Digital-Food-Weighing-Scale-Multifunction-Kitchen-Scale-with-Large-Back-lit-LCD-Display-11lb-5kg-Baking-Cooking-Scale-Liquid-Volume-Measurement-Stainless-Steel/dp/B01MYGCJ35/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Etekcity Digital Food Weighing Scale Multifunction Kitchen Scale with Large Back-lit LCD Display, 11lb/5kg Baking &amp; Cooking Scale, Liquid Volume Measurement, Stainless Steel</a><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Etekcity-Digital-Food-Weighing-Scale-Multifunction-Kitchen-Scale-with-Large-Back-lit-LCD-Display-11lb-5kg-Baking-Cooking-Scale-Liquid-Volume-Measurement-Stainless-Steel/dp/B01MYGCJ35/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Etekcity Digital Food Weighing Scale Multifunction Kitchen Scale with Large Back-lit LCD Display, 11lb/5kg Baking &amp; Cooking Scale, Liquid Volume Measurement, Stainless Steel</a>
 I use this scale almost daily as a way to keep a more accurate log of my daily calorie intake.<br/>It's not super accurate, but it's definitely accurate enough for my needs.<br/><br/>The auto shut-off timer is a bit short, however that's most likely a good thing because, knowing myself, I would probably leave it on for long periods and kill the battery very quickly. I also have yet to replace the batteries that were included, so battery life appears to be satisfactory.<br/><br/>The company even reached out via email asking if I had any questions or concerns and offering a quick and easy way to get in touch with them. The representative in the email was polite and kind. I haven't had any issues with the scale requiring me to contact their customer service, but from my first impression with them it seems as though it would be a painless process.<br/><br/>I would say 4 stars for the product, but I'll give 5 stars because of their proactiveness and willingness to help.<br/><br/>Good stuff, Etekcity!
 I was looking for a small scale to weigh food while counting calories at the office.  This works fantastic!  I've used this several times a day and it's so easy.  You can switch between grams, ounces, or pounds by touching the button on the left.  The on/off button is also a reset button, which allows you to put a container on it, reset to zero, and then put your item on so that you read only the weight of the item.  Lightweight, seems quite durable, and compact to fit in a small location.  I usually put mine in an upright position in my desk cabinet.  This works so well that I ordered one for home also.
 Its small size makes storage easy and functions as advertised. My only use of it is to measure coffee:water for my morning joe and this is the perfect device! Not to mention it can measure 4-5 different units. However, taring can take a second or two but it is not a deal breaker or a drawback.
 Got this for my boyfriend because he's working out and needed a way to precisely count calories and control portion size. This scale displays in lbs/ounces or grams. It holds up to 11 lbs total. It has a tare/zero feature, so you can place a bowl on the scale, zero the display, and measure straight into the vessel. So far it has been very accurate and consistent. I would recommend for any home cook or healthy eater to enhance precision in your daily routine!  I am excited to use it for British baking recipes where ingredients are measured by weight rather than volume!
 It's small, it's light, it's versatile, it speaks metric (always useful for those of us using global recipes online), and it switches itself off when I forget to.<br/>All my years as a baker, and I never measured anything. I am a convert now. It's so easy - and my first Angel cake turned out beautifully.
 This is one of the best products I have purchased in the last two years. It is easy to operate and functions perfectly in day to day use for the last several months. It is small in size and easy to store in a cabinet drawer next to my food preparation area. I use it daily. I have used it to weigh items form a few ounces up to three pounds. It is well designed and easy to clean. The digital display is perfectly located and the tare function which I use frequently functions perfectly. I would buy this product again and recommend it without reservation. Bob Stewart
 I had my doubts, but this scale exceeded my expectations.  I just checked the accuracy using Ohaus calibration weights from 5g to 4000g......all readings dead on!  In ounces I found error to be between .01 oz. to .03 oz. over the same range.  I'm very pleased.....now let's see how long it will last.  Also, manufacturer offers to extend the warranty for an additional year if the product is registered within 7 days of purchase, and offers toll free telephone, email, and live chat customer service.....nice.
 It works well enough for the price. I don't like it when you touch a button to change a setting, the scale registers the pressure as if you're placing something on the scale to be weighed. Other than that its OK.<br/><br/>My primary reason to get a scale of this grade was to weigh weapons and their accessories. If I ever need to weigh a chicken breast, I'll definitely grab this scale.
 I've been using this scale for a week for my strict new diet. Works well. Nice and small.....fits in any drawer. The seller sent an email clarifying how to weigh, which was a nice touch.
 I was a little nervous because the price but I'm so glad I went with this one instead of spending more money on a different one. It does everything I needed it to. I set my bowl or pouring pot on it, decide which weight I want, g, lbs, oz, click the button again it zeros out and I put my wax or raw butters in and weigh. It's completely accurate and has saved me the hassel of trying to even amounts out while making lotions or candles and I'm able to get a much better end product now that it's accurately weighed out before making. If your looking for a scale to weigh ingredients 10lbs n under don't waste your money on anything else, this is all your gonna need, and you just can't beat the price!
 I bought this scale to test out some UK recipes...and maybe to feel a little fancy!  The instructions are easy to follow and the buttons are clearly labeled.  I appreciate the "tare" function and would not have a purchased a scale that didn't include it.  I love the purple led backlight as it adds some fun to the scale.  I love the silver look.  It is sleek and would fit in with any kitchen décor.  The scale itself works great.  The weighing platform may be a little small for some people but I didn't want a large scale.  I use a glass bowl to weigh my ingredients so I don't have any obstruction.  I am quite happy with the scale!

I also wanted to weigh food portions and decided that a scale was in order.  I was suspicious that such a small, slim unit would really work.  I especially like the tare function which allows you to subtract the weight of the container to get an accurate weight of the item in question, like at the salad bar!  I don't like cluttering up my kitchen with gadgets and appliances and this is so small that it fits easily in a drawer.  It did take a couple of tries to use the tare function without pressing too hard and adding weight and with a large bowl on the scale it was a little hard to see the read out but it's a tradeoff I'm fine with because I like the small size of the scale.
 I am on a strict diet and this scale allows me to measure very small amounts and even weigh my plate and automatically subtract it so I can then place my food on my plate with out it getting the scale dirty. It is small enough to put in my purse to take to a resturaunt as well.
 This scale has been used at my school to weigh science experiments and been used at my house to weigh food. It works for everything. It is light weights and small so its perfect also for when you travel. It is super easy to clean and i love that there are so many measurement unit options. I don't have to convert my numbers anymore. I would highly recommend this if you need a small scale at home.
 First time I ever wrote a review on here so here goes. Ok so when I first got this product it was working great nothing was wrong with it. I was using it everyday until a week ago it did'nt work anymore. I figured it was because of the batteries being dead because it was'nt turning on at all. So fast forward to a week later or so I buy some brand new batteries for it and install them and nothing happens. I would have given this a 5 start rating if I had first reviewed it when I first bought it. The reason I did buy it was because the reviews were so great on it. Maybe I just got a defective one. Does'nt mean I wont ever buy this food scale again.
 Love this scale, very light weight, easy to use, sleek design, would definitely recommend this item and would buy another. I cook many recipes with measurements other than cups and tablespoons, this comes in handy, I make my own hamburgers, very good accuracy for weight the meat. Also for diet cooking, measuring it out just right. I put mine in a Ziploc bag, and this way I don't​ have to worry about cleaning it! Even came with the batteries! Thank you!
 It worked fine for about a month, then the screen stopped fully lighting up and now it doesn't work at all.<br/><br/>Edit: I was contacted by Etekcity and informed that the scale had a one year warranty and if the issue couldn't be fixed, they would replace the scale. I couldn't take advantage of the offer because I had already disposed of the scale, but I certainly appreciated the customer service which is why I bumped the rating to 3 stars.<br/><br/>Edit 2: Etekcity sent me a new scale. It seems that mine was just a defective product because the new one works perfectly. I've updated to 5 stars because the new scale works perfectly and I have never had a better experience with customer service in my life.
 I wrote a very detailed review about this product and it's accuracy that was never posted in 2017 so I'll keep this update short.  We weighed three calibrated weights tonight, 20 grams, 200 grams, and 1000 grams.  The scale measured all to +/- 1 gram of the calibrated weight.
 I use this to weigh my yarn (yeah, I know, I'm weird, shut up) and packages for shipping, but it has been used for real kitchen things like weighing flour for bread. It works great and I have never had an issue with it. I'm always surprised by how much the little thing can actually weigh.
 I've mostly used this sccale for weighing mixtures of spackle, grout and such. It does the job just fine. I've never verified the accuracy, but I've also never needed that kind of serious precision. It cleans up nicely owing to its polished finish, but the lcd screen will fog if it gets much water on it. For that reason I wouldn't douse it with any liquid for long. Battery has lasted for 3 years or so with intermittent use.
 I will place a bowl on the scale and then remove the bowl so that I can put something in the bowl and return it to the scale. But, as soon as the bowl leaves the scale, the scale turns off. This does not work for me.
 This has made my simple cooking so easy with measuring few item I use to make assumptions about the weight. Its not at all complicated and a 10 year old kid can also use it without any supervision. I love to bake my own bread and this little balance has proved to be very handy and quite accurate as per the manufacturer claims. The tare function works fine too however, the power saving mode can be quite annoying as it turns off within a couple of minutes and one has to turn it on again causing more delays in weighing. Over all a good product; will wait and see how this gadget performs on long term use.
 A great digital kitchen scale, although if you truly want to be accurate this is not the scale for you. This scale gets the job done and weighs accordingly to the nearest whole number. Best part to love is that the scale is portable and lightweight. Not only does the scale automatically turn off, if not manually powered off, the package also comes with 2 pairs of AAA batteries. Easy to use, mostly accurate and looks nice. Everything about this scale is easy. My old scale needed a manual to learn how to use it so I am so happy I bought this one and I highly recommend it.
 Really great, lightweight, and accurate. It comes with batteries as well which is nice. The LCD screen does turn off rather quickly, but the actual device doesn't turn off for a few minutes, so if you add something new on top of it, it will wake up again and display the new weight. Essential for counting calories!
 This is an amazing scale. It's great at zeroing out containers, so you can accurately measure food; fantastic for dieters and bodybuilders, or anyone that measures what they ingest. It can be used to weigh other things as well - it's sturdy design can handle up to 11lbs. It comes shipped with two AAA batteries, so I was able to use it right off. So far it's doing an excellent job.
 It acts finicky if you have anything close to its side including your fingers. Testing items in the kitchen cabinet it appears to be reasonably accurate.  It is an attractive small unit which is easy to store in a drawer. I hope it remains accurate and durable. Only time will tell.
 I wish I bought a scale that plugs into the wall because this one does not hold batteries while off well. I use it maybe once a week and every week I have to replace the batteries, which is now costing me more.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The company reached out to me and sent a new scale and it works perfectly fine. It works even if i have not used it in weeks. and Does what it needs to do now.
 Got my scale in 2017. It is easy to use. One tap to tare the bowl to "0". You can switch from ounces to grams while the scale is in use. It's slim, streamlined, and has a small footprint. Easy to store in a drawer. Yet I find it of such size that even my largest bowls fit on it and I'm able to see the display with ease. Display is bright and large, even for my old eyes. These make great gifts, have just purchased the 3rd one for a friend.
 Clean smooth feel. It's handles weight distribution extremely well and is consistently accurate. I had bought a food scale prior to this one and the etekcity scale is so much better at tare weight due to the button mechanic rather than touch sensitive button. It's a great inexpensive product. The only issue I have with it is the size, but that's because I like using plates when meal prepping, if I use bowls it's not that big of a deal. If you use a plate, it's practically impossible to see the weight number unless you angle yourself right. Overall, it's a great scale.
 I love my scale. I make soaps and needed to weigh each one for quality control. This is a hardy scale. I use it in Oz but you can also measure in kg. And lbs. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it looks like it turns itself off after a short time. It's not shut off its just saving batteries so if you hit the on key it lights back up. It has a tare button and it's very thin but not too small. I highly recommend
 This scale LOOKS nice but the functionality is not so great. Depending on where you put certain things on the scale--it will read you a different number which to me means inaccurate!! As a heavy meal prepper where precision is everything, this scale will not work for me.

I have not been disappointed.  The scale has a stainless steel surface that is easy to clean, and well-illuminated display.  The TARE function works great, as does the conversion from metric to standard measures.  The auto shut-off is a great bonus since you do not need to remember to turn it off. The only reason for my 4-star rating is that the rubber supports for the four legs are not firmly attached.  They have come off more than once, making the scale unbalanced.
 I ultimately purchased this to keep at my office to weigh my food portions to help me count my calories. For ~$10-ish, it does what it's supposed to, accurately weigh things! The get thing is the simplicity, easy-to-read display and a decent sized metal surface. The surprising bonus compared to its competitors on top of the decently sized surface area is the back light. I've used my scale for months now and is still going strong. Well-worth the purchase, for sure, and I'd definitely purchase again if I need additional scales.
 I have had this scale for over 3 months, and it works well! I noticed that it's fairly sensitive (which is good), but now seems to glitch a little sometimes. When I'm weighing things, it'll change weights although nothing is touching it to make it do that, and it is on a level surface. Perhaps that's the battery. As I've said, I've had it for three months and use it multiple times a day.<br/><br/>Also, I dislike that I can't use large plates with this, as the display gets covered.<br/><br/>I would recommend it, but would suggest to keep these things in mind if that's a deal breaker for you
 Worked great until 7 months later it didn't! The scale would read zero even with something on it, I replaced the batteries and zeroed the scale out and still wouldn't register when I put a jar on it.<br/><br/>Time to find a higher quality scale.<br/><br/>5/23/18 Update<br/>Seller sent a new scale free of charge, showed up a few days later. The scale is working perfectly just like the last one when new. We'll see how long it lasts.
 This product works as advertised.  Although I haven't used it a lot to date, I'm a bit concerned about the durability  number of cycles] of the electronic on/off switch because pressing it means flexing the stainless steel tab seen to the left of the number readout display.  If that doesn't prove to be an issue, I'd give it a 5-stars rating.  I've found it handy for weighing items to be mailed to avoid applying excess or too little postage.
 The scale opperated properly, but the bed is quite small and you will likely cover the readout if you put anything larger than a small bowl on it. I however enjoyed how compact the scale was.<br/><br/>I am giving this product one star because, as one would expect, I got food on the scale. I went to wipe it off with a wet paper towel and the electronics were fried. How can a kitchen product be designed to not have any water resistance? Food will get on it, and you will have to clean it. Sad!
 This is the best kitchen scale I've ever owned. This is a big help for the Weight Watchers program I'm on now. The backlight is bright, easy to read and easy to set. I like the fact that I can put a bowl on the scale and zero the scale and then weigh the items in the bowl. It's a sleek compact scale that doesn't take much room. Highly recommended.
 This is a very good scale for the price . I mean if it lasts a long time which  dont know yet . I have only had it for a short while and i really like it . It will weigh things up to 11lbs. it can be used to weigh in grams , ml., ounces and pounds. it came with two aaa  batteries and also arrived fast . I like it and am happy with the purchase .
 I finally took this out of the box to find that it is not calibrated correctly! The weight increases after leaving the product on there for more than a few seconds. It ruined a large recipe I was making. Unfortunately, I can't return even though I only used it that once. Not very pleased at all.
 Exactly what I needed to ship packages. Obviously, size is a factor but this scale has worked for items as large as 13" x 15".  Precise, easy to operate and reconfigure, it's super handy for weighing items not only for shipping but for adhesives, like Command Strips.
 This scale is awesome. It's really easy to use and versatile<br/>- lots of different units you can toggle between easily, and a simple tare function to cancel out the weight of your bowls etc.<br/>- It's easy to clean, store, and transport<br/>- it takes standard batteries (2 AAA)<br/>- Very precise - Division: 0.01oz/1g<br/>- It is small and light but handles up to 11 lbs!<br/>- and it is inexpensive!<br/>If there has ever been a kitchen scale you can get excited about, this is it!
 Super product. Excellent price. I bought this scale to weigh my parrots because it will register grams or ounces. I can use the gram scale function for my birds and the ounces for other things. The switch from one to the other is very quick and easy. The numbers are easy to read. The surface is a handy size. The scales are large enough to be useful in a lot of applications , yet small enough to store easily. I am extremely pleased with my purchase. Would recommend to anyone!
 After use I noticed my scale is then scaning right, when I buy 2 lb of meat and weigh it out it's not reading even close to 2lb it's been like this ever since I bought it and I tried many things to try and fix this to nothing more I could do.
 I bought this to measure food when I went on a diet 1/1/2018 (yeah I know but this time I am still on it!). I keep track of all consumed calories with the program by under Armor. So far I have used it every day and have lost 14 lbs from my start at 187.5.  The weight loss program does not have to be run by an accountant - I just keep it all close.
 Very sleek scale. It fits nicely with my stainless steel appliances.  I have used it to weigh ingredients.  I'm glad I bought this scale.  I can cut down the portions of any recipe.  I was given a chance to rate the scale when I made the purchase, but at the time I was super busy. I just got around to review it and it's a great price for a scale that does so much
 Was so excited when I first used this scale.  Was easy to use. Worked great.  Then a few days when I went to user it again. Would not come on, changed battery, would not stu to zero.  At first i could rest batteries and it would zero. But not any more, just runs thru numbers but will not zero. Not happy. 10/23/2018 up dating: scale is still not working. Was hoping somebody from company would contact me.  Sad day. I really wanted this scale to work.  Sad face.<br/>Updated 11/18/18, manufacture sent replacement to, no charge. Thanks
 This is exactly what I was looking for to keep track of my food portions. Simple to use and lots of options for units of measure plus a tare weight function.
 Does what it's supposed to, most of the time.<br/>I've noticed sometimes when using powder (as in putting a shot glass on the scale, clearing it, and then adding powder) it jumps from 0 to 3 on the grams setting and won't register anything in between.<br/>Slightly annoying since I craft and make DIY cosmetics, so I use powders quite often.<br/>Still, it's not too bad to use and for the price, is alright and reliable enough.
 This scale is only accurate for heavy weights. It took over a full cup of flour before it registered there was anything in the bowl.  Extremely useless considering I got this for baking and canning, and if it can't weigh out grams of flour or sugar, what's the point? I'll just stick to using imperial units instead of metric like I was trying to switch to :/
 Slow to clear and slow to respond In general. Has a hard time sensing light and or air weight objects. Wouldn't weight honey , butter or baked chip items until it sensed a weight (over 1 portion).  You can barely fit any containers on it and see the scale weight at the same time.
 Very nice scale. It's lightweight, was the perfect size for what I need, has a nice LCD screen with easy to use functionality. It came with 2 batteries inside the scale plus an extra 2 which I thought was a nice extra touch. Most companies don't even give you any and they give you 2 sets. Now to see if it holds up over time.
 This is an honest review of a piece of junk. I bought a set of weights with this scale to check its accuracy and and you shouldn’t every associate the word accuracy with this one. It concistantly reads less than actual weight and it will fluctuate as well, which I verified by weighing the exact same item multiple times. Yeah it’s cheap but it also doesn’t do what it’s advertised to do. Buy something else. Oh and they wouldn’t let me review this item with a 1 star rating, but I would have given it none.
 Very good.  Small.  Seems to be accurate.  Love that it measures in grams, ounces, pounds and ounces.  Also displays in milliliters - which, of course in impossible to measure with a scale - but close enough for cooking as long as the liquid being weighed is close to the density of water.<br/>Easily cleaned and stored.  Good bargain.
 This scale is so great. My other kitchen scale is twice the weight and takes up a third more counter space, but is always unstable. This little guy has the stability of a mountain goat. The display is easy to read in any light. and it's easy to keep clean. The smart button array knows when to work for the function you need. No need to worry about hitting the wrong button or getting two functions competing at the same time. Measurement is fast and easy, and tare calibration is a snap.
 Works well.  Wish the “timeout” was a little longer.  If you leave it idle for about 10 seconds, screen goes dark, and, auto off is maybe another 10-20 seconds.  Auto off time is okay.  How about bumping the dimmed screen time?  How much battery life are we really talking about.? It’s just annoying when I’m trying to read it and do something else at the same time. All in all, good buy.
 Decent scale for a decent price. Not 100 percent accurate but VERY close. The fact it's so simple to use and you can put a container on the scale and hit a button which zeroes out the weight so the only thing being weighed is what you put INTO the container. You're not trying to subtract the weight of your container from your product. Supermarket scales are calibrated to a standard. I often match the weight a purchase from my meat department on the scale and verify its reading is very close.
 This scale works perfectly in my hobby desk to weigh the fishing lures that I am making out of wood.  The scale is very accurate and well made.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap, good kitchen or small hobby center scale.
 I'm currently on a "cutting" diet, so I have to be rather meticulous with serving sizes when I'm prepping my meals. This little scale surprised me with how useful it's been with dialing in the portions. I especially like the automatic tare feature when I have to use a container to measure out small pieced items like shredded chicken or nuts.
 Looks nice, easy to use... but this morning I woke up to weigh out food for food prep and the thing was dead. Little did I know that weighing out Almonds would cause too much stress on the internals causing it to break. Broke out new batteries even. Nothing... I contacted support because apparently, I missed the return deadline. Need a reliable daily digital scale? Keep scrolling
 Looks good, seems very accurate and easily adjusts if you want to weigh something in a container. Just place the empty container on the scale, hold a button until the scale again reads 0 then add what you want to weigh. When you are done, remove the container and after the scale turns off it resets itself to 0.
 This works okay for some stuff but if you are trying to measure herbs and spices down to the gram, forget it. If all you are doing is ounces and pounds, it might work for you. Personally, I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it to a friend.
 Having trouble with the accuracy of this thing, a lot of the times it will display different results for the same item. On smaller portions it sometimes does not even register changes in weight when you add stuff to the plate. It says accurate to a gram but it does not even round consistently up or down. If you are looking for something that is accurate give or take a gram or two this should work fine. But when making recipes that are for a few grams of this and that...this will not work.
 Love this little scale. Its great for my Kitchen and easy to store in a draw because of its size. I've been using it to weight out serving portions to keep track of my calories. It has help me loose over 20lbs and it is so easy to use. You can place a bowl or cup on it then quickly ZERO the scale and then get an accurate weight of the food you are eating. Has more use than just the kitchen. I also use it for my backpacking trips to help me make sure I'm not carrying extra weight I don't need.
 lasted less than 1 year with very minimal use.  Had to replace the battery every time I used it.<br/><br/>Update.... Contacted by company and sent a replacement without charge stating the battery issue had been resolved.  This is good CS, but I don't think the product should have been sent out in the first place is the QC hadn't been done on the product.  I have no way of knowing if the new one will have the same issue or not.  I guess I got what I paid for.  BTW, I had already purchased a replacement of a more expensive (and hopefully better) scale.
 I purchased this to replace a bulky food scale that I bought years ago. This chic little scale will measure up to 11 pounds!! Has the tare feature so you can weigh your food in whatever container you like. When getting recipes off of the internet they are often in weights, instead of measures, and also in grams rather than ounces. This great little kitchen tool handles both - from tiny amounts of spices to pounds of stuff - and works great. I'm so happy I made this purchase.
 This scale works great. It's battery powered, so it's very portable throughout the kitchen. It's very sleek and looks great sitting out on the counter, but also can easily be put away. It's helped out a lot following recipies that list weights vs standard measurements, and also for keeping track of portion sizes for dieting. We've had it for a few months on the same pair of batteries with no issues. I wasn't sure I'd use a kitchen scale very often, but I'm very glad we went ahead and got it.
 Very nice scale that works wonderfully! Just a note for you new users:<br/><br/>Really small measurements (ie 0-3 grams) are hard to read on most scales.  To circumnavigate this issue, put a bowl on the scale and zero it first. Once there's some weight on the scale (a bowl, etc...), it can easily measure the single-digit gram values!
 Easy to use and the stainless steel matches our other appliances. We use it to measure chicken, steak, etc when we freeze part of the large package from Sam's. We weigh the meat and mark the weight on the wrapper and it's so easy to defrost. Very handy and we use this much more frequently than we would have thought.
 This is a really really GORGEOUS scale. I love the looks. It fits in perfectly in my very modern, chic, and trendy kitchen. As a guy who's very cosmopolitan i need to weigh my coffee and water with perfect precision in order to get the ratio correct in my HARIO pour over coffee maker.<br/><br/>Works perfectly!<br/><br/>My only gripe is that there were two very tiny dings on the thin stainless steel cover. I'm not going to exchange it though because I don't care too much.
 Got this for sourdough bread, worked ok for about 2 months then started acting up. Tried new batteries a few times.  Started by not taring, and then wouldn't turn on unless I took batteries out.  Hardly works. I wonder if there's a problem with the connection by the batteries, but it seems to be overly sensative when I tare it just thinks I'm adding something to the scale. Perhaps too much flour got between the buttons, idk!
 This scale is the perfect size for weighing spools of 3D printer filament. It seems to be pretty temperature sensitive (meaning the indicated weight changes in response to temperature). Some scales have temperature compensation to account for this, but not this one.  Overall, not bad.
 As a culinary &amp; baking student, i use a scale a lot. This scale does not measure things accurately, it will skip between 7g-20g (for example) and you won’t know exactly how much your measuring. I messed up several recipes using this. The display also turns off within about 5 seconds. Mine was stuck on “unSE” for a few hours before it died only a week after having it. Don’t waste your money on this.
 Works well, but it was two drawbacks:<br/><br/>--Only precise to ± 1 gram.  That means if you want 10 grams of coffee grounds, you might have 9, you might have 11.  Consider your use if you care about that kind of thing.<br/>--If you jar it all, like slightly bump thing you're weighing as you set it onto the scale, then it will re-zero.  If you zeroed the cup or whatever you were weighting you'll have to start over.<br/>--It so flat that you'll need to be clever about putting wide things onto a cup or riser to be able to touch the buttons or read it.
 Started a diet where I need to measure a lot of my food. Need something accurate and small to keep on the kitchen counter and that can be zeroed out with plates.<br/>This little guy fits the bill. It is big enough when I can see the numbers when putting a bowl on it but small enough where I can place my container with spoons and stuff.<br/>I can place a bowl on it, turn it on and it zero's to that weight automatically.<br/>The stainless steel outside fits in with our kitchen decor.
 Works quite well, easy to read, seems to be rather accurate.  I'd only make one change if I were designing it, put the button to change it from metric to English on the front.  It comes with batteries installed and a spare set, can't beat that. Why don't more companies do that?!
 Super Pleased with this scale. After reading the reviews on this scale, I decided to purchase.  I have not regretted my decision at all.  This scale is completely accurate and truly easy to use.  Although it was easy to figure out how to use it without the instructions, the instructions are clear and concise.  Unlike the bulky stand up type of kitchen scale, the slim design of this scale makes it very easy to store in a kitchen drawer (a huge bonus).
 Small, sleek, great design and color, digital reading is clear and consistent, the different units is key, lightweight, and comes at a great price. As a lifting and meal prepper, I am 100% satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it to anybody.
 I actually purchased this scale to weigh different forms of fiber rather than food, though I'm sure it would work just as well in the kitchen as in my fiber studio. It does an excellent job, just what I was looking for.  It is small and light weight and appears to be quite accurate. Very happy with this purchase! I even had the opportunity to weigh a small package for mailing....multi purpose is what I'm all about!
 This is so sleek and so pretty, I thought this was going to be a great location for my old manual scale.<br/>Sadly, the unit only worked for about 2 months before it broke down.<br/>At first I thought that it was a battery issue, but I replaced the batteries and no digits showed up in the window. There is a glow but no numbers so it doesn't weigh any thing.
 Love, love, love this. It's perfect for weighing my small packages for postage amounts. Great price and fast shipping as well.
 So far this has been a great little scale, only downfall is that it is small so if you plan to put a plate on it to measure your food, it covers the number scale part. Otherwise it’s a great little scale, lightweight, thin and very easy and simple to use.
 Reliable, robust, easy to use, compact - all of it made a great kitchen scale in my little apartment. I love it and will probably getting more of them, as gifts. In a year and half of active use, I am still to replace a battery or see any sign of wear.
 Thank you for supplying us with more info about the scale! However, we were able to figure all these things out on our own. We are so please with our choice! We could not be happier! It is quite accurate!  We love being able to buy large portions of meat now and not having to guess how to bag it hoping it is remotely close in the same weights!
 cheap scale, works well.  there's not much else that I need from a kitchen scale.<br/><br/>I keep ours in a 1-gallon plastic zip-loc bag to protect it from kitchen/food liquids (even while weighing things).  keeping it in a bag has worked well and I haven't noticed any measuring discrepancies.
 Had product for 10 months and in the middle of using it today, it just starting reading the number 1000 then flashed 60.  The scale was good up until today.  Not sure why it flopped out, but it did.  I lift weights and weighing my food is very important for me to stay at peak performance and to get the desired body shape I look for during different times of the year!  From my experience, this scale is not worth the money unless you only weigh ingredients for recipes from time to time.
 This digital scale is AMAZING! So easy to use and holds up with everything you throw at it. I've had oatmeal spilling out on this thing, huge pots on top of it and very heavy plates with piles of food on top — it measures everything accurately! I even brought it to a froyo place to track macros by weight of each flavor I was getting and it held up nicely (same accuracy as the scale at the counter). So if you're thinking "this scale is too good to be true for such a low price" - seriously - don't. It's amazing! Definitely get it!
 Seems pretty good so far....I like that it measures by very small increments...ex.: hundredths of an ounce... As far as material quality, battery life, and durability, only time will tell. It doesn't appear sturdy enough to withstand tons of abuse but that's not what it's built for...seems a good quality kitchen scale at an economy price. One item of note, in the ad for it, they make a bit of a fuss about it's 'purple background' LED readout...The one I received had a dark navy background with light blue digital numbers. No big deal really but not what was advertised.
 I bought this scale to keep at work so that I could accurately log my food and it's exactly what I was looking for!!!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that you have to use a smaller plate in order to be able to see the read out.
 This scale is accurate and works really well. I would have given this 4 stars if it werent for one fatal flaw. This scale drains batteries super quick!<br/>You can get maybe 3-4 uses out of this prior to the batteries dying. I bought this for meal prepping but the annoyance and cost of having to change batteries so often has led to me just purchasing a better engineered scale.<br/><br/>Edit: I had a faulty scale, the vendor replaced the scale. Scale works perfectly! I would recommend this to anyone. Scale is compact, stylish, and accurate.
 So far so good everything works fine my only gripe is it don't weight tenths of a gram so you don't know if you are in between a gram. Weighing flour malts or sugars for cookie or beer recipes are not as precise as my old scale. Besides that it works fine auto shut off works it is sleek designed and has a nice matte metal finish. Will keep it in the kitchen for sure.
 This little scale is better than I expected. Was a gift for a family member but I was the first to use it. It doesn't seem cheap,  looks nice,  cleans nicely and is really easy to use.  Definitely recommend.
 Received this on Sept. 29th, 2017 and it is only Oct. 7th. I have used it maybe 4 times for no longer than 3 minutes at a time, and it already stopped working. It will turn on and off, but only show "0". Even when I try to weigh things on it, it remains at "0". Disappointed, I was hoping to use this for a long time.
 I use this for mailing packages. The post office man told me that the weights on my shipping labels matched exactly what his scale said. He asked me what kind of scale I had and I told him that I had an Etekcity kitchen scale from amazon. He was impressed, and so was I because I did not have to pay extra postage. I would recommend this scale! The price is amazing and its accuracy is awesome. Everything in the description matches what you can expect from this product
 I found this scale to be very accurate. Much more accurate, in fact, than is necessary weighing food. I have a 100g calibration weight which it correctly weighed at 100g. It does not display fractions of a gram, but display ounces out to 2 decimal places. I have weighed some of my camera gear and it checks within 1 gram of published factory specs. Only two head-scratchers: Error message "unSE" (listed in manual as "unSr", calibration error) has come up a couple of times and I could not clear it by holding the on/off button for two seconds - had to remove and replace the battery. The other is that one of its units of measure is "ml" or milliliter, which is volume, not weight. I can only assume that it refers to volume displaced by water at 72 deg F.<br/>This product is well worth the money in my opinion, and has many uses other than food weighing.
 The scale does not switch between units and only measures in grams. It doesn't accurately measure or even detect measurements below 10 grams and provides different numbers for the same mass every time you weigh that object. Would not purchase again.
 I already have one for myself and bought a second for my sister for xmas who is trying to be more conscious of food intake. It measures very accurately and has the great function of being able to change between measurement units.
 Accurate but sensitive if anything is touching it nearby.
 Received in an unopened box but batteries had moisture on them and one was corroded. Battery cover wouldn't stay flush and the lower battery wouldn't stay inserted, causing the unit to lose power when you set it on the counter. Would've anticipated better quality based on the amount of great reviews. Re-ordered a second unit - let's see what we get this time.<br/><br/>****UPDATED****<br/>Received the second order. Item works as advertised and doesn't have discrepancies that the above had. Changed from 2-star to 4-star rating.
 You may think you know your portions until you try this. The Etekcity weighing scale destroyed my notions about the portions we take for protein, carbs and fats. And then i started realising that this is why i was not losing weight as much as i was suppose to. This is a must have product in your kitchen if you are serious about tracking macros and eventually reach your body goals.
 I recently started meal planning. This thing is great! I buy meat in bulk because it's cheaper and I use my scale to portion it out and freeze it. This scale paid for itself in the first week I had it.
 I bought my first Etekcity Scale and It looked used and not accurate. After a while the company sent me a new one so I'm updating my review, scale is acurate and it looks 100% new the only reason why I'm giving 4 stars is because for any reason in both of the scales I can not work the tare button seems like the function doesn't really work. I use It to measure hair color so my color bowls are a little big so that means I have to balance the broduct in the bowl, I was able to work the tare option once on my first one and It was so easy to measure I didn't have to balance the product for It to be accurate.
 I've been measuring candle wax and the product is very easy to use and appears to be accurate. This brand Etekcity seems to have some excellent products and have certainly earned my trust. I also have their body scale and must admit, the ratings and reviews are not false. I don;t question the results when I stand on the scale. The results are bright, fast and consistent. The product itself has a heavy, quality feel.
 I'm diabetic and weigh everything that goes to my mouth- including weddings and restaurant and everything in between. You can imagine how many scales I've used and gone through!! This is the best! I love the ease of the batteries, the fact they are already installed! I bought two and will definitely buy other products by you!<br/>May in CALIFORNIA.
 Going from a manual to a digital scale was probably always going to be an upgrade, but this scale is just perfect. Easy to use, with multiple functions and units; extremely precise, as its 1g increment statement is TRUE; and cleaning it take just seconds. Highly recommended.
 I've been using this scale for over a month.  It works perfectly right out of the box and is easy to use.  It sets the tare weight every time it turns on, so it's easy to put a bowl on the scale, turn it on, and then start putting food in.  It is pretty small so it does not take up a lot of counter space and the brushed metal finish gives it a contemporary appearance that fits right in on my countertop.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that with a larger dish on the scale the flush screen is not visible because it is covered by the container.
 A quick check of calibration shows very close and sensitive readings. This will work just fine for getting exactly 24oz of R134 charged into my cars new A/C system. Sleek design, easy to clean/maintain it will find use in the kitchen without taking up storage space also. I like how clear the readings are also.<br/>  I really like how Etekcity includes an invitation to contact them with any concerns or comments. They clearly care about customer satisfaction! :)
 My husband and I bought this so that we were able to measure out our food for proper proportions for our weightloss journey. So far it has worked well, and we have not had any issues with it. I will update if anything changes.
 I like this a lot more than the other scale I had. I use the scale for food measurements. This one is accurate (so far) and is easy to use. I also really like that it has a button for ON/OFF. A lot of other scales I have used, the off function is not there. SUPER ANNOYING. The only downfall to this one is it feels a bit cheap. But for the price, it's great!
 I use this every day in my kitchen. I use it when cooking or baking to weigh my ingredients. I also use it when serving food to get an accurate portion. It comes in handy and doesn't take up a lot of space. I love that it does measurements in all kinds of weights as well: lbs, oz, grams, etc. Also, the feature where you can put a dish on it and reset the weight with a push of a button so you only get the weight of the contents comes in handy a lot!
 I really liked this scale at first but then just yesterday it started malfunctioning! It keeps says "unSE" and starts flashing 1000g at me. What the?<br/>I wasn't even weighing anything heavy!<br/>first the display when dark but I could see the values so I changed the batteries, It worked for 30 secs and went dark again and then started giving me the "unSE".<br/>I have had other  scales that lasted YEAR! 7 months is just terrible.<br/>Not cool Etekcity. Not cool.
 Had this product for a couple years.  It was used maybe a dozen times, stored in it's original box in a kitchen cabinet.  The product stopped working after just under two years.  It was cheap but I hate having to rebuy imported junk every couple years and filling a landfill.
 Not good or accurate for weighting anything to small<br/><br/>Edit: 12/17/2018  —  Sent me a new version of the same scale however it’s still no good for measuring anything accurately to the gram. The same nickel would weigh in anywhere from 3-7 grams. Never consistent, however I’ve used it reliably for weighting packages for online shipping. It works great for that I just round up one ounce.
 It’s small for storage, yet big enough to do the job. The only downside is that it is hard to see the weight if it is on a plate. A bowl works much better. I particularly like that I can zero out the weight of the container.
 I have had this scale for less than 6 months and it is not working.  It reads unSE and I thought changing batteries out would fix the problem but it does not.  Very annoying.  Note:  when I posted this, I was immediately contacted by customer service for the company who promptly refunded me the cost of the scale.  Good customer service effort.
 Bought original scale Aug 2017.  Batteries discharged even when off.  Was lazy and simply replaced batteries when I rarely used scale.  Finally got frustrated enough in early Aug 2018, eleven months after my purchase.  Contacted Etekcity, gave them some order info and got a new scale a week later.  Kind of amazed that they honored the warranty after so long.  Replacement scale seems to be perfect so far.
 Seems pretty solid had it for a month we will see if it co to yes to function properly but it has aided in my attempt to accurately track my calories so far so good
 This kitchen scale is great. It's small and compact and very sleek. I bought it partially for looks so it wouldn't "stick out" in the kitchen and it doesn't at all. The size also makes it convenient to tuck in a drawer or cabinet if not needed. It resets pretty quickly when you zero it with a container at first, then back to zero without anything on it. I've used it to measure many types of foods and it works consistently. I've gotten pretty good at eyeballing several things now but still use it for checking accuracy. Long story short: it does the job and looks good doing it. In our world of completely insane proportions, I recommend it to anyone looking to lose or maintain weight, or nutritional balance.
 This scale is the perfect size for our small kitchen. We have very little counter space and only 3 drawers, so it needed to fit into an already well occupied space.  Perfect!  I am always trying new Gluten-free recipes, some in grams, some in ounces, so needed a scale that could toggle between different measures.  I have verified it’s accuracy with a number of packaged products and so far it is spot on.
 I am a pastry chef, so it's important for me to scale small weights to the gram.  On Amazon, this product claims it will weigh accurately to the gram.  However it fails to do so.  A 4-5 gram difference in kappa carrageenan will do horrors in trying to thicken a recipe.  This is a good, sleek product for a home cook measuring ounces of protein or carbs, but not if you need 3 grams of..well anything.  When testing it to weigh a teaspoon of salt, for example, which should weigh 5 grams, it couldn't read the weight.  If you need to smaller measures, go with a smaller more accurate scale.  However I'll still use it to gauge larger measurements of flour, sugar, etc.
 Using tare with this device is quite frustrating. When you click on the button it effects the reading of what your trying to measure. Usually coming up as inaccurate. If they could make it possible to use the buttons without it effecting the reading it would be fine.
 Compact.  Precise.  I like the multiple measurement options - total ounces or covert to pounds/ounces.  The metal is sturdier than glass and makes it light weight.  I did tailor a DIY flexible screen protector to cover the digital display and the switches to avoid either water or food getting into the slots.  My previous scales have been destroyed by accidental drop (glass) or water (electronics) - I think I'll be good with this one for a while.
 I've had this for only three months and it already does not work properly. You need to remove and replace the battery each time in order to turn it on and it does not tare anymore.<br/><br/>Update: The company contacted me immediately after I wrote my initial review and offered me a replacement.  I received this within a week and the new scale has been working very well. Therefore, I have upgraded my review. Based on the price, this is a very good scale and the customer service is excellent!
 This scale is very easy to use, it's measurement is pretty accurate for meal preps and counting carbs (based on nutrition fact). You can reset the scale with a plate on it so it measures the food only. It displays various measurements (gram, oz, ml, lb, etc). Every convenient to use and appropriate size for the kitchen. I have used to measure meat, nuts, cookies, condiments, etc. It measures from 1g and above.
 This was great when I first got it. It is very small though which I should have looked better at because I prefer a bigger scale for my needs. Lately it has been weighing funny, it seems to go up or down by .3 or so grams or any unit when I weigh things so I really don't think it's getting a good accurate weight. I am going to get a different one eventually but it isn't the worst scale.
 Cheaply made to go with a cheap price. It just looks appealing, don't know how accurate the scale reads. Scale doesn't cut on when you want it to, the metrics continue to flash around whenever it decides to cut on. Probably best to spend some extra money and get something better.
 I like it. Easy to use. Easy to clean. Tear option works great, Just put your empty measuring cup on it, press tear and it only measures the item you put in the measuring cup.<br/>Recommended by<br/>Bob
 It was a good scale until it stopped functioning correctly. I can only weigh in grams because the botton won't work to change it over.<br/><br/>Update: The company has contacted me to resolve the problem. I ended up ordering the scale with the bowl (prior to me seeing their email) from the same company and I'm thinking this one will fit my needs a lot better. I have raised my review to 5 stars for the good customer service.
 I've used it several times every day for two months, and it's great. It toggles quickly between metric and English measurements, and tares (zeroes out) at the push of a button. It's also easy to clean the surface with a spritz of cleaner spray.
 This is a great scale, very accurate and beautiful looking as well. The battery used is a AAA, I hate things with the round batteries and I did make a mistake when I bought a product that had that kind of battery
 Very well made little scale. I was surprised at the quality of fit and finish, and it's ease of use. Beautiful, bright, backlit display you won't need your glasses to read!. And it even times out after a little while to save the battery life. First the backlight goes out after a minute, then it shuts itself off after another few minutes if there's no more activity. Even the packaging and documentation were better than average. A second pair of batteries are also included. I've never heard of Etekcity before, but well done!.
 Drains batteries when sitting turned off in a cabinet. Have to remove batteries after each use to prevent them from being dead next time I want to use it.<br/><br/>EDIT: Etekcity reached out the day I posted this with the offer to send me a new unit. I will update this when I get the new one to say if it was a one-off issue that they fixed promptly with good customer service or a design flaw and prevalent in both scales I have.
 Very nice looking, quality materials and worked out of the box. I weighed an item which I know to be 138 grams and it reported 140 grams. Another quirk is it reports in pounds+ounces (displays 2:11.4 meaning 2 lbs and 11.4 oz) and not pound+decimal which is what I need sometimes.
 We bought this as a first timer/inexpensive scale, and it works well so far. No complaints. There is a small rattle coming from inside the scale, and we didn't drop it or anything, but that doesn't seem to affect it at all.
 provides very precise weight....the main thing I had to learn was to make sure I had everything I weighed ready....so there was no delay in adding materials.....because if the delay is long enough, it shuts off automatically and then it must be re-tared........which is not a BIG deal but causes delay in finishing the task.  I have found it most helpful why recipes call for ingredient weights rather than volume measurements.
 This scale does everything as advertised. I use it for soap making and it is extremely accurate- which is important when working with lye. This is absolutely a great product and I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for a good priced kitchen scale. Also the design is sleek and slender and the surface is sooo easy to clean. 5/5 for sure.
 So far so good. I can see the very sensitive part that ppl are saying but I’m not going to freak out over 3g difference. I’m just using to measure out roughly for healthier eating.
 Not accurate at all!  Tried to weigh several items and not one was close to the actual weight. An 8 oz block of cream cheese weighed 8.38 oz 8.18 and 8.25.  Very frustrating. Returning
 Feels a little underweight compared to the scale it replaced, but it does the job. If I had one complaint, and it's minor, I'd like a scale that does pound + decimal, rather than pound + ounces, so I could measure (for example) 1.3 pounds, instead of having to know 1lb 5.3oz.
 So far I love this scale, great value, looks very nice on counter. Small enough to store out of site ( if you need to) seems durable so far. As far as I can tell very accurate and the “tare” feature works well.
 I have used this more times than I thought I would. I bought it for bread making but use it all the time! It is super easy to use and easy to change the unit of weight. It is small and light and easy to store when not in use.
 I guess I didn't look at the dimensions closely enough. This was smaller than I thought and doesn't weigh as much as I had hoped but that's on me for not looking into it closer. Other wise the product is pretty good and no other problems
 This scale has almost everything that I wanted.  It's attractive, accurate, sleek, simple to use, reasonably priced, and has a pretty color for backlight display.  I gave it 4 stars because of its design flaw.  It's so tiny, that it's hard to read display window if you're always weighing your food on plates.  Kamenstein has a scale that's designed perfectly (kind of shaped like a pork chop), with display window on the side, but it's pricey.  I hope Etekcity can make something similar.
 The scale is precise, it works well, after about a year of use the button starts to fail and not click as easily. This is a gradual problem over time and use, but still worth my $11
 Love this scale! Used it for a year and still haven't changed the batteries. The tare function is fast (just start it up with an empty bowl on top and it zeroes out for you) and it's great for both portion control and those days where you don't feel like dirtying a measuring spoon.
 I love this scale, it is easy to use, I don't like complicated  items . It's  lightweight , thin and small enough to fit in my little drawer where I keep my oven mitts. The display is nice and big.
 Perfect scale at a great price. Burnished metal is easy to clean and keep looking nice. Large, back-lit and angled readout makes it easy to see results regardless of what container or plate you use. Stays on if you need it, but can be turned off quickly to save battery life. I like the out of the way button to change from ounces to grams rather than repeated clicking through an onscreen menu.
 Started on my weight loss journey, and got this scale to help with portion control. It is large enough that it holds my plates comfortably while I measure out my food. Easy to clean since it is stainless steel, and super fashionable. I don't even try to hide it when guests come over. Since I got it, I've lost 10 pounds. Will continue to use!
 The price of this kitchen scale is very reasonable but I got this unit with a promo code, which made it even better to try something out without the feeling of spending too much. This package shipped quickly and came in an envelope. When I picked it up, it was SO LIGHT! Opened the package up, the scale had a nice matte silver color. Came with pre-packaged batteries. Directions were simple to follow. And the product was easy to store in the cabinets after use. Overall, very satisfied with the product!<br/><br/>Side note: Had already received 2 emails from the company's customer service following the purchase to make sure I am satisfied with the product. Never had any other companies do that before. Seems like Etekcity is very sincere to retain their customers!
 Very nice little kitchen scale by etekcity. I own several of their products and haven't had an issue yet.<br/><br/>I don't use this that much for cooking but instead to help me separate large packs of meat that I purchase down at Costco. Usually buy 5 pound packages and this makes it really easy to separate it into 1 pound zip lock bags and into the freezer.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.
 used it for the better part of a year now. Great battery life compared to other brands. No problems whatsoever. This is NOT a huge scale. Make sure it fits your needs. To weigh very large doughballs, we put a plate on top or a bowl, and that works great as well.
 Never measured accurately.  The number would change when nothing was on the scale. When trying to measure it would not register until several items were placed on the scale.
 I received the scale. It does not work. I pulled the tab from the batteries I took the batteries out and put them back I got my own batteries and put them in and it does not work I need to return it and would like a replacement. Thank you for emailing me so I could make contact with you to return the scale. I am anxious to get one that works. Sharon Smith<br/><br/>The company immediately sent me another scale and I returned the one that did not work.  They were very helpful and efficient.  I love the scale, easy to use and is accurate.  Thank you for your quick service.  Sharon Smith
 Love, LOVE this little scale.  It's economical and so easy to use right out of the box.  It cleans up nicely and it's really low profile, so it barely takes up any room on my countertop.  This is the first food scale I've ever owned and I have to say, I just love it.
 Light weight. Easy to use. Easy to read. Super portable. Smallish in size. Comes with batteries. Serves it's purpose for all of my light weight shipping needs. Found on daily deals and I love it!  Fast shipping too.
 Received as promised!  I purchased this specifically for office use.  I haven't used it enough to make an informed review.  It seems to have a difficult time getting the measurement (display flickers).  I'm going to change out the batteries and see if that makes a difference.  If it works better with a battery change, then it's good value for the money.  After all it's just for the office.  I have a cuisinart at home and I love it but it's more industrial.  This is more for loose tea, nuts, etc.
 Loved it! It works as advertised! No problems so far<br/>So it replaced a 10 year old scale that required a power adapter.<br/>It seems as accurate if not better.<br/>I would recommend to anyone.
 The food scale is good. But beware not to use large bowl u can't read the weight. Also dont lose any of the bottom rubber bush. It would not be stable n the reading will be wrong. Now there is an small issue with the unit button. Else the scale is good
 This digital scale is perfect for my needs! It is so much thinner than my previous one, so it stores very easily and doesn't take up much space. I also like that it will calibrate using one of my own bowls. An added bonus was that it came with the batteries needed, so I was able to use it right away. The numbers are clear and easy to read, and the instructions are simple as well. Overall a great value at a very affordable price! Very happy with this purchase!
 Used it for weighing postage and food. Loved this product, very accurate. Too bad the light quit working about 15 months after I got it. At first I thought the problem was dead batteries, but the problem persisted after replacing batteries. If I held the scale at a certain angle, I could see a faint number so I knew it was on. I was very disappointed.
 This is a good quality scale with sufficient battery life, and it was great for daily use for about a year. I think it's not as waterproof as it should be for an item that comes into contact with lots of food, and eventually it wore out.
 I do like this, however I gave it 4 stars just because I had to send in for a replacement. Yes, it comes with batteries and a small user guide. I do like that its compact, slick and perfect for a small kitchen. I have just only started to really use it, but it has held up well and seems accurate.
 Small, sleek and it works. Love this scale. Very precise measurements and I love the tare function. I use it to weigh my meal portions and it works well. Size makes it easy to keep on counter. Barely takes up any space. Stainless makes easy to wipe clean
 So easy to use - turn it on, the tare function flashes  screen clears, and you are ready to go.  Turns itself off, too.  All the features make sense and work quickly.  Takes up very little space and is lightweight.
 Great scale, nice design until it quit working. Conveniently this scaled started giving me a error code out of the blue about the time it was no longer returnable.  Fluke or not, it stinks it didn’t last past a month.
 This is a great scale if you're trying to save space.  It's very small, although i've never had issues with fitting anything on it.  I use it maybe one a week, very accurate but it's great to be able to easily store it with the small footprint it takes up in your kitchen.
 The product is what you would expect at the price point - standard kitchen scale with all the needed functionality. The ease of use, and ability to tare+ toggle through different measurements are all positives. It does seem a bit finicky with smaller measurements or small increments.<br/><br/>What is an overwhelming positive for this product and what would make me recommend it highly is the amazing customer service! Top notch with quick and friendly responses.
 Worked for a little over a year and then stopped turning on out of nowhere. One day it worked and one day it didn't. I've tried changing the batteries multiple times and looked up troubleshooting online and nothing helps. It was a good scale but doesn't have a good shelf life. Super unfortunate that it doesn't work anymore. Other than that it’s a pretty standard scale. Easy to clean but I don’t love how quick it turns off automatically.
 I had initially given this a poor review but the company sent me a new one and I am happy to say that this one has been working strong for quite awhile!<br/><br/>Previous review: Quit working after about a month. My previous scale lasted about 5 yrs. I bought another replacement of a different brand, and this one is still working after 6 months and I love it! Don't get this Etekcity one, keep looking!!
 Handy scale for weighing food portions, and smaller things. Don't know about the really small stuff that some reviews say it isn't accurate but it does all I need it to do.
 It looks good and is easy to use, but from some angles it's hard to read the display even when it's lit up. When I have a large bowl on top of it, I have to look at it from a low angle, and the display turns black and uneadable. I'm always second guessing 😒
 This kitchen scale is exactly what I wanted.  Thin, lightweight and very accurate. I like the fact that you can set it to ignore the weight of the container holding the food.  Great product!
 Nice looking, feels well built and has a backlit display, which is cool. The smallest thing it weighs is 3 grams and it measures to the nearest whole gram. I have not used it with any fluids or 'non-metric' measurements. It can be switched to measure ml, oz and lb/oz. very happy with this product. I give 4/5 stars, the only things missing is the ability to weigh in less than 1g increments.
 I used this a few times a day &amp; the batteries would die once every other week. Over 2 months I spent more on batteries than the scale. Such a waste. Also, The screen is dim &amp; hard to read. I've had two other digital scales that were much better products.
 It's a shame, because it's a beautiful piece that's very easy to store. Unfortunately, it read a different measurement every time. Even in the dead center of the scale with a solid object (shot glass, in my case) it came up a different weight every time I weighed it. I plan to return it.
 I've used many kitchen scales but this one by far is a great addition to my countertop family. It cleans well because of its one piece design, measures accurately, and looks spiffy. I use the scale for meal prep as well as baking and it has not let me down yet. I am so glad I purchased this scale.
 The scale was easy to set up and is very accurate in its measurements. It is big enough to do the job, but small enough to not be in the way on the counter. It is perfect for our needs in the kitchen.
 This scale is terrible. It doesn’t also detect small weights and it tends to add a gram to anything over 10 grams. I tested this with calibration weights. I’d have returned it, but I missed the period by a week. The scale I was trying to replace has been dropped numerous times and it is still more accurate. Extremely disappointed.
 I'm happy with the purchase; however, the online Amazon photo seems to indicate you get 4 batteries with the purchase.  I only received 2...the photo should be corrected so not to confuse customers.
 I gave them 5 stars because of their excellent customer service. I got one and the screen lights were dim then went out. When I contacted the company they gave me 2 options, either a refund or they would send me another one. I really like the scale so I opted to try another one. This one works. The scale is perfect for my family when we are measuring our foods. I would recommend this product because of their customer service.
 Nice little kitchen scale. It’s fairly small so easy to store in a drawer. Weight has been accurate so far (see 113g butter displays right at 113g). Love the stainless, looks nice out on the counter!
 This a very accurate scale and I like that you can change the measurement from ounces to grams and more. It's small and portable and very easy to use. Another plus was that the batteries were included.
 Precision seems to be off by around 5g. Sometimes I'll weigh something and it's 50g, sometimes it's 55g. Same item. Or when I tare, then put something on it, then take it off, instead of showing zero it might show 4-6g. That can be a big difference, depending on what you're baking.<br/><br/>Also, it feels pretty flimsy, especially how the buttons click.<br/><br/>But overall, if all you need is an approximate weight, it will do the trick
 This scale looks very nice and easy to use.  The display is difficult to read, though, and if you don't change the batteries once a week, you won't be able to read it at all.  We got tired of replacing it and bought another scale for a little more that was more expensive.  However, we save the difference in batteries in a month!
 So I ordered one of these in June and absolutely loved it. Arrived quickly, super easy to use etc. I went on vacation in July and and when I got back it had stopped working. I was outside the return window but I contacted the seller to see what they had to say. One of the best customer service experiences I've had. They immediately sent me a new one free of charge, and didn't even ask to have the old one sent back. Very helpful and the new one works wonderfully. I'll be buying another one for my boyfriend for his birthday. Thank you!
 My needs are limited. I track nutrition and and cook a few British recipes that specify quantities in grams. I am sure there are better kitchen scales out there, but I can’t imagine a home kitchen requirement that this product can’t satisfr.
 Have been using it almost daily since I received the scale. Worked perfectly fine, backlight stayed on for the time I needed it and weight seems on point. Easy to clean and keep clean! But then the battery died and when I went to replace them, the scale didn’t turn on, when it eventually did it would not reset to ‘0’ or turn off at all. The batteries were new even tried them with different ones and nothing. It worked fine until then.
 bought because i started working out a couple years ago and when i go into cutting i need my rations to be exact...this is pretty accurate and easy to use.
 Used this scale a few times and then left it alone for a few weeks until I needed to use it again. Trying to use the scale after a few weeks sitting turned off in the cupboard I found that it would simply not function. The cheap included battery's had corroded and even after replacing them and cleaning the connectors the scale would not function. Hugely disappointing to have this break so quickly even with it's low price. I would certainly return if that were still an option.
 Finally have my kitchen scale!<br/>I love it because it's light weighted.<br/>It comes with two battery.<br/>One the right hand side, there is a button for you to switch between different units!<br/>Awesome for my baking life!
 I returned this scale after using it only once.  It was easy to tare.  It times out too quickly to add ingredients.  When weight is taken off it didn't zero.  I weight a 3 lb item 10 times and it gave me a different weight each time.  It wouldn't find a weight and stay there.  It would migrate up and down over 15 grams.  I do not recommend this scale.
 I love this scale. It is thin, sleek with a good sized surface area. The lighted blue display is very easy to read and looks so cool against the stainless metal. Operation is intuitive. I have another kitchen scale back home in PA. I have used it and loved it for several years. I will be replacing it with this scale when I get back in Spring.
 This scale is super easy to use. Put a plate or something on it and turn it on and it will automatically go to zero, ready to start weighing. It looks nice and is easy to clean. It has been interesting to weigh foods while trying to figure out portion control for my current weight loss program. I definitely would recommend this to others.
 This is a great little scale for mobile food logging or weighing. If you need exact weights in a kitchen setting, you should look towards a larger scale.<br/><br/>I love this little scale. It's sleek looking, it's small enough to easily fit in my backpack, and it works great in weighing my meals. I use it everyday to measure caloric and macronutrient intake during my meals while I'm at college. The scale is easy to opperate, including the auto-tare. The scale is aethetically pleasing with the stainless steel finish. The scale's price is avearge for cheap scales on amazon but this one looks sleeker and has no lifted parts or moving parts unlike other scales. What I mean is the measuring area is not lifted above the unit, meaning it's easily contained and better for travel.<br/><br/>The LCD screen could have a little better contrast as the screen can be difficult to read. The bottom of the scale is plastic which reduces weight but also feels sort of cheap. This plastic could be an issue around heat but, as i said at the start of the review, get a different bigger and more durable scale for kitchen needs.<br/><br/>Pros: Everything is contained in the body so no lifted parts, nice stainless steel finish, easy functionality, cheap<br/><br/>Cons: LCD can be difficult to read at times, plastic underbody.
 This food scale is easy to use, easy to read and very compact.  It fits in a drawer in my kitchen so I can pull it out and turn it on right when I need it, and don't lose any of my counter top space.  It looks nice and seems to be accurate too!  I'm hoping it will help me learn to better gauge obscure portion sizes, like 3oz of crackers or 4g of salami that I can't easily verify without a scale.
 Not sensitive enough.  Is not accurate when weighing low weight items.  When comparing to my other scales, it simply doesn't work with lower weight items.
 First, I was pleasantly surprised it came with batteries. How nice! Then very impressed with how versatile it is. You can easily find and switch the unit of measure you're looking for just by pressing a button. You can also easily zero out a plate/carton etc. It's small and portable, yet durable and idiot proof. I love it!
 Just received my scale today and there are small scratches all over it. Haven’t even used it yet and am very disappointed in quality<br/><br/>EDIT 11/15/18: Though my scale was scratched upon arrival (shipped directly from Amazon warehouse), Etekcity has great customer service and fixed the issue. Other than the scratches, the scale seems to work great and I haven't had any issues. Will most definitely purchase from this company again!
 This is a great little scale.  It performs well and lets me accurately weight my food products.  The first scale that was shipped to me had a problem when trying to switch the units.  I contacted the company and they made it right very quickly.  I was impressed by their customer service.
 When I got it, one of the rubber feet was already peeled off and I had to super glue it back on. Then it died completely after limited usage in hardly any time. Changed batteries - still didn’t help. Display comes up and shows gibberish. Worth noting that I didn’t get it wet or abuse it at all. You get what you pay for I guess...
 This is a fantastic scale! It is compact and stores in a breeze. It is accurate in grams or ounces, it even weighed how much a small plastic sandwich bag weighs. It adjusts for whatever container you place on it to hold what it is you want to weigh. This product is worth every penny.
 Disappointed wit this scale,,despite the other good reviews. I like the sleek look of stainless steel, but the numbers on the screen are not visible when you put your food on the scale,. It is a poor design. I did not realize this flaw until I went to use it.....
 Great scale.  It seems accurate enough for what I am using it for (meal prep).  Only complaint I would say is the display can be hard to read at certain angles and that the surface doesn't clean off as easily as I would expect.  At the price point though, I think it is a great buy.
 Arrived on time, nicely packed,Nice and slim so I can tuck it away out of sight. Easy to use Tare function. I bought it to weigh flour,sugar,etc for baking. Easy to switch from grams to ounces .. so far very pleased. Four stars only because iv not really used it in baking yet. Just been setting it up and playing with it. But I’m sure it will work out just fine. Picture with spoon on it shows how small scale is. Scale is turned off .
 I don't think I could be any happier with this scale. As an American I did not want to commit to having a weighted scale in my kitchen but this is super small and I can tell a big difference when using European recipes that using the weight is so much better than trying to convert everything into cups.  Totally worth it and I love it!!
 this has to be the nicest scale in its price range.  a stainless steel surface and backlit LCD are two very nice features. i had to deduct one star because the viewing angle of the LCD is not very good, and you pretty much need to look straight down to see the numbers.
 It works well for the price but it doesn't do half grams so it makes it hard to know the exact weight on a lot of stuff
 I use this scale to weigh my hand-crafted caramel. It is very sensitive. I love its low profile. I keep it on the counter top under a fruit basket with a lower of about 2 inches.  My only complaint is that it is affected at higher weights. I just make sure to calibrate the scale before using it. I love the fact that you can weigh in grams, ounces or pounds.
 I’ve made so many quality gains from having this thing. Game changer. Works great, haven’t had to replace a battery yet and it has been like a year. My only complaint is that it feels a little weak, id like a heavier/more durable model.
 I upgraded from analog scale, and this product helped a lot save time measuring. The quality is very good. I love it.<br/>Update: LCD went blank after just a few use.  Quality became questionable.
 I bought this with just a cheap kitchen scale in mind, but this is a very pretty addition to the kitchen! this looks a lot better in person than the pictures! Also if you are portioning food in any way than you definitely need one of these!
 Would not work. Will turn on but when something was placed on the scale, it will not weigh it. Also, when the tare button is pressed it turns the scale off. Would not reccomend.
 This is a handy scale. It seems pretty accurate and helps when following a cutting diet where portions have to be weighed. It's easy to use and the battery lasts quite a while. Overall it's a good product.
 After seeing a review about the accuracy and the scale not staying at zero I thought I'd risk it because of the amount of good reviews it got. Now I'm not a professional food scale expert but I've had this scale for over a month now and I absolutely love it! Currently on weight watchers and this little guy comes in handy. I highly recommend getting this!
 Unless looking straight down at it, the display is hard to read.
 Seems super accurate, and its aesthetically perfect. Doesn't stick out like a sore thumb in my kitchen and its stainless steel everything! It has different unit options, which I love. Reset the weight easily with one button. And its so easy to stick in a cabinet somewhere because its so thin and tiny.
 The backlit LCD screen can be anywhere from hard to impossible to read from most angles. It looks like the newer version of this scale may have fixed this by changing the color of the screen to black instead of blue/white...but its still backlit so who knows. Other than that, the scale is great. Very accurate and consistent. The stainless steel finish looks great in a modern kitchen. In the end, I'd go with the newer version.
 Love the scale! The finish is smooth and the scale is slim. Looks great in the kitchen on the counter. The scale seems very accurate. Also easy to wipe down after use. The backlight does go off after 10 seconds, but you can still see the previous reading.  I have been looking for a long time and this is everything I wanted in a scale. Wish I would have found sooner!
 I've only had it for a day or two, but I must say it is VERY good. I had an electronic scale previously that finally broke after about 7 years, and this one had good reviews, so I ordered it. It's very intuitive if you've ever had an electronic scale before, and it's small and thin. I like that it doesn't take up a lot of space on the kitchen counter. I'll update the review as I use it to measure my food portions and give it a good workout.
 Love the small size, and compactness of this scale. I appreciate that you can set a container on the scale and zero it out so that you are then weighing just the items in the container and not the items+ the container. I've been using this frequently when I make fig jam.
 Will give a zero star if I could, it is very inaccurate in terms of scaling. The minimum to weight is 3 grams. Very dull and coarse-grained, not good for measuring anything accurate.
 Items arrived new but had multiple issues.<br/>Would not calibrate to zero.  Put it on multiple flat surfaces, and it always registered at least 7 ozs.  I tried to turn it off manually by pressing the on/off button per the instructions, it would not turn off.  I waited the 2 minutes for it to turn off on it's own and then it would not turn back on without taking the batteries out and then putting them back in.  I tried replacing the batteries but the same problem continued.  Returning item for a different brand.  I know that it was pretty inexpensive, but I would expect it to at least turn on and off and register at zero!
 This scale is easy to use and measures weight to the tenth of an ounce.  It is very accurate and is small enough to have handy on the counter to weigh everything, so I know exactly how much I'm eating!  Having the scale right there is a big help.  I love using it and every household should have one!  You won't be disappointed with this scale, and the price is right!
 JUNK! I bought this based on reviews. I was not expecting a lot for the price, but i did not count on it breaking in two weeks. It no longer reads numbers on the screen. Save your money.
 I purchased this item (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0113UZJE2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0) December 16, 2016, as a gift and found out today (Feb 2) that it is no longer working and that the deadline for return was yesterday, Feb 1.  Needless to say, I am not pleased.  I would have expected more from a popular item like this.  The gift recipient told me that it had stopped working about two weeks ago.  As a loyal Amazon Prime member I am really disappointed.  If I had known that the scale had stopped working, I could have returned it for replacement.
 This this is slick. The lcd display is back lit so easy to use in the dark and easy to read in the day..small compact so it don't take up a lot of space if you have a small kitchen like I do...It's easy to use for various weight applications. The chrome look is a nice touch !
 Some things had to be weighed a couple of times to ensure weight. Not very sensitive.I was weighing coffee beans and when I would drop more on it would not properly update the weight, all items had to be removed and put back on the scale, very inconvenient. I probably would spend a little more for a better quality next time.
 This little scale is perfect.  It's small, so I can leave it sitting on the counter, and I use it every day to weigh things.  If you're weighing food for nutritional purposes or dieting, this is a perfect little scale for that.
 Good little food scale.  No frills, does exactly what I need it to.<br/><br/>Update:  stopped working after less than three months of use.<br/><br/>Edit:  Customer service was very quick to respond.  Shipped a new scale free of charge which I received in two days.  Great service.
 I bought this scale to measure food portions while I was dieting- horrible scale.<br/><br/>The weight would change if the same item is placed on the scale and taken off. I would measure can goods and household items that listed the weight- the scale' s calibration is wayyy off. If this scale isused for recipes I'm sure the end result wouldn't be good because of it's inability to measure correctly.
 NOTE: They ask about battery life and although I gave it 5 stars, I really don't know since I just received it, but the scale is lightweight, very sleek and inexpensive....now if I can just get mynewborn puppies to stay still while I try to weigh them!! lol.
 This is the perfect sized scale for someone wanting to keep track of their diet and portion sizes. The scale is very low profile and weighs in one of 4 units (g / ml / oz / lb&amp;oz. It also has a tare function to help zero out the weight of a plate, bag, etc.<br/><br/>I'm very happy with this purchase and have nothing but positive experiences with products from Etekcity.
 I LOVE this scale! I spent countless hours doing research and trying to figure out which scale to buy online. They are not to be found in stores and this is one product I really would have preferred to be able to see in person before buying it. Reviews only go so far. Nonetheless, I am very, very happy with my choice. I love the compact size (and not ridiculously small like a pocket scale), the design and that I was able to start using it immediately without any problems whatsoever. Oh, and the best part of all - the price for a quality product. :)
 This is some much better than our mechanical scale and much more accurate. My wife and I have medical issues that require us to count carbs and we do this a lot by weight. This also comes at a great price and it's really easy to use right out of the box. It looks great too.
 I love that it's so compact and sleek in design. I have only tested it out but not used it for a recipe yet. Their customer service is amazing--a rep sent me an email with FAQs and urged me to reach out if I neef anything. And it came with batteries. Love this brand already!
 I recently went on a weight loss program and needed to weigh some of my food. this scale sits on my counter top doesn't hardly<br/>take up any space easy to read . if you need one it works great.
 Should be called a proximity scale. Put the same Avocado on it and got 3 different results, same as when I tapped any item on it. It's pretty but does not measure consistently and correctly.
 It performs it function, but it's quite small so anything of any size obscures the display.... if it could have been angled on the side surface so you could at least see it from the side, it would have been much preferred.
 Gave this a 3 star because the 1st day I used this it read UnEr &amp; wouldn't work. Needed this at my business to weigh Coffee beans &amp; noticed it won't register until 3 grams. Also shuts off after 20 seconds &amp; during my pour over it takes 2:30-3:00 mins. Very disappointed in this scale &amp; may return it.
 I was surprised by the size and weight, well balanced between the two. Seems to work well and I like the back light function to see the display. For the price you won't go wrong
 Stylish, compact, an asset to any kitchen. I'm a man, and I guess I'm not supposed to buy stuff like this because it's not manly - bull!  I do my own cooking, and sometimes I need to be more accurate than  "that feels about right", so I weigh. It looks good enough to just leave on the counter, and mine has it's own little corner of the precious little space.
 I received the scale today. It is easy to use and accurate. I weighed a cup of water from a measuring cup; it was on eight ounces. I will be using the scale often since am using it to weigh portion sizes.  I have been dieting going on two years so I will continue to use it. Also to maintain my weight I will still use it.  If it let's me down I will report that also. I use Myfitnesspal. So easy you can operate without directions. But it did come with directions. I like that it measures grams, ml, oz.
 I weigh all of my food and track it, so this scale comes in quite handy. I've never had an issue with it and use it several times a day. I can also leave it out in the kitchen because the silver finish looks so nice and modern. It is light and I'm able to take it on trips as well. I've been using it for 6 months and haven't had to replace the batteries yet.
 Absolutely wonderful! It arrived fast and without damage and works perfectly! I love that it's small enough to put in a kitchen drawer to keep out of the way. The scale has helped tremendously with my meal planning because I can weigh out EXACTLY what I need for the day! I would definitely recommend this. BUY IT!
 I bought this scale for my crested gecko and it is perfect! The readings are super quick and i can wipe off the surface so easily. Perfect for keeping up with his weight gain!
 Just received this yesterday so it's day one.  It will not register grams until it get's to 3.  Considering I use 2 grams of magnesium powder at night, this is a problem for me.  It seems very precise on ounces though.  Looks like I'll have to return it.
 I love the small size of this and the fact that it is all one piece.  We had a different one that kept coming apart and this one is easy to use and clean.  You can even set a plate on this and weigh food so the scale doesn't get dirty.
 I purchased this scale to use in my craft room to measure yardage remaining in a ball of yarn per the ball weight..... Unfortunately this scale seems to require a 5g minimum to register at all and so the slight differences aren't shown. As such, this scale has limited functionality for fine measurements. As a partial work around I add another heavier item (ie. Fountain pen) with and without the ball of yarn to calculate the difference for the ball weight. It's less than ideal but it is the only way I've found to see the weight under 5g.
 Works great! Perfect for keeping my food on track. I like that I can use different measurement types (oz, gram, etc) and I can take the measurement of the container out and get the value of the food. I'd recommend!
 Bought this for my pottery studio to measure out clay.  I have had it for over 2 years and have only had to replace the batteries once.  It works great.  Love it.
 Works well other than when putting a bowl or something on it and trying to tare it out. The way the buttons are part of the sensing area really makes it a pain. I use it for portion control for cooking meals. It does work well once you get use to the tare issue. Love the size and thinness of the scale though. Display is actually blue on mine not purple, btw.
 Great scale! Love that it's small and lightweight. Minus one star for automatically turning off too quickly when not in use. I walked away to get food to put on the scale in a few seconds and it turned off. Good feature for saving battery but way too quickly.
 My husband and I have been focusing on some new food and eating habits that require careful calculation of serving sizes and weights. We got tired of guessing and finally gave into buying a food scale that would simplify things for us. We couldn't be happier so far with this product from Etekcity. It is small, looks beautiful, easy to clean, and is accurate in its measurements. And, even my husband can use it! We love that you can quickly change from grams to ounces, etc. and the "tare" function is very, very useful. And to top it off, the price was more than right. We would probably pay more for something like this that has made our kitchen life and meal planning so much easier.
 Wont weight grams.<br/><br/>Works worse when negging out a cup.<br/><br/>Difficult to turn off.<br/><br/>Wish I had returned it first thing and purchased a quality scale.
 They were not kidding when this is described as petite. This scale is a bit smaller than I expected, but I bought it to weigh ingredients for soaps and lotions, which never require large amounts. It is easy to read and so convenient to switch between measures of ounces and grams.  I am planning to purchase another as a gift. Great price for everything you get.
 I had to buy a scale to count the fat, protein, and carbs of my diet. I was excited to find this one at such an affordable price. It is very sensitive and very accurate. I would highly recommend it to anyone starting a new eating plan or for recipes.
 Worked for one use and then died, changing batteries did not fix. I didn’t have original packaging, so I was unable to return... DO NOT BUY THIS!
 It's not accurate at all. I weighed a nickel, quarter and a penny and each coin was off 1 - 2 grams. I put 2 brand new duracell batteries in as well just to check. Still off by 1 - 2 grams. Sending it back. This is the 2nd scale I've bought in the last 5 months (both were best sellers on Amazon and not sponsored best sellers) I don't know which one to try next, they all seem to be Made in China pieces of crap.
 This is my first food scale and I love it! I especially love the tear function so I can put items in their containers and not dirty the scale and not have to worry about the added weight!
 The item was bigger and better than I had anticipated. Very happy with this purchase and seller. I would highly recommend this product.
 Please note it only goes up to 11lbs / 5 kg! I find this is the perfect amount without going overboard and getting a 10kg one.
 I absolutely love how thin this scale is.  It makes it able to fit into a much narrower space in my pantry than my previous one.  I also love the purple display because I love the color purple.  I tested it out by weighing some substances on both this scale and my old scale and the weights were right on between the two.  I would definitely buy this again.
 Great 👍 little scale with a nice price.  It works excellently even for me, who needs help setting a alarm ⏰ clock.  It's made very well and should last a long time.  I'm a happy customer and will recommend it to my friends .
 Feels kind of cheap...but what do you expect, it is cheap..Looks good, works great.  I have no complaints.  Easy to store, easy to clean.  Seems very accurate.
 I bought this for my girlfriend for christmas and now plan to get one for myself. This is especially great for measuring out ingredients in baking, as the same volume of flour can differ as much as 50% in weight. My girlfriend loves using it for bread making, and I have borrowed it for a couple recipes of my own.
 Great price, but the instructions are tiny. I had to call the company to get an email copy so I could read them. I had a little trouble with something that I thought would be easy. It's probably me....age related, lol!
 I really like the sleek high end appearance of my new scale. I especially love the compact size for our tiny kitchen, it fits nicely in our cupboard so it is out of sight. I plan on using it to help calculate the amount of portions in our meals and this will do the trick. The tare function is definitely a necessity.  I will update my review after a few weeks of use.
 Great small footprint and sleek, easy-to-clean design, but has started giving me issues after only a couple months: doesn't always turn on or tare when I press the button, and have already had to replace the batteries once. I'm using it every couple days, so intensity of use doesn't account for these malfunctions.
 Had it for a week and a half and seems to be a very good quality scale. I like that the numbers light up for easy viewing in the dark and that the surface is stainless steel.<br/><br/>Update:<br/><br/>After one month of use I noticed that I couldn't measure 4 grams of tea; it just wasn't registering. Then I tried putting a nickel on the scale to see how accurate it was (as a nickel should weigh 5 grams), and it read anywhere from 4 to 6 grams. I use this to weigh beans for brewing Chemex coffee and I'm not sure that I can trust what the scale says. It's really a bummer.
 Very happy with this scale.  I especially like the way it zeroes out when I start it with a container on it so that I can then weigh what I put in the container.  Seems accurate and sensitive, though I don't have a second scale to check it against so I have to trust it on accuracy.
 I don't like the display.  It's like you have to be directly above it to read it.  If I put a small bowl or small plate on it, it is difficult to see the display since you have to look at it at an angle.  I like the functionality enough to buy a different Etekcity scale to try (the one that comes with a bowl).
 So far so good. Seems pretty precise and has good functionality like being able to set the scale to 0 after placing a bowl on the scale, changing measurements, etc.
 The product is great! LOVE IT. It is compact and small to fit in my draw in the kitchen. It does not take up very much room to store. I wanted it to weight my food and to be able to pack it with me. I would purchase it again. I have had other food scales in the past and really like the one.
 Small scale, easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store.<br/>Nice price.<br/>Fast shipping, good packing.<br/>Satisfied customer.<br/>I've only had the scale for about a week, so I've only used it a few times.<br/>If any problems develop, I will try to post an update.
 While the scale was accurate, had a good battery life, easy to use, I must rate this a 3/5. It is not conditioned being in the kitchen, I placed it on a wet surface (mind you, not soaking, but wet) and it has stopped working. While I understand electronics, and realize (and accept partial responsibility) this scale should be able to withstand some wetness.<br/><br/>UPDATED 5/28/17 - I have been contacted by a member of the Etekcity team, and they have offered me a new one for free. I will update once again if/when the scale arrives.
 The display arrived broken. The second digit does not show completely, I have no idea if I am measuring out 150, 100 or 180g. Renders this useless. Otherwise small and compact.
 Very sleek and modern design, looks very nice in my kitchen. My only minor complaint is that the buttons are weight sensitive, when tareing or changing units your finger will change the weight on the scale. Other than that it is a great product. Etekcity also makes it very easy to get your warranty setup and I thank them for that.
 Well, it worked for a year and just died over night. Won't turn on. But what really drove me nuts about this scale is the one minute automatic shut off. ONE minute. I use (well, used) it for making pour over coffee and it would super irritate me to pour the water on the grounds, walk away to attend to my eggs cooking while the coffee did it's thing, and then come back to find it shut off and I would have no idea how many grams of water I already poured. Grrrr! Buying a Hario to replace this one.
 Works like a charm for very light things such as mail and recipes.<br/><br/>I like the fact that you can put the empty container down first before turning it on, and it assumes that is zero.<br/>Anything you add after than is the weight of the contents!
 Purchased this to weigh my sons Pinewood Derby car for Cub Scouts. It worked perfectly! We got the car to 4.9 oz (5 oz limit). My son won 2nd place for speed at the derby (of course not entirely due to this scale mind you).
 Works perfectly. I almost had a hissy fit because when I went to turn it on, the lights only flashed and didn't work. I opened the battery case and saw that the batteries were in place, but still had the plastic wrap on them (kind of strange way to ship them!), but as soon a I took it off, it worked without a hitch. Love the tare feature so I can put food in my own bowl. Excellent value!
 I did a lot of research before buying this product.  The price is great and the ease of use is even better. There are many scales to choose from but I was not looking for gimmicks - just a reliable and straightforward scale.  I am truly pleased.
 I had ordered this scale and upon receiving it I noticed that it didn't seem to zero-out properly. It worked, then it didn't and then I just figured I was out of luck, but I posted online that this was my experience and the company read my post and offered to send a replacement. Happy to report that the replacement works perfectly fine and has continued to do so.<br/>For the very affordable price, I would definitely recommend this scale. It's great in the kitchen and very easy to use.
 This scale is quite small and light weight, so it is easy to stash in a cupboard.  I put it on end, like a book in the library.  The surface is small, though, so when you are measuring large quantities, a bowl with a bit of a pedestal makes it easier to see the numbers.  Numbers are bright and clear.  This is a great scale for the price.
 This product is perfect for weighing small items. I mainly bought this device to weigh boxes for shipping and its been great. small size easy to store, on/off button, large LCD easy to read and selection lb/kg. Stainless steel top makes it look nice an d sleek, perfect for use in kitchen. All in all great buy and very useful product.
 I really like this scale. I use it to measure my ingredients for soap making.  It came with the batteries, and its digital. I can change the metric, and it is very accurate. I wish it was a little bigger, but it gets the job done. Highly recommend.
 Please read other buyer reviews and issue resolution. Many mention the scales inability to weigh items less than 5 grams. This is absolutely the case with my scale. The scale does, however, accurately weigh items above that amount. The appearance and size is very nice. It runs on two AAA batteries. Batteries included. If it were able to give accurate readings for lighter items without taring tricks i'd give it 5 stars.
 I bought this for measuring ingredients for sourdough recipes.  It is light and easy to work with and store.  However, they say the screen will shut off in 2 minutes of no activity, in reality it goes blank in less than 30 seconds even when there is activity.  When it comes back on it is zero, not what the past measurement was.  Also, the readings jump around too much.  For the price I won't bother with a return, it will go to Goodwill.  Our small postal spring scale got lost in a recent move, will try to find one locally.  Very disappointed.
 The scale works well. It is a bit on the smaller side, so that needs to be considered when using a container to weight items...you may not be able to see the display with the container on the scale.
 This is an attractive and accurate scale, and not really bad deal for this price. But this scale gave a different weight each time the item was placed on it,so you have to make sure placed your item in middle of scale every time.In fact,I got little disappointment with my expectations.
 Good product
 I absolutely love this scale.  It is small, thin, light weight and easy to use.  You can set any object on it and zero it out so you can get an accurate reading on measuring only your food.  I measure all my protein for portion control.  This is a permanent fixture on my counter.
 Got this for a great price (considering Bed Bath and Beyond's cheapest digital scale was about $40). Simple, easy to use. Easy to clean, though I'm not sure if there is a seal on the buttons on top, so i'm careful letting a sponge or paper towel get in there. Maybe they all do this, but I love that I put an empty plate on it and turn it on and it sets to zero automatically, so I can start measuring immediately.  Cool. It's also very easy to switch metrics. Some packages list in grams, others in ounces.
 The scale is alright.  Not as accurate as I would like or expect from a digital scale.  The variance of the scale is within 0.04+/-.  Which is pretty big difference when you are trying to get to 1oz.  It will show 0.98 and then 1.02 the next... no change... just bouncing between and no 1.00.
 A foot broke off after a few months and now the scale is useless; the feet are plastic and attached at two tiny spots. I never measured anything heavy, just cooking ingredients. The scale uses the pressure at the points where they're attached to the scale to measure the weight, so without them the scale doesn't work. Poor design poorly constructed.
 I bought this Scale to monitor/track weight progress for a Blue Tegu I rescued. So far this scale work perfect. I am very satisfied with this product. Thank you Etekcity.<br/>-Austin
 I got this item 2 days ago. First I was exited to use it. After that I was very disappointed because it didn't work. I changed batteries or even looked up on the internet how to use it. I've followed the video how to use this scale but it still didn't work. It is such a piece of junk. I'll never ever order anything from this seller anymore.
 Alright for the price but not terrible accurate at lower weights<br/><br/>Edit: Although the scale was not what I expected Etekcity went above and beyond with their customer service to address my concerns. I gave an extra two stars because they are a solid company to deal with.
 This is an awesome little scale and the price just can't be beat. We've had it for about a year now and it's still accurate and looks brand new. It's easy to use, small and lightweight, but capable of giving accurate weight for everything from a tiny packet of spices to a big lump of beef roast. It's proven itself to be durable, easy to use, easy to clean, reliable, and a great value for the price.
 Just started a diet and having this thing comes in handy. Measuring is simple, and love the design. Feels nice for a scale, and is quite light and simple design lets me put it almost anywhere as not to make my counter cluttered.
 Love it.  So easy to use.  Great for measuring on the KETO way of eating
 Really happy with this scale. It's large enough I can but big mixing bowls on it and seems very accurate. Love that it turns off automatically, too. It also looks really nice and doesn't take up much storage room.
 Measures weight from 4 individual feet on the bottom  instead of the plate. Seems a little inconsistent, and doesn't do light weights real well. Wouldn't buy again.
 This scale is simple to use and clean.  It is easy to set to zero so food can be weighed on a plate or napkin.  Perfect for our needs.
 I bought this scale primarily to weigh bags of breastmilk that I pump right into at work. I've been using it way more than expected tho- it's helping me be more conscious of my serving sizes and calorie counting. The scale functions well- I turn it on and it zeros itself. The backlight doesn't stay on long but as soon as you place something on the scale it turns back on. I can rezero it easily and flip through the different measurements. This was a great purchase.
 I put this little scale through the ringer and it is still holding on nicely. I love the tare feature. And it weighs in several different types of measurements (I use oz and grams most frequently).
 This Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale is quite amazingly accurate and very easy to use! I was actually worried about it being flimsy and inaccurate, but it is quite durable and spot-on! While meal-preping and used other unreliable devices; accuracy is very important. Thank you for the great deal as it was also reasonably priced.
 I've been using this scale for the last 8 months and it's great.  I weigh my food and you're able to zero out the weight *tare) if you have a container on the scale.  Multiple settings make it great to use, so I also use it to weigh coffee beans before I grind every morning.
 One day after opening the scale it doesn't work. The problem is in the LCD Display. Although it lights yet the illumination is hiding the numbers. You have to tilt the scale over 60degrees to see the numbers.
 It’s a nice, light design, however.... it is not accurate. Weighed multiple things and it’s over the actual weight. I guess it’s better than being lower because then you over eat what you’re weighing, but wish it was more accurate and I am upset about it, but don’t want to go through the trouble of a return process. I will just go with another companies product.
 This scale is not at all accurate when measuring things on the scale of 1 gram.  It varies widely when you are dealing with things &lt;20 grams.  You can add a great deal of your item onto the scale and it will not change the reading on the scale.  I have not used it with "heavier" items and thus cannot comment on that.  I am giving it 3 stars because it is beautifully constructed and the reading/LED is wonderful.  I hope it will work with "heavier" items better.
 zero'd and works great right out of the box. I got to weigh silver and packages since my other scales only go up to 10 oz. You cant beat this scale for the money. and You can find them in about 5 other colors. Regardless of what they say the brand is, they are all the same.
 For the price, amazing little product. I use it every day to make sure I am tracking my food accurately. It has a bunch of different measurements that lets me pair it with MyFitnessPal extremely easily, and I'm so addicted to it and its accuracy, I've thought about bringing it to work with me as well.
 I have used this scale for a variety of things and I have found it works surprisingly well.  The measurements seem really accurate and there are plenty of unit options to choose from.  The only issue I have with the scale is that it turns off too quickly if something is left on the scale.  If that happens you have to empty the container and items you are weighing and re-zero the scale  with the container.
 This item is perfect!! Well could use a little notch on back to hang on wall, but other than that its perfect!! Very easy to figure out kg, lbs, etc.  AND its lit purple!! Cannot beat it, even the price is great!  Last time I bought a food scale it was completely old school.  Things have sure changed.  I HIGHLY recommend this product! If you need to place food in a bowl or a container, just put the container-empty-on the scale and then zero out.  I use this product a lot!
 My boyfriend is a bodybuilder. I loves it when I measure all his food out. This isn't my first time buying a product from this company. I never has any issues with my others products.<br/><br/>This scale is useful for cooking and probably other uses. Yet, I find it nice because its lightweight and super easy to store.<br/>The look is super sleek.
 The scale is fine as long as you do not need precision. It is maybe accurate to +/- 3g, but not to the gram.<br/><br/>Would not recommend.<br/><br/>Edit: Dead after 2 months. Definitely would not recommend.
 This scale came with the batteries...an unexpected surprise.  Appreciate the 11 lb max which is great for weighing in mixing bowls and for weighing garden produce.  The scale switches easily between oz and g.  I'm extremely happy with the scale.  Purchased on sale it was an exceptional value and a significant improvement over my previous scale with a 3 lb limit. The slim profile allows it to be tucked away easily when not in use.
 This is a great little scale, with emphasis on the little. I bought it to weigh my pet rabbit, and it is smaller than I would like for that use. However, that is my fault for not reading the description thoroughly. If you just want to weigh small things this scale will work great, and it looks quite nice.
 This scale is exactly what I needed and had been looking for. It is sleek, easy to use, very accurate (in my opinion) and easy to store when not in use. I bake bread a lot and measuring out the flour cup by cup was a messy and tedious process. Weiging the amount of flour I need is a better method  and this scale is precisely what I need.
 Love using this little scale. Have started tracking my food intake and this scale is great. It is compact and can be left on the counter without being too much of an eye sore. Also packs easy for travel with the slim design. Have recommended the same scale to several others.
 This scale is perfect!!  It's small for storing so it takes up no space, cleans easy and super light weight.  I couldn't be happier with this scale!!  And it take regular AAA batteries, I always have laying around the house  :)<br/>-Nicole P (KY)
 Scale works as expected, but arrived with water INSIDE the sealed plastic/styrofoam packaging.  Booklets and manual were very wet and covered in mold.  Not so thrilled with that.
 Perfect size for me - not too big, not too small.  Sleek design, easy to read and simple to operate. Nice that batteries are included. Price was fantastic.  I'm really happy with this purchase.
 The display went out after less than 1 year.  Cheap junk.<br/><br/>Edit:  The company did offer to send me a new one.  I refused.  I'd rather just buy a better quality scale for more money.
 It's great for diet portion control but also found another handy use. We collect spare change and when time comes to roll coins and cash in for bills, its great to weigh the coins without having to count every coin before rolling. It is so precise, every roll is totally accurate. What a time saver !
 Excellent scale for food. Great price and accurate measurements. I thought I broke our first one because I ran it under the tap... Don't do this! Just use a damp cloth or rag to clean it. I ordered another one after being scolded by my wife for breaking her scale but the thing came back to normal a few days later!
 Very happy with this scale! We have limited kitchen storage so I wanted a smaller scale and this is perfect! It's accurate in all modes of weighing and is a large enough base for "regular" use without a container to hold items. It came with batteries, instructions and has a nice sleek look. The only hindsight I have is that due to the thinness &amp; slim storage I probably would have ordered a larger sized base. I recommend this product &amp; am so glad to get rid of my old unreliable scale!
 This scale seems to work very well. It takes a little getting used to and you cannot weigh really small amounts. I tried to weigh approximately 1 teaspoon of salt and it acted as if there were nothing on the scale.
 I have had this for a while now, and have had zero issues. It measures everything accurately, is very lightweight, and can be cleaned easily. I haven’t had to change the batteries and it’s been almost 6 months. It is perfect for someone tracking macros and can be carried with you to work, etc. I would definitely buy this again!
 I would not recommend this scale. Don't waste your money!! It worked great for a few months and then after using it in the morning, I tried in the afternoon and got an "unSE" error message. I replaced the batteries 3 times and still got the same error. So disappointed.
 I used to have a model where it had a base and a scale on top.  This model is minimalist and looks great.  I just didn't really how hard it would be to actually see the weight since it is flush with the scale.  Hence -1 star
 Have had this scale for 8 months and am pleased with it's compactness and accuracy. It has a pleasing sleek aesthetic, travels well, and is easy to clean.
 I received my scale this week and I've used it constantly. It's exactly what I need. It's still new but so far I really like it. It gives you options of ounces, grams and milliliters. I also really like the fact that it uses double A batteries instead of the lithium. T
 Worked really well for about a year, then after 13 months of off and on use, started to act up - does not provide reliable numbers. I contacted the company and they are sending me a replacement. Other than that it's sleek and stylish, and worked well while it lasted
 Decent scale, user friendly. My batteries pop out randomly though and that's annoying. Yes, the back is on. They just come loose on the inside.
 It's a nice little kitchen scale. Very flat and compact, so it's not taking up counter space to leave it out. I've checked the accuracy, and sometimes it seems to fluctuate a bit...nothing I can't live with, for sure. I'm  using it to help with portion control, and it seems to help keep my meat allowances in check.
 This the first food scale I've ever had and this appears to be exactly what I wanted.  Directions for use are easily understood.
 Product digital screen was scratched. Looked like someone tried to buff it out. Returned and ordered replacement. Seemed to have a lot of functions. Hope it works well.
 There are some screw-ups somewhere, like replacing some reference design with less sensitive, less accurate sensors! Or, it looks silly to display only even grams if your sensor resolution is 2 g. So if you need a resolution of 1g and less, for making lotions or weighing spice, this is probably not for you. I use it mainly for weighting rice and spaghetti so that's very sufficient. If the amount I weight is within 10g, I don't waste time to adjust the amount, because it's much less than a mouthful.<br/><br/>I tested the scale for linearity and it passed. With the zero / tare button, it doesn't matter if you have a heavy container or no container, the amount you want to weight is the same (limited to the resolution of the scale).<br/><br/>The good thing about this scale is that it has four sensors at the corners instead of the usual single sensor in the middle. I had a sharper image digital scale that is a digitalized version of the analog scale. It is well made, a lot of metal, fused with quality glass, and then some screws, but the central platform and the column that support it finally collapsed. I opened it and fixed the screws but it won't last long because of the complicated design. This one virtually has no "moving" parts. The sensors support the whole weighing surface and allow you to put any container on top without the need for centering.<br/><br/>The bonus of this scale is that it is thin and flat. You can still open the microwave door with the scale right in front of it.<br/><br/>The multi-function buttons are also of good designs. There are only two buttons. But you can tare / zero out the scale with the push of a button, and also change the unit with a single press. The sharper image for example, you have to turn it off and then turn it back on to tare. But to turn it off you need to hold the button for 2 sec or more, and then wait for it to turn on. It's really silly when I need to weight noodles into different bowls.<br/><br/>The steel looking top is at best a thin metal skin, with a coating on top and support under. But the whole thing is light weight and highly portable.

It is very accurate and it has multiple units (g,oz,ml,lb) for tracking your food weight. I really recommend it.....it is value for the money.<br/><br/>Video is uploaded to answer below question;<br/>"How long exactly before it automatically shuts off?"  1min &amp; 5sec
 This has helped me more than anything else in my life with portion control.  I love that I can turn it on with any plate, bowl or container sitting on it and it'll come up zeroed, so I can weigh out the right amount of food.  High quality and durable.  Haven't had to change a battery yet, so cannot comment on battery life or ease of changing it.
 This scale is very easy to use.  I can't believe I waited so long to get rid of my old non-digital scale!  This one takes so much less space in my cupboard, is accurate and is easy to keep clean.  On the few occasions that I use snail mail, I can now accurately weigh the envelope in order to use the correct postage.  No more guessing or going to the post office.  I also look forward to accurately dividing ground meat into even patties rather than using my hands to guess at the even weight.
 I am obsessed with this digital scale! I have been tracking my macros for a while now and always would have to eyeball and guess when foods were measured in grams or ounces...like meat. Turns out I have been overestimating the weight of a lot of the foods I was eating. I was curious about the accuracy so I tried weighing something I already knew the weight of and it was pretty darn close. So glad I purchased this.
 This scale is easy to use, easy to measure with. small and portable. doesnt take up much counter or /cabinet space. Has different measuring units which is useful. Works great and the price was right.
 I like everything about this scale. No moving parts to clean. Easy to wipe down. Weighs accurately as far as I’m aware. Great options to choose how each item is weighed also. I have no complaints.
 I purchased this item for a project that I do monthly.  It operated perfectly the first time I used it. The second tme, as soon as I turned it on it became very erratic  and unusable. After trying to zero it the reading constantly jumped around a large range from minus to plus readings without any steady indication at all. New batteries did not help. By then my return period had expired. Sent in a complaint and a week later have received no answer.
 It's simple, sleek, and accurate every time. My favorite part is how small it is and takes up next to no space.
 Perfect for basic portion control. I've been using this to help track calorie intake and it makes it way easy to know what your actually getting instead of just ballparking. Simple operation and has the ability to ignore the weight of the container. Maybe not anything super fancy but a good value for sure.
 Love this scale. It’s accurate on weighting food/liquid and worth the money. Would recommend this product!
 So, I got the scale here and it can't weight anything under 3-5 grams. Straight up will not register and still reads zero. I tried to send it back, and it's more of a hassle and waste of time that just getting a new one. Keep looking, this is not worth it.
 Very clever and useful...compact size but you can add items to a container on it (a bowl or measuring cup, for example) and the "Tare" function automatically deducts the container's weight from the contents.  Very handy; good value.
 It works great! You can zero out the weight of any bowl you are putting your food in, and then weight to your heart's content.
 This is a fantastic little device that is simple to use and easy to read.  My only con on this is that the screen doesn't have a large viewing angle so if I have a bigger plate on it and have to bend to see the screen it washes out.  Other than that it is great.

When not adding extra weight, scale numbers go up and down on their own. (I took a video) keep in mind that even if this does happen Etekcity has by far one of the best customer services. And there will always be someone willing to help
 The quality of this scale is excellent. All of the components are nice and sturdy, elegantly designed, and very precise when it comes to measurments. This scale is fairly small, so if you're looking for one that has a lot of surface, this model is probably not for you. Awesome for mealprep because it's sensitive enough to accurately measure small quantities. Easy to clean too. Love it!
 I use this to monitor my small pet's weight regularly &amp; this is just fine for the price. It's accurate, has a large, flat surface that's easy to wipe down, easy to read, easy to understand &amp; easy to use. All in all, it's a great value.
 Nice little scale. I'm not sure if it's the most accurate - it seems slow to update sometimes. I use it for weighing lunches and coffee grounds. For that it's good enough. No real complaints.
 I've had it for a few months now and I love it. It weighs accurately, and has all the functions I would expect. When I was working I could afford to pay $50 for a scale that had bells and whistles. Now I'm retired I need a good, reasonably priced, workhorse that does what I need it to do on a daily basis. This is it.
 It was just what I was looking for when starting my diet.  Its still working and I've had it for at least a year now.
 This works great ! We love it. One benefit is that if you put an empty bowl on the scale, then turn it on, it Zero's itself with the bowl on so you can just throw food in the bowl and get measurements of just the food - critical if you go on the HCG diet, which we did.  It helped me see how much I was trying to cheat.
 Very nice, light weight scale. The screen is easy to read. I wish the fl oz option was available to use. Otherwise I think it will be a nice scale to use. I just received it so I don't have much of a review yet.
 This is a solid little scale with lots of units of measure. Doesn't take up much room in the kitchen, but simple to do tare weight on, making it very easy for those who like to weigh every piece of food that goes onto their plate and into their body.<br/>Looks very nice and does not take up much space.
 Stopped working just after the 1 year warranty. Not designed well at all. Plates were to big to see the numbers underneath not quite big enough for regular plates. It is thin so would have worked for traveling.
 I purchased this scale to use daily and leave out of the counter.  It's very slim, lightweight and looks nice.  I was afraid it might scratch up after use but so far it still looks nice after pretty heavy usage for a month.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a multifunction kitchen scale.
 Awesome little scale for meal prep!  The whole surface is weighing as the four feet on the base to the math... put your container on zero it out and you are good to go.  Add veggies, carbs, or whatever and zero it out again to add protein.<br/><br/>I'm military deployed and still like to stay on target nutritionally and honestly you have no idea what portions you are being served going through the chow line.  I just pull this out of my cargo pocket weigh what I want, record it, and I'm done.
 This scale is a great price and it works very well. It's not perfect, of course, but I weigh every thing I eat with this, every day and it's great. It does what it's supposed to do quite well. If i'm being nit picky, it could be bigger but if I wanted a bigger one I could have paid more for one. For the money there's not a better food scale. I've had it about six months.
 My boyfriend is all about meal prepping and he absolutely loves this scale. He prefers it over the scales with built-in bowls, too. It's easy to weigh anything on it and it's easy to clean! A necessity for the kitchen!
 Scale was fine and did what it was supposed to do, but the scale is really sensitive to water if you spill liquid on it while measuring or wiping off with a wet rag. The scale ended up gettin. Water damage and stopped working from this...wouldn't recommend if you're going to use for a lot of liquids or need to clean it often.
 Five stars!  Except 4 oz of meat isn't as much as I though it should be...  Now that this scale let's me know that I guess fewer animals will have to be butchered for my meat eating needs.
 Second one I’ve received that doesn’t work.<br/>First one had cracked LCD screen.<br/>This one has a dent in it and doesn’t properly get correct weight.
 Ok, this is a really good scale for all your needs! Believe it or not, I use this to keep tabs on my pet snake’s weight! It works great! Very nice design and easy to use. Would work great for anything! Worth every penny.
 This is much smaller than I realized. Those are little cherries in the picture, not apples. On a cell phone I thought they were apples. I'm not sure about the accuracy as none of my "tests" came out very close to what the container was labeled, but who knows who's fault that is.. I was looking for something a bit more sturdy.
 Really exact scale. I tested different places and angles on the scale and always got the same weight. Great investment for your kitchen!
 It worked great at first, but now it won't weigh properly even with fresh batteries. It's like it keeps taring itself as I am adding stuff to weigh.. Crappy product. I would not recommend.
 Now I have a real scale in my kitchen!  Love the fact I will weigh more than one pound of food, it can be easily cleaned because of the stainless steel, and it has a sleek design with no funny add-ons to catch the food debris.  Additionally, the lighted indicator has large enough numerals which make it easy to read.
 I love this scale and use it frequently when cooking. I like how easy it is to change units and zero the scale - I feel like I’m in science class again!
 This item works great. It was much smaller than expected, but it does the job. It is compact and I put it in the drawer.
 If you are a dieter or a seller, then this scale is perfect for 10lbs or less. Weighs in pounds, ounces, or grams. I really like it. I think you will too, comes with the batteries.
 I love this scale! I just started a diet and this little gadget is awesome. This is my first time using a food scale so I don't know if they're all the same. I like the fact that I can put a bowl on it then hit a button so that it resets to zero to weigh the food. Very easy to use right out of the box and the price was great. I highly recommend this.
 This is a great scale, makes my baking so much better!! Plus it’s much easier to make all my British recipes!!!
 I bought this for my mother and she loves it. The size is not too big and not too small is just right. It does what it supposed to do and so far is working perfectly. Highly recommend it.
 the purpose of a scale is to be precise. the scale is not precise so it is not a good scale. do not weight for ml and make sure you are looking at general grams and not precise grams cause the product cannot tell.  i am disappointed...
 I LOVE this scale.  It was actually purchased to weigh small, uncooperative pets for purposes of finding a medicine dosage for each of them.  😏  While it's a fairly small scale, it has worked out WONDERFULLY and I'd buy it again in a heartbeat!!  I'm very happy with my purchase!
 Love this! It’s easy to use and I put a piece of plastic wrap or wax paper on it before I weigh anything for easy clean up. Fits easily in drawer to keep at hand but out of sight.
 Used for pinewood derby.  I needed a scale that went to the hundredths place.  5.00 OZ.  It can challenging getting the right weight, without going over.  This removes the guessing by telling you exactly how much you are over. Only used it for a month, no complaints yet.
 Function and style wise its a good scale, battery life not so much. I used the scale twice a day for two weeks and after a week the batteries would completely drain. Two AAA batteries should last more than a week. Other scales I've owned with AAA batteries have lasted months. This one is getting returned and I'm buying a different brand.
 Bought seven weeks ago, used maybe three or four times. Seemed to measure fine, but after that little use the battery is dead. My last scale served me for years with way more regular use without needing a battery change.
 I purchased this item to help with my meal planning portion control. I love the bright display screen and it has been accurate thus far in the past 2 weeks of using it, It is simple, easy and quick to clean if you spill anything on it!<br/>Only flaw with this was the shipping, The item arrived late but was quickly corrected with over night shipping from this seller.
 Very nice product.  Slim profile, attractive stainless surface but needs to be used in well-lit environments. Function keys printed in gold-colored paint (on stainless steel) and surprisingly obscure in less than ideal light.  But I'll still be happy with my purchase if I'm still using it 20yrs down the road! 😉
 I've had previous success with Etekcity's products so when I saw this come up as a lightning deal I figured why not.  I'd been looking for a compact and accurate food scale for our kitchen.<br/>Everything appears to function exactly as stated in the description and using the unit is easy/intuitive. (I have not yet tested the 0.01oz/1g precision; I don't know that I'll ever need/expect that level of precision from this scale considering the price.)<br/>I would buy again and I'd recommend this to anyone needing a compact and accurate scale.
 Made the best pizza dough ever using this scale. A little more work, but having exact measurements makes all the difference. I can't think of any improvements, this scale is perfect as is. Highly recommend.
 We run a restaurant, and our distributor charges twice as much for their digital scales.  We ordered these instead, and are ecstatic with the decision.  Look better, easier to clean, and extremely accurate.  Thumbs up!!
 Using this kitchen food scale is very helpful when weighing food and make accountability for calories so much easier! It takes up very little space on my kitchen counter.
 best scale ever! small light weight and easy to take on vacation. I put a plastic sandwich baggie over it to save on clean up. the digital read out is easy to read. great for using if you are counting calories and need to measure weight of meat.
 A good kitchen scale for a great price. The kitchen scale I was using before this was seriously damaged after an accident, and this one is simply cheaper without sacrificing accuracy. I bought this in April, and now in October the batteries just recently started showing signs of needing replacement.
 I really like that this is light and easy to get ready.  The instructions are clear and easy to follow.  I bought this to help me weigh things for freezing accurately.  I have never had any problems weighing things in lbs or ml's. I would definitely recommend this to others.
 I'm pretty concerned about this scale, although I was thrilled with it until yesterday. It did everything I wanted it to and it was small and light and looked great on the counter.  It quit working yesterday at 53 days old, after I washed the surface with a damp sponge. I replaced the batteries  but it stayed dead, then returned to life this afternoon. However, now the scale lights up and shuts off at random times. I've already one for a friend who asked me to because of my glowing recommendation. Gah!
 Very easy to use,  I use this every day.  Particularly like that it has dual read outs and can alternatively do grams or ounces.
 In my experience it doesn't seem very accurate when you're weighing down to the gram, but I maybe that's to be expected if 1g is the lowest denomination. Sometimes the scale doesn't move even when putting something over 1g on, then eventually it'll jump up when you put enough. Just seems to not respond very well if you're looking to weigh a lot of common ingredient serving sizes for example, so for a small kitchen scale where this would seem like the primary function, I don't think I can justify a higher rating.
 Love it. Simplifies everything. I can nail my Macros day in and day out., The tare function is the bomb<br/>I'm losing weight again after stalling out for  a few weeks. I'm back on track thanks to this puppy!
 We have to weigh a lot of my sons foods because he is type 1 diabetic. This is perfect and portable!
 Small, but works well.<br/><br/>I use this every day and it's held up well. It's readable,  easy to clean and works well.  I love the tare function and the measurement options. It's a very good,  standard food scale.
 My wife loves this.  She said it is very easy to use and very accurate.  Now she weighs everything when she is baking.  To many baking show on TV.  This is not going to be good for my waistline.
 I honestly wasn't expecting much for the price. It is amazing though! Works well and can measure in a few different units. I use it for cooking and weighing packages to ship.
 Exceptionally useful scale for all lightweight items from measuring (various units), in the kitchen, to weighing mail for correct postage.  Its "Tare function" is especially handy, allowing the weighing of most any odd-sized lightweight items.
 I use digital kitchen scales frequently for my baking measurements, this scale is very good and for its price well built.
 This scale is really handy light weight and portable. But I don't take it to Restaurants just with me when I dine with family. Keeps me motivated to watch my calories. And because of that I lost 25pounds.
 This is an excellent product.  Very easy to zero out and provides exactly what I need for my diet.  I can now measure my food and know that i am getting the exact amount.
 The scale meets my need and truly makes it easy to weigh portions for my weigh loss program. My only complaint is that there are no indicators to let you know when you are weighing grams or ounces. However, when you power it up, if it shows zeros with a decimal point then it's ready to weigh ounces, if there is no decimal point displayed, you are about to weigh grams, and you can toggle between between the two. In summary, it's a great scale and very accurate.
 I use this to measure my sons formula. I have a hard time trusting it because when I put half a scoop, sometimes it doesn't register it so I have to shake the contents and put it back on the scale.
 This little guy works so well!! It'll calibrate to whatever you have on it at the time...so if it's nothing, it'll just start measuring when you put something on it. But it you decide you want to put a bowl on it first, you can have the bowl equal "0" and then put food in to measure that! It's definitely worth the money!
 WOW, WOW, WOW! What a beautiful design, nice packaging, simple control. Simply fantastic... and what a great price. Truly more value than cost. Congratulations.
 Love this little scale. I use it professionally for work and it never ceases to get accurate weights. The LCD display is bright and easy to read. Cleans easily too.
 Used it once and it worked perfectly. A few months later I needed to use it and it was out of battery. No big deal. I replaced the batteries, and checked the functionality. It worked fine. Fast forward another week and the screen turns on but is all black. It does not display numbers and is totally useless.
 Easy to use. Can put small cutting board on it to weigh out things I’ve chopped.
 I use it maybe twice a week and have to replace batteries at least every week.  My daughter has the same one, uses it daily and has never replaced batteries.  What's up with this??
 I love my new scale, so light and quick also when you put things on to give the weight.  It is also small so easy to keep around without cluttering.<br/>Easy to clean just wipe and voila.  I am very impressed.
 Way better than most.  Some mentioned it shuts off in a few seconds, and I was ready to return if that was an issue, BUT, all you do is "touch" it and it relights the display with the weight -- not shut off at all, just in a smart standby mode.  This is a good buy imho.
 I use this for weighing packages on ebay.  Some larger packages are hard to balance on its small surface and still see the display.  But its really REALLY perfect for small first class packages and packages up to 3 lbs.
 Very easy to use.  Worked very effectively to measure gurmet food packages.  Cleans up really easily.  The slim design is great for that already crowded kitchen.
 I really liked this scale. But it died after 9 months of use. I couldn't adjust the weight measurements. Was constantly using google  unit converter just to get my correct weights. Then again it was a cheap scale. I will probably buy another one honestly.
 Amazing scale! I used to have a really good scale from Japan but I lost it during my move so I purchased this one. I'm amazed that this works better than my Japanese one as it has four different scale units : grams, oz, ml and lbs with a max weigh of 5kg!! As a baker who lived in countries using grams, this scale does wonderful as it easily convert all oz and lbs into units that I know!! The reason why I rated 4 instead of 5 is that I wish it could measure up to a decimal place, as for baking you'd want to be as accurate as possible (and not wasting any ingredients). But this problem can be solved by using a measuring spoon instead, overall it's a great product!
 It is lightweight and easy to store. It couldn't be more simple. A great kitchen scale for a small kitchen.
 Great little scale at a good price. It's easy to tuck this away in your kitchen when not in use or attractive enough to leave out on the counter. Glad I purchased this. I'll use it for measuring flour in the kitchen as well as for postage.
 Love the design and haven't had any problems with it. Real Stainless Steel unlike most of other claims to be stainless steel but start rusting.
 Great scale easy to use and small enough to fit almost anywhere. It made of stainless steel looking plastic which was a slight disappointment.  However I would buy again and would recommend it as a good buy.
 This is a great little scale. It does not take much room on the counter. I like that you can choose from a variety of measurements (grams, ounces, etc.) I also like that you can reset the tare with one button press to get an accurate measure without having to recalculate an subtract the weight of a bowl. I had an issue with the first scale I received missing the battery cover, but the seller made it right by sending me an entirely new scale with all parts intact. Great customer service.
 Very small, thin &amp; looks great on counter.  Need a tall bowl to measure in so can see the numbers but that's no inconvenience to me.  Just zero out the weight of the bowl &amp; carry on.  Buttons very responsive and easy to work with.
 It's ok. But I can't weigh larger plates of food because the plate covers the display and the numbers disappear immediately after lifting the item you are weighing off.
 I am currently a Weight Watchers member and even though the program has gotten so much easier to use, I still like having a scale to weigh certain things like meats.it words great.
 I recently began eating better and a food scale became a necessity. I don't have much kitchen space in my apartment so I wanted a scale that looked good enough I could leave out on the counter and not be unsightly. My only other criteria was it needed to be affordable and work well. This scale ticks all the boxes for me. The stainless finish looks fantastic, the price is great, and it's very easy to use. It even comes with batteries so it's ready to go as soon as you unbox it!
 A great item for an awesome price. This item is small enough that it can be tucked out of the way to avoid counter space. Measurements seem to be accurate and easy to obtain. It's also nice that you can put a bowl/plate on and reset it to 0 so you know you get an accurate count. A great buy.
 Great food scale.  No longer need to guess at how big to make burger patties or how much food to log in my fitness app.  Works great, easy weight tare.  I ordered a 2nd one for my workshop, just because it's pretty useful!
 I love my scale.  I was taking my food to work and weighing it on our postage scale there. I bought the Etekcity scale to make it easier for me to weigh and measure out food at home. It works very well and has met my needs.  I leave it out on the counter. It doesn't take up a lot of space. Thank you for a great, affordable scale.
 Very small thin lightweight scale. I bought this to check postage which it's perfect for. I don't think I would use it for food  unless it was a small amount in a small container.
 Serves my purpose, at a decent price. I haven't had it long, only time will tell if it will be of good service.
 Not very accurate in grams. Put in 3 grams before it registered
 While the overall quality of construction was good, I found the display on this model was too small and difficult to read - the largest issue for me was seeing what unit it was measuring in.  There were 4 different options, but the print on the display was so small I had to pick it right up a couple of inches from my eyes in order to read it.
 After a couple of days, display no longer works. It just lights up with no numbers.  Never dropped or damaged. Complete garbage.
 Crappy scale. Totally inaccurate, especially for lower measurements
 I use this for baking primarily and it will double use to weigh postage when that time comes. I really like the tare function, where you are zeroing out the scale with something already on it like a bowl. So easy to use, small, sleek!
 This is working out fine. Easy and prompt on and off, weighs in kgs or pounds. Easy to read. Looks nice there on the counter. Would recommend.
 Very easy to use. The tare function lets you use mixing bowls and plates for measuring containers. The readout is easily changed fro oz to g to lbs+oz. great little tool!
 Works great.  Clearly shows weights.  Easy to change. Fell off counter, still works.
 Haven't used it yet, but it does work. It zero's and has it's different measurements. Looks cool, it's about the size of a mouse pad more or less.
 This scale has a low profile and looks great.  I leave it on my kitchen counter and love it that the stainless look matches my appliances.  Also like the tare feature (you can set an empty bowl on it, then turn it on and it's set at zero, so that when you add your food, you're only weighing the food, not the bowl)...
 Works ok but weights are often inconsistent.
 This scale is great. Lightweight and easy to use. I love that it measures in a variety of units. I'm also pleased that I can set a container on it, and using the functions, still only measure what's put into the container.
 great price for a small multi functional scale. Can adjust to gm to oz to lb to ml and can zero out after putting a rather heavy cereal bowl on it.  Slim, takes up little room in my dish towel drawer. love it. Make sure the size is right for you.
 I purchased two of these in the last year and they both have died.  The first time I thought maybe I did something to break it. The second one I always left it on the counter and didn’t move it around much.  They are junk.
 Wow! What a great feature. Works as described and lightweight. Love it.
 i love this scale. The backlight is nice for when there is not great lighting in the kitchen and the scale is very lightweight. It's very easy to use and offers different measurements upon preference. For the price, this is a must buy if you like weighing out your food. It's also sleek and takes up little room.
 Fast shipping, works just as needed. Came with batteries. Nice that if you turn it on with a plate on it, it automatically starts at zero pounds, you don't have to tare it. Little bit more lightweight material than I expected.
 I love my scale. I recently got into food prepping and calorie counting. I had a scale but batteries were difficult to find and scale had no on/off switch. I wanted something that was easier to keep powered and could control when it went on or off. This scale had given me that control. Only complaint is the weighing surface is small, so weighing large plates of food is a little difficult. The plus side to it's size is the scale take up very little space. I love it and bought one for the whole family. No real complaints.
 This works great for weighing small items, but when trying to weigh meal prep containers, I'd find myself fighting to either see the output or keep the container from sliding off the sloped back.
 I’ve used this scale a handful of time since receiving it. I haven’t had any trouble with it. The only thing I will say is the auto turn off is nice, just wish it stayed on a min or two longer, it goes to sleep really fast.
 This kitchen scale works well for basic needs. It's small footprint is great for not taking up a lot of counter space. It measures in 4 different increments (lb oz/oz/g/ml). It is easy to use and clean and was available at a good price.  I would recommend it to others.
 Bought this scale to portion meat in 3-5oz increments.  It worked for only 1.5 days and the digital display reading began to show non numeric readings....then finally went dark...to bad I like the design of the scale.
 I love this product. I was a little intimidated but needed it to be able to correctly use recipes that have weights, especially in grams. So easy to use it makes me feel smart. Even rare weights are so simple. Takes the guesswork out of everything. Even this great grandmother can do it.
 Very functional very small and easy to store. It works really quick is accurate and it also is really easy to use not over complicated. The scale is a very modern slim looking device and is really easy to store or keep on the counter without taking much space or looking messy. I have been wanting a scale for while but didn't want to spend too much since I figure I won't be using it too too often this was a great price and works great. plus its so fast and easy to use I might use it more than I thought.
 Use it for WW weighing out portions. Weighs things perfectly every time - ounce, gram, lb.  Love it. Plus waterproof so I can clean the surface without worry.
 I bought this in order to accurately measure my ingredients in the kitchen. I'm very happy with this scale. My wife likes that it is small enough to store almost anywhere. It looks good, is very easy to use, and has a very wallet friendly price tag.Thanks
 This is the perfect size kitchen food scale/package (small) scale. It was a decent price. I don't have any issues seeing the screen like some reported. It does come with batteries!
 This scale does an excellent job.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that something can always be done to make something better.  In this case, I haven't really figured out just what that is yet but I'm working on it.  My wife is not at all technically oriented and she loves it.  She would give it five stars - and she is the one that uses it the most.  We recommend this product and, as a side note, we did not receive any perks for saying this.  We paid full price on Amazon.
 It's a small, well lit LCD screened electric scale, it has a alluminized top and uses triple AAA batteries, which makes it convenient in terms of replacement. It's surprisingly small which make it easy to store.
 Love this scale. Love the digital feature and takes out very easily. Seems very well made and I am thinking it will last a long time.
 Excellent little scale that doesn't take up a lot of room on the kitchen counter. It is attractive and effective. Well made, and easy to use.
 Exactly what I was looking for after my previous scale died on me. My husband and I are watching our diets and proper portion control is vital for us. This scale is sleek, lightweight, does not take up lots of space, and couldn't be easier to use. Converting between units (oz, lb, lboz, g) is as easy as touching a button. I love the lighted display, especially when I'm using larger bowls, as it makes it easier to view the screen from any angle. The lighted display does turn off after a few seconds but all you have to do is touch the scale and you're all set. A great deal for the price, definitely recommend.
 Best scale I have ever used. No lie. I have a commercial kitchen in my home and use lots of high end stuff. This little $10 scale outshines most of the scales I have had, the tare function stays on a good time, doesn't shut off too soon, and weighs in small increments. Did I mention that it was $9.99? Gonna buy several more so that I can give as gifts. Genius.
 Product is easy to use and clean, plus the scale is incredibly accurate.
 Disappointed. Less than 3 months in and this scale has died. Even with battery replaced, the scale is malfunctioning and the buttons are non-responsive. I have another brand scale that is going on 3 years with no issues.<br/><br/>Update (7/12/17): customer service is great and they worked with me to make things right despite my issues with the product.
 Used this a lot and it works just fine. Small but that’s what I wanted.
 It's pretty, but not very accurate. You should only use it for situations where approximate values are needed. The same object shows a different weight depending on where you place it on the scale.
 Beautiful scale, works great and has a back lit screen which other scales at this price point often lack
 It works, and it still does a year later despite the poor ways my spouse stores things.
 Works exactly as advertised. You can set a baseline weight by setting an item on it before you turn it on so that it won't count the weight of your container.
 I love this scale.., it is a must have for the kitchen. Easy to operate and just as easy to use. It is also a good value compared to the local store.
 Really great scale.  It is slim enough to fit in our cabinet on its side (like a book) or laying down.  It seems to be extremely accurate and has a nice sleek look that matches the rest of our kitchen.  Very pleased.
 Each time I use the scale, it's a different result for all items.<br/>2 pennies should be 5grams total. On this scale it reveals the weight as 3g or 4g and never at 5g.<br/>A dollar bill should be 1gram. On this scale, it just shows 0g.<br/>I tasted out a regular candle jar that I weigh at Ikea at 17g. I weigh it on my old scale, same result, 17g. This scale shows it at 15g.<br/>I was hoping for a  scale to use to help portion food ingredients but I guess I have to get another one.
 Great scale. Very acurate. Wish I had gotten the larger one but that was lack of research on my part. Great for cups and very small bowls, but not plates; small or medium or medium bowls. Like I said that was lack of research on my part. I just use wax paper until my larger scale comes in and then this will be my travel scale!☺
 Great little scale which deducts the weight of food container automatically. converts ounces to grams. Perfect for my dietary regimen.
 The product works perfectly and the design is the best, but it gets dirty very quickly. The fingerprint free advertising is totally false, very disappointing. I would rather prefer another scale, depends on your priorities design or convenience.
 Multiple weight readings makes it easy to use. Built very solid. Doesn't feel or look cheap. Solid materials used. Scale is very accurate. I've probably used it 12 times in the short time I've had it. Very happy with this purchase. Buy it. You won't be disappointed.
 Unit arrived well packaged but does not work as advertised. The units will not switch from grams to lbs.  I will not purchase another nor any other product produced by Etekcity.
 Not very accurate. It took 6 grams for it to start showing 1 gram. But will do for food measures.
 The scale works well. The only complaint I have is the buttons are not very responsive and are a bit clunky. Other than that the device works fine with accurate measurements and a button in front to change between standard and metric measurments.
 Makes meal prepping easy! Wish it came with a little bowl or something but I knew that when I bought it. Great buy.
 We use the scale for weighing to shipping packages. Works great for smaller packages but not as good with larger ones as its a little difficult to see the weight. But very easy to use
 I love this scale. I use it to portion foods and now my quarter pound burgers are really a quarter pound. When not in use the scale slips easily into a drawer to reduce counter top clutter.
 I recently decided to start counting my macro nutrients and this has been a great help with weighing my foods. The scale itself is nice and concise and most importanly accurate. I like the ability to quickly switch through the different units of measurement. I would definitely buy this product again.
 Can't complain. I just recently got this and so far it's working really well. Seems calibrated well and it has a really sleek modern design.
 I use this scale to measure protein powder and other ingredients for nutritional shakes.<br/><br/>After unpacking and installing batteries, it works perfectly.  The scale looks nice, does not have any manufacturing odor, and has been totally reliable so far.  I have not checked the accuracy but I don't see any cause for concern.  The price was great and I am very pleased with this purchase.
 I needed a scale for pour-over style coffee. This one works out great  and was very affordable compared to others I had looked at.
 Didn’t work from the day I got it, if you press one of the little feet on the underside (only one) it reads some weight, but if you try to measure something on it it doesn’t work at all
 I do kitchen inventories every Monday and this scale is great. I can go from less than an ounce to 11 pounds without looking for another scale. It's sleek and efficient.
 Have only used a few times, weighed right to begin with.  Now it is all over the place.  Am going to have to throw away and replace.  Really wish I had never bought it!
 Works so good! Love this and use it every day! Awesome buy for great price!
 Haven't had any real problems with this scale, it works amazingly. Was very simply to use and I find it to be very accurate. It's easy to clean and it feels more than worth it for the price.<br/><br/> The only downside I can think of is how long the screen stays lit. I wish it lit up for longer, or at least had a setting to do so. But otherwise, it's perfect!
 Works fine, use it for making pour over coffee and other kitchen tasks. BUT, it burns through batteries incredibly fast in my experience.<br/><br/>Update: Etekcity contacted me and replaced the unit. The batteries do work better in the replacement.
 It is easy to use- I am an American using British recipes which call for weight measurement in grams and liquid in ml so the scale is a must.
 Really love this scale. No plug in makes it easy to use around the kitchen and small enough it takes up very little space.
 It’s a cheap scale. Hard to see when any decent size bowl on it. Broke easily.
 Does not seem to be as accurate as I hoped.  I do appreciate that it takes regular AAA batteries and not the small round ones that most kitchen scales use.
 Was not accurate for very light weight objects. I purchased to keep track of my baby birds weights. Epic fail.
 perfect little kitchen scale for college students-- or anyone. Nothing fancy but it doesn't need to be! super light weight, convenient that it comes with batteries.
 Good scale, weights can vary on the same item but they usually dont make a big difference and I just round up anyhow.
 The scale is so small that most of my plates and bowls block the LCD, and when you duck down to try to read the display it's completely unreadable at an angle.  I've now got a dedicated bowl for measuring, but I still don't like using this scale for the 2 reasons above.  Shopping for something else...
 I have had this scale for almost two weeks now and it's AMAZING. It's small enough to not take up counter space, yet still big enough to weigh big items. It's really easy to use and pretty self Explanatory. The sleek design makes it easy to clean too! I would definitely repurchase
 Very handy. I've used it for making burger patties the same size, weighing pet birds, and weighing materials to be shipped. It's accurate and easy to use.  I like that you can hit the button again with a late on it and it will zero out the weight of the plate, and just measure the food.
 Very nice scale, easy to read, common sense to use, and you don't have to rummage around to find batteries to put in it. I also love the purple back lighting as my kitchen is accented purple.
 Bought this as part of my niece's birthday gift as it was on her birthday wish list and she is a very talented cook.  She loves it to use for her cooking.
 This is perfect in so many ways. Just the perfect size to be on your counter but yet out of the way. It is so easy to use and very responsive. For its size the capacity is quite large. I have been using this scale now for several days and have nothing negative to say about it.
 I bought the item in December and barely used a few times as I cook very seldom. I kept it in dry place in my pantry but anyway it started glitching.<br/>I changed batteries, tried to turn it off and and on. But unfortunately it just stopped working :(
 It mostly works for what I use it for. I have to use a different scale, however, for anything less than 3 oz. This one will not go that low.
 I waited to write a review on this product because I wanted to see how it worked first. This scale is great! It's easy to use and has different settings depending on what you want to weigh. The only thing I don't like is that there is not an option to increase the length of time the backlight is on for. It turns off rather quickly, but you can turn it back on by adding more stuff to the scale. Over all a fantastic purchase.
 Great little scale for the kitchen......very accurate..easy to clean...no more guess work for the wife......she loves it....great cooks need great products
 It is a little funny when working in gram increments. It is not sensitive enough. However, it seems to work okay for  the purpose of bread making.
 Great scale! Very accurate but needs a stable surface in order to measure correctly. Love the LED light, which provides a bright response when scaling food. It was easy to use and has many different unit functions. The polished metal makes the product look very nice as well.
 Love this little thing. It's very small and easy to tuck away between canisters on the counter. I've used it for both mail and cooking weights and have had no problems with accuracy or consistency. It wipes clean very easily.
 This is a good product. While not as large as another brand we bought for a second home, it is sufficiently big enough, costs considerably less, and is solid in terms of quality.
 Works fantastic.  Learned a new word -- "tare" weight, which is simply being able to weigh a container separately so what's put in it weighs correctly.  This has been a huge help in my many pound weight loss of late.  Easy to use and stainless surface cleans up great.
 Bought  in March and in August stopped working. Made in China maybe that's why. Don't waste your money.
 Been using this for over a year! Super easy to use and great price! Great buy!
 I use this for my meal prep and it works fantastic!  Comes with batteries so that is a plus--cleans off easily and has worked well for me for the last several months.
 Misleading advertisement.  It stated the dimensions “as stored” which meant the dimensions of the box it was shipped in.  Actually item is much smaller.
 This scale has a very nice look to it and is very sleek. Light weight and easy to travel with. But it is incredibly inaccurate. The numbers jump around so you never know if you have the right weight or not. It is cheap so if you’re not looking for precision then this scale is decent, but if you need correct weight for anything I would not recommend this.
 fast delivery...just in time for some more holiday baking!
 Cheap, easy to use, This is a great product for the money, I really was expecting something (lower quality) for the price, Works perfect, I use it for basic things mostly food, coffee,  so no  precision required.
 So far really good. The scale is the perfect size and thin enough to stand up next to the cutting boards for more space on the counter. It doesn't take up very much space anyways. It is an accurate scale with more than enough settings.
 I love this scale, my wife and I weight and measure our food and this scale will automatically zero out any dish and does both oz &amp; grams (as well as some other weight options we don't use).  It measures very quickly and accurately, and is very easy to wipe clean if you get food on it.
 Much slower to respond when I press a button than the more popular Ozeri ZK14-S Pronto.
 Very nice small kitchen scale, useful  for measuring ingredients when you cooking food.
 Overall, this is a very efficient scale. It's compact, easy to use, and easy to keep clean. It does seem to time out fairly rapidly with the light fading on the scale reader, making it difficult to read, but overall I am pleased with this scale.
 Great little scale. Accurate. So small you will always be able to keep it on the counter.
 Works exactly as described, accurate measurements, easy to read &amp; so inexpensive; I can't believe I waited this long to get a digital kitchen scale. So handy, especially if you're dieting and need to keep track of your food accurately. Would absolutely buy again.
 Works great. I have been using in a long time. Never had to replace battery
 Looked like good quality but never used it. Packaging was cheap. But scale looked nice
 What a great little scale!  Just what I needed to weigh my food.  It is very accurate and so light.  It can be stored just about anywhere.  Why didn't I get this a long time ago.  Great product!!!
 This thing is s life saver when counting macros! Backlight is a nice touch. Zeros out and easily changes units! Pro tip: put whole tub of butter on scale, zero it out and count the negative number ;)
 Nice little scale. I have diabetes and need to count carbs for my insulin pump. This scale seems well built and is what I need. Thanks.
 This is a nice quality scale, but after using it for a few months, I cannot get it to register 1 ounce increments. It doesn't register weight until 2oz. It may be defective, but overall for the price nd if you don't need super precise accuracy, i think its a good purchase.
 I haven't had it for very long yet, so it's tough to give a full review. But so far, I really like it. The price is good, the scale seems very accurate, and the design is sleek. I also like the light up display. My one critique is that because it's entirely flat, it's harder to weigh larger things as the display gets covered up. Other than that, I recommend it.
 Fast shipping, arrived on time, it's just as described. It's very light, I love it
 I wish I had purchased a better quality scale.  This one is okay, but it gives different readings so I have to repeat and repeat until I know I've got the right weight.
 Very disappointed with this scale for coffee prep. Thought I'd save a few bucks after Hario scale I had kicked the bucket when I spilled coffee on it (🤔It's a COFFEE scale, shouldn't it be water resistant?) Anyway, should have just bought the Hario again. This Etekcity scale doesn't register small amounts or slow additions. Kind of defeats the purpose of a kitchen scale. It's a cheap scale. As always, you get what you pay for.
 Still using months after purchase with no problems.
 Simple, but easy to use.  Small and light weight for storage.  Excellent scale for the price!
 Sleek design; gorgeous with our stainless appliances. Good value for the money!
 I have had this scale for only two weeks to the day.  Am on a strict nutrition plan and have to weigh everything.  This morning the scale won't go to zero, won't shut off.  I expect more out of products!  Two weeks old and it's leaving me in a lurch.  Very unhappy.
 I'm giving it two stars because it served me pretty well until one day it read "unSE", I tried balancing it, resetting it, cleaning it, EVERYTHING and nothing worked. I got it to the point where it was giving me random numbers... Completely displeased with this... I even hurt my hand while trying to fix it... Would be fantastic if this could be addressed.
 Junk doesn't work for crap got it to weigh out portions of food for each day of the week and it just flat out doesn't work
 This scale has a small footprint, is thin, lightweight, and easy to use. And since it is so compact, I always have it at hand on my counter where I use it daily.
 I had high hopes for this product - especially after reading the reviews. But after receiving it, i'm less than impressed. It is very difficult to read the numbers on the scale, and smaller than i somehow imagined. It will do the job, but wish it was easier to read.
 Solid instrument for the kitchen! Didn't have to calibrate turbed right on no problem after removing plastic tag from batteries. I'll use this when baking since I always find recipes that call for a measuring spoon/cup I don't have.
 Have had this for awhile and haven’t had to replace the battery. Shows weight in a variety of units.easy to keep clean
 Works exactly as promised and even came with not only the batteries to start with but the first set of replacements.  Great buy.
 Love this little scale. You can set an empty container on it, set it back to zero, and put your ingredients into the container for an accurate weight.
 Broke in a week. Got three to prep with, all three died different deaths. Just buy a better one if your planning on using it daily.
 Broken within one day of receiving it.<br/><br/>Edit: customer service sent me a new one after they saw this, works like a charm.  Must have just been bad luck! It looks very modern and sleek.  Highly recommend.
 Do a lot of baking and I love the ease of the Kitche scale.<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0113UZJE2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_82
 Just what I wanted for my RC hobby to be able to weigh some kf my components. I only wish it had the tenths place for grams.
 It works really well. The only thing that is a little weird is the off button is on the scale. So when you press and hold to turn it off it is calculating the weight of your pressure. Now Im concerned that it might hurt the longevity of the scale? Not sure. But works great.
 How did I go so long without this? This is a great little scale. Works perfectly, easy to use, doesn't take up a lot of room, and I love that it calculates the container's weight separately so I don't have to do the math. ;)
 I bought this in support of my Keto diet attempt, and while the form/function were ideal, this scale had a defect that caused it to drain the batteries in less than 24 hours. Took me about $7 worth of batteries to figure out though!
 Easy to use, great little scale.  No more guessing on recipe weights.  Update: after two years my scale would not display in anything except for grams so I reached out to customer service and they replaced the scale at no charge!  Amazing company and would highly recommend!  Thank you!
 Such a good price, but it does kind of feel a little off to me sometimes. I have to clean it and reset sometimes because I will get a false read if there's any residue left. Otherwise, great price for a starter scale.
 I use this little scale quite a bit. Delivery on time. Its easy to read. Cleans perfectly. Very stylish.
 Easy to use very modern and shipment was very quick.<br/>Now I can easily measure.
 Easy to use. the digital read out is large and easy to read. The scale is also easy to keep clean. Only 2 buttons make operation fool proof and effortless when switching between weight units. It even comes with batteries!
 Great small food scale for the kitchen.  Nice stainless steel finish.  I weighed a penny to see how accurate it was.  Not bad.  This scale was a gift to my girlfriend.  She loved it so much she bought 2 more for her sister and mother.  I bought another one my self.  So, a total of 4 scales were bought in about a weeks time.
 i didn't pay close enough attention. it doesn't calculate in half grams, so it's not really very accurate.  useful though and not bad looking. worth the money.  if i had it to do over, i'd get something that gives measurements out to the decimals.
 This has worked amazingly well. Nice and small so I can fit in a drawer. A bit of a pain when weighing wide items, but there are ways around it.
 I would give this a higher rating but hasn’t worked since purchased
 Update: 5/5 The supplier replaced the unit in a timely manner with a new working unit. Absolutely a hassle-free experience with their customer service. The scale is simple to use for all the kitchen needs and is perfect to keep out or even fits perfectly in any drawer.<br/><br/>Worked great the first time I used it for my food prepping to weigh my meats. Wiped it down and put it away. But when I took it out a week later a second time the screen lit up but with no numbers. Shame it was recommend with a high rating.
 I just received this in the mail today.  It is replacing another scale I have had for year that has reached the end of it's life.  I chose this scale because it was flat, stainless, and took AAA batteries.<br/>First Impressions:<br/>- The packaging is solid, it's not bouncing around, it's secure in the box.<br/>- I liked the stainless, it comes with a film you need to remove which is nice.<br/>- I like the blue hue to the screen and large LCD.  Makes it easy to read.<br/>- I'm a bit disappointed in the buttons.  I thought they would be smooth, the photos don't do a good job showing that these are actual buttons with space in between.  This means I will need to make extra sure when cleaning it to make sure nothing gets stuck in there.  Since it's a flat surface, I'm imagining flour, dust, crumbs, you name it getting stuck in there.  This is the reason for the 4 stars.<br/>- I like that it comes with batteries.<br/>- I love that it's light weight.<br/>I use a scale almost daily for baking, making sure that rolls, pizza doughs and such are equal in size.  I occasionally use it for portion control, so this scale will see tons of use.  Since this is my first day with it, I will post a follow up after some use.
 I love this scale. It has settings for different measurements and tares it for when I need to put a bowl or something on it first before the food.
 I will keep this because it was inexpensive and works well. But I have to get another one because I didn't realize I need not weight ingredients that weigh way me than 11lb.
 It's great.  Drape it with plastic wrap before use, because it is NOT waterproof and you will need to clean it otherwise....especially if you are weighing raw meat.
 The scale is ok, beautiful, works well but the surface was very scratched in the middle as if used or defected from the manufacturer. I didn't want to start a return process as i urgently needed the scale so I kept it.
 I love this scale! When you measure, it comes to a number and doesn't waiver so we can work much faster. It waits a good amount of time before shutting off so if you get pulled away while you're still measuring, you don't have to start over as often.
 Works well, good construction. Use it often. Really like it and highly recommend
 Fantastic purchase for the money.  We misplaced the user manual.....and I use the term "we" loosely.<br/>I sent them an email asking for a user manual.  Got the manual/PDF within 10 minutes.  TEN MINUTES !<br/>Wonderful Customer Service
 I love this product! It is a must for dieting and has helped me track my Macros and Micros so I can eat accordingly to my diet. It is also super easy to use and the perfect size.<br/><br/>Awesome product.
 This scale weighs the food fine, but it is VERY hard to read - the letters are not very bright against the background.  You kind of have to orbit around the screen until you get the right angle to see what it's saying, and then it's hard to tell which unit you have it set to.
 Not only could this scale not measure single grams (as other reviewers have noted) which was forgivable on it's own, it just flat out broke after only a little over a month of use.<br/><br/>Look for something else.
 Does exactly what I need and at a great price. I like that it lets you zero out the weight so you don't have to do the extra math. Can't think of anything I would want it to do that isn't already there. Came with it's own batteries also.
 Really easy to use, very accurate,  consistent readings, and high tolerance.
 This scale is awesome. Works great and smaller than it looks
 Pros:<br/><br/>very sensitive but not overly so. I can measure 1 unit at a time.<br/>Price<br/>It looks nice, and the numbers are huge<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>Light went out about 3 weeks into use... very annoying<br/>Prone to scratching (I dont know why... I used plastic/ceramic plates)
 We are delighted with this etekcity digital multifunctional scale. It is small, lightweight and thin, making it store easily in a small space on top of other goods in the bottom cabinet. We use it to measure cold cereal to assure we are appropriately limiting our quantity. We also use it to measure our small dog's food to assure he isn't getting overfed or underfed. We just put a small piece of saran wrap (or other plastic) on the scale and spoon the food on top of it so we can easily toss the plastic without needing to clean the scale. So far, we have used it to weigh up to 3 pounds and it seems to be accurate. The dimensions cited in the product description are accurate (it's small) so if you expect to be measuring larger or heavier items, it's small size might be a problem for you.  For us, however, the small size works well, given that we only use it for small, quantities and we did not want to pay more for a bigger one. A big factor for us in choosing this one was our limited kitchen cabinet space.  It's thinness make it so easy to just tuck-away in the cabinet horizontally on top of something else and, when you have to move it out of the way to get to something else in the cabinet,  it's easy to do because of its light weight. So far, after about ten day's of using it, we are quite pleased.
 Nice scale that doesn't take up much space.  It works just fine.
 My husband uses this to weigh out his ingredients for resin casting and has been satisfied with it so far.
 I just received this scale and immediately had to contact Etekcity customer service to troubleshoot problems with it. The Units button would tare the scale when pressed instead of changing the unit conversion. The customer service representative was friendly and helpful which is a plus. The problem turned out to be bad batteries and after I supplied my own it works just fine. The rating would have been 5 stars if it was shipped in operational condition but 3 seems reasonable for being such an easy fix to use it.
 This scale is exactly as described. Small, and lightweight. Works like a charm. Easily tucks away into any cabinet due to its slim profile.<br/>I highly recommend this product.
 Stop working after 4 months of use
 Great small little scale, the color isn't exactly gray, ours was a little on the copper side. Works and does its job so cannot complain!
 Very nice scale, especially with all that functions.  Very easy to use, make measuring the ingredient a whole lot easier and faster.
 This works extremely well for small food measures. I have no reason to believe it's inaccurate. Super easy to clean and the slim design is good for storing in a cramped kitchen!
 Super helpful knowing EXACTLY what youre eating! Turns out i eat 3.5 servings of cereal at a time, so its nutritional content is not what i originally imagined! If youre trying to develop a healthy life style, i definitely recommend this product.
 this little scale is marvelous, i bought this scale to use in my hydroponics green house, easy to clean and most of all it works great.
 Affordable, portable scale. Seems accurate and looks decently made. Definitely worth the money I paid for it. Also well packaged.
 I originally gave this 2.5 stars as I had some problems with scale accuracy and going dark/turning off too quickly.  Etekcity contacted me and after a few emails it became apparent that I got a lemon.  Elekcity immediately sent me a new scale and it works great.
 This is a great little kitchen scale. While I wish it was more accurate (to the 1/100 of a gram) I'm very happy with what I got for the price. If you need a slick starter scale for your kitchen or science experiments this is definitely worth looking at!
 I boughtthe Etekcity Kitchen Scale a while ago and waited to give it a good trial before writing a review. I love it!!!  I've been guessing on quantities for herbs and other such things; now I can accurately measure grams, ounces and more. And the tare function allows me to measure items that need to be weighed in a container. The unit it very pretty and easy to clean. I'm VERY satisfied.
 Has all the features I was looking for: small, lightweight, easy to clean, uses regular batteries, calculates two decimal places, easy to use, works well. I bought some for gifts. A great companion to the free My Fitness Pal website where you can track your food. For best weight loss results, you need to weigh your food, and this scale is perfect for that. It was easy to pack for a trip, too.
 Very nice lightweight attractive and accurate scale at an affordable price.  I couldn't ask for much more from this item.  Highly recommend if you are looking for a quality kitchen scale.
 Once you open the box, you can feel the material being cheap and flimsy. After using it a few times, it stopped working. I thought it run out of battery, I put new set of batteries then it gave me "UN Se" code, and I haven't been able to use it afterwards.  Don't waste your money on this cheap material.
 Does the job, but learned the hard way it needs to be on a hard flat surface
 The scale isn't as sensitive as I'd hoped. It has enough sig figs fore most food related purposes. The backlight turns off too quickly. It's nice and compact though.
 This scale is completely inaccurate. Reports much less than actual. Took me awhile to realize it until I had some produce that I knew the weight of and I needed to weigh out only some of it. It was 24 oz., and the scale weighed the whole amount to be 11 oz. Changed the batteries, same issue. Threw it away.
 Worked well when I used it for mooncake making at home.
 Awfully inaccurate.  Tried weighing 5 grams (it only does whole numbers in grams).  Placing food on scale three different times back to back to back gives three different readings.  Ounces seem to be more accurate (weighs to .00) but I've found this to be wildly inaccurate.  Buyer beware
 I am very happy with this purchase. The scale is accurate and small which makes for easy storing. Most importantly, the scale is exceptionally easy to use. You literally have to hit a button. If you want food measured in a different unit (oz, grams, pounds, etc) you hit the button again. Quick and efficient. I recommend this scale.
 First, I didn't get a discount on this for a review. It's an awesome product. Sleek, accurate, looks nice in my updated kitchen, easy to clean and use. I bought this to weight my dogs raw food and it's perfect. Also, great customer service. I've had this for several months and couldn't be happier.
 Thin design makes it easy to store. Works perfectly.
 Everything I have purchased from Etekcity is beyond great.  This company has my vote for the best Company on Earth.  Such quality.  This scale is the best I've ever had(and I've had a lot).  Keep up the great work guys!  I will always choose your products over bigger "Brand" names any day.
 Great little scale.  I've used digital over 34 years as a science teacher.  This kitchen scale is of better quality than many of those high cost scientific scales.
 Inexpensive, unobtrusive, and reliable with different measuring options and zero tare.  Perfect for when you just want to know how much you're eating. I had another but is huge in comparison; this one is the size of a kindle so you could leave out and not have in the way. I bought one and another as a gift.
 Works well.  My only complaint is that I have to turn it over to change between grams and ounces.
 It looks great, but haven't had a need to use it as of yet.
 Nice appearance, works for general use. Not accurate enough to use for pour over coffee, mine does not register anything below 5grams
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R3OD67A6PIR2P0"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1D9XoiXVTS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EF4gagZlS.png"/> Definitely not a trustworthy scale—very disappointed. Compared to my old scale, it can’t measure the grams in a couple pieces of cashews.
 Its okay. Times out too soon and turns itself off when you are trying to make adjustments. Huzzah for battery saving, not so great for fine measurements. Small and light. Easily stores in a drawer. Wipes clean.
 Overall, I am somewhat pleased with my purchase. This is also the first food scale I have purchased. I have had this scale for just over a week and already the back-light has stopped working which makes it kind of a pain to read. Since it is all one piece, if you have a container that is larger than the scale itself it can be difficult to read the display as well since it is flush with the surface and can be covered up easily.<br/><br/>This scale will get the job done. That being said, when it dies, I'll be purchasing a different one.
 I like this but didn't realize it was so small but I will use it.
 The item arrived in non-working condition, it wouldn't power on.  A call to Etekcity Customer Support elicited an apology, and the immediate  shipment of a new scale, no arguments, no questions asked.  The second scale arrived in perfect working condition, and is just what I wanted.  It is attractive, compact, and surprisingly accurate for a thirteen-dollar item.  This appears to be a very reputable company, and I would not hesitate to do business with them again.
 Scale works great, batteries with the scale gave out within a few months though. Other than that it works well and looks cool too.
 Thin and looks elegant. Useful in the kitchen. I love to cook and it is very helpful for me.
 Inconsistent. At best. Really not cool when is for a business where measurements are of the utmost importance in precision. Chemistry is not an "ish" science c
 Slim and lightweight scale to take with you to correctly measure food items. I can use any container and scale will deduct that from the food.  Easy instructions for doing that.  I wish they included small bag for carrying easily.
 I use this to weight my foods out and it really gets the job done.  Portable too I can take it to work with me or wherever I need it.  Great purchase.
 Worked great, bought 3 lb's of ground beef at the butcher and weighted out 12 1/4 lb burgers, each right around 4 oz and had perfect burgers for my cookout, definitely pick this up!
 Accurate for the most part, but display can jump around a bit usually increasing weight by a few grams...have to reset to zero and weigh again. Good size to easily place items on. Easy to wipe and clean. Just needs to be more weight stable.
 LED is not backlit as advertised. Barely readable in the light or dark. No customer service...no email reply, no pick-up on the phone, and real time chat on their website does not work. Don't know for sure if the scale is defective but since ETEKCITY customer service is nonexistent I'll never know for sure. Returned through Amazon for refund and will try another brand. 👎🏻
 This scale is simple and easy to use.  I just wish the display was a bit easier to read.
 What a nifty little instrument! I've always wanted a little kitchen scale, and this thing is just fabulous! I haven't tested for accuracy yet, and have only used it once to measure the weight of chopped potatoes, but it's easy and intuitive to use, and looks so nice! :)
 The scale stopped working.  I think it was because I was handwashing it to clean the scale and it sustained water damage in the front buttons.  I was careful not to get the batteries wet but the problem was with the buttons on the front.
 Love this scale. It can even weigh liquids accurately
 Good size for small items and fits neat in small places in a kitchen.
 Great product for the price, included batteries have lasted the five months since starting to use it daily. Very accurate (within 1-2% usually). Only problem is the backlight goes off fairly quickly while using it but it is a small issue.
 The scale is not very sensitive. The numbers keep going up and down if you even slightly shift whatever is on top, and oftentimes the number doesn't even change despite removing or adding stuff from the scale.<br/>---------<br/>Update - the scale stopped working, so I tried switching the batteries, but the screen just switched to 'unSE' and stopped functioning again.
 I love that this unit automatically tares when you turn it on.  Put your bowl onto it, turn it on, dump food inside, accurate reading.  It's also very stylish and easy to clean.
 This thing is absolutely the BOMB! It is so accurate and delicate that I believe it could weigh your voice. If you could find a container to put it in???.<br/>Beautiful little device: Under $13 dollars with enough change back to put a down payment on a Postage Stamp. A-Z Guarantee. Free Shipping.<br/>Trust Me you will be leaving me a Thank You.<br/><br/>Rat
 Stop guessing. Weigh you food. Control portions. Greater accuracy when following a recipe. A must for every kitchen. Sleek thin profile and stainless finish looks great on counter and fits in any draw if you don't want to save counter space.
 This scale is great! So glad that I purchased it, I have been looking for one that is reasonable and of good quality.<br/><br/>Update: So I have been tracking my food and using this scale and I have been successful at losing weight- I give it to the scale for being accurate.  It is also small enough that it doesn't take up a lot of room when stored!
 Didn’t like the fact it doesn’t measure in .4 like 3.4 for an example. If that doesn’t bother you then it’s fine
 I really like this scale. It's super simple to use and very compact. My one gripe is that I wish the screen was on the angled part of the device because it becomes hard to read the screen when you are filling a larger bowl or container as the container would obstruct your view. If the screen was angled, that would alleviate that problem. Other than that, I'm super satisfied.
 I had several Taylor scales and they always seems to have problems. This is extremely great value for the price (half what I would have paid for a comparable Taylor). Slim profile and easy to read. Would buy a bunch more for my friends, but then that would be weird.
 Great for the price.  I have only done boil eggs.
 I tested this unit when I received it and then put it in the kitchen drawer.  It was dead when I tried to use it the next day.  I am returning the unit.<br/><br/>Update on 10/12/3017:  Etekcity was very proactive on solving the problem. They sent me a new scale and the scale is working well. No issues so far. Great customer service!
 Works great!  I use it for cooking, so while it's a smaller scale it's still very good. Hard to find much better for the money. Easy to use.
 My wife finds the kitchen scale very useful for the kitchen things to do.
 I am delighted owning this food scale. It is easy to use and helps me follow Carrie Brown's "Eat Smarter! Holidays" cookbook recipes because she provides weights in ounces and grams and this scale handles both.
 It is a great scale and has a good design and functionality. I noticed it didn't measure precisely down to the gram but was contacted by customer support and have a provided with a solution ever since.
 This performs very well for my brewing needs.
 Gets the job done, idiot proof to use, nice brushed metal finish. Very light which can be a bit cheap feeling but personally I like the lightness.
 Perfect for helping me mail my Avon brochures to my customers!
 Works well. I like that it uses AAA batteries (included) so they will be easy to replace when/if they run out. It is very slim and easily stows in one of my kitchen drawers. Four stars only because
 They're too small to be of any use.
 What a great scale! Easy to use and quite informative. When they say an ounce of cheese is the size of two dice, for example, they must be talking about the 12-sided variety! Pretty pleased I can have more pepper jack as a snack 😎
 Received the item quickly, small and light weight. Disappointed that it was very scuffed up before even unwrapping it. Doesn't effect it's usefulness but you still expect a nice clean new item right out of the box
 I got this to help me measure out my portions and it really comes in handy! The only thing I don't particularly enjoy is that it turns off if you're not weighing it after a minute or two, you have to turn it back on again. There's been a couple times I've tared out a bowl and some rice in it only come to find that once I've put in something else it's turned off. BUT, it is a cheap little scale and it does the job. Very lightweight and portable, easy to store due to its thin size. Would purchase again!
 Loved this scale, just ordered three more for Christmas gifts.
 Not a bad scale but very hard to see the display due to it being on the same surface as the scale.  Retuned for one that has the display at an angle.
 This scale is fantastic.  It is accurate and VERY simple to use.  Aside from this product actually working the way it is supposed to (can't say that about all products unfortunately), it isn't any bigger than it needs to be.  Unless you have a kitchen the size of two rooms, counter space is always at a premium.  This is sleek-looking and doesn't take up much space.  If you want to stow it away in a drawer or cabinet, it's small enough to work with just about any configuration you have.  Buy with confidence.
 I love this handy little jewel.  It doesn't lie like my big scale in the bathroom! (ha ha!)  Easy to use, and very accurate. Thanks
 I like this scale, look sturdy with readonable price
 Very dependable little scale with accurate weight readings. I have it four stars because the weight reading tends to clear off faster than I would like. I use this for my soaping business to weigh my oils and lye and at times the scale will turn off after a min of so, although I think that might be pretty standard for most scales.
 For the price, I think this scale is totally worth it. It's easy to read, though you want to be standing pretty much over the screen for a clear view of the lit numbers. It cleans up easy. And, it's very thin, so I can store it in a drawer without taking up counter or cabinet space.
 Great scale! it's very precise! I love all the functions it has and the best thing is that it looks awesome!
 Just what I was looking for
 I've only used this a couple of times but it seems to be accurate and works fine. For the price would recommend trying!
 The scale works fine. Very good customer service
 Very inaccurate. I wanted to use it to weigh supplements ans herbs. I placed a small plate on the scale, tare, and started adding powder. The reading remained 0 after adding an amount that I am absolutely sure was 10 grams. I am very disappointed of this product. Wouldn't recommend.
 I use this to weigh my Hamsters for their health checks and it works pretty well with no flaws. Accurate and easy to use.
 I use this for measuring hair color. I do hair at home and this has been a life saver for me. I use it frequently and it works well. I love that this can be used in grams, ounces or pounds, it makes measuring so much easier than before. It's small and compact so it doesn't take up a lot of space bit is big enough to put a bowl on. I am getting so much use out of this device.
 I've had this scale for a while  and it is excellent for the money. I use it everyday.
 This attractive, compact  kitchen scale is a real bargain at a great price.  It is easy to use and a good addition to my kitchen utensils.  I highly recommend it to anyone that wants a good scale at a very reasonable price.
 Easy to use and clean, too!  I like the versatility of having more than one way to measure food--ounces or grams, for example.
 I like how you can zero it out and does oz or lb or grams
 Very versatile and useful.
 It worked great for a month!!! Now all it shows is am error code. Customer support is NO help. Needless to say I already ordered a different brand.
 I just received this scale today and I’m loving it! I love how sleek it looks! It is very very user friendly! And the bonus batteries in the box were great!
 Nice addition to kitchen operation, was using a postal scale so you know I needed this item. Lots of scales on the market, I looked for features &amp; price, we'll see!
 I used this for maybe 2 months and it only worked 20% of the time or so. Always showing an error on the screen. I replaced batteries and still the same issue. Etekcity contacted me and sent me another one as a replacement.<br/><br/>maybe 4 months later the issue happens again. HORRIBLe product, what a waste of money and time. Communication from seller was decent but I'd HIGHLY suggest another scale.. 2 failed? come on.
 Very inexpensive but works great. It's super easy to use and easy to clean. Been using it twice a day for a few weeks and the batteries haven't gone yet, so pretty efficient.
 Great buy.  Easy to use.  We use it many times during the day (4 adults, all eating separately), while we weigh for our Keto-diet meals.  Clear read-out, easy to convert from grams, oz., etc.  Bought it for a friend and she is happy also.
 Very easy to use, very compact, very easy to clean. The tare is very easy to set. So much better than the old type scales that always needed to be adjusted and there was no tare. I don't know why I waited so long to get it!
 Nice looking and easy use
 This is a good kitchen scale for the money.
 Nice little scale and easy to use. The auto tare is great!
 I purchased this kitchen scale for my husband to help us make better choices on our portions throughout the day. We are very happy and impressed with this scale. It's precise and easy to use. We would definitely recommend this product and should be in every kitchen. I wish we would have purchased it sooner.
 Great scale. Easy to use and seems very accurate. I like that it has different measures like grams and ounces.
 Effective scale but it is on the small side about the size of saucer. Large dinner plates are a bit annoying to measure with since they cover the display screen. Would not repurchase if I ever need another one but it will go with a larger scale.
 I use this all the time. It is light and super easy to use.
 BUYERS BEWARE<br/>This scale is an absolute waste of money, I never like leaving bad reviews unless the product absolutely deserves it and in the case I’m sorry to say it does. The scale can barley read anything close to accurate in the grams or oz settings which frankly is the main use for a food scale. UNACCURATE, CHEAP, BATTERY LIFE SUCKS.
 Does what is supposed to.  Weighs food.  The surface is flat and easy to weigh food.  Works well and accurately. Easy clean if you forget to use a plate or wax paper.
 great scale great price
 better than expected. tare function works like a charm, LED light is clear as works great. Im loving this scale
 I love this digital scale. Extremely easy to use. Delivered fast. No damage to anything. Packed in Styrofoam so completely cushioned.<br/>Not a bad thing to say about any part of this order. Thank you for your service.
 I need to weigh my food and this works perfectly.  Keep in mind the surface area is small so if you want to put a big plate on it, it would obscure the reading.  I find it easy to clean and I like that I can put a container on it and the scale adjusts the weight of the container so I am starting at zero for an accurate measurement on food that is too difficult to weigh on its own. It's a compact little item so easy to store as well.
 Wanted kitchen scales to replace old scales...this does the simple weighing I wanted plus a few extra functions. Perfect for price and my usage
 It does everything I want and is easy to use
 Perfect for measuring food! Highly recommend!
 Perfect for what I needed.
 It won't weigh grams properly I can put a nickel and it will read and the amount of salt sugar and flower ect and it will not read as well as my other scale I got from the gas station.
 Burns through batteries when completely turned off and nothing touching it.  You literally have to remove them if you want to be able to use it next time. Haven't tested accuracy but I'm sure it's off.  Don't waste your money
 Liked at first then had to change batteries more often. Even tried rechargeable  guess just a bad item.  It happens
 I use this to weigh small batches of coffee (1-3lbs.) for roasting. The scale is user friendly, sleek, and intuitive. The only shortfall is that there is no AC adapter and it relies  on batteries. Overall a very good scale.
 Literally a life saver. Very easy to use and now I no longer over eat. Would highly recommend this to anyone who wishes to eat anything they want in moderation.
 A wonderful scale when it works. But it has drained new batteries within the course of four days. This has happened twice, each time with brand new batteries--once the batteries provided by the manufacturer and once that I purchased the week before. I am considering returning the product due to the amount of batteries I need to go through to keep it working.
 Great, modern and extremely easy to use. It comes with batteries, which I love. I always feel manipulated when these items don't come with batteries lol. Great purchase!
 My first kitchen scale...even though I am an elder...I am quite pleased with its compact size and easy visibility.  I love the "tare" feature.  Now it's off to  make some (hopefully) delicious French bread using weight instead of ounces in measuring my ingredients!!!
 Small, light weight but does the job. Easy to use and store. Takes up no counter or cabinet space. Makes baking more science than art.
 This is the second time I have purchased this scale. I used my first one every single day until it accidentally got put on a hot burner and it had to be replaced. Oops! This scale has helped me lose 15 pounds and attain a whole new level of fitness. It will open your eyes to portion sizes.
 Works fine but I often find I need to use a nickel for initial weight then add whatever I'm weighing. It had trouble reading without the initial weight of the nickel.
 The product is light, portable, and provides fast and easy weights.  Easily displays various measurements.  Love it.
 It has started to act up but does the work
 Nice food scale, you can change the unit measure type, simple no use. no off or on button to turn on too.
 Just received it. Lightweight. Easy to use with instructions that are easy to follow. Small enough to store away conveniently.
 Very useful and great for everyday measuring
 Very light weight and looks good on my counter top. Easy to use. Thinking of buying one for our motorhome.
 I had ordered this scale and had it for about 9 months. The scale stopped working. I wrote a review reflecting my disappointment and the company sent me a brand new one. Very happy with the customer service.
 I really like the size of this scale. It is big enough for measuring food and small enough to easily store anywhere in my kitchen. Also I don’t have any issues with it going to sleep quickly, and whenever it has gone to sleep because I stepped away, it’s one click of the “on” button and it pops back up!
 I don't use a weight machine in the kitchen a lot but you need it when you need it.<br/>looks more expensive that what I paid for it.<br/>its very accurate too. tried weighting a lays chips and it was very precise ;)
 This is a great food scale -- small, lightweight, and seems very accurate. It's easy to use, and automatically subtracts the weight of a food container if you put the container on first, then turn it on. The size makes it great for travel if needed. Excellent value for the money.
 I wanted to make some recipes that called for the weight of ingredients instead of volumetric measurements, so I ordered this scale. It's extremely lightweight and works well for the measurements I need to make. You can convert units at the press of a button, and its thin size makes it very easy to stash in a drawer when you're not using.
 Not much to say about it, gets the job done.
 As described! A great way to  accurately measure what’s going in your  mouth.
 The scale is a great physical size and it reads up to several pounds, or a few kilos. We like how easy it is to use and its functionality. It covers all of our cooking/kitchen needs.
 Outstanding value!  Sleek, slim, and shiny.  Pre-installed batteries.  Very nice.  This would make a really great gift with tons of bang for the buck.
 I wanted a slim scale so I can slip it in between my wall and nice block. This scale worked out perfectly. When use it to track portions for our meals while we are watching what we eat.
 Works great! Used it a lot this past Summer doing some canning. Couldn't have weighed the fruit and vegetables without it!
 My wife and I really enjoyed the scale. After 8 months the digital display went out on us We are liking it enough to give it another try. The cost is not expensive so we ordered another, we'll see how it goes .
 easy to use and read. I like that you can zero out the dish.
 I purchased this scale because the one that I had was difficult to see when you wanted to switch between oz and gm.  This one is very easy to see and switch over.  also it is a nice compact size and doesn't take much space to store it in.
 This is the first kitchen scale I have ever owned.  So far, I am very pleased with it!  The scale is very easy to use and it's slim design makes it easy to stash between my cookbooks.  I'm trying to eat better and this is a huge help with portion control.
 I really like this scale. It's easy to use, easy to set a tare weight, and easy to switch between units of measure. I've wanted a kitchen scale for a long time and I'm very happy with this one.
 After 6 months the scale ended up dying on me. Would not hold a constant weight despite battery changes. I'll have to buy a new one.
 I use scales a lot for my bath and body business, and more often than not they get liquids on them, gunk, etc. This has held up for months now, unlike other scales I have bought.
 works great - I use these in my kitchen all the time.
 just a perfect scale for food and color my hair measuring the tubes.
 It works, it really does.
 Rather small for kitchen baking use, it works though. It shuts off quickly, so if you tare it with a measuring cup, go fill the cup and come back in more than twenty seconds it forgets the tare. Pretty annoying.
 Easy to use.  I don't know how we managed without it.  Small and unobtrusive - looks great on the countertop.
 I love this little weight scale so much it's so easy to use and you can store it anywhere!! Its a must buy kinda thing!
 Love this little digital scale. Has lots of different modes. Easy to use and easy to clean. I love how thin it is. Great value.
 Use it for weighing food portions and also packages.  Has several measuring scales.  Great item.
 Works great and is just what I needed!
 Easy to use, looks good, and accurate. I highly recommend for anyone else who is trying portion control.
 I love having this scale!  Talk about a game-changer; I was completely underestimating the amount of food I was eating.  For example, I thought I was having 1 oz of cheese, but I was really having 3 or 4!  This scale is so slim, it fits right in a drawer, no problem.  Great value for the price.
 My daughter in college actually ordered it.  As soon as she pulled the battery tab to activate the battery it worked for 1 weigh in.  She was charged more for shipping than I paid for scale.
 Excellent little digital scale.  I use it for cooking.  I've been using it for well over 6 months without any issues.
 Works great for measuring my coffee beans.
 I love this scale. I’m on keto and this helps keep my macros in check with my proportions.
 I use this to weight my supplements. I'm not sure if it is concise. But it is easy to use and looks good.
 I Bought is in Jan 2017 and it stopped working after 6 months. I contacted the seller and the customer service was awesome that I receive I was very impressed. I threw it in the trash but they sent email to troubleshoot but it didn't work and They were extremely helpful and gave me the refund back. Great Work I would recommend this product due do wonderful service I received. thank you :)
 I love this scale! Very convenient, and love that it easily can be zeroed out making it  work with a container or without.  It's perfect to help me stay on track with my new diet.
 Item came on time and as expected.
 Nice little scale for the price. East to use and understand. A bit small but it accommodates for this by being able to weight a bowl/container and then zero out to give you the weight of the object within it. Very nice design.
 This is a great scale. It measures my food. It measures my drinks. It measures everything that can fit on it. Especially food.
 Don't get liquid anywhere near the display WHICH IS RIGHT THERE Because they didn't take the simple measure of sealing it.
 Super simple to use, like the multiple measurement options. I do wish it could handle more weight than 10lbs though.
 The ability to toggle between grams and ounces is a plus as not all cookbooks use metric
 Only complaint the stickers at the bottom that hold the scale at level pealed off right away. Had to take them all off to keep it leveled.
 I am very excited to have and use this scale. It does not take a lot of counter space and is perfect for my use. I have weighed and prepackaged freezer bags of healthy portion foods for use thru several weeks. Very handy!
 Perfect size for me. It's simple, light, and sleek. Weighs my food properly. I like that there's only two buttons so it's very user friendly and that it has the capacity to change units. The only little annoying thing to me is that you may have to push a little harder on the buttons and sometimes it makes that clicking noise.
 I like this scale however it’s way too small. I wish there was a bigger option but I never noticed one if there was. This is really the only thing I’m disappointed in. It’s diffuclt to weigh all of my food because it’s so small. If there’s a bigger scale please notify me. I may return this one
 Very precise and useful!
 Great small size. Lightweight. Works very well. Very Happy
 I love the scales.  They are very accurate.

Its got some weight to it. Well worth it for the price.
 Very nice little scale for kitchen use.  Easy to keep clean with the stainless metal top.  Although I did not check the accuracy with any standardized weights, it seems to match up fairly well with stated net package weights.
 We used it everyday. Perfect for counting how many calories you comsume a day. Easy to clean, perfect size, it fits in every corner of the kitchen. Did I tell you the battery last forever.
 My wife made off with my old food scale in the divorce, so I bought this scale to replace it. Good riddance to the old! I like this new one so much better. Easy to clean and use, attractive, compact to store. I have already used it a lot and have no complaints at all!
 My husband meal preps and we had a very old cheap scale. We recently got this scale and love it. It is quick, sleek and very easy to use.
 great kitchen scale at a great price.  Seems accurate enough
 Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale Multifunction-- works great so far.<br/><br/>December 1, 2018 Update: The scale does not turn on anymore.  It was good while it lasted.
 We are trying to get healthier and we use this daily to measure our food. It is super sensitive and accurate, easy to read, easy to clean, and easy to store.
 This is a great little kitchen scale.
 This scale eats batteries like cookie monster eats cookies. A set of batteries lasts around 2 months with once a week use of the scale. Additionally, the display  is covered up by most bulky items.<br/>It works and scales accurately but I will be looking for a better version in the future.
 it works perfect for what i need
 I've bought this item for a long time, but just use it for several times and now it doesn't work anymore. I've put the scale in the closet for a long time. The scale can't weight any item now and when I press really hard on the plate it shows EEEEE. The battery is not very suitable and protruded.  Really a bad item I ever had in Amazon!
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-RVNHJKGSQLWRU"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91wcoG2mQJS.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fPQNv25sS.png"/> It has around 3 months and for some reason it does not change from the UNse message. Changes batteries and everything then the escale started to change weigh without having anything on top
 I am loving this food scale.  Recently joined Weight Watchers and this helps measure quantities of food until I get away from my "portion distortion." :)
 Thank you
 I habe owned this 3 weeks and used it 3 times. It is not calibrating properly. Since i use it for my home business, i find it super frustrating.
 Update (1/22): less than 2 weeks and I suddenly get a message 'unSE', can't find what it means and can't use it anymore. Tried removing batteries, new batteries, pressing buttons, nothing works.<br/>Purchased the scale to weigh my food as part of a food program (Renaissance Periodization). It is light, easy to use and quick to tare the weight.<br/>Update (5/25/17): once I changed the batteries, it's been working great. I haven't seen the error message since.
 Perfect size light weight but heavy duty
 Attractive product which works as advertised. Nice that batteries are included, and nice that they are regular batteries as opposed to the flat round ones that my older scale uses.
 Very accurate and easy to use. Also comes with a one-year extended warranty for registering the product.
 The scale is much more than I expected. Am very happy with the price deliver and performance.
 I love this scale. It's easy to use, very lightweight and small. I use it primarily for meat to help with portion size and to count calories. It's easy to store because of it's size, which is a bonus for me as I don't like counter clutter. Would definitely recommend.
 Does exactly what I needed it for
 It’s a very sleek digital kitchen scale. The measuring options are quite versatile, with a lot of options available. Easy to carry around, I take it with me on my journeys. It is a very classy looking product as well. Looks very up market for the price point.
 Was really looking forward to using this item only downside was that it stopped working after about a couple weeks would look into buying something better word well while lasted but would not buy again
 the scale doesn’t work. it just shows error or the numbers don’t move. i tried everything. don’t recommend!
 The scale display does not work any more. Just four months after purchasing. Initially gave a five start but I will take my rating back to 1.
 Perfect and just large enough.  Wanted a scale that could zero out,convert to grams, ounces and ml, and this does.
 I just got this, and started using it.  Literally ripped it out of the box, took off the battery tag, and started using it.  Very user friendly.  Easy to use, and seems to be accurate.  I would buy this again
 Utterly unreliable. The on-off switch doesn't work, you literally have to take the batteries out and reset it to get it to turn on. It worked about 3 times before breaking.
 Had to return. Seems like it was a return in the first place because it wouldn't work.
 Not sure this is completely accurate. I’ve had different weights on the same bowl but it’s minimal so for my use (cooking for dogs) it’s not a big deal. But for some who requires total accuracy this might not be the one for you.
 I love how convenient this scale is to store and to use. It tares to whatever container I am filling and then makes using the exact amounts of herbs easy. Great product.
 Wonderful little scale and very easy to use. Got it for my son as a Christmas gift and he loves it! We love the compact size and the ease of use. It is also great that is can measure in 4 different units and we are using it as a learning tool for our son since he is learning about measurement at school. The stainless steel look goes great with our kitchen appliances.

It is January and I bought it in September.  I use it twice a day to measure dog food. This morning, this happened (see video) and it is worthless now.
 Takes up no room. Easy to use.
 Nice small scale that gets the job done.  Ended up buying the bigger one from the same manufacturer as i needed bigger and it had a bowl.  I still use this from time to time though.
 a clean and tidy stainless steel kitchen scale that blend's in with my stainless appliances. I have not put it to the test yet, I did weigh one banana, as a test. I will up-date.
 Scale is a much needed addition to my kitchen.  Works perfectly! Highly recommend.
 It's attractive... looks great in the kitchen. It's accurate, provides ounces and grams.
 Easy to use and accurate. It is a bit sensitive but i was able to clear before measure food for my meal preps. Definitely recommend!
 Durable, accurate cheap scale.
 I gave this scale a fair shot! I've used it for about 2 months and had to buy a different one. I'm a hairstylist and used this scale to measure color, but it was extremely inaccurate. I feel like I wasted my money.
 I am glad to have found this food scale. It arrived quickly and I have been using it daily several times each day since. It is easy to use and the perfect size. I have had no problems with it and would recommend it for someone who needs to keep track of their portion sizes.
 got it a week ago and its pretty cool. easy to figure out right out of the box.. simple to use... I'm looking forward to getting a lot of use from it
 I've purchased this scale twice and while it works, it works great. Weight is accurate, product is simple and it looks great. The first I bought this product it lasted just under 3 months. The second time I bought this product it lasted 5 weeks. I used it maybe once or twice a week with ease of use. How in the world can I recommend this scale? I'd stay away.
 Accurate and looks good
 Item arrived within stated time frame, item is as described. Works well, no issues
 So light and thin, makes it easy to store.  Really nice quality, especially for the price.
 lightweight, portable, and easy to use. works great and easy to clean as well. like that it offers lb, oz, gm, and tare weight.
 It works as advertised, except the LED screen became impaired after 7 months of use. However, the customer service was excellent and I received a free replacement.
 ITEM IS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED
 Small and effective!  This has been a helpful addition to my kitchen tools and helps guide my portion control.
 Just got this to assist with portion control and I'm very pleased. Looks very nice on the countertop and easy to clean. (Imagine it's easier to clean compared to the non flat scales). Would buy again!
 This little scale works well.  I'm not sure about the battery life, since it's working with the original batteries.
 Serves its purpose but water got in the screen and it is harder to read. Should be more water resistant since it is used in the kitchen
 Looks nice and works well. Would like if it were a tad bit larger so that I could weight things on a plate just for convenience. But other than that it's great. I like that I can switch between oz and grams and pounds
 I have read a few reviews before I bought this, and yes it is cheap so that made a bit worried about it quality, but is pretty good. It is mostly plastic and it maximum weight is 500g which to me is a bit small since my bow weight about 100g. I have read about people complaining that it's battery is bad, I haven't come upon that yet because I turn it off right after I use it. I will say that it is pretty accurate. I will say that this product is worth buying.
 I like the easiness of zeroing it out after placing an empty container so I know quickly what the actual amounts are. I have learned through the years to put a rubber band around my spaghetti so I can weigh it rather than guess at a amount by feel. I like the stainless steel appearance. It seems very accurate with the digital read outs. The draw back is it wasn't made in the USA because I like to support our jobs here. I would recommend it to others because it is of good quality.
 It's awesome, good price, very accurate
 Love it, I used it to weigh my hiking gear so I know how much I'm carrying, and I use it for portion control. Great, accurate little scale.
 This scale is easy to use.  I do wish it had a larger top so you could put larger items on it and still see the weight.
 works great.  Like that there are different units it will measure-grams, ounces, etc.
 Works great. Only complaint from my daughter who has been using a food scale for over a year now says it needs to be bigger. So we will use this little scale for smaller portions.
 This little guy is a trooper. I've used it almost every day for 9 months and it's had no issues. Accurate even on very small amounts of food.
 Works like a champ. So thin it fits into the smallest places for easy access. Great for buying bulk that you may want to divide into individual pound packages.<br/><br/>Recommend highly.
 Love it. Great way to count calories and stick to a diet when cooking in bulk. Use it every day!!!
 The only issue with this that if you use a plate to measure items weight, you can't see the scale number, so you have to use a bowl or very small plate.
 I love this scale! It is very sensitive and picks up on even the smallest weight put on it. It has several different measurements to choose from and is very easy to understand and use.
 Exactly as expected.
 Easy to use. Good results.
 I tested it on a package I received in the mail, and it was accurate to USPS, anyways. I love how small and slim it is. Great for weighing small things.
 scale worked great for a month. then it started acting funky and weights randomly would vary
 Broke within a year of mild use (~3 times per month). Weighed coffee using it and now the scale goes beserk when i put 12 grams on it. Highly inaccurate and slow response time. Expected a higher quality good considering I used this for a max of 30-40 times for 10 seconds per time in a year. Would not recommend.
 I ordered this scale to weigh out my food as part of my diet and lifestyle change. This scale has exceeded all my expectations and I would recommend it to anybody. Amazon continues to be the leader in mail order purchasing and customer service.
 I bought this to measure food and it works great, easy to use and read
 Easy to use, easy to switch from ounces to grams.  Bought one for myself and after trying it bought for kids' homes.
 This is our second one of these. Our first one lasted years
 Easy to use, sleek design, very accurate as far as I can tell. So far this scale does the job perfectly and the price point makes it an ever better deal. I should also note that their customer service is fantastic. They reached out proactively to make sure I was satisfied with their product and helped out in no time when I had trouble registering it on their website for an extended year of warranty. I am extremely happy with the scale and the whole customer experience. Highly recommended.
 Love the way you can change measurements and take out the weight of a bowl if need be. Counting macros is hard, but this makes it easier! Very compact! Cleans up nicely with some Simple Green spray too or any dish soap.
 I like the fact that it is very small and takes up little room, but works as well as a larger scale.
 I LOVE THIS SCALE! I bought it to use as a weight loss tool and I am loving it! Can also be used for baking since it weighs up to 11 pounds. Buy it, you will not regret it!
 I love the compact sleek design. Stainless color blends in with my kitchen decor. Small enough to leave discreetly on the counter.
 Easy to use. Works for me
 I bought this scale and loved it the first time I used it.  It's so easy to read and change from grams to kilo's, etc.  The 2nd time I pulled it out to use it, it wouldn't turn on. I tried putting in new batteries, turning it off and on again, referenced the owners manual but nothing helped.  I emailed the company and they immediately shipped me a new product.  Great scale, great customer service.  I'd definitely buy from them again.
 We have one and gave this one as a gift to family.  The scale is accurate enough for dietary use, and very compact.  Battery lasts a LONG time, so no need to use the charger unless you are averse to using batteries.
 Small, compact, easy to store.... using it at office as postage scale.  Great!
 Clear readings, in oz, mg, pounds, kg and some I don't know!  :)<br/><br/>Easy to use; turns off on its own.  It zeros out any effort.
 Perfect, just what I needed and  wanted.  It everything I wanted a sale to do.  Plus it uses regular batteries, no button batteries.
 Very sensitive. I like that it comes with batteries.  Scales aren't something I feel comfortable buying second hand, so for $11, this scale is a steal.
 Easy to use
 I am very pleased with this scale. It is a perfect size for measuring food portions which is the reason I bought it. I would recommend this product.
 Love this scale. Very sensitive and accurate. Also you can put a container on the scale and it will automatically subtract the container weight from the food you're weighing
 Put my c - o - c - k on this scale and it was accurate.  I need to go on a diet.
 Excellent product and reliable!
 excellent easy to use
 Works great! This scale looks very nice on my counter, it has a large display and the weight is read instantly. Also, I like how light it is and how small it is. It's also very easy to use.
 Unbeatable value.  Simple to operate and works perfectly.  Compact size which is perfect for a NYC kitchen.
 WONDERFUL!!!  This scale is perfect for everything.  It will weigh anything, even one chip.  I use it every day for all types of food.
 I bought this last October but have only started using it on a daily basis recently so I could track macros. This scale worked really well, up until yesterday. I thought the batteries were dead, but even with new batteries, the scale won't turn back on.
 I bought this to keep track of how much my snake weighs, so having an easy zero function was important so I can put her in something instead of trying to get her to sit still. Even with her wiggling around, it gives a quick and accurate reading. I'd imagine it would therefore work even better for anyone weighing something not as squirmy.
 Very good scale with several options. Sometimes hard to see display numbers when I have a plate/dish on it because you have to be on top of it to read it well but its still totally worth it and would purchase again!
 Best scale to carrying around and easy to use. Love that is light weight and compact.
 This scale is sleek, easy to use and precise.  I bought this to replace my clunky old non-digital model and there is no comparison.
 This unit works perfectly but shame on me for not noticing that it only weighs "whole weights". It doesn't tell you if what you are weighing is a portion of a gram/ounce/pound.
 Small enough to leave our on your counter yet durable and big enough to get the job done
 Not exactly content with how it looked when I first opened it. It came scratched right out of the box still wrapped in plastic. When I first turned it on it started spitting numbers at me and there was nothing on the scale yet. Not content, but since I need to use it asap I guess I'll just have to work with it. This feels like a cheaply made toy I just bought.
 Does not weigh correctly.  Put an item on to weigh and weighed again and again and each time was a different weight!
 Great product! This makes meal prepping so much easier! The scale is very user friendly. The stainless steel makes it easy to clean and the scale is easy to store.
 At first, it worked great, although difficult to read with a larger plate. After 6 months, it stopped working. Gave totally inaccurate readings. Replaced the batteries. It didn't help. Threw it out.
 After 5 months, the scale stopped working. Manufacturer replaced it for free (including shipping). Hoping this one holds up better. Appreciate the warranty service.
 This little digital scale has really helped my husband and I keep track of our food/calorie intake.  It's actually been fun!  The design is sleek and very nice looking.  I would highly recommend.
 Straight forward, small, and lightweight scale. I like how I can store it in my kitchen drawer laying down or place it standing like a book on a shelf. I like the stainless steel material and the LCD display. It looks modern and uncomplicated.<br/>I think it is accurate and the tare function is great.
 I use this for measuring ingredients in my baking. I like the sleek stainless design. I like how light it is and slim so I can store anywhere I want. Always accurate!
 Great product so far. Good accuracy. I did notice it gets stuck on a number, but turning it off and then on again will reset it. Would buy this again.
 This scale is small but very functional.  I leave it out all the time.  Well worth the price - happy with this in my kitchen.  I replaced a scale that<br/>was larger so love the size of this one.
 Design, functionality and construction are all great. Only issue I've had is when trying to tare, any pressure added to press the button adds weight to the total, due to the buttons being integrated to the face of the unit.
 Hard to read the display at times depending on the lighting in the room/kitchen.
 Es pequeña practica y muy buena
 I use this to measure hair color, bleach mixtures. It struggles to read anything less that 3-5g.
 Works great. I can cook with this OR use it for portion control. Very basic, but it's great if that's all you need it for.
 Nice looking but not accurate the first reading. You need to pick up and place down a few times what your weighing, compare the majority of same numbers, and hope you get an accurate reading... pain in the butt. Not for chemistry!
 No complaints, this does what it should and seems to do it well. I appreciate how compact it is so i can slide it easily into a drawer and it is very sensitive to the smallest touch, quick response.
 Works Great<br/>I am using My Fitness Pal app and need to know how much I am eating..<br/>This is perfect!👍👍👍
 It seems a little small but it works fine.  I really like the size of the display.
 Looks beautiful but supposedly has four settings for units. When device is turned on, it only will register grams....none of the other three settings. I followed the instructions which accompanied the device. The units button does nothing at all. Will follow up with the company directly but so far not happy. Will update rating if and when this is resolved.
 Was so excited for it to arrive, to have it not work correctly.. It changes weight of object depending on where you place it on the scale, and gives incorrect weight entire time. A nickel weighs 5 grams, and it said was 3 grams or even 0 grams .. depending on where I placed it.
 I ordered this because I'm starting to count calories and lose weight and just try to be more healthy in general. It's a little small but overall works well for what I'm trying to do. If you want to bake and use big bowls to mix together the ingredients this might not be the best for you but I like the size because I have to keep this in a dorm room and it's important things don't take up too much space.
 Works well.  Use it every day
 This scale looks really nice, however it isn't very accurate. My biggest problem with it is that the tare button cannot be pushed without destroying any chance at an accurate measurement. Shipping was on point however.
 This has been helping me with lifestyle changes by just doing what it does simply and well. No effort measuring.
 good product and good price
 Great product, easy to use, fast start, scale zeroing is a great feature when measuring ingredients precisely for recipes.  Recommend
 Use it in my bulk tea and spice shop and it's been fantastic. super easy to use. Have used it for 3 months now.
 Great for diets
 Perfect. Gets the job done.
 It is a small yet functional scale.
 Really like this scale it's small and slim but big enough to put a container on it. I Use it often the weigh my chicken (or other meats) to make sure I'm packing enough protein
 Very good product and easy to use.
 I picked this up for 13.99, which was really the perfect price point. The device itself is small, but that's not a problem as long as you know how to tare. On the same note, I really like that it's so small, since I have a small kitchen. On top of that, most of my counter space is already taken up! This scale is so small I can put it in a drawer and take it out when I need it, which is really nice.
 We like this when we make bread
 Lightweight and easy to use.
 Great price and works great
 This electronic scale is one of  1/2 doz. that I own and it undoubably is the best of all, the price for this scale is execellent and I have other scales that costs 3 times as much and don't come close for simplicity  of use, very happy with this unit.
 Scale works great. simple, straight forward design. Nice finish on the unit.
 Keto necessity
 Perfect measure
 I really like this scale but it gets messy real quick even though it's supposed to be Stainless Steel and it doesn't weigh accurately because I put some water in a Measurement Cup for 2 oz. But when I put it on the scale it would say 2.5 oz instead.
 Very disappointed in this scale. When i got it , the box was in perfect condition but I installed the batteries and it powered on. I put something on it to test it and it did nothing. I even put new batteries in to see if that was the issue but nothing.<br/>I have since sent it back and I am looking for a different brand and hope I have more luck with that one.
 I received this on Tuesday and it broke by Sunday after having lightly wiped some flour off of it. It started flashing numbers rapidly and then turned off. Can’t get it to turn back on at all. I didn’t even get a chance to register it for its warranty.
 No ggod
 Love this scale! So easy to use has oz,ml,g,lbs perfect for weighing out meats and snacks! I haven’t had any issues with battery life yet either and have had it now for a while. Would buy again!
 Multiple uses for this scale.<br/>I started out using it for my food but then starting using it to weigh mail. Works nice
 I love it
 Seems like a high quality product.
 I love my little food scale. Keeps my on track with my portions and no more eye balling how much I'm eating. Love it!
 The first time I used this it would. A week later the tare and unit buttons didn’t. Changing the batteries didn’t help.<br/><br/>Maybe try a different scale.
 This scale is just what I wanted.  I use it manage my food intake.  However, the primary reason I bought it was to weigh the coffee beans before I grind them.  I then weigh the water so I have he proper ratio. The display area is well lit and easy to see.  Surface area is just right for my purposes.  Scale is fast.  My only problem is that it turns off too quickly. Would definitely recommend this product.
 Works great.  Easy to use.
 Better than I expected!
 Very accurate with multiple functions for weighing in many different measurements
 This is a great scale.  I was surprised how small it is but it does a great job.  The only thing I wish it would do was hold a tare (if you've tared with an empty bowl) and then it has turned off after timing out, it no longer remembers the bowl (even if it's still on there).  But I make do and this has taken the guess work out of baking and portion sizes.
 Slim and trim. Super easy to store. Tares easily. A great little scale. Perfect for soap making and the kitchen.
 I just tried to use this product for the first time to measure 1.5 grams and the scale wont read anything below 15 grams!  Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money and buy a product that actually works.
 I bought it for present.<br/>Later my friend told me she was happy with this stuff.
 This scale is really light and mobile. So far perfect for what I wanted which is to get a better idea of general portion sizes and the amount of food I am eating. People have complained about the accuracy being off by a very minor amount but, it has measured my creatine to 5 grams consistently (just to see the accuracy based on the scoop given with the creatine) therefore, considering the room for error in food labels themselves amongst other things, I am not concerned by it. Overall satisfied.
 Great product
 After 3 months, this thing began to short out batteries that were powering it. Brand new batteries, both rechargeable and standard would be rendered unusable after 1-2 uses. We burned through five batteries for 7 uses of the scale.
 I love the functionality of this scale. It is my second digital scale and it is better than the other brand and is nicely affordable.
 Lightweight, thin, easy to store, quick to boot up and use, choices of measurements... lets me do UK recipes in my American kitchen.
 I just wrote a super long review and my phone rang and I accidentally lost it all... it's no super computer but I promise you won't find a better scale for this price
 Small and simple it does exactly what I needed. For the price can't beat it.
 the scale is good, but smaller than I thought - I just did not check measurements; but still does its work.
 Nice little food scale at a great price
 I don’t like this scale at all. Will change weight reading just sitting there with bowl of liquids.
 Love this food scale. Affordable, minimalist, easy to store (small enough to hide away but large enough to put almost anything on). A++ Works great!
 These scales are so handy thank you.
 Inaccurate to 15 grams.  Useless for measuring any small quantity. How do you measure 5g yeast?  You cant
 It works great but top, but the top is small and many containers overwhelm the space.  I wish I would have bought a larger unit.
 I just started meal prepping more seriously and the one thing I love about this is that you can put your empty dish on the scale before turning it on and it auto balances to zero, before filling. Looks great and seems like it's made with quality in mind.
 Good scale and easy to use.  I like the zero out of the measuring cup.
 Use this thing EVERYDAY, literally EVERYDAY.  It gets my flour and water exact for my levain, and my levain is super happy because of it! Couldn't imagine my kitchen without this tool!
 It's small enough to fit into a drawer but larger enough to hold a plate
 Very nice and useful.
 This is my second scale after wearing the first one out by slowly weighing out a ton of clay in small increments.  I use my scale in my clay studio and I really like it.  This one is a little different from the first where you have to wait for it to calibrate every time you turn it on, a handy function.
 I had an issue with the scale initially where the battery would drain even when it was turned off. I contacted customer service and explained to them the problem I was having. They were very polite, friendly, and easy to work with. They sent me a new scale and it works perfectly. It works very accurately and meets all my needs. I strongly recommend this product.
 Good little kitchen scales...works well for sizing up portions for diet. Not heavy duty but I didn't need it to be.
 Very nice scale!  However, did NOT include the bowl as the description indicated.  That was one of my reasons for choosing this item over others.
 This scale does not measure accurately. I was using it at a second check scale and at first it worked fine. Then it got to the point where I always had to take the batteries out and then put them back in to calibrate the scale. Now, the numbers change while I'm measuring even though nothing has been added or removed!
 As far as I'm concerned, this is the perfect kitchen scale for all of my culinary needs. As a University student, I use it daily to regulate accurate portions for the ingrediants in my post workout shake, and on occasion when I'm curious about the calorie content of a new food item I'm trying. It's convenient, reliable, and I love the stainless steel feel of the surface. Ultimately, I'm very glad I invested in this.
 Pros:<br/><br/>Reasonally priced,<br/>Well made and easy to use<br/>Works as advertized<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>Only one color - white which is a bit bland looking.<br/>Smaller than I thought.<br/>Poor customer service
 Nice design and usability.  I'm using mine primarily for bread-making.  The tare function is easy to use.  And the price is definitely right.
 I bought this digital scale to weigh food portions as part of a fitness program. It is a decent little scale for the price, but please note that the manufacturer's 0.01 oz "strain of gauze" sensitivity claim is completely false. It is more like 0.15 oz. So if you're thinking of buying this one simply because it boasts a greater weight sensitivity than like items in its price range, then like me, you will be disappointed. While it will do the job  (because the majority of items I'll be weighing will be greater than 0.15 ounces), I really hate it when manufacturers are dishonest about what a product can and cannot do. This will make me think twice about ever ordering from Etekcity again.<br/><br/>*Note: I tested the scale's sensitivity by placing small beans on the platform until the readout changed from "0.00". I tried it without a bowl, and then with one using the "tare" feature. In both cases, it took about 30 beans (0.15 oz) to make the display change from zero. While I'm not too concerned with what the weight of a few individual beans is, I chose this product over others for the pinpoint accuracy it claims to have. Etekcity shouldn't state that their scale is capable of determining weight down to this level of accuracy if it is not!
 I use this scale every day, and it works perfect.  It's super easy to use, and doesn't take up much space.
 Doesn't give the exact weight because it flickers between 1 number up &amp; down.
 Muy funcional
 Works good for small items and boxes. Still working so far. I think it's a good buy.
 Super compact and easy to use. Exactly what I was looking for.
 I bought this item for measuring food to keep my diet on track. The scale is very accurate and versatile in that it has the ability to jump between units of measurement without reseting. I really enjoy the sleek cool look and has proven to be very easy to clean (for when I (often) forget to '0' the food container). I'm so happy with this product it is now my go to gift for people who are fitness oriented or need help regulating their diet.
 Wife is very happy with it. Very accurate and easy to use. Attractive.
 This is a very well made, very accurate, and smart looking scale.  No need to look any further.
 The scale was off by as much as 50 percent. trying to find a way to recalibrate but everything weighs about half its actual weight. They sent a new one that works better.
 Works very good. Just note it is not "touch" buttons. You have to push until you hear a click. Initially I though it does not work until I accidentally pushed harder!
 I use this scale to weigh different foods in order to count calories. Works perfectly every time. Switches between different modes easily.
 Handy size for kitchen counter. Has worked perfectly and easy to use.
 Easy to learn to use, supa sleek and tuck-away-able, totally fits the bill! I use the zero function a lot bc it makes any container a measuring container!. My only complaint is that the first time I switched batteries, the zero function button seemed to be less responsive. Tested with different batteries, and still - had to hold down the zero for longer for it to take effect.
 A great scale to measure food intake.  Very easy to use and the instructions are very clear.  Definitely recommend.
 Ordered this kitchen scale so that I could buy meats from the market in bulk and re-package them for individual meals. Works great, price is great, all-in-all a good product.
 This scale is smaller and thicker than I was expecting. It does fit on a drawer but I would like it a little bit bigger and more slim. I hope batteries last and hopefully accuracy will be good.
 Perfect little scale for me. I needed exact measurements of food for my dogs since I have to feed them 3 times a day.  This scale is small and compact and the finish matches my stainless steel kitchen. I love the accurate readings especially the Tare option. I am very pleased with it. I also use it for myself, lol 😉
 Love this scale, I use it to weight letters and packages for mailing and my roommate uses it for cooking it's a great looking scale so I don't have to hide it.
 Exactly what I was looking for, the scale is very slim and light weight. It is also intuitive and I figured it out as soon as I turned it on.
 Superior design, easily stored, accurate, and priced beautifully, this is a gem!
 This is the perfect gadget to have handy around the kitchen.
 Doesn’t give u persice measurements for grams you’ll always be a point off. Not worth it
 Decent scale, it's very small.  It's a little too small for weighing out raw food.  So far it works ok but hard to read due to bowls covering screen.
 I like that it can weigh to such a high number. That means I can tare my plates and still get an accurate read on the amount of food I'm getting. Great for carb counting.
 I LOVE this food scale! I use it pretty much everyday especially for meal prepping. It is super easy to change the settings on it from oz to lb to Ml. Great price and good quality!
 Are these the most accurate scales ever made? For $12? Are you kidding? These are kitchen scales for cooking in grams. If you convert most liquid volumes to weight/mass, you don't have to fluff flour or pack brown sugar - just weigh and move on. Recipes are faster and more accurate with less confusion. So if nearly all kitchen scales are alike, what makes these stand out? My last kitchen scales used a weird 9 volt that I could not find a replacement for when the battery failed. These scales use the ubiquitous AAA batteries so there is not the built-in obsolescence that other manufacturers build in. As for fingerprints, the stainless steel is no better than my last one - a space age plastic. On the other hand, for $12 and using AAA batteries, every cook deserves kitchen scales.
 I am both a professional and home baker. Given the volume of weighing I do, upon arrival the scale seemed to be smaller than I expected. However, its sleek design is effective and it works well. The illuminated display helps in the event you place a larger bowl or item in view of it.
 This scale is great for the price and easy to use
 Good things do come in small packages. I had to replace a scale I had used for years. I ordered this ultra slim and light scale and it is perfect. Less bulky and more accurate.
 The absolute worst scale I’ve ever purchased. I can never rely on it to zero out, it is glitchy regarding power and overall a complete waste of every penny I spent.
 Love this for soap making and general cooking where I need accuracy
 Works good but smaller than I expected. Doesn't even fit a small dinner plate. Literally need to use a tiny plate for it to fit on the scale.
 Love it. Easy to use. Love love it.
 Easy to use and switch between units. The background light goes off after a short time, but the scale is still on, just put a little weight on it and it lights back up.
 Nice little scale, but sleep screen goes dark too quick and then also shuts off too quick a few seconds afterwards. When adding ingredients together if you take too long it turns off, then when you turn it back on, your showing zero as it has automatically tared itself with your measuring bowls and ingredients on it. Worth the purchase, but I didn't like this feature of turning off so quickly.
 Had mine for a while now. It's covered in flour, gets used all the time, works like a dream. Quite a stylish lil' thing too.
 Like it
 Does what it's supposed to do, priced right.  Display can be a little tricky to read, but more than adequate.
 Works well and I really like how slim it is because it doesn't take up any room to store. I keep it on top of my microwave.
 Small and easy to use.
 Got this little scale for a real good price $11 and it does exactly what I got it for. Use it for measuring when I make my pour over coffee in my chemex.  The highest I measured on this thing is 700 grams, but I'm sure it goes much higher just never had to.  It's also very easy to use.
 I love the scale and I didn't realize how much I would use it until I got it it's so easy to use.
 Very nice
 Sleek design, simple to use, easy to keep clean.  It's a sweet looking scale and is very accurate.  The price is great.  I use it every day.  Love it!
 This is a great tool in the kitchen! Sleek design makes it easy to store. The finish makes it easy to clean. Very easy to use!
 An awesome product.  Am finding I use my new kitchen scale often.  Compact and fits nicely in my kitchen.
 I was excited by this scale at first, but I now question its accuracy, especially with smaller quantities. My recipes are becoming inconsistant, and almost inedible...
 If ur planing to weigh anything less that 16g it's not going to work even with a counter weight setup.
 I bought this for my fiancé for meal prepping. He loves it so I love it!!
 Easy to use and great addition to counter. Love its smooth sleek design.  Shows weight well exactly as it is.  Also easy to clean.
 I bought it to scale my foods since I was increasing weight at that time, but it just never worked, I bought new batteries, replaced it, never. . It would always display wrong weights. I ended up buying another one at Walmart
 Very accurate, washes up easily and so far batteries have lasted a year(ish).
 Works as designed and easy to clean.  The first unit received was scratched.  I returned it for another without problem.
 Ordered for my dad, because he's a calorie counter, and he says its perfect.
 Perfect scale, light and easy to clean! We use it every day for 4 + months can't go wrong with size and price point.
 Works great simple to use
 It's portable and good size so it doesnt take up a lot of counter space. Has different conversion settings from oz to ml to g. It even has a tare tare option which I love!!!
 It's very nice looking that's it, inaccurate with grams and ounces, should tried before stupidly reviewing
 Simple to use, works well and a great value for the price. Also doesn't take up much space in the kitchen.
 Easy to use, even for a twitchy drug addled mind. Now our cuts are exact and our macarons perfect....macarons are my crack!
 works perfectly for what I need it to do - weigh food items
 Works great and was a great price
 This was a great addition to my kitchen.  It works well and the digital readout is easy to see.
 I was hesitant at first, in regards to quality due to very low cost of this product. However, much to my surprise, this scale is amazing. Extremely easy to use and understand. Light &amp; compact, makes for easy storage and/or counter top storage. The cost of this product along with quality, made my "food weighing day!" I would highly recommend this product.
 Had it for over a year and still kickin :)
 It's fancy. However, it's very small, in a way that if you use a big plate you cannot see what is the weight. So it's good for small measurements.
 Looks very nice and works as expected.  Like different measurements and is accurate.
 After 10 days of use, it no longer works. My first sign should have been the lack of accuracy- what was 3 oz. of the same protein changed each time I weighed it. I guess you get what you pay for.  Now I just get an error code when I try to use it.
 We use these for weighing ingredients for pizza fundraisers.  Very easy to use and clean.
 We've had this scale for about 6 months, now, and are very pleased.  If offers several different weight scales and is easy yo use and accurate.  It does everything we need in a kitchen scale.
 Use this almost everyday. I like the digital screen. I love the feature that enables you to subtract the weight of the container from the food.
 I loooove this little scale. It is really lightweight and fits easily in a drawer, it's very easy to wipe clean, and it's very precise. I use a food logging app, and this scale is really helpful in getting accurate measurements for produce, meats, protein powder, and basically everything I eat. It's very helpful for recipes. I use it several times a day, and I consider it an essential. It was so cheap, too! Definitely worth it.
 Nice compact, accurate. Only down size, I wish it had larger batteries, though I'm sure these will last a while. Just my old scale used 9V and lasted a long time. However, this is a great little scale. buy one!
 Works awesome. 5/5
 Given as a gift in a gift swap game. Let's just say it wasn't swapped.
 I love it: it's compact, precise and very easy to use
 Great product! Love this scale! I use it all the time when cooking or meal prepping! So easy to use and sleek design!
 The product arrived in a very timely manner. It even came with batteries!!! It is super easy to use and the instructions explain everything perfectly.
 Loving it more with each use. Extended rectangular design makes it easier to use and hold merchandise.<br/>Mine was right on target with the scale at the post office.
 Easy to use.
 At times it feels a little delicate. But it is good for all you diet aware people.
 Buena, bonita y barata
 Easy to use, easy to see display, nice big surface area to measure on. I'm doing carb cycling so measuring portions is key and this scale has made it easy.
 Fits my needs.
 Such a small and elegant scale. I use it to measure herbs for infusions primarily.  No problems so far.  I have a much larger, uglier scale at home and will replace it with this one.  Very nice in a modern kitchen.
 Very happy eith the purchase! I use it to weigh small ingredients and it never fails.Have it for a year it consumes battery but overall very happy.
 Now that I'm retired &amp; have more time to try out new recipes, I've found this scale indispensable in my kitchen.  Many of the recipes have measurements in grams or ounces (instead of the usual 1/4, 1/2 cup, etc), &amp; this scale makes switching to metric measurements quick &amp; easy!
 Great little scale for the price. Very easy to use. Like that it goes up to 11 lbs. Use it for making hamburger patties and dividing up meat for making jerky
 Works very well and easy to use.  Readout is easy to read and stable.  Batteries included!
 This scale is accurate and does everything necessary to provide necessary measurements for coffee. Especially when comparing the price to a $35 Hario Coffee Scale, I was pleasantly surprised how accurate this is with coffee beans and grounds. Now of course, don't expect it to read the weight of each coffee bean; it just isn't that sensitive. But when I'm making my AeroPress coffee, I measure it out in my Hario manual grinder and then measure it again in the AeroPress. It's usually right on, but sometimes a gram &lt; or &gt;.<br/>I recommend this unless you cannot handle the risk of it being off 1 gram. For best results, what I do is weigh it in (your container of choice) and then shimmy it around a bit and weigh it again. It often will be different between the two, but you're paying a low cost for this, so this is part of it =)<br/>So with that method, I have the same strength coffee each day (** 1 gram of coffee per 15 ml of water **).<br/>This of course will work great for all your other kitchen scaling needs. Have fun and enjoy consistent brews each day and say goodbye to "eh, it's a little weak today." or "Hm, that's a little a strong."<br/>One last thing is to make sure it's wiped clean of any residue or gunk (even seemingly minor), that has proven to throw off the scale significantly.
 I use this scale to weigh out hops and sugar for beer brewing/bottling and also for weighing out coffee. The uses are endless. I really don't know why I waited so long to buy a kitchen scale. I love that it doesn't take up much space and it reads out two decimals (hundredths).
 Seems to be working as described.  I like that I can put a bowl on it and then weigh the food.  I don't know if it is true weight since I have nothing to compare it to.
 I use this weigh my reptiles and etsy packages. Works well and not bulky
 Just what i was looking for works great
 Inexpensive, but does the job well.  I've already spilled lye water all over it, but it didn't damage it.  Still works great.  If you need a scale for soap making this is a good choice.
 Very easy to use right out of the box.  The display is well lit.  It is easy to switch between the measurements with a simple button click.  Very accurate and doesn't take up too much space.
 I didn't think I would use this as much as I do, I should have purchased 2, one for home and one for school.
 I use this everyday doing meal prep. Keeps portions on point and easy to clean.
 Easy to use and no way for me to check but I imagine its weighing accurately, at least enough for me.  Easy to use.  Happy with the purchase.
 decent little scale for the kitchen. I am using it for portion control. works well.
 High quality, durable food scales! I love them!
 Love it. I use it almost on a daily basis to weigh in my foods.
 Wife uses it in the kitchen. Also check postage with it
 Really nice and compact scale. I bought it primarily to measure proteins (steaks) which i cut from primals. However its so small and stays in the drawer that i often forget to use it! :)
 Nice scale, especially at this price point.
 I love this scale. It's simple and has multiple different measurement increments. I use mg and ml the most.
 Works good
 This is the first food scale I have purchased, and I'm quite pleased with the results. The scale takes little room on my counter making it convenient for me to measure my portions quickly. I like the fact that I can place a bowl on the scale, zero it out, and then weigh my food. That scale does all of the work for me. No need to subtract the weight of bowls and plates from the total weight.
 Great kitchen scale, very small, tares as soon as you set a plate or device on it and then turn on, weighs accurately<br/>Great buy, glad I bought this.
 This was the perfect scale for my needs.  Small in size, with a sleek, clean design.  Able to weigh in pounds, ounces, milliliters, grams.  Really happy with the features and quality and what a great price!
 I am meal prepping and the scale is helping tramendalsy. When something is wet I just place a glass bowl and zero it out and then add the liquid.
 Very accurate. Used for pinewood Derby cars.
 Got it for my wife to use in the kitchen and it works well.
 I just received this in the mail today. It is replacing another scale I have had for year that has reached the end of it's life. I chose this scale because it was flat, stainless, and took AAA batteries.<br/><br/>First Impressions:<br/><br/>- The packaging is solid, it's not bouncing around, it's secure in the box.<br/>- I liked the stainless, it comes with a film you need to remove which is nice.<br/>- I like the blue hue to the screen and large LCD. Makes it easy to read.<br/>- I'm a bit disappointed in the buttons. I thought they would be smooth, the photos don't do a good job showing that these are actual buttons with space in between. This means I will need to make extra sure when cleaning it to make sure nothing gets stuck in there. Since it's a flat surface, I'm imagining flour, dust, crumbs, you name it getting stuck in there. This is the reason for the 4 stars.<br/>- I like that it comes with batteries.<br/>- I love that it's light weight.
 This is an easy to store and easy to use food scale.
 ...it's just hard to read the display when I put even a medium-size plate on top.  I kind of wish I got a different scale now.
 Works but smaller than expected.
 Not especially accurate.  scale consistently over reported weight.  On re-weigh, it under reported weight.  There is no means to adjust it.  Fine for some food weights but just not dependable.  That is what is leading me back to Amazon to track down another, hopefully, consistent scale.
 A good buy. Accurate, light weight and easy to use.
 Fantastic. Exactly what I needed for my foreign recipes; no more goofy conversions from metric to moronic imperial. Just set the little guy to grams and done!!!!
 Easy to use, does what it should do. I love that it can switch between metric and US units. Great price for the quality (or great quality for the price...)
 It's perfect and precise
 seems accurate. works well in my kitchen. easy to use.
 I love this scale.  It's small and easy to store or just leave on the counter.  Accurate and easy to use.  The Tare function is so convenient.
 I like the sleek design of this scale and it weighs fine. However, a really large limitation is the surface area - because everything is on one level, its impossible to put a large bowl on it and be able to read the numbers. I wish I would have purchased one that had one level for putting the bowl on, with the actual digital reading on a lower level. Also, the numbers are screaming bright and are only readable looking straight on.
 It is accurate and easy to use. The only downside is that it is sometimes hard to read the display, since the background blends in with the lit numbers.
 It’s great but it’s kinda Annoying when you have to keep on resetting it to zero
 Overall it’s decent. Measurements are not always exact.
 It is not working very well when u gradually add something. It goes up and down. It stops on 10 for example and suddenly changes to 14 and then comes down to 13!!!
 The weight sensor on this scale has a lot of friction, so that when I measured 14 grams, the readout bounced around between 12 and 16 grams.  Poor design in that the push buttons are on the weighing platform.  I replaced it after three months' use with a cheaper scale that works much better (eBay from China).
 Love the ease of weighing my protein portions.<br/>Thank You
 Not the greatest scale, I have an older one that is much more accurate and was about the same price I bought in 2010. This one feels cheap and plasticy and doesn't measure as quickly as my old one does.
 This product is totally worth every penny! From the purchase to arriving to my front door was a very quick shipment. I would totally recommend this Eteckcity Digital Kitchen Scale to all of my friends, family &amp; colleagues.
 I like the size and the flat design of this kitchen scale. The display is easy to read  and pressing the unit button quickly change the unit of measurements.<br/>Also the tare feature is a plus. It stores easily in a kitchen drawer. It is a very nice scale.
 Last year I have bought a small scale for weighing herbs. I purchased this one for my cooking and juicing needs.<br/>It is very convenient since I can use any container with it, to weigh liquid as well solid foods.<br/>The battery has already lasted a few months.
 Not accurate at all several different readings u get what u pay for
 Great scale and super easy to use!
 This scale doesn’t work, will swing more than 50% when weighing food and is chewing through batteries like no one’s business.  The customer support link provided by Amazon does not connect to the seller.
 Nice small kitchen scales. Does the job but does not take up much room.
 Over six months of use and work's great!
 Baking has never been better!
 I bought this mainly to measure 1/2 lb coffee for cold press.  It is more compact than I expected, so I simply use a smaller zip lock bag.
 absolutely love it, so small, practical and so handy
 Very nice scale!  It is easy to read and use.
 Works exactly as described. Tare function and different scale s work great.
 Easy to use, great price
 Amazing product. Packaged well with quality components. Includes batteries which is great. Easy to setup and use. Easy to clean. Great value.
 When you are under 1 gram it is not that good.  Really you need to be a few grams for it to show you a good weight .
 I am so happy with this scale. It weighs in different measurements and has a tare feature so you don't have to put the item directly on the scale. It's compact and easy to use. I am using it multiple times a day with no issues. I combine the weight of my food with the myfitnesspal app and to control my serving sizes as suggested on packaging. It's reassuring to know how much I'm consuming without guessing.
 It weighs in ounces or grams. I use it every day to weigh may food.
 useless for under 3oz
 Works wonderfully, couldn't have asked for a better scale.
 A great help for anyone weighing out food portions.
 I've been using it now for a few months and like it but there is a bit of a big but. If the dish you need to weigh is big it is hard to set it up and still see the reading. I bake a lot and use a 12 QT dish to mix my dough, cannot set it up to weigh it. I need to buy a new scale with the reading position below the weighing surface so it is never blocked by the dish used.
 love it
 scale started to malfunction 2 weeks of owning it.
 I love the scale and is easy to figure out. Nothing complex and gets the job done ans you can switch from pounds to grams to ounces to millimeters with ease by pressing one button. The product is great.
 I already had a kitchen scale, but this one is more compact and much easier to clean. I enjoy using it and would recommend it to anyone.
 This came nicely packaged, it looked just as described once out of the box. It is lightweight and compact so it fits nicely on the counter without taking up a bunch of space and is easily moved when the space is needed. Battery was pre-installed with a pull out tab to get it started. This is a very simple machine, easy to use even without previous experience. I do tend to use a small square of wax paper each time I put food on it to cut down on surface germs/bacteria and cross contamination. This has in no way affected the machine's ability to calculate the weight of my items. Very happy with the product so far and would definitely recommend it.
 Good quality, but when it turns off so fast after you tare your bowl and start to add stuff, it's very inconvenient.
 I am very happy with this product so far. I needed a scale to weigh my food. This is compact, easy to use and accurate. It takes up very little room and has the tare function. It allows to to make sure I am getting the ammount of protein I need each meal.
 Foot pad went missing after a few uses. Never washed, and it remains in one spot on the counter, so it's a mystery. Now it wobbles when used and is therefore is not at all reliably accurate for precise measurements.
 Does what it is supposed to but it is too small. I can't read the screen after placing a bowl or food on it.
 I recently purchased this scale, it's very simple/no nonsense and weighs accurately, I have no complaints.<br/>I can not answer for battery life or durability yet but I will after I have used it awhile.
 I use mine to weigh out meat that I buy in bulk so that I can package it into meal size bags.
 Haven't used it yet but there's something weird going on with the screen right out of the box. Hope this doesn't turn onto an issue but it sucks a little that it isn't in pristine condition.
 Does as advertised. This is replacing my old one that finally kicked the bucket. Easy to read. Easy to use. No complaints.
 The scale has been very easy to use, I've noticed people mentioning the back light not staying on long enough but that hasn't been an issue at all. It's also very easy to "tare" which has been a huge plus for me because I use it for all different foods on my food prep days and I'd rather not have to clean it in between each use. The size is also absolutely perfect, I love this product and am super impressed with this company!
 Works very well. Dinner plate unfortunately covers the digital read.
 I have had this product for several years as I also had their bathroom scale. I had a problem at the beginning and called customer service. They were wonderful. They sent me a new one right away. Ever since I have been pleased with the product. I only have one request. Next version design it with a back light.
 I used in the kitchen for scale the chicken. I have used about 4 months and it does not calibrate every time when I start to scale. Most of the times it gives me a different scale with the same weight of an item.  It is very frustrated.
 it really is nice !
 Good service.  Good price.  Great product!  Use it often.
 DOESNT DO MILGRAMS
 Using this for food. Very easy to use.
 This product is well built however lacks accuracy. I put a 200gm bowl and used tare function which resets weight to 0. After this I put some food to weigh and then repeat this 4-5 times, I get variation of 1-4 grams for food of about 2lb. For a scale that claims 1 gm precision and highly accurate sensors, I may be having 1 off unit or its just the way it is built. It will definitely serve you well for cooking recipes but if it bugs you to see different number for the same thing, this may not be for you.
 Works well, easy to use. The instructions on how to zero it out, and other functions were a little sparse, but it's good for a basic kitchen scale. Use it in cooking at home.
 Used it to measure smart balance buttery spread.  Laid a piece of plastic wrap on it and weighted it out it was great.  No more guess in for correct amount.
 Does what it needs to do, easy to clean. Love that I can change the units too. Helped me portion food better &amp; lose weight.
 For anyone that wants to know.  This scales will not measure grams in half or decimal incraments
 This scale is really nice. I use it to portion out dough for rolls etc. and other baking items.
 It's not particularly sensitive and it was much smaller than I was expecting it to be. Would not purchase again if I had the choice but works well enough.
 The design of this scale is beautiful -- goes with all the stainless steel in my kitchen.  I like that there are no moving parts to break.
 Excellent
 I purchased this to weigh components for a combat robot and it has worked well.
 Really a great scale and even better for the price
 This item is already not working properly after only a month. The display is going funky with the digits so I cannot weigh anything.
 Going on 8 months of using this scale.  It hasn’t let me down yet.  It’s easy to use, clean, store, and pack to take on the road.
 Impressive scale to use in my kitchen. It's what I needed.
 This  scale is overall a good product. Seems accurate enough for measurements to the gram, but it does fluctuate a bit on smaller measurements.<br/><br/>The first Product I received was defective and drained batteries. Etekcity contacted me to send a free replacement, and it works perfectly!
 This is a great food scale for the price. Very easy to use and understand.
 After months of using it, sorry, but not too accurate.
 I love this scale. It is super easy to use and to clean as well! It is very lightweight and does not take up too much space. Comes with batteries too which makes it ready to use as soon as it arrives!!
 Works well and very accurate.
 Love it! I rarely rate things (due to my laziness and procrastination) but I love this little guy so much that I just have to rave about it. It's kind of small but that's ok because I'm able to bring it back and forth with me to work VERY easily. It's very simple to use and because of that I'm encouraged to use it more often to track my macros. I'm extremely happy with it.
 Scale has stopped working after a couple of months.<br/><br/>Update: great customer service as they immediately replaced the scale.<br/><br/>Update 2: replacement scale no longer works properly with “unse” code.
 Nice size.  Nice appearance. Priced right.  Would buy again and do recommend.
 No problems as long as you don't get it too est.  I let it dry out and it worked just as if nothing happened to it.  excellent for the money.
 Perfect for Kito diet !
 I use this to ship items on ebay. It works super well. You're able to "zero out" your bowl so that you know how much the item in the bowl weighs.
 Worked great for weighing our pinewood derby car!
 I only used it 3times and already broke
 Edit: seller quickly provided a replacement scale. Replacement seems to be working well so far, fingers crossed. Very pleased with great customer service from the seller.<br/><br/>Seemed to be a great scale, but quit working after two months now only displays unSE error. Seems to be a common problem.
 Nice small unit
 Works fine. I've had it a couple years, I think.
 This scale is handy (when it works). 1 month in and I already got error alert. I eventually just got a much better scale that costs a little more.
 only comment i want to make is that you need to pour your stuff slowly. I wish i could see at least the tenth decimal place.
 Great scale,  petite and light weight,  very accurate and easy to use
 I've had this for over a year now with a solid amount of use. Has always worked great and still is
 This scale made my measurements on point in grams and ounces! I have been able to exact recipes down to the exact point that I can no longer blame the recipe just my cooking skills.
 It's so nice and small, it fits in my kitchen drawer but very accurate and easy to use.
 Works as advertised. I love that it is super slim and easy to store.
 Works perfectly for measuring food items.  I never realized how poor I was at portioning my food until I purchased this scale.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Easy to use<br/>Looks nice<br/>Small size<br/>Accurate<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>None!
 Love this little scale.  Use it for weighing items for ultralight backpacking and also for portion sizes.  Really is a nice scale.
 Has an automatic tare, so whatever you have on the scale when you turn it on will be 0'd out. It's great!
 Seems to be of high quality.  Good price.  Easy to use.  Handsome.
 Easy to use.  Great quality product. Very nice looking on my counter. Perfect for portion controlling my meals while losing weight.
 Should be called malfunctioning kitchen scale. Came with batteries that looked like they were run over by a car. Replaced batteries with "brand new ones" and it came on with the message "lo" and immediately shut off. Awaiting resolution and may enjoy this once I get a working one!
 Easy to use
 Sleek smal,profile
 good product but a little slow to turn on
 Works wonderfully! I love that it is able to zero a plate or dish and that there are various units of measure. Its a bit smaller and lighter than I expected, though the size doesn't really affect anything as you're able to put a larger plate on top and zero it while still being accurate
 Good considering the price.  Good as a small postage or kitchen scale if you are not measuring very small increments.  I found that measuring in grams it can be off a bit.
 Great scale, with easy auto-tare.  Changes units easily and quickly.  Very compact - lightweight, but doesn't feel flimsy.
 It isn't fancy, but it functions as advertised and looks sleek.
 Very accurate compared to my old oyster from Walmart. The only issue I have is the surface area, wish it was just a bit bigger for large bowls.
 If you need to measure under 5 grams it's not that accurate.  But for ounces + it's good enough for me.  I like how slim and attractive it is sitting on my microwave.  Good affordable product.
 Just received it a few days ago.  Hardly takes up any space...easy to read...easy to use!
 This scale works exactly as stated. Bought 2 of these for the kitchen I manage and we use them multiple times a day, for extended periods of time.  Still running on the original batteries months later. Definetly worth the money.
 liked it so much i bought a second one
 Works well, but has a cheap feel to it. Pretty good for the price, though.
 Nice compact digital scale.  Excellent for Pinewood Derby Car weigh-ins.
 I must have gotten a defective one or something.
 The scale makes it easy to control my portion size. Very easy to use. Digital display is easy to read and it has a button to zero the scale so you can place a bowl on the scale and then zero it before you measure something.
 It stopped working properly after only 1 month of use. I kept getting errors and the weight would never stay still long enough to get an exact reading. I think I got a dud because the other reviews looked great.
 Super easy to use! I figured it was going to be a hassle trying to figure this out, but it couldn't have been easier. I've had it for about a month now and so far...fantastic. I like how it switches weight measurements with one button - super happy with this purchase.
 Very satisfied with size and quality. Suits my purpose perfectly.
 Works pretty well, i love it and would give it 5 stars if only it had an easily accessibly tare function
 Aesthetically pleasing, well designed, very easy to use.
 I took the scale out of the packaging and was using it in 2 minutes...no complicated set up. Very lightweight.  Attractive looking. Small easy to store.  Highly recommend!
 Good little scale.. easy to use.  5*s
 Started a new dieting plan and needed a food scale. This one exceeded my expectations. It works great, looks nice and is very thin and lightweight for travel. I like how the buttons are flat and prevents crumbs from entering...the cause of death for my first scale.
 Great scale, easy to use and really appreciate that it defaults to the previously used unit (oz, grams, etc).  Highly recommend it.
 Good product good value
 This was an excellent buy. I've only had a it a few days, but it is working well. Included batteries. Would buy again at this price. I bought this for selling some items causally on ebay.
 Very easy to use, clean, and store for postage and kitchen activities! Highly recommend!
 So easy to use and looks wonderful with my stainless steel appliances. Most importantly, it's accurate, easy to use, and sleek design.
 The scale is just great. I like the feature where it is turning off automatically so I don't have to worry about battery life.
 Nice little light scale for the kitchen.
 Nice scale. Will set to zero with your container on it, then fill with food.
 Great scale, works perfectly for meal prepping. The screen is clear and easy to see. Unfortunately, after 3 months of use, I was wiping down with a damp rag and now it will not find a true zero weight. I would purchase again.
 This is a nice little scale. I like the time out feature without shutting off.  It's a little small for my dinner plate but I make it work.
 Really love this little food scale. Extremely good quality and pretty slick design
 So far, I believe it works.  Going to get a better understanding how to measure my meal.
 Bright display, works great
 Works great for food and as a postal scale.
 does what it's supposed to do,  no complaints so far!
 Works great!
 Very easy to use.  The scale allows you to subtract the weight of your bowl etc. when weighing any product. Love it and highly recommend.
 Excellent scale.  Easy to read and easy to cycle through units.
 This scale works fine but runs out of battery insanely fast. Replacing the batteries every two months with barely even daily use? I'm disappointed. I don't know if I got a bad but now it won't even turn on after replacing the batteries.
 I like this scale the only thing is if you stop using it for a few minutes you loose your information
 It's too small. I use it to weigh food on and it's too small to sit a plate on it and read what it's saying at the same time.  The light turns off too quickly as well.
 Great scale. Lightweight, small, and does a great job
 We tried to use it but couldn't get a reading that was the same each time we weighed out something! Then we just put it up just stop using it,  Ended up buying another scale for less an it works better an is smaller in size
 Have been using this for over a year, works great for me.
 Good scale, seems to be pretty accurate and easy to use.
 mainstay scale at walmart is better then this scale. cant register until over 4 oz.
 This works well. I actually ordered it to weigh my post office packages so that I could print my postage online.  It measures accurately and consistently.
 My scale arrived this afternoon.  I weighed letters, soup cans, vegetables, etc.  Now I will be able to take a large package of meat and break it down into small 1 lb meat packages.  Easy to weigh cheeses, pasta, and other ingredients to be exact. Love it.  The size is great....
 Nice sleek and does the job! I even through my kitten on there to weigh her.
 like it alot
 great little scale
 Very easy to use and have established it to be very accurate.  Definitely recommend it.
 Very accurate scale. would RECOMEND.
 Excellent scale! Very easy to use and looks very good and sharp for the price! This is a must have scale?
 For an under $10 digital food scale you get what you paid for. Quality of the unit is an issue for me seems a bit to cheap plasticy.
 For the price of this little thing, it works great, easy to store and use. I bought it to weigh my bird and it's very accurate in the grams. Also very easy to clean!
 My boyfriend loves to cook, says this scale is great
 Smaller than I thought it would be and shuts off a little too quickly, but it works ok.
 it okay but I would buy a different model only becuase the display faces up so if you have plate on the scale it will block the display...ugh....design flaw but good scale
 Very sleek and modern and seems to weigh with high accuracy.  Also nice large letters - easy to read.
 Ideal for weight for determining  outgoing postage.
 Have had this for several months and use it for everything. No complaints of yet. Easy to use, easy to read. Easy to tare.
 Terrible! Item does not work, will not zero, will not turn off! Do not buy!
 Smaller than expected. About half the size of a ruler length ways.
 Was delivered fast!!! It works great, nicely built and does what it's supposed to do. Highly recommend this scale to anyone looking for one.
 Is a Great product. easy to use. I'm a baker and I do everything from measure ingredients for the recipes to the final product for shipping. I recommend to store the product without the batteries so that they may last longer.
 My scale came with 4 batteries. I really like the large digital numbers. I also like the lip on the scale. Very simple to use.
 Great little scale.  Takes up very little space on the counter and can be stored in a drawer when not needed.  Holds all my plates and bowls well.
 This is a good buy.  It works well for me. Compact and easy to store.  I would recommend this product.
 I've been using this scale for a few months now and I love it!  I use the scale almost every day and haven't had any problems.  Some of the reviews complain about the backlight shutting off quickly; however, if you add more of whatever you're measuring to the scale, it automatically lights back up.  For the price (really price aside), I don't think you'll find a better scale.
 Very easy to use, very little but in the same allow to weight even big size of bowls. I like the design and it is so thin that it does not take much space.
 Cheap and holding up to three meals a day use. Smooth surface and fits into a quart size ziplock to keep it clean.
 Works excellent so far.  See.s pretty accurate and precise.  I can put a large heavy bowl on it an tear it and the add a small amount of food and it seems to record it accurately.  A god sent for calorie counting.
 I have used the scale only once since receiving it to weigh fresh tomatoes for making gazpacho.  Everything was easy; directions of how to use a container to weigh contents easy to do.  I cook a lot and look forward to using it regularly.
 Great little scale, super precise.<br/>The lack of surface area can be made up by a bowl or other container with a narrow bottom.
 I wanted a kitchen scale for a while and finally purchased this scale. I am extremely pleased with it. It's very easy to use. I love the tare function which allows you to use any plate or bowl and then reset the scale to 0. It measures quickly. It also has a lit screen and it is very easy to see the measurements.
 We love the scale! We make our own TV dinners and use the scale to measure out the portions that go into the various parts of the trays. It automatically subtracts the weight of the container. Great for our needs!
 Too much plastic, and it won't zero out properly, therefore you don't get an accurate measurement.
 Smaller than I thought it would be.  Will easy to store.  Should do just what we want.  It will take the place of an old dial type scale that takes up a lot of cupboard space and is difficult to use.  Will make accounting for the bowl or whatever we put on it to hold the material being weighed "tare" easy.
 works
 Very nice scale.  Its functions as described and it is stylish looking as well....
 Works quite well so far. Much better than the old mechanical food scale I used before I got this one.
 This scale is amazing!!! I love it
 Has been a very good experience owning/using this scale. I should have replaced the clunker/clinker much sooner!
 One year later and it still hasn’t needed a battery change! Works perfectly. It is a bit small though.
 Display is a little tough to read and the measurement is a little slow to update. But it works and is slim/light, and was cheap.
 Works great so far only had a week but its seems to be a good one. And I thought the price was right
 only complaint is the screen isn't purple like pictured, and although works, can tell it's a cheap product.  Not sure how long it'll last.  Hopefully it surprises me.
 This scale won't repeat the same weight.  It doesn't work at all.  Waste of my time and money.
 I find this scale to be very accurate. I haven't has any discrepancies. I like that the display lights up so I can read it easily. It's very light and slim so it doesn't take up to much space.
 Easy to use and simple to figure out. My only complaint is that it is small so the display gets covered by my container sometimes, but that's the trade off for not having some jumbo machine that takes up my entire counter. The scale is light-weight and the backlight makes it easy to read.
 This scale is beyond expectation. I love it! Specifically my favorite feature is that I can put a small bowl on it, zero out the scale and then put fruit or something in it to get accurate weight.
 This is exactly what I was looking for. It's small enough to fit in a drawer, very easy to use and a great complement to my cooking utensils.
 I love it. Really appreciate that it does oz, grams, etc. Sometimes difficult in reading the weight if using a plate - but I invert a bowl (use it like a stand) and put plate on top. Can zero the weight out before add any other item. Very easy to clean. Small size - doesn't take up much counter space and easy to store
 Love this thing.
 Very easy to use. Well-made and at a good price. Works great. I weigh all kinds of foods: meats, veggies, cheese, etc.  The scale seems accurate and I am able to record my food intake with ease.
 Does its job correctly
 It works and it is so easy to store.
 handy, small, great for measuring baking ingredients
 Perfect little scale for my workshop and I would imagine great in the kitchen as well. Seems to match my other digital scales in terms of accuracy.
 Great and accurate little scale. Love it. Easy to clean .
 Works good and a great help with measuring for shipping and such.
 This scale is accurate and the backlight is a nice touch. Easy to use and zero out for use with dishes. Stainless steel topper is very easy to clean as well. Would recommend to others.
 Nice and small, but big enough for my weighing needs.  I like that it doesn't take up much counter space and is appealing in tis design.  Simple to use.
 Just got the scale the other day and have used it a few times. No problems so far, I use it for coffee and other foods so the 3g minimum before it registers weight is no big deal here.
 Great convenient scale to have tucked away in your kitchen. Works great, easy to use and made from decent materials! Thanks!
 Works great. We use it to weigh our foster kittens and have no complaints.
 I bought this like a year ago and still use it. Haven't had to change the batteries so that's good.
 Works great for weighing portions of food.
 it does the job but it quit small
 This scale is perfect for my kitchen needs. Doing weight watchers, this allows me to measure my portions. Doesn't take up much space, light weight.
 Works great!  Highly recommend! A++
 The briefest way to put it: it has one job and it doesn't do it very well. I use this scale to measure coffee for pour overs so each gram matters. Unfortunately, the scale reads the weight of the grounds different every time if I measure it multiple times. It's kind of frustrating to have a scale that doesn't actually read weight very well. I'll be purchasing another one.
 Great little scale.  So glad I got it.
 No complaints.  Does what it's supposed to do.
 It's only been a week since I first got it and it has already stopped working!!<br/>It just wouldn't switch on, and when it does it just shows an error !!
 Easy to use scale and easy to tier the scale with a plate or bowl. I believe 5 different measurements. easy to clean as well.
 Very stylish scale.  Seems to be accurate.  I like the fact it comes with batteries.  I do wish the display is in the front of the scale instead of top, so it isn't as easily covered by whatever you are trying to weigh.
 I love the sleek design. Very unobtrusive sitting on the kitchen counter so I don't have to drag a scale out of the pantry. I've only used it once to measure 100gm of dried mushrooms but I'll be sure to use it frequently since it is very easy to use and I have several European recipes calling for grams of ingredients.
 This compact scale does work like a mega scale.  Very easy to use and is very accurate.  Compact enough for easy storage.
 I bought this as it has more precision than other scales. We used it to weighing pinewood derby cars for cub scouts having hundredths of ouce precision was helpful in getting most weigh on the car possible.
 Bought 2 of these for our daughters for Christmas and they have told us how great it is to have a scale.  Works great with no issues...
 Good product for the price
 Small and practical, but not accurate enough.
 Love it.  Outstanding product and services.
 Cheap, reliable, compact, and sleek.  Works great.  I love it!
 Love the size.  Great for measuring cookies to achieve the same size.
 This scale works great.  It has an auto off feature that is interesting. If you move quickly enough it will turn back on and remember your tare, if not you need to reset your tare.  It's not too distracting but keeps you on your game if you're weighing several things in succession. I would recommend this scale.  It's sleek looking too and doesn't take up too much room in the kitchen.
 small, lightweight and easy to use. My favorite Scale that I have found so far.
 I received this scale after careful consideration of similar items available on Amazon. I'm very pleased with it thus far, and it has been very easy to use; right out of the box I was able to use it for exactly what I needed with minimal set up (the entireity of which included making sure the included batteries were situated correctly). I'm able to zero the scale for using a bowl or other container, and it wipes clean very easily. Great product!
 I love this scale. I want another! Light weight, compact. It doesn't make any noise, thank goodness. Easy to change units. Accurate!
 Ready to use right out of the box. Weight of item is easy to read and accurate. Small enough to  leave on the counter.
 Works great. Easy to figure out.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Etekcity-Digital-Kitchen-Scale-Multifunction-Food-Scale-11-lb-5-kg-Silver-Stainless-Steel-Batteries-Included/dp/B0113UZJE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale Multifunction Food Scale, 11 lb 5 kg, Silver, Stainless Steel (Batteries Included)</a>
 Sleek and easy to use. Other food scales I've tried always lagged when I pressed the button and it wouldn't tear right away. This product responds quickly and I've have no problems with it. Great product!
 It came with batteries!! The only reason I gave this scale 4 stars is because there are a few bubbles on the finish. It almost looks as though there is plastic over the stainless, but there isn't. But I'm not going to stress over it. Anyway, it's a sleek looking scale and works very well.
 It works.  I wanted a scale but was not sure how often I would use it so I opted for this item.  It was a good price and fair quaily.  That turns out was a good decision because I really do not use it all that often.
 Bought this for measuring baking ingredients after realizing how much easier it would make my life. Only used it one so far but it does what it should and looks great on my counter.
 Easy to use. But not tested in the dishwasher.
 At the deal price there was no comparison to this handy little scale. I use it to weigh gun powder to paint in my shop.
 Love this scale! Looks very nice in our kitchen and works great for measuring our food and helps us be more accurate on how many calories we intake each day.
 A great little unit.
 I use this every single say to meassure portion control. Easy to use with a small footprint for easy storage.
 love it just wish it did more than just 11lbs.
 The best little kitchen scale ever it help me weight everything I need and I love how you can change the settings
 This scale looked used out of the box. The buttons barely worked, and then a day later the scale wouldn't turn on. Just go with something else.
 I liked the compactness of the scale mostly. That made it very easy to store. It also seems to be fairly sturdy so far. I've dropped it at least five times and it is still kickin' like Kung Pao chicken.<br/>🌽
 Solid scale for general kitchen purposes.  I use it primarily to make coffee with a Chemex (weighing out ground<br/>coffee and water).  It is very easy to use and clean, and has a very clean design.  Definitely happy with my<br/>purchase; I don't think there is a better scale offered on Amazon at this price point!
 Good scale
 Being able to weigh out portions for the week is a great plus to trying to control weight and this product let's me do that effortlessly. Can put bowl on and sweet weight to zero to weigh out portions with ease and no clean up between food
 What a great little scale. It takes up NO ROOM and comes on immediately. It also provides a Tare weight. I use mine mostly to weigh dog food.
 It's perfect. Easy to use and even came batteries. It perfectly meets my needs!
 This scale is so light weight and accurate it doesn’t take much space great product
 It's been a great purchase. Very durable and accurate
 Works as represented. Easy to clean
 NEVER WORKED DONT BUY, UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY
 Works completely as intended. Great little scale.
 very thin, good scale.
 Mesasuring in grams allows to eat anything just in the portions allowable for ones body weight.  I am using this along with an online app. helping me with my macros
 I wasn't expecting a lot for the price, but this little scale is perfect. Well made, easy to use. No more guessing how many ounces are in a cup of flour.
 I love this little scale.  I use it daily as I weigh out all my food.  It does everything I want it to do plus it has a nice look to it.
 Works well and the sale price was right.
 At first I really liked this digital kitchen scale. Now having it for about 7 months it quit working correctly. First I thought that it needed new batteries and changed them and still would not work right. Gave up and bought another kitchen scale at a local store.
 I'm so disappointed in this scale. I've had it less than a year and it's already stopped working. I changed the batteries to no avail. I see others have had their scales up and die on them. I should have noted those reviews.
 I love this. It works great! I like the fact that you can put a plate on it and reset it to 0 so you don't have to put food directly on it. (Which you can if you want to. It wipes right off)
 Thanks to this digital kitchen scale, I have lost 5 pounds already! I love measuring my food with this scale. My only constructive feedback for the manufacturing company would be to move the zero button closer to the front; if you have a big container on the scale it is hard to press the button.
 Failed after 14 months.
 Nice quality for the price.
 much less thick than my old scam and more modern looking while having a better resolution for about the same price
 I am a colorist and from time to time my formulations require a very small amount of something. It does not register very small amounts.
 Easy to operate. Works great
 It works, for smaller measurements it's not as useful though.
 Awesome tool for the price. Gets the job done great! Super light and easy to store.
 I love it!! Is very light, easy to clean is perfect for me!!
 Works great and is small.
 great price works great too
 Super small and efficient. Does the basics
 great value
 It works great and its nice and small so I can store it anywhere. Love it!
 I read that people didn't like how fast the backlight turned off but I haven't had that issue at all. Mine stays lit for approx 22 secs but even after it turns off it still keeps your weight displayed (just harder to see). So if you need to add a little more product to your total amount go right ahead and boom, the backlight turns right back on. This scale is legit.
 Have not had long but with free extended warranty I’m confident this scale will continue to be exactly what I was looking for.  Light weight and sleek design but is delivering a spot on weight which is what I really care about.
 Works just as advertised. Can’t ask for more than that.
 My other scale wore out after many, many years.  This is a very similar item that works the same way and very easy to clean.
 I'm sure this is a good product, however I haven't had the chance to use it yet<br/>.
 Very accurate scale. this aided in my diet because I can weight my food and more accurately calculate my calories intake.
 slim &amp; light weight.  Works as it should
 Fairly accurate +/- 1 gram. Must be used on flat level surface, scale uses feet to measure weight. Works and looks as described by the package.
 It gives different lectures for the same quantity of food and the variation is really large like 38 g. first time, then 94 g. the second time. Awful!
 Nice little scale for the money.
 Perfect for kitchen, and solid .
 Very useful and very bright. Cant wait to use it
 Power/stare button stop function properly. Not even used that often
 Scale works great, the screen is easy to read. For the price this is the best food scale I've owned..I've been through 3 other scales before this one. Perfect for my needs to track macronutrients.
 Exactly what I ordered... works perfectly... great price... and fast shipping
 great kitchen scale. It weighs metric, and us in g/kg and oz/lbs it is accurate and easy to use. if you want to put a container on it  to keep it clean just press the on/off button to reset the weight to 0 with it on so you can know exactly how much you are using.
 a little tricky to figure out but works great!
 excellent product and delivery time.  thanks.
 Works great but is a little touchy amd sometimes you can't get the number you want. The words on the buttons rub off quickly. Works for someone who doesn't need it to be exact.
 Doesn't get any easier!  Pull the tape on the back to activate the battery and you are good to go.  Looks nice, works great, and fits nicely into a kitchen drawer.  Great product; great price.
 If you’re wondering, no this can’t read stuff under 4 grams
 This good-looking, compact, metal top scale is the best I've seen.<br/>The price is excellent and it works exactly as advertised.<br/>With a max. weight of 5 Kg you will find it very useful for a large range of applications.<br/>Would recommend this to anyone looking for a kitchen scale.
 It's tough standing on this cuz I have big feet.  But it's a nice scale.
 Screen should be at a 45 degree angle, cant measure anything wider than the surface or screen is unreadable.  Cheap scale.
 I know that this scale could be exactly what I needed if it decided to work properly. Doesn't register any weight except zero. Here's a photo with a champagne mango on the scale - coming up zero grams. Kind of frustrating! Sending it back. Including batteries was a nice touch though.
 Simple to use, easy to store, and easy to keep clean. Had for two years now and haven't had to replace the batteries yet
 Small, sleak and effective.<br/><br/>I don't have alot of counter space so this was the perfect modern looking kitchen scale
 Easy to work perfect measuring
 Works as stated. Couldn't get the warranty situated because I didn't get a receipt with my order...
 Great looking, functions as described, great price!
 Easy to use, clear numbers and like that you can put whatever container on it to measure by using the tare feature. Overall great product.
 Works great thru both functions. Stainless is attractive, easy to clean. Small size makes it easy to keep at hand without a lot of clutter
 Great little scale.  Love it!!!  Already recommended it to others.
 Great addition to my kitchen. Works well.
 Love it.  Wonder why I didn't get it before instead of guessing.  It's good looking as well as very useful.
 This lovely and stylish product was more then I could have asked for - it works beautifully and looks stunning in my counter! I don't even put it away!
 ok
 This kitchen scale is a good size and will serve the purpose I bought it for.
 Simple to use.... love it
 very accurate
 Was a gift for my grandson. He said he liked it. Did what it was supposed to do.
 Opened the package yesterday.  Used the scale once and today when I turn it on there is a black screen - no numbers.  I changed batteries and still a blaCk screen.
 This did not have any clear instructions with it.  Not at all happy with this product
 I love this scale and I use it everyday. Smooth surface makes it easy to clean. Comes with batteries. No complaints.
 Just what I wanted. Easy to read. Easy to use. Nice to look at.
 I really like the design and look of this scale. However, it did not work!! It was stuck on grams, I followed the instructions on how to move to ounches. I returned this the same day it came.
 I love this scale. It is small and sleek and doesn't take up too much space on my kitchen counter. It is easy enough to use.
 This unit is put to work on a regular basis. Sleek, good looking, a proud addition to my kitchen tools.
 Really nice look to this one.  It's thin and the metal has a brushed look.  I use it a lot and it works well.
 OK
 Good product! Good price!
 nice scale but the one i received has an lcd problem
 I've been struggling to lose weight.  My trainer suggested to buy a scale to weigh out my foods.  This has worked great for this purpose.  Very accurate and easy to use.
 Perfect size to keep in the kitchen. Works great
 Great all purpose scale for weighing up to 11 lbs. If you need to weigh small 3-5g portions you need a different scale but that scale will not be able to weigh a portion much over a pound or two. So this scale has the perfect kitchen range capacity.
 Excellent product. Works as it should
 Very accurate, quiet, light, and compact.
 Works great. Price is right.
 Look out pinewood derby!
 Exactly as expected.<br/>A little small but easily overcome by a narrow bottom bowl.<br/>Would buy again if i needed to.
 These are really nice. Me and both of my roommates have one. They are great for hobby stuff and cooking.
 Works well for baking ingredients.  Flour is hard to measure with volumetric method.
 Gets the job done. Love the multi-function feature as well
 The scale has been perfect for our food weighing needs, works great.
 I love the size and it's easy to use.  I use a small clear glass pyrex bowl I have on it to weigh my foods and if you just turn it off after use, you shouldn't have an issue with the batteries dying fast.  I have been using it without an issue with the batteries so far.
 Perfect little scale. I wanted it just to weight my foods so I could track what I'm eating. This switches from grams to ounces easily. It's small enough to be tucked away when not in use.
 Very easy to use and clean.
 While I can validate how accurate the scale is, it is very repeatable which gives me confidence. It is very easy to use, is nice and compact for storage and transport and is very sleek looking. I would have expected to pay at least triple for a scale of this quality. Highly recommend!
 This scale does exactly what I needed it to! I bought it because it was a low price with good reviews!<br/><br/>I use it to measure my food and determine portion sizes.<br/><br/>I would recommend it to anyone who needs a basic scale in the kitchen to measure portions.
 Using this scale for my meal preps. Working great and it's very accurate. Makes portioning my meals a breeze.
 It's very accurate for weighing small items
 So much nicer than the scale I had previously.  It's slim-line keeps my counter from looking clutter-free.  Easy to read electronic read-out.
 Just what I was looking for.
 This was too small for me and what I need, and it was a little quirky. I did end up returning it.
 I bought this to help with tracking my macros, works great!
 So far its working great!
 when living in a Gym Culture lifestyle, this is a must have !
 There are three scales, I am reviewing the EK4352H, which I really wanted to like.<br/>There are many flaws with this scale. Just when you think you think a feature is great, you discover the many flaws that overwhelm the positives.<br/>Examples:<br/>- Stainless steel is great and easy to clean: but the the edge where the stainless ends and plastic begins is an open seam, which is impossible to clean and will harbor nasties.<br/>- Unit conversion is great: but the switch is underneath, so impossible to use.<br/>- Solid, liquid, milk modes sound great: but why would an ounce of nuts, water, or milk be different? (should have put the mode button underneath and conversion button on top??<br/>- Bright and large display is awesome: but the viewing angle is so extreme you need to bob and weave just to read it.<br/>- Sleek stainless steel platform: but the body seems overly wide
 It's easy to use. Nice, clean, and simple design. It's thin, so after use I tucked it my miscellaneous basket and in a drawer.
 It was inaccurate and didn't hold up.  Crapped out in six months.  3 or 4 uses. Will never buy this brand again!
 It does exactly what you'd expect it to do. The LCD display is very clear and easy to read, switching units is as simple as a button press, and it zero's/tares very easily. I've used it for a few days and have no issues with the quality or ease of use of this scale.
 This scale works wonderfully. I love that the display lights up too!
 Very nice little scale, lightweight, doesn't use too much counter space, seems accurate to me right out of the box. Great price, batteries included. Happy customer :-)
 Love this scale and stylish
 Super perfect tool for small and a bit larger weights. Light weight. Rsy to use.
 Love the feature that lets you subtract the plate or bowl you use to put your food in. Perfect scale!
 I really like this scale. I love that it’s compact because it’s easy to store away. It’s also very accurate. For the price of this scale, you can’t go wrong getting it.
 I love it. It's small, the display is bright, the taring works well and there are plenty of units to chose. Design is nice, manufacturing solid.
 Small and convenient.
 Works as advertised.
 I really loved this scale. Idk why there is so many negative reviews on it. From the moment I turned it on, it was easy to use. I didn’t even need to read the instructions to know how to use it.
 this is great for weighing my small packages. very accurate! ill eventually need a bigger scale but for now this works :)
 This scale is awesome, takes up barely any room on my counter and is easy to use. It has allowed me to be 100% strict with my dieting. Highly recommend especially at the price.
 Works good no complaints and looks really nice  (only goes as low as 1 gram)
 sleek design and works great
 Lots of features. The best is setting it with a 0 setting with a plate so you don't have to lay raw or cooked products directly on the unit. Great for tracking food intake.
 Light but good quality. Loved it.
 works well for food and mail
 Purchased this scale a 18mo ago - works great, sleek and modern design. Use it daily to measure out ingredients and portions. Great product for a good price
 I use this thing a lot.  Most of my recipes for deer processing are in grams.  This thing works awesome..
 Excellent product and customer service.
 Scale seems to work great!  Small so it doesn't take up much space.  Would recommend.
 Easy to use and works great!
 Very easy to use/ toggle between different measurements. Light-weight, easy to store! A must if you're dieting!
 Love the scale. We use it almost every other day. Easy to use ad easy to clean. Easy to store away.
 Takes up only a small space on the counter and very easy to use. I really like the clean lines of this style.
 Great price and does the job.  It is super small, so you can tuck it away easily.
 I use this for measuring our curing salts for jerky.  It's worked well so far and is within a few grams of exact weights.
 Works perfectly. The design looks great. I use for Soapmaking and it's perfect. Very accurate!
 I bought this and it came in a box. I had fun opening the box because it is like opening presents.<br/>It looks just like the picture.
 I have only used it a few times, but it is easy to use and read.  Definitely enjoying it.  I am not so fond of the "lbs.+oz." display option.  I wish is was just "lbs."
 This is a really nice kitchen tool!  I am so pleased with my $13 purchase.  This scale is lightweight, compact and accurate.  It was exactly what I was looking for!
 I bought this 6 weeks ago. It’s already broken, the rightmost number display doesn’t work anymore.
 So nice and compact
 Great for portioning out food.<br/>Have been using almost everyday for past couple months and so far no issues.<br/>Would recommend purchasing!
 we had a cheaper scale that wasn't very accurate and only worked part fo the time. This has a very easy to read screen and is fairly accurate it feels nice and durable. I have been pleasantly surprised so far
 Nice and accurate scale. Easy to operate and convert to various units.
 Shipped as promised. Works great!
 I love this scale! Its small enough for me to put away without it being an eyesore, and helps me accurately measure my food.
 Works well.
 Worked immediately out of the bag but 2 hours later, the screen is blacked out and will not show any of the numbers. Have tried removing and replacing batteries, turning on/off but nothing. Returning this product immediately for a full refund.
 Works well, gives accurate readings
 Great price
 Not accurate at all. Not even the slightest closeness of being accurate. This has potential to cause someone serious harm. I returned mine. Terrible product
 Auto off feature is a must have for me.  It is easy to use and accurate.  It has a nice size and weight to it.
 Its a great scale
 Bought this for an ice cream/burger stand.  Working very well, bought a second one.
 Fantastic! I use it daily for portion control. I am fully satisfied with this product.
 Lovely little scale and seems to give pretty consistent and reliable readings.
 Exactly as described. A friend told me about this and I'm so happy I ordered it, instead of spending $50 on one. Works great. Sleek and beautiful.
 Works great. Very repeatable and seems to be accurate also.
 Scale overall works good. But it is really hard to read the numbers. Colors are too light and it's hard to weigh stuff on it unless you weigh in a smaller container, because you can't see the numbers.
 Lightweight, easy to store, and so simple to use. I love the multiple unit options as I use the scale for meal prep. Great way to track macros and make sure that I am following my daily goals.
 It does not work.  It drains battery and so every time it is used the battery has to be removed otherwise you have to replace the battery.<br/>Follow up on former reveiw - Customer Service is very impressive!  They are replacing the item to assure I am happy.  I look forward to trying it out again.
 Use it everyday, works really good for measuring anything out
 Does just what I want at a good price.<br/>Has choice of units (g vs oz) as well as tare; I use both features.<br/>Small &amp; convenient to store.
 great
 So far been a good little scale.
 Very small area, not usable with larger items (paper plates, etc)
 This scale works great. I use it for my buainess. While making soaps and bath products the exact measurement is very important. This scale.never let's me down.
 Loving my new scale,it's can be easily stored under or on top of counter,I'm able to easily adjust it to whatever measurement is needed
 Good scale for the price.
 Great scales. Easy to use. If you're looking for nice looking scales then go for it.
 I just recently started counting macros and this scale is coming in really handy. It is very accurate and easy to use.
 Works good so far.
 Exactly what I was looking for. Appreciated the FAQ email I received from the seller, too.
 It’s a good enough product but not exactly a 5 star one. More importantly, it does the job so far.
 I’m not a fan of measuring food and I’ve never owned a kitchen scale before, but this cute, small scale is just awesome - makes measuring fun.
 Slim design and versatile
 Works just fine, as promised.
 This is not the highest quality scale, However, for the price it is awesome!  Fits nicely in the drawer and quick and easy to use.  It came with scratches on the top, but this doesn't effect the usability of the scale.
 Excellent tool
 Light and stylish scale, very easy to use and highly recommended, not for portable use, it's a finger print magnet. I'd buy it again.
 Just ok.
 Very happy with purchase
 Small and accurate
 It doesnt measure individual grams, it skips two when i try to measure anything less than 10 grams. If youre looking for something more precise, invest elsewhere.
 Lightweight, easy to use, perfect for my purposes of weighing yarn. I had some difficulty with shipping, due to USPS, and I got excellent customer support form the company, even though it was out of their control, and package arrived swiftly anyways. Love that batteries are included in package.
 It's nice and sleek, and not too big, Easy enough to use, and does not leave finger prints as stated.
 Really nice food scale. Easy to use &amp; keep clean. LOVE that it has an OFF button! My previous scales had no off button and burned through batteries like crazy.
 Just used this for the first time to make bread.  Easy, accurate,  the best scale I have ever used!!!1
 Return Ed ...not what I was looking for...star rating is not applicable
 Excellent
 Does the job- I only wish the display would stay visible for longer. If there is something on the scale for a little bit, it will turn off and then the weight will read as 0 when it is turned back on
 This works very well.
 Love this product. Easy to use and read even with a large bowl on it.
 The scale is often inaccurate. I have to constantly turn it on and off to get an accurate read.
 super clean, flat look. very responsive to touch, LOVE that I can switch between different measurements and the one-touch tare is great.
 I like this item quite a bit... it functions well with ease and meets my needs
 Great buy! Exceptional value. Tiny but mighty: unit conversion, accurate readings, small enough to fit even small counters. They also offer extended warranty through a couple of simple steps. I'm very satisfied with my purchase (in fact, it was a recommendation from my nutritionist to make meal prepping easy).
 Has worked great for me for all of by baking needs. Small enough that I can leave it out on the counter and have it available when needed.
 Works great and easy to use
 works great
 Simple, lightweight and perfect to use for any meal measuring, definitely a must have!
 Easy to use and works as it should
 This one is great, small and sleek also easy to clean. It stays on a perfect amount of time if you are adding weight to it slowly. The customer service for this company is amazing btw. So I’d highly recommend
 I purchased this based on previous customer reviews and am not disappointed.  The scale is very accurate and the tare weight feature was important to me.  The top is small (I wanted a small scale), but you can put a large item on it and still get an accurate reading. The follow up with the company is impressive.  I would definitely purchased again from Etekcity.
 Great for my kitchen. My cat wieghs 8 lbs, 7.46 ozs. We get real weight for fitness data. How did I live without it? Igot and returned 2 before this one.
 This little scale is exactly what I was looking for.  It weighs oz's, lbs and grams.  It has a small footprint for my tiny kitchen  is accurate and easy to use.
 Small scale just what I was looking for.  Easy to store between use.
 This scale has been great. Its very easy to use and has a clear display. It’s very important to use on a flat surface so the scale can calibrate to get a proper reading. I purchased one as a gift a few months after owning mine.
 Really useful when I’m baking
 yes
 So far, so good. Easy to use. Great deal.
 The scale is sleek and compact. Checked the accuracy of the instrument and it was good. The price was surprisingly low for such a well built product.<br/><br/>P.S.: Just got the product today only and this is a first cut feedback.
 Very useful
 Slow to react, and buttons are very flimsy, it takes a lot pressure to push down. Round up to the nearest gram. Not great for measuring espressos.
 I loved the scale until it stopped working altogether today. After a few weeks of using it, the display wasn't functioning but I loved it because I was able to still weigh my food. Today, the display has some sort of error message and isn't working. I'll try to contact CS for some help. Great scale though.
 Exactly as described and easy to use!
 It's a pretty good one just was not sure on the increments but definitely worth your dollar
 Works beautifully. Easy to clean.  It zeros out easily to add to a plate to weigh. A godsend for the weight watchers plan. Also comes with batteries, and it uses AAA kind, not those expensive flat batteries.
 great little scale. easy to clean.
 My scae functioned perfectly for about 2 months and then mysteriously broke. Based on other reviews, this seems like a pretty rare occurrence. I emailed Etekcity and they got back to me within an hour or so and put a replacement in the mail right away, completely free. I'm really impressed with their customer service!
 Great little scale
 DO NOT waste your money. The only good thing about this is how light and clean it looks. It does not show the weight correctly, half the time it doesn’t even register there’s an item. Tried way to many times to make it work, not even worth the bother. Major skip!!
 Works as intended.  Wish it was a little bigger.
 Nice product.
 For this price, this works excellently. Very lightweight and stores easily in drawer.
 Really great scale for what I'm using it for! I make homemade soaps and to get the right weights for the recipes is extremely important and this scale is absolutely perfect.  It works great, it looks nice, I would recommend it to anyone!
 The scale has very accurately reading, it read .01oz and perfect for kitchen usage. And price is fair enough.
 I love this little scale. I have used it  for everything from weighing cookie dough to postage to salt for making sauerkraut. An all around handy scale.
 Not so good, it does not work too well. Sometimes it weights right and sometimes it doesn't.
 This is the perfect size, easy to use and as far as I can tell it is accurate.
 Love my scale! Works great, and has a higher max weight than my old scale.
 Works like a charm.
 Scale works perfectly, simple to operate, perfect size. We are quite pleased!
 At first I loved the size of the product. It was big enough to measure what I needed, but small enough to find space in my cabinets for. But in under a month and very minimal use, it already broke. I'm very disappointed in the overall quality and will be looking for a different scale.
 I love this scale it works well is very easy to use and looks nice on my kitchen counter.
 Lots of different units :D
 This is a great scale for weighing meat and veggies!
 Works great, very stylish and low profile. Accurate as well. I tested this to another scale I have, and they almost always way the exact same amount!
 Seems great so far. The price was right and I have tested it on grams to lbs and so far everything weighs as it should. Looks and works great
 Have had this for almost a year and I love it.  Works well and seems to be accurate for both large and small items.  Would recommend.
 Excited to use this! Did a few test runs and it functions well! Has all the units I need.<br/><br/>It lost a star because the writing on the on/off button was half rubbed off already when I received it. Thankfully there are only two buttons so it's not a big deal, but if I were giving this as a gift I would hate to have some of the words already completely gone.
 Easy to use and small enough to store in the kitchen.  Has a nice flat surface that's easy to clean.
 Nice little scale.  Seems really accurate.  Easy to use.  I would definitely buy again!
 Small and easy to store. Does what it says it will do.
 The scale is accurate, easy to use and you have the option to measure in several units.
 Excellent scale ! Buy it well worth it. I use it daily now for about a year or so.
 Works great. Only issue is that when I push the tare button it adds weight to the scale. I don't think this ends up being an issue (due to delay), but I would prefer the tare button to not impact scale.
 Elegant design, easy use. Seems accurate.
 awson to use！easy to store since it is light and small enough to put in the kitchen drawer。nice design and easy to wipe off dirt。
 Got the scale and was going to use for coffee but when I zeroed it out the weight display showed that it was going backwards in negative numbers. Cheap Chinese brand. Do not waste your money on this.
 tiny fits in my kitchen that is strapped for counter space. It is a godsend and a lot of bang for the buck. The two button simplicity is genius
 Its exactly what a kitchen scale should be, pretty simple, but its also the smallest I've found. Perfect for a small kitchen.
 This scale worked pretty well...for 3 months. Today I was making bread which I have made many times before so I'm familiar with how the weighed ingredients should look and the scale was totally inaccurate. It seemed to be rezeroing randomly, for instance I put a 150 gram container and it had somehow rezeroed to -300 grams. Also it seems inaccurate, it isn't accurate within 3-4 grams, which is a lot when you're baking. It won't weigh under 3 grams either, which I initially thought wouldn't be a problem but it's a huge problem. Very disappointed.
 Do NOT purchase this scale. I received this scale on 8-8-17. It failed (keeps flashing 1000g) on 9-15-17.  Go figure - right outside the 30 day window.
 Thin, sleek, and accurate. This little scale is perfect for weighing food to help with proper portions! So often what we think is "the right amount" is far too much! The scale is small and modern looking so it even looks nice on the counter.
 Very easy to manage.
 Perfect for backpacking ounce counters!
 I could do without it. low cost, on time delivery, good selection at the website, very convenient, low profile, ounce, pound and gram scales. I use it every meal
 I purchased this scale after reading a lot of reviews and thinking I was making the right choice.  I was wrong.<br/><br/>I am a new soapmaker and I purchased this scale to use in measuring ingredients for soapmaking.  It's kind of important when you're working with caustic substances (lye) and expensive oils that they are measured correctly.  This scale DOES NOT MEASURE CORRECTLY.<br/><br/>It randomly adds or subtracts ounces while you're standing there staring at it and not even breathing.  I can place a measuring cup on the scale, wait, write down the weight, press "TARE", wait, then remove the measuring cup to see what the negative weight is (it should be the exact amount of the measuring cup) and IT IS NEVER THE SAME.  I can replace the measuring cup on the scale and it will weigh in at a negative number still, as if it erroneously added weight.  Which most likely it did, as in pressing any button at all on the scale will cause the scale to register extra weight!!  However, it is never the same, and sometimes it subtracts, not adds, which makes no sense at all.<br/><br/>I can repeat this process over, and over, and over.  The added or subtracted weight is never, ever the same.  It is completely random.  I don't even have to "tare" the scale, all I have to do is place something on it, remove, repeat, and the weight changes.<br/><br/>This is by far the worst product I've ever ordered off Amazon and it was VERY frustrating as a brand new soapmaker to attempt to use this item and worry about the amount of lye I was putting into my soap and hoping for the best since I couldn't get an accurate reading, much less a consistent one.<br/><br/>My advice, look somewhere else.<br/><br/>EDIT: I received an email almost a year ago from the manufacturer promising to replace my faulty scale, I have never heard from them again.  I ran out of soap and finally had to make more and was forced to buy another scale, thankfully my new scale is reliable.
 Great scale for the price. It's very small, and looks nice enough to leave out on my counter.
 Works very well that I bought one for my mom!
 Great scale. Last scale wasn't as accurate. This scale is easy to change between fl. oz and lb oz.
 Can't ask for more at such a low price. Accurate, easy to use, and keeps a low profile in my pantry.
 Works great. Arrived fast.
 We liked this scale in the beginning but the battery drains so quickly and the buttons have just stopped working. We have to press the on/tare button a dozen times to get it to work, Shopping for a new scale.
 I love to cook and this scale is so useful for measuring small amounts of incredients.<br/>It is small and fits in my kitchen draw, I love it.
 Just used this scale for the first time and I am sad to say it is the biggest waste of money ever. This scale is not accurate at all. Every time i take something off and back on there is a different weight. If you are using this scale for cooking I would look somewhere else.
 I did not think I would love this product as I have - this scale is GREAT on getting my meals prepared. love it !
 Love this scale, It is small so it is easily stored in the kitchen. It is helpful to have a clear glass bowl is you want to see the weight of what you are measuring.
 I only wish I would have purchased this sooner! It is thin, sleek, stylish, and very easy to use. You can place your bowl or container on the scale, then zero the scale and add your food to weigh it. This is very convenient! Love, love, love this scale!
 excellent scale, small and portable if need be
 Small and light. Easy to use.
 Nice scale, accurate, has various units. Went with the reviews.. 1500 people can't be wrong
 Simple and easy to use. Nice quality, and highly accurate. Very much worth the money.
 The scale looks good, sleek with a matte stainless finish.  To really test the scale, I used a set of calibrated weights from Rice Lake Weighing Systems to check the scales accuracy.  Measurements were taken in grams starting at 3g and increasing to 3500g.  Ratios are given as (Test Weight)/(Scale Weight).  Overall, the scale is pretty good.  The accuracy slips 0.4%-2.0% between the 50-500g.  The remaining values are spot on.  For product over 1LB, this is very good. Remember that if you use the tare function with a heavy bowl or container, you could easily go over 1LB.  Test values are below (Test Weight)/(Scale Weight).<br/>3/3<br/>5/5<br/>10/10<br/>20/20<br/>30/30<br/>50/49<br/>100/99<br/>500/498<br/>1000/1000<br/>2000/2000<br/>3000/3000<br/>3500/3500<br/><br/>***Some caveats on the above readings.  This was an informal test of one unit.  Your unit may be more or less accurate than reported in these results.***
 I use it daily to measure meat, vegetables and fruit for me portions. Easy to use and clean!
 Great little scale works awesome for the little stuff I had to weigh in the kitchen for my diet plan! Love that it’s lightweight and love the price.
 Worked well
 Works fine so far!
 I really liked this scale at first, howevert after a couple months it will only weigh grams and not switch to other measures.  Nice design, easy to clean but it does go off rather quickly as well which results in having to re-measure again.
 now i can weigh eerything
 Grams do not have a decimal point.  So up to 1 gram and from 1 to 2 gram, etc. is a guess
 Very easy to use scale. Has option to change the unit of measurement from ounces to grams to milliliters. Has a weight limit of 5000 grams but I don't think that will be a problem for me as I plan to use it for baking. The stainless steel finish and light up display look very nice.
 Perfect for what I need it for.
 You get what you pay for. Half of the time this scale doesn't read weight properly. I would not purchase again.
 Very useful and compact.
 I like this little scales! Very fast, handy and accurate. It’s my first kitchen scales and I have it over a year now - works perfectly fine.
 Compact which is perfect for someone who doesn't have a lot of room. It is accurate and I really like that it's metal and not plastic. It is not expensive but it doesn't look cheap. Happy I purchased it
 Handy little scale to have in the kitchen, very easy to use and looks great.
 Nice scale! It's low-profile, light weight and accurate. The feature to zero out the scale to factor in for containers and such is helpful.
 Love it!!  Perfect size for me...
 Maybe a teeny bit off. Not good for measuring really tiny things (I tried to weigh medicine for my dogs, and even 10 pills didn’t trigger the scale). But perfect for weighing food and such!
 Very good packaging, very good product. The price is strangely very low for such a good product. What I find great is that I can follow American recepies in pounds and recepies from home in grams. The tare function is also very used. Easy to use. In also nutchell: perfect for a nice versatile kitchen scale
 Nice product and beautiful design.<br/>It looks big in image but really tiny product !!
 Works well!
 This product worked wonderfully for ~3 months before unexpectedly failing to turn on. Fortunately for me, Etekcity customer support was very responsive and reminded me of the 1-year warranty. I had a new scale within a few days. Based on the other reviews, I expect my experience with it failing was a fluke.
 Not accurate!
 I love this scale. It’s intuitive, I didn’t have to read anything. It works like every other scale I’ve used. It’s sleek and easy to tuck away
 The scale is nice and does do what it says, but the only issue I have its too small.  I like to put a plate on it to measure my stuff so I don't  have to dirty other dishes in order to put on my dinner plate.
 After 2 years I still use this scale at least once a week and it's holding up beautifully.
 Great value for the price!
 Good scale, but is not very accurate to items of little weight, under 1 oz. Heavier items read great.
 Works well
 Works like a charm, love it
 nice, works well,
 Awesome!  Great little scale.
 I used this product one time and the very next day it stoped working ...had to return it ...it may possibly be water got in the scale after i rinsed it so whoever buy this make sure not to wet it ...wipe down only i guess
 Counting ounces is helping weight management and over eating.
 So far so good
 I love this!  First kitchen scale and I am really enjoying it.  Easy to use and works well.
 Loving this scale - best one I've ever had. Helping me lose weight!
 I bought this product a month ago and have been using it daily. I did not expect it would stop working properly after such a short period of time. When I weight foods whose weight I know (because it is written on the packaging label) it shows me a completely different weight.
 It doesn’t weigh items less than half ounce. I guess it is for making big meals.
 For the price seems to work great!
 This scale is so easy to use and works perfectly every time! I’ve had it over a year and still loving it!
 Easy to use, small size makes it convenient.
 Excellent!!
 Does not work for light weight items....I think mine may be defective... I use it for weighing out meats, fruits etc therefore it's not a big deal for me to return it but I can imagine for others it could be a deal breaker....For some reason it will not calculate anything under 10G.... I also thought it would be a little more durable but given the price, what can you really expect for $13?
 Purchased 2 units based on reviews. Both units I received did not perform as advertised.<br/>Unit measurements did not convert properly..Oz. to lbs. or grams were way off. Returned both..
 I really enjoy using this scale. The buttons on the scale function well, and it turns on/off and flips between units quickly and easily.<br/><br/>I took off a star because of the size of the scale. It is pretty small, and my plates/bowls sometimes hide the screen when I'm using it. But other than that, this is a great product. Highly recommend.
 This is a very nice, reasonably priced item, that is extremely easy to use.
 I use this to follow the recipe closely.
 Compact and easy to use. Has a tare button, easy to read, easy to store.
 Excellent buy.  It is thin.  It is reliable.  Very pleased with the purchase.
 Works as it should
 Not as accurate as expected. Different measurement every time. But not bad for the price. Lightweight and easy to store.
 Useful, even I can put something on top and reset to 0 for additional ingridient.
 Easy to use, light weight, easy storage, sleek look. Very pleased with my purchase
 I really like this product. It tells exact weight of the items.
 Good price, good scale.  Lightweight.  Accurate.
 Good simple scale for the kitchen and postage.  Wish that it had a bit more capacity for larger items.  Should have paid more attention to the dimensions
 Works great for cooking and blending food to make sure the portions are correct and equal. This gets used almost every time I am cooking or blending food in my Ninja.
 Great and very informative scale.  Price is quite attractive too.  Trouble free for months.
 Just what was needed for small shipments
 I really love this scale.  It relieves all of the guess work.  I can weigh ounces, grams and pounds.  This scale will also eliminate the weight of the container holding the weighed food,  I highly recommend it.
 I've used this for a week. Trying to learn the food prep. This has been a good product so far. Simple and easy to use.
 Use for weighing foods for a diabetic.
 This little scale is amazing and great I love using it it  automatically  deducts the cup or what ever is holding the stuff which I think is neat the design is sleek and very modern feeling A+++
 It works as intended. Depending on how large your plate or container is, it might be difficult to see the display on the scale.
 Works great
 It is user friendly and the price is very good , the reason I give 4 star  is the surface is little smaller than what I expected
 easy to use and easy to clean! it is a great helper for our diet.
 I haven't had a chance to use it much but seem to have a problem getting a weight after I take it to zero.  would like the weight in oz instead of grams.  Not sure how to do that.
 This is a great little scale.  I have recently started a weight loss journey and will be using this to help with portion control.  The display is easy to read and the scale is sensitive and the tests I've performed on it have been accurate.
 Bought as a gift for Christmas,arrived on time and got an excellent deal for the Lightning price.
 Strongly recommend.
 Works fine and it looks nice!
 Works great, easy to wipe clean. Stows away well.  May be a little bit small, but good for my needs,
 Amazing. Easy to clean and small enough to not bother while you cook.
 I bought this for my wife and she loves it! It looks really nice, very easy to use, compact for storage!
 I am well pleased with this product.
 Best kitchen scale i have ever owned for the money
 great little scale works awesome I like it
 only used it twice and worked perfectly
 It works as you expect, the buttons are not difficult to press, my only complain is that it arrive without one of the four pads that go in the legs.
 Don't buy this scale of you're interested in any kind of accuracy. Watch the customer review video with the two batteries to see what I mean. The weight measurement jumps all over the place and is very inconsistent. When you need a scale, you are looking for precision, not guesswork. Waste of money!
 Love how the scale looks. It is simple and compact and super easy to use.
 Good
 as advertised
 I've used this scale multiple times daily for nearly 8 months and still haven't had to change the batteries.
 Good product
 Great product, good value. Appreciate the capability to measure actual weight without messing up the surface
 I was looking for a really sleek and simple kitchen scale. This is it! The appealing purple backlight makes it easy to read the measurements.
 Product works as described and looks great. The battery compartment comes off a little easy, but it's worth it for the price.
 This is the coolest thing ever--small, efficient, easy to clean, idiot-proof.  I bought it to perfect the science of pizza dough.  I think I'm being nominated for the Nobel Pizza Prize and will mention this scale in my acceptance speech.
 works perfect, nice and sleek.  easy to keep out on the counter without it getting in the way.  great price for a very good product.
 I loved this value product so much that I sent one to my daughter. With the scale and My Fitness Pal app I have lost 30 lbs in four months.
 It's a nice scale, but I find it weighs slightly different if I jossle the contents I'm weighing. I need more consistent weights, even in tenths of ounces.
 small and light. Easy to use. Just what I was looking for
 Very light and good quality
 I like the look of this scale. It is modern and sleek.<br/><br/>However, I had to return because it did not measure to the 0.01g
 Love this little scale. Works beautifully.  Very easy to store.  Light in weight. Accurate. Perfect for traveling as well.
 Excellent little scale which I've been using as a postal scale. No idea how well it works as a food scale!
 I absolutely love this food scale! I meal prep every week and this product gives me exactly what I need to make sure my proportions are measured perfectly. The scale is of great quality and the display is clean and easy to read. I love it! Highly recommend!
 Came damaged, looked sleek with stainless.  I replaced with Smart Weight in black glass.  I can weigh foods to 11lbs.  Etekcity may also has same weigh levels but has a smaller surface.
 Love my digital scale! I have used it a lot for making desserts! Love how light it is too! Very easy to use and straight forward.
 Weight measurements are inaccurate and don't register if under 3 grams. This is a huge issue when you need accuracy for light material/objects. Also, slow to update new measurements when adding more product. Bummed I bought two of these.
 So far, so good. Was a bit late arriving but it is exactly as pictured.
 THIS IS AWESOME!!!! MY goodness you almost don't want to believe it is so good for the price. I hope to be using it more very soon, I will come back and give a more detailed review.
 good
 small in size and accurate - great stuff
 The batteries that came with this product did not work. Once I placed my own batteries in, it displays inaccurate/inconsistent measurements. Also, it will not display weight of less than 2 grams. It will only show whole numbers, it will not display tenths or hundredths of a measurement. It is useless.
 Love it. Exactly as described!
 Nice small scale. It is compact and light. It turns off if you add ingredients too slowly in small amounts (like lemon zest) so be careful.
 The scale is not always reliable/stable. The digits light would dim if nothing is added in a few seconds. I move the materials so the light would be on again but the scale is not right... maybe return to zero... It is frustrating to measure everything again and try to finish scaling in a rush.
 It is very handy.  I like that I can weigh larger items on it than the old one I had. Works very well!!
 Purchased this product and I haven't been disappointed. Easy to use and change the settings. Found it to be extremely accurate as well. I use it daily in my kitchen.
 Easy to use and precise. I can now weigh my portions when cooking!
 This scale is not accurate -- When I make coffee, I use 2.0 oz. coffee per pot.  The scale will measure out 1.97 oz. then skip to 2.10 oz., never indicating 1.98, 1.99, or 2.00 oz.  WTF!  Etekcity can take their scale and shove it....
 beautiful design and works wonderfully
 Bought this for my wife, she loves it.  Easy to use and very accurate.  Highly recommended.
 Works easily and looks great!
 works very well.
 We purchased this item to have an additional kitchen scale for portioning food.  We've only had it for about a week and overall I'm happy with this purchase.  The measurements are accurate.  My only issue is the size.  Our other kitchen scale is slightly larger and this scale can be difficult to read when you have a dinner plate on it.
 Very pleased with this scale. Performs the necessary functions with ease. Would recommend to others.
 The scale does exactly what it says it will do , and I've had it for a few months now without any issues. Great product for the price!
 I use this to measure out my portions for  on the lunches and dinners.
 Good product
 A little smaller then I expected but it does the job
 It somehow spontaneously stops working about every three days. Ive changed the batteries twice and it wont work.
 AND CAN HIDE ANYWHERE
 Nice scale works for me an easy to convert simple
 This food scale is a great way for me to weigh my food so I can log what I eat. I especially like using the tare function so I can zero out the weight of my plate.
 I bought this with plans to use it.  Then didn't.  It sat out of the package next to the fridge for about 2 months.  Untouched.  Finally thought to put it to use.  I loaded it with batteries and put a couple ounces on it.  It read Zero.  I tried several other items jar of spice - 2 jars...<br/>"zero".<br/>Why can't I give it zero stars?<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Following my review above (one star), I was contacted by the company.  They hastened to correct the issue by sending me a new scale at their expense.  The new one also came with batteries.  This one seems to work just fine.<br/>Had they started with this one, they would have gotten 5 stars.  The scale is sleek (fits into narrow spaces), light weight, streamlined for easy maintenance/cleaning.  Seems like a good product.  There efforts deemed them a redeeming four stars.  I knocked one star off for the hassle.
 Weight varies when I use this I have to do it 3-4 times to settle on one weight. Shame as otherwise sleek and easy to use
 Perfect!
 It's a scale and it weighs stuff just as advertised.  Size is just right.
 I loved this scale, but it stopped working six months after I purchased it.  I purchased this in January of 2017, and it stopped working in July.  I am incredibly disappointed that this scale broke.
 Don't but this. When you press the tare button the scale reads the pressure from your finger so it adds about 128g to every measurement.<br/>This company offers free products for reviews so most of the reviews on here are fake.
 well-designed. Sturdy.
 So far it works great. I like how it can change measurement  conversions so quickly
 I am very very upset that I have to change the batteries every month.
 very nice does not do grams well
 Works great. I love it.
 works great
 Great product, modern looking, nice digital screen, slick look.
 This little guy is amazing, super easy to store, easy to use, so good I have one &amp; given two as gifts,
 Sleek design, good quality. Perfect transaction. No issues. Worth the investment. Thank you!
 slim good looking works
 Great scale! I use it everyday to weigh my food! Great tool for counting calories!
 Works very well with any kind of bowl
 Ordered this because it was cheap.  You get what you pay for.  The scale was inaccurate. Contacted Etekcity and they sent a replacement.  Very good customer support.  However the second scale was even more inaccurate.  Returning to Amazon!
 I love how compact it is
 Love the scale, it's perfectly sized to be used in everyday tasks.
 This is very good
 Works great!!
 Love it!
 This scale is awesome!  Started a diet where I have to weigh my food from .5oz of shredded cheese to 4oz of chicken.  Easy to use and you can zero it out with a bowl on top so that you don't have to put the food directly on the scale.  Now I even weigh some food just for fun!  :-)
 It wasn't very good, not accurate or consistent...while this product did not work for what we needed it for, they were very easy to work with and tried to help me but when it didn't work, he offered me a refund, no problems. Good company to work with and I look forward to buying other items from them, Sharon
 Everything came when it was suppose to and your description is exactly what I got.  Thank you
 I LIKE IT FOR DOUBLE CHECKING ADVERTISED GUN WEIGHT.
 Love this thing. So easy to use!!!
 Great product
 works great, nice size
 Great value! Great quality!
 I love the sleek design of this food scale. I've had other food scales-the last one I used had a non-removable bowl on top and I like this design much better. It's so easy to use and has been wonderful for my needs!
 Works like a charm. Easy and intuitive controls, fast and accurate readings, a great option for this kitchen essential.
 Lightweight and easy to use. Highly recommended.
 easy to used  and accurate
 I bought a couple of these scales to use in different application than for the food kitchen. This product offers you what they (the manufacture) promised no more no less... this scale is accurate for this purpose and also works great  for the application I am using for (rc planes), specially for the price I paid for it. This scales have the accuracy for what they were disingned for.
 Works well and has a good area to weigh all your food.
 Disappointed W/lack of gram . breakdown! .01 percentages
 Accurate, easy to use., and affordable.  I bought 2 and love them.
 This product is worth buying ，always good condition.
 It's easy to use, and seems to work fine, and looks clean and simple.
 Inaccuracies in measurements.
 As suscribed.and all firm no glass or anything even after several falls is brand new.great little scale
 Great little scale! Works well.
 Love it, I measure alot of my meals and portions thanks to this.
 This scale was to replace an old one that finally gave out. It is exactly what we needed. We switched to a gluten-free cooking style a few years ago and being able to measure by weight rather than volume helps a LOT when cooking. This scale is accurate, small and convenient. If I need another one, I will definitely purchase this model again.
 Dose a good job for my application
 It does what it's supposed to do perfectly. The only down side is cleaning the stainless steel type material. However, the stainless steel does look nice. I'm giving this product 5 stars because it's a great product that arrived very quickly and it's not the company's fault for me not accounting for the material style I chose.
 This is a great product. I would defiantly recommend this to anyone.
 easy to use, small, weighs everything
 very great product, but<br/>pay attention<br/><br/>in my case, the product come in original package, in plastic cover and manual, so i put 4 star as<br/>the product get with some little scratches<br/><br/>work perfectly, only thing to keep this scratches
 I found this cost effective scale to be both accurate and easy to use. Switching from measure to measure was simple and cleanup just as easy. The brushed metal look is stylish especially when compared to other scales and doesn’t look out of place on my counter top.<br/>It would have been nice for the buttons to be under a screen to better aid in cleanup but this has yet to be an issue. As they are now, they are raised so if you spilled liquid directly on them, there might be the chance of some getting inside. Also, I don’t know if it’s my scale in particular as I didn’t see any mention of it in other reviews but the batteries don’t seem to last as long as I would like.<br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Etekcity-11lb-Digital-Multifunction-Food-Scale-Batteries-Included/dp/B0113UZJE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Etekcity 11lb Digital Multifunction Food Scale (Batteries Included)</a>
 Genial
 Very simple and easy to use
 It broke after four days of use.<br/>Before it broke, I was unimpressed with it's ability to tare and weigh small amounts.<br/>Nothing seemed to measure until it was at least three grams.<br/><br/>Not compatible with the needs of my Keto diet, but I was struggling along with it for the 4 days it take to completely stop weighing anything.
 It’s simple to use and easy on the eyes! Love it!
 Works exactly as discribed
 Nice little scale. Easy to use. If you're using something like a bowl to weigh your food, just put the bowl on the scale, turn it on &amp; the scale automatically sets to 0. So no need to do adjustments.
 Accurate weights. Easy to read and a cinch to clean
 Works great for me so far.  Easy to use and switch weight choices (lbs, oz, grams etc).  I can add or remove food and it accurately measures it.  Easy to zero and to turn off.
 Got this for my boyfriend/strength coach/trainer. He loves it and it works perfectly. I want to buy one for myself now as he loves it so much. We both track macros and this makes it so much easier to track food like chicken etc!
 My husband needed this for his home brew making and since getting it has improved his outcomes!
 Compact, flat/slim, very quick and easy to use and looks good too.
 Product works great and as expected. It also looks nice, but my particular scale was slightly damaged before getting to me... the brushed stainless steel look had 3 tiny dents/smudges in it. :(<br/><br/>Also I tried using 20g and 100g weights to test the scale, but it would always be 1g lower than the weight (19g and 99g), but it might be that the weights were worn down.<br/><br/>Edit: Packaging also comes with a message from Etekcity offering a warranty extension for registering the product on their website within 7 days, all you have to do is sign up and enter your order ID #. Unfortunately, it doesn't accept my order ID # and I can't even get the warranty extension. :(<br/><br/>Edit #2: Etekcity responded to this review within a day or two fixing the warranty issue and asking for more details of the problems I was having. Really excellent customer service, so I changed my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars even though I'm keeping this scale. :) Also added pictures below of what the tiny smudges look like.
 I haven't had a need to use it yet, but have practiced with it enough to know it is easy to use, accurate and the design is perfect. I would definitely buy this again
 Gave it as a Christmas gift.  Seems like a very nice scale.  Shipped quickly.
 Scale is not accurate. Weighing the same item more than once consistently gives different weights.
 Garbage, bought this and was not working after a day. Had to return it.
 easy to use, accurate
 Love the size and weight of the scale. Easy to use and store.
 Wish it would read to the hundredths
 PERFECT! Accurate &amp; small, got couple extra for family, they too enjoy Etekcity scale...
 Works great. Quick and easy.
 Super easy to use and very sensitive. I love having it around and figuring out correct portions.
 This is an excellent scale. It seems very accurate. Top-notch product!
 Scale worked really well from dec 2016-march 2017, and has since totally malfunctioned. I've changed batteries twice, but the scale only turns on for a few minutes before completely dying. During the few minutes it does work, it won't let me calibrate it. Shame, as I was happy with the product before this.
 Love how this has three different value output settings...grams, ounces, and pounds/ounces!
 The scale doesn't seem to be sensitive enough to detect or measure small increments of weight (for example it would remain at 0 grams as I slowly added more of what I was measuring and then suddenly jump to 4 or 5 grams) Maybe not a huge deal for some but for me that's a deal breaker. Probably will attempt to resell this as unfortunately I waited too long to return it!
 Very cheap scale can't even push tare with scale changing weight.
 Bought this to help with food portioning after stomach surgery, easy to use.
 Great scale.  Small but accurate.
 Great value
 perfect to measure, quick &amp; easy to use
 the scale is a very good buy for the price.
 Great, space saving scale with accurate measurements.
 The scale works well and is easy to use. It is incredibly slim and very light. Nonetheless, it appears to be durable.
 Bought this for coffee. Works great.
 Works well. Seems accurate and is easy to clean and store.
 Very sleek and convenient to store.  Very easy to use. I like that you can change the unit of measurement (i.e. oz, grams, etc)
 Currently on weight program through VA and this is helping me accurately document my intake. Easy to operate and doesn't take much room on the counter. I highly recommend.
 great used it a large amount for soap making , Great!
 Works as advertised. I've been using it to watch my portions and this doesn't disappoint.
 As described..
 I've used it with both my v60 and my Chemex.  It doesn't turn off too soon like my other scale used to.
 This is great - small, lightweight and easy to use
 Definitely the best food scale I've ever owned.
 I was hoping it would weigh one gram but it will only show weight when you add about 4 grams and then its really unclear if it is accurate.  My suggestion is to buy a different scale if your looking for accuracy.  I am sorry i bought this scale.
 I got this scale a few days ago to allow myself to track exactly how much meat I was putting into my vacuum sealer bags. I go to one of those bulk discount clubs for all my meats, then repackage them in vacuum sealer bags for my family to use. Up until now I was eyeballing the portions, and boy was I off! Now I can weigh them out much more accurately and I end up with less waste.<br/><br/>The scale looks great on my counter with a nice brushed metal design. I originally thought he whole thing was plastic, but on closer inspection the top plate actually looks to be a thin piece of stainless steel which is great. The scale runs off 2 AAA batteries and are supplied in the package.<br/><br/>The scale has 2 buttons, the left is an On/Off if you hold it as well as Tare (zeroing out the scale) when you tap it. You should always zero it out before use or you will not have an accurate reading. The button on the right cycles through the different units of measure. This scale can report ounces (oz), pounds &amp; ounces (lboz), grams (g) and milliliters (ml). I assume the ml unit is supposed to be for water, because milliliters are not a real unit of weight, it is a unit of volume.<br/><br/>When it came, I ran around weighing everything I could find and it seems pretty accurate when you take into account the packaging of your household items. Weight is calculated before packaging, so in my photo there is a container that is 38oz, weighs 40oz with the container it is in.<br/><br/>All in all its a great little scale for the kitchen. Looks great, and if your short on space (really, who isn't?) it can easily be tucked away for later use.<br/><br/>Note: I was given this product free of charge in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
 Works great
 It is small, lightweight and accurate. This is all you need for measuring your food before consumption.
 Never worked.
 Awesome scale. Easy to use, lightweight, and sharp looking.
 easy to use and operate.
 Great little scale. I love it and use it daily.
 Great scale in a compact size.  It shuts off the display automatically to save batteries but comes on the minute it feels some weight.
 Great - just what I needed.
 Cheap.  Attractive.  Works.  Oh, and it cleans easy, too!
 I jus it  is very good ,quite small
 Great scale.  Bought for my wife to use for her outgoing packages.  Very accurate and easy to use.  Small and nice design.  Nice addition to her office.
 So excited to finally upgrade my spring powered 1lb kitchen scale. In comparison this scales is wonderful. Works as expected and the zero feature works well. 4 stars because LCD display is incredibly bright and sometimes difficult to read.
 Sturdy and extremely accurate for kitchen use
 I meal prep every week and I love my new scale.  Very stylish, easy to use.
 I LOVE it! I am trying to lose some weight and this product really help me a lot in monitoring the amount of food I am eating.<br/>Before I get the product, I was really worried that this scale would be too big and heavy for me to carry ard.<br/>But it turns out not to be true!<br/>Great design, absolutely accurate measure with different units to choose from.<br/>Can't ask for more!
 Very good scale.  Would recommend to all who need accurate food weight.
 I love this scale. It's great quality, works well, easy to use. And it's sleek and super easy to store and clean. Love this.
 Really simple to use and helps me with portion control.
 So far, so good.  No complaints
 Great little scale!  Simple to use and stores easily, without taking up too much space.  Very happy with my purchase.
 Broke after a week. Seemed nice, but law of averages….
 This scale looks great, is thin enough to stay with the cutting boards and easy to use.This is the scale you want if you're looking for an all-around best compact, sleek, basic food scale.
 I like it just wish it was bigger. Its hard to use because when you have to weigh something a little bigger how the hell are you to read it on the screen??
 Scale has been very helpful, it's easy to use. I am able to get an accurate reading and the size makes it easy to store.
 Accurate
 Very compact and light weight, seems to be very acurate.
 Works very well. Use it regularly.
 It worked, but not very accurate of 1~2 gram change, however if you keep adding more weight, it will display the total correctly.
 Works well enough for measuring out coffee in the morning, not very sensitive to small changes in weight.<br/><br/>One point of concern: Once (so far) when measuring the displayed weight was roughly half the actual weight of the items being measured. Operation returned to normal after cycling the power.
 I didn't need anything fancy.<br/>It weighs my food.<br/>The light stays on long enough for me to get the weight.

When I set it on a flat table, it starts at 220-230grams. The on/off switch doesn’t work so I cannot switch this thing off.
 Great for the kitchen, amazing quality and accuracy for the price.
 Great product, I like it, it is clean and the right size.
 Very easy to use and exactly what we needed.
 Seriously amazing! Works great, small, compact. i can even travel with it!
 Excelente!
 Very happy that I got this scale ! So easy for me to stay on track w. my macros now ;  abs here I come !
 does exactly what I need it to do &amp; very lightweight
 Has a malfunction where it won't turn off automatically, and burns through batteries in a week. Have gone through ~4 sets of batteries in a month. Terrible quality control. Wish I returned it sooner.
 I am very pleased, and you can't beat the price.
 Easy to use and it's light. I can place the scale anywhere and it never takes up any space. I use it to track my calories and nutrients.
 It’s totally light wieght, but You will never use it ! use it!! not accurate at all ? It’s skips like 10 gram easlly specially in liqued like honey and butter! which’s not accuptable at all ! I don’t like it
 Works great and as advertised. I love it
 it doesn't work for measuring lightweight material. i put a handful of dried chantrelles on it and the weight remained at zero. only buy if your'e looking to measure food of over 5 grams.
 Only worked once, when I tried to use it the 2nd time is was useless and past the refund date.
 Couldn't get it to switch between g and oz so it was never usable for me.
 Nice functions and ultra lightweight
 Works great and I use it to measure mail and food!
 Included batteries were dead on arrival.  Seems to work good and consistently zeroes out.
 Nice
 Very sleek and small but extremely precise.  I love it! I hope it holds up to the amount of use I will be giving it!!
 This is a small sized kitchen scale that is easy to use. It's perfect to leave on the counter and it wipes clean quickly. Good product.
 Compact, lightweight, accurate.
 This kitchen scale is perfect for all weighing of food for recipes you make. The stainless steel body  is beautiful and easy to clean. the unit is very versatile in it's operation.
 Does its job.
 Very accurate and batteries last quite a while.
 Had this for a while now and it does a great job still and I use it all the time.
 Sleek look. Easy to clean. I use it to weigh chicken for cooking.
 Accurately informs me that gravity is a constant and unyielding force.
 Digital is hard to see when it brights. I have to cover my hand over the digital to see the number. Buttons are little hard to press. Other than that it does a job as a scale but not recommended for commercial and heavy use.
 Looks good, seems accurate
 Fast, simple, and accurate. Lights up again when weight changes, so it's easy to keep up with.
 Don't waste your money. Stopped working after a month
 Great little scale for the kitchen counter. Recommend.
 Works well.  Sturdy build.
 Started weighing my meals and I started losing weight!
 As advertised
 Have had this scale for around 2 months now. Couldn't have lost my 20+lbs with out it! What I mean by that is it has drastically improved my eating habits! The back lit screen is nice! I keep it in grams. But it has other setting to (really easy to change the settings). Super simple to operate. Battery life has been good so far!
 Nice compact scale that cleans easily.
 This is a handy little scale for weighing small quantities.  Works great.  No problems after several years.
 Works Great!!
 The scale came and didn’t work. It gave an error which becuase it didn’t come with a manual I had to google. It said take out batteries and replace and put on a flat surface. Tried this 5 times and it still does t work.
 Excellent!! This scale is doing everything I need.  Thank you
 Product came with a missing back piece meaning all the measurements are inaccurate.
 Very useful in measuring ingredients. No problem with this one.
 Good quality.
 d
 Received item 3-24-17.  Scale was small and very usefull.  Enjoy the usage.  Rate XXXXX
 I loved the size, color, cost &amp; ease of use. Thanks.
 it works no issues and looks good.
 No complaints! It's so small and so light-weight making it easy to store away when not in use and/or travel with! It weighs about as much as this butter knife does. The scale is super easy to use with just the 2 buttons and easy to clean the smooth, flat surface. The ONLY downside for some people would be the fact that because it operates off of batteries, the screen will dim after 10 seconds and completely shut off after 60 seconds of no use to preserve battery life.
 works great and is small and compact for storage
 i didnt open it but it look very good deal .
 Love this scale. Compact.
 works great
 Really sleek looking and so easy to use! I'm so happy I bought this one out of all the options.
 This scale is very compact and attractive as well as meeting my needs perfectly. I can weigh items directly on the scale or put them in a bowl that the scale will pre-weigh for me so that only the weight of the item itself is displayed. It is very easy to use. I intend to purchase other products from this maker.
 I really like my scale. No complaints.
 Love it, love it!! Easy to use, accurate and makes my life easier. A very nice product and easy to clean.
 the scale itself is not that easy to use as the display takes more than a few hits to reset and the square footage is not that great if you want to lets say weight a food container then add the food to then calculate the weight.
 I love this! It's small, light, has different settings, looks nice...what else can I say? The affordable price is what drew me in.<br/><br/>I use it along with tracking my macros and it does the job.
 Stopped working about 3 months of use.
 I'm very happy with my order. The order was processed and delivered as promised, on time and in excellent condition. Thank you.
 This works well and is great for measuring food in a bowl however, if you want to measure food on a plate you will not be able to see the display.
 It works, but mine arrived with scratches on the surface and did not look new. I just kept it because it would be such a hassle to return.
 This scale is good. I use it all the time.
 Easy to use, perfect size, just need to take the time to learn all it's features.
 Great scale, hope it gives me many years of service..Thank you.
 I really like my kitchen scales. Seems to be very accurate in weights.<br/>Light weight and fits into my kitchen drawer easily.
 looks good and convenient to weigh small packages
 Works great and is very precise 5 stars
 Worked okay for ~3.5 months, now when I try to turn it on all it will give me is an 'unSE' error. Will be ordering a new scale from another company.
 I like this thing. Easy to use. Very helpful.
 Perfect scale for the price. I weigh out food in ounces and herbs in grams. Very easy to use, comes with 2 AAA batteries, and easy to read display. I would purchase again.
 Love this scale!
 Just received. Very secure packaging, variety of weight options, and looks stylish on the kitchen counter.  Batteries included, yeah!
 Very good scale. Easy to use &amp; small, exactly what I needed. Price was great too.
 This scale is light weight and I like the fact that if offers different forms of measurement (ml, oz, etc.).  So far I am very happy with this product.
 Edited review :  after giving poor review on first scale that quit working almost immediately, Etekcity customer service contacted me and sent a replacement. It's a great looking scale that does the job. I appreciate the wonderful customer service and how concerned they are about their product.
 Small, light and very practical for the kitchen
 perfect scale for counting macros
 Perfect for measurong copper silver or gold content in Coins
 I love the small size but exact weighing.  Easy to use.  Easy to store.
 can't go wrong.  Good design.
 HOME BREW USER<br/><br/>Bought this for measuring out hops for brewing.  It measures ounces the .01, so measuring out 1.75oz is easy.
 I love the face that I can zero it out to take off the container.  What I didn't realize was how small it is.  I should've read the specifications more closely.  I have to put my food to be weighed on a saucer to weight it, rather than putting the whole plate on it.  But it works great and gives me the information that I need.
 it does what I bought it for.<br/>No issues here.
 Thank you
 Great scale and costumer service! I use it all the time!
 Nice little scale
 Awesome little scale for the price! Does exactly what it says. Nice and thin so it hides  away in a drawer easily. Easy to use and easy to read!
 Batteries died almost immediately, and then when I replaced thos with fresh batteries, the digital display starting showing gibberish. I turned it off, turned it on again..then pulled batteries and re-inserted with same result. Very poor quality, in the trash can.
 This was a gift and she loves it!
 Doesn't grab the weight of most things. I missed the return window so now I'm stuck with it.
 It is so easy to use and you can weigh oz. grams, pounds &amp; milliliters.  Like that it turns itself off after 2 minutes.
 Scale worked fine, but completely died after 9 months of semi-frequent use.<br/><br/> update]<br/>Seller reached out and replaced scale for free. Changing from 1 star review to 3.
 The scale was precise.
 Easy to use; compact and light. Great buy.
 Can’t see digits if you put a normal plate on it
 So slender and convenient.  Exactly what I wanted.
 It's great and easy to use.
 Seems to work pretty well.
 This was a present for my mom, she absolutely loves it!
 Perfect for my needs and is exactly how seller described
 love it
 This scale works very nicely. It's compact and fits out of the way. No complaints here.
 Very sensitive and stylish- keep the box that it comes in, works great for storing or when you are traveling!
 Easy to use and clear screen. Very nice little scale.
 good
 Don't waste your money with scale. It is very unstable during measurements and very inaccurate. If you want to use that for weighting something in the range of 30-50 gr forget about it. Very disappointed
 This product does not weigh grams accurately.
 Can't beat it for the price
 Works perfectly. Just put whatever container you want to measure in on it, turn it on, and then add the item you want to measure. Very nice.
 Works great. Easy to use. Great small size
 I bought this scale for a Cooking Class I was taking at CBU(Christian Brothers University).  I found it extremely accurate and very helpful in measuring ingredients by weight and not by volume.  My wife and I will keep this scale for years to come and use it as we enjoy more cooking adventures.
 very nice design and high quality, i was surprised to see at such a good price!!!
 scale works perfectly! :) never had any problems at all.
 perfect, just as described
 I bought this scale to keep at work. It’s okay but not as good as the EatSmart scale I have at home. The number never seems to settle and continually goes up and down (+/- 5 g). I wouldn’t buy another one.
 I've only had the scale for a few days and it works well. I'm giving a 5 star rating because of their customer service. Even if the scale happens to die tomorrow, they made me feel really good about buying it!!!
 Seems to be very accurate even with 6 months of daily use. Going to order a couple more soon.
 The batteries it came with died after 2 months and now that I've replaced them with new batteries the scale will power on but the digital display is blank (only shows a backlight)
 does exactly what I need it to do and even came with 2 extra batteries.
 Easy and accurate, just what the doctor ordered,literally. Good scale, and it is eassy.
 Great product the first one we received the numbers were not working well on the screen and it was replaced without a hassle the next day I highly recommend this product I love that is has so many different settings and it's so versatile
 light and compact, easy to use and pretty accurate.
 Works well.  And the "tare" factor is great.  But instructions could be a little better.
 Love this. Super easy to use.
 wonderful scale...just wish it didn't scratch and scuff up so easily
 Elegant little scale performs flawlessly. Would purchase again.
 Simple and accurate. Great size, nice finish. Good for weighing any thing. Times out a little quick, but no big deal.
 Bought beginning of January 2018. Sending it back beginning of March 2018 due to the scale reading UNSE. Even after a battery change. Worked perfectly for 2 months though. Make sure you sign up for the warranty. Takes 5 minutes.
 Really nice, not super fancy, but do the job I need in the kitchen at a very low price.
 my wife likes it
 Been using for over 6 months now and this thing is great! Only goes to 11 pounds but thats all I need.
 Very sleek design but worked for about 2 months and then just got stuck, no hard or rough use.
 Perfect for the new eating lifestyle
 I love the size. Very accurate.
 Good value. I use it every day. Seven months in, the on/off button became defective, but the excellent customer service team helped me out with a replacement and I’m back to using this wonderful product.
 Small and convenient
 Great and easy to use. It is also very easy to wipe down for cleaning.
 This scale is sooo easy to use. I had a previous scale from Walmart and it was very confusing and I ended up returning it. The demo video is very helpful and teaches you step by step. Very small so it stores easily
 Great scale for the price.  Works well.  My daughter and I use it weekly for food prep.
 Loved it!
 Awesome little scale, especially at such a low price.  It's reliable, and easy to use.  The only criticism is have is that the display can get covered if put a plate on the scale, but it's not that big of a deal.  Id buy it again, even came with batteries!
 Works great, simple to use, no complaints yet.
 was a gift, person had one already
 using it everyday.
 Great looking and accurate.  Perfect for weighing anything.  We are using it for food so the size is perfect and the stainless is easy to keep clean.
 Display quit working the first week, unable to contact seller I am trying to get refunded
 i use this for meal preping. love it.
 Works well. Serves it purpose. I use it to measure my food. I like that it's small/portable and digital. It's easy to use and can restart scale to zero after placing my glass containers on it so it accurately weighs food.  I'm happy with it. Thanks.
 Very nice...
 Simplicity works. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles,  just does what it is supposed to do. At a good price.
 Nice accurate scale great for weighing meat.
 Love it
 This scale has a problem with eating batteries you put in brand new batteries and they die in a few hours you have to take out after each use or when you go to use it in a few hours it’s dead I’ve gone through a lot of batteries very very inconvenient don’t recommend it
 Works as intended, easy to use and takes little counter or drawer space. Read the measurements prior to buying though as your needs may differ.
 Scale arrived promptly, opened the box and it's nice and small and sleek. Love it only the grams option is not accurate, bummer.  I don't want to bother returning  it so  I will try to make due with using the ml...
 It is small, slim &amp; light weight Fits easily in a small space &amp; is easy to use. This is my 1st scale &amp; I am glad I chose this one.
 Stopped working after 1 year. 0 stars. DON'T BUY.
 I've been very satisfied with my scale.  I would not hesitate to order this scale again!
 Does everything it's supposed to do. I love the different weight options,  very sensitive so it works for lightweight items and small measurements
 Great tool for baking recipes from my mums British baking books. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to convert them!
 Received my Digital Kitchen Scale and I am extremely excited and happy!  I cannot wait to start creating candles and soap!  Thank you so much!
 I have used this to meal prep and count macros. It worked well until today. In less than 2 months it just stopped working. I changed the batteries and still nothing. Very disappointing! 😭
 Simple, and it works. Goes down to the .01, which is more than some other similarly priced kitchen scaled. Good stuff.
 This scale is the worst.  It gets "stuck" on numbers, gives different readings on things of the same weight, and is too cheap to bother returning it.  Unfortunately it's just wasted energy and resources to make a terrible product.  I don't understand the high ratings at all.
 As advertised
 This scale is exactly what I hoped for, and very accurate; when I was dividing out my brown sugar into convenient 1 lb bags, I was literally adding a pinch at a time to bring it exactly to the pound.  I like that is shuts itself off after a little bit, and that I can store it in the cupboard and it dosen't  accidentally turn on, even if something gets stacked on it.
 Nice and small like I wanted. Works well.
 The sacle worked for about 2 mins. Then tje screen went out.  POS scale.  Buy a better manufacturer.  Not worth the money or same day shipping i paid.
 I used this for one day in August.  I pulled it out today to use for a bread recipe, and it would not turn on.  I changed the batteries....nothing.
 This is okay. The buttons are too much trouble.
 Great product - Smaller than I expected, which is actually great!  I only dinged it by one star, because the rubber pads on the "feet" keep coming off.
 Scale works great
 Very good design, I love it.
 This scale has saved my life. I can now save money by sorting the right amount per serving and also eat healthy portions of food simply by applying the basic principles of food preparation. Thank you to your magnificent staff.
 Works perfectly!! Lightweight, sleek design.
 Received product quickly, looks real neat, but weighs 1-4 grams off.
 I use it everyday! Exact measuring
 Small, simple and easy to use.  Very accurate.
 Love it !!
 It's simple and gets the job done. It's easy to clean and the batteries last a long time. It would be nice if it was a little bigger, so I could sit a plate on it easily. Other than the size, it's sleek and goes well with any kitchen. Quite a good purchase and good for tracking your macros.
 Luce muy bonita, es muy útil y facil de usar. Excelente por su precio. He pagado más por otras que me han gustado menos.
 Excellent Customer Service, if you have any issues with the product, they do everything to make it right
 Have to remove and then replace batteries each time to "turn on". Once on it has to be recalibrated. It is very difficult to recalibrate as it seems more by chance than how the instructions indicate. Will not buy again.
 I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!
 Love my scale - works great!
 Great purchase.
 Use this to measure my food portions and does the job. Easy to use and easy to switch options.
 Very accurate, easy to use
 great for the price.  The batteries are normal batteries you can replace unlike other scales that you have to replace frequently
 Works great!
 Cam dead on arrival. Even tried new batteries,
 I've had this scale for about two months and I like it. After about a week the "on" button needed to be pressed several times before it registers. It does its job, but I have a feeling it won't last long.
 Love to use it in the kitchen, easy to use.
 Very simple to use and reliable. Comes with battery, so no hassle to start. Looks beautiful and build is sturdy.
 This scale is amazing. It definitely does the job and it’s super simple and easy to use. It is very conscientious to have and I definitely recommend getting this. The instructions are easy to follow and the scale is easy to use
 Not  very precise with small measurements.
 Compact, light weight, portable, fast, accurate. No buyer's remorse, just good vibes.
 I loved the accuracy of the scale as I checked repeatability several times. I found out quickly that glass bowls were best to use to see the weight as I was measuring in the 5-10 lb range. Easier to see that way.
 batteries were bad, purchased new batteries, seems to work ok
 It already broke. Less than 2 weeks of owning and it won't turn on with the batteries it came with or brand new ones.
 Elegant look, easy to use, low price.
 Simple easy to use buttons. Small enough to store anyway
 Sleek, works well!
 Scale works great and it very accurate. It is very light and easy to read and clean.
 Perfect scale - has multiple settings for convenience (I.e grams / kg / lb / oz).<br/><br/>Exactly what you need for daily dieting
 love the scale - I use it twice a day to measure out my dogs food and it's great.  I love that I can zero out the container.  Would recommend.
 Small and very easy to use, would buy again.  Very useful
 I've only used a few times but seemed accurate.
 I like that all the buttons are on top. I have had one in the past that I had to push a button on the bottom to change from lbs/oz to grams. I also like that it takes AAA batteries rather than lithium as they are expensive.
 Useful but the scale takes a long time to scal our weight
 Beautiful on my counter and works just like advertised.
 I absolutely love this scale it works great,  its weight is light, incredible.
 I am totally enjoying the scale
 Seemed to work well for a few days but I had trouble cleaning it after weighing it. I must have gotten too much water on it bc in less than a week it doesn't work anymore.... luckily it was only $12.
 so far so good.
 Great buy!
 I do not recommend this product. It worked great for about 6 weeks and then the batteries died. I replaced the batteries, but now the unit button does not shift so I have to weigh all items in grams. Not the best product on the market.<br/><br/>Update: Etekcity promised to send me a new scale free of charge! I am pleased with their display of customer service.
 Not that responsive
 Performs as expected
 Great scale
 Nice little scale. No issues as of yet
 I like this scale. It suits my soap making needs perfectly.
 Works great!
 The backlit display became hardly visible after only 3 weeks of use!  I changed batteries but still had the same problem. On a good day, it's quite visible but on a bad day, it's impossible to see anything.  I didn't bother to return it because I already threw the box.  I wrote my review on Amazon and then  less than a day later got  contacted by an Etekcity customer rep apologizing for the inconvenience and telling me that they will mail me a replacement for my defective item.  So 4 stars for good customer service!
 I have been using this to weigh my wedding save the dates and other envelopes. It seems very accurate and easy to use. Made well.
 I give this scale 5 stars. It is easy to use and small enough to travel.  I have weighed fruits, vegetables, meats and grains without any problems.  I have used bowls to weigh and it is easy to reset the weight of the bowl or plate to weigh just the food.
 Easy to use!
 Love it!
 Wildly inaccurate and inconsistent weights...
 Practical, slim and doesn’t take a lot of space. Had it for several months: no issues and battery still full with a use of about twice a week.
 Works great. My daughter is loving it and it has helped her to change her diet
 Amazing how nice this scale is.  Even my son was weighing everything.  Very accurate and easy to use.
 Works really well. I use it to measure out my soap making ingredients. Nothing fancy about. It just gets the job done.
 Works great +/- 3 Grams, No complaints!
 The item was easy to use and came with its own batteries.Great design but it was not accurate and fluctuated a lot. I returned the item.
 Works great. I thought I was touch screen for some reason but the buttons work well. It's tiny
 This scale does everything it advertises.  Being able to use the tare feature is hugely helpful in recipe creation.  The display is big &amp; bright.
 Always on my counter top or easy access to. Easy read
 Scale works exactly as advertised.
 Conveniently small and easy to use.
 Rather small but does it's job well. Very easy to use!
 Fantastic scale! Has all the features you could want or need. Display is very vivid and bright.
 This scale quit working after the 3rd use.  The return expired Dec. 1 and it is Dec. 4.  Do NOT waste your money on this project.  I have purchased platy of digital food scales over the years and have NEVER had a product that worked only 3 times!!!!
 Love it! Accurate and essy to clean.
 Works great and is nice and compact on my kitchen counter.
 Lasted 5 months before I was unable to tare. Worked perfectly well before that. I tried changing batteries to no avail. Disappointed that I didn't get more time with it. I'm not sure if I accidentally dripped water on it or something, so I'd advise you to be cautious about doing so.
 I'm very happy with this scale. Compact, easy to use, easy to store (takes up no space at all hardly).  Easy to clean and doesn't show fingerprints.  I've already recommended this scale to friends.
 Good and easy to use
 This scale looks nice and works very well. It performs its purpose and I have no complaints!
 A great addition to my kitchen.  Easy to use &amp; clean.
 This scale is outstanding. Well made, easy to use, quality product.
 Just got this for starting weight watchers to weigh portions. Love this. It's sleek and super compact.
 WOrks but it's smaller than you'd think...
 Product arrived on time and in great condition.  It works great.  Very pleased.
 very good
 Worked good at first. Now I can't read the numbers.
 This product is just as described!  I love it!  It's so easy to use &amp; clean.  It takes up so little space too. I highly recommend it!
 Never worked
 This thing works great and was exactly what I was looking for! Very easy to use and came with its own batteries.  Can't beat the price.
 The Etekcity scale is very sleek and works great. Very easy to use.
 I use this to measure out equal parts of 2 part epoxy glues. It is a very sensitive scale for small amounts of glue or other small items.
 Listed under a toutubers discription seemed easy to use i bought it nd it looks sleek and yge display is pretty cool i like it and it works thanks for the cool product :D i recomend it
 Works exactly as advertised.
 Product was actually bigger than i thought it would be which was a pulse.  Simple and clean design.  Batteries were included.  Was ready to go right out the box.
 just received my Etekcity digital kitchen scale..Works perfectly and simple to use. Delivered quickly as well<br/><br/>Thank you<br/><br/>John W.
 The product sensitivity did not appear to be 1 gram. Repeated attempts were made to test this sensitivity. Item mass did not register until approximately 3 or 4 grams.
 Works good and is small
 I have bought this scale around a week.Yesterday measurements are extremely inaccurate suddenly.Super disappointed.
 I've had many kitchen scales. This one is very easy to use, seems accurate, and is great with interchangeable measurements. Quickly switch from ounces to grams while weighing. I love this!
 HAVEN'T had to use this yet, but when I received it  I checked the calibration and was exact. Look forward to using. Very nicely packed and detailed instructions.
 the scales are all four legs not the top of it. dont trust it really
 VERY TOUCHY MUST BE FLATE AND RESET OFTEN BUT IT BETTER THAN MY OTHER ONE I HAD
 great food scale, so nice and sleek! tiny also, i love it!!
 Great product and nice price.
 Works great
 Smaller than I pictured, but nice.
 Great little scale. Easy to use and easy to store
 Handy food scale for weight watchers.
 To be honest I ordered two scales that day and this one will be for my travel. I did use it once and it worked great and matched weight from the second one.<br/>I have recommended to others at my meetings with weight watchers!<br/>Thanks,<br/>Linda
 I can do the math, but I really like the option of having an ounce measurement that doesn't automatically go to pounds when you get to 16. Saves a step when blowing up recipes to 3 or 4 times.
 great product and price
 This scale is awesome. Has all the different units that I need to measure when meal prepping in the kitchen, or weighing things out for a recipe.
 Great little scale as a gift for my daughter to weigh her food with on her diet! She likes it!
 This scale is the perfect size to store on my limited counter space.
 Like the small size.  fits in a very small kitchen and is easily stored.
 Very happy with this scale. Looks very solid and well-made, and works very accurately. The stainless steel look of the scale looks very cool also. Very happy so far.
 Good price, small and light with the choice of units.
 Works well
 works fine but the built quality is not the best.
 I use this all they time and is great very accurate and easy to work with!!!
 good, like the scale. Work as i wanted
 Easy to use. Weighs in multiple units.  Great buy!
 A principio no meme acostumbraba.
 Really reliable and afordable.
 Easy to use, and seems to be quite accurate and repeatable.
 It weighed everything the way I needed it too, and helped with my diet :)
 Easy to use and helped us a lot in our kitchen. Would reccommend!
 I like how this scale looks very nice and it is easy to use and the owners manual is very easy to read and tells you exactly what you need to know and in simple English. For the price, it looks and works very beautiful.
 What's to say, its a scale for weighing your food.
 Sleek looking, doesn't take any space and has been working great (I've had it for only a month)
 Giving 2 stars for design only. Item is sleek and backlit display is great. Function was not satisfactory. Weight calculations were off and would fluctuate by .05 oz regularly. Not helpful if you need precise measurements. Tried changing batteries but no change.
 simple to use
 I actually use this to measure haircolor in grams  &amp; it works great!
 Just don't waste your money elsewhere~
 Love it work amazing
 Worked great for about a week ! Now it’s already crapped out . It won’t change from grams to anything else so now I have to use 2 scales just to meal prep... dissatisfied and disappointed to say the least !
 Smaller than I expected but it looks sturdy and I love it so far. I use this with my baking stuff and it works very well.
 Works everytime love it.
 Works great
 very slim and works as expected
 Very happy with this scale, not only is it beautiful and sleek but, accurate.
 got it to service my ac in vehicles works well
 Good quality.
 Super fun little scale. Works great for our home of four, cooking and baking.
 Perfect for portioning things out at work.
 Love this scale!
 Very good kitchen scale. Easy to work with. The metallic "coating" tends to get dirty fairly quickly, but it's easy to clean.
 beautiful, compact, large capacity, easy to clean, easy to use - everything I wanted it to be
 Good
 Perfect.  Just what I needed at a great price.  Love being able to have it display in grams or oz.
 Easy to use and measure accurately!
 Great product, we use it frequently measuring food portions as part of a healthy eating regimen.  We bought 2 as we figured that we would need a back up as the price appeared inexpensive.  Much to our surprise we have had no issues and despite a few minor drops from kitchen counter the scale keeps working great.  I would certainly recommend it
 Sleek, smart
 👍👍👍
 Sleek and compact. Perfect for portion sizing. Put the container/bowl/plate on the scale, reset to 0, then add food to get only the food weight.
 Compact, accurate. Serves its purpose
 Beautiful shape, small size, but its surface is slippery, there is a difference in measurement of 1 gram,<br/>in general excellent.
 EXCELLENT scale. Does everything you need it to for a great price. Loved the product and it comes with a year warranty. I highly recommend it for any purposes. It's small and able to be stored very easily. Stainless steel as well so it looks great on the counter!
 works great! cute and small
 Like this scale very much, bought two after I spilled liquid on the other
 Great product and really impressive customer service explaining how to use!!
 It’s small and accurate. It’s been really helpful for weighing portions for food preparation. And helpful in baking accurately.
 This scale is small and convenient to store but is very efficient.  Great product.
 Works great was packed nicely!
 The scale has a sleek design and is easy to switch settings. The drawback? The scale won't give me consistent readings at all. It's essentially worthless.
 for a small scale it works good
 This scale eats batteries. If you leave the batteries in and then don't use it for a week or so, they will be dead.
 Easy to use, very good quality.
 Definitely worth it. Very sensitive and easy to operate.
 Never worked, neither with the provided batteries nor with fresh ones. Disappointed with this purchase.
 Perfect for my needs.
 Works very well... I was reading through some comments about the reading of weight going away too soon... not a problem on my end. Plus it's very chic looking, goes great with my kitchen!
 smaller then I thought it would be but works great
 Very efficeint and it does not take any space in the kitchen!
 I like the looks and it's easy to use.  I would be even happier if the weigh table was a little longer so that I could put a full size dinner plate on it and still be able to read the weight
 Not happy with this.  Not reliable under 3 grams.  Ruined my bread when trying to weight salt.  Display goes to sleep too quickly, and when it does, it resets the zero setting.  Gonna get the oxo version for the kitchen and keep this one for the garage.
 This is my first digital food scale and it is so much better than the Cuisinart manual scale I had.  Very accurate and precise.  Easy to use.  I especially like the feature that allows you to change from grams to ounces and back.  Light weight and easy to store.  I recommend it.
 it's very light and delivered fast. Somehow it is not very sensitive when measuring little amount
 Scale is inaccurate.
 Works but I don't think it's so accurate but enough
 Nice little scale that does the job.  It is easy to store, easy to use.
 It works better than older versions
 The scale measures in ounces, grams and milliliters and switches between these measures easily. It also has a "tare" feature which allows one to measure just the content of the container as the weight of the container is zeroed out. Because it is light and battery powered it is easy to use in the kitchen and dining room (for those watching calories!).
 It's a decent scale. I like the different units of measurement but it's so small that I can't use a big plate on it so I always have to get two plates dirty when weighing my food. Pretty annoying.
 Just received this today. Turned it on, the LED display turned on but anything I put on it does not change the display. It sticks on 0. Would like a full refund!<br/><br/>Edit: I received a full refund for this product!
 Works great, seems very accurate. I like the backlit LCD.
 I will be using it a lot!
 The only thing good about this scale is that you can return it.
 Scale seems accurate and it's easy to read. I like the auto shut off.
 Works geat and a fraction of the cost of my last food scale!  Like the fact that it is also measures liquid
 Great for portion control.
 This is a great little scale. I can now get really accurate measurements when making my own cheeses.
 Great scale.  Clean, sleek.  Does exactly what I need it to.
 Perfect for my garlic farming.
 Simple and easy to use.
 This came fast. The product looks sleek and easy to operate. Nice to see gram and ounce measurements. Nice detailed manual as well as the included batteries.
 This item is very essential to me as a student chef. I have really enjoyed using this and have seen a very good product.  8 oz can be five pounds.
 It's easy to use i really like it
 Great product.
 always there for perfect baking
 Works great and an accurate tool for weighing food
 It doesn't seem to have weight in ounces....only grams or ml which I have to convert everytime I weigh something.  It's a little inconvenient.
 So glad I purchased this scale!  It's small, lightweight &amp; easy to use.  It slips right under my cookbook holder, out of the way, but easy to get to.  I was using an old Weight Watcher's spring scale &amp; I'm glad to be using one now that is very accurate.  And it was a great value-wish I'd ordered it sooner!
 THANKS A LOT
 did not use it dont use for it. does not help my diet plan in any way. would love to return it its brand new but I am out of the return period.
 Amazing for this price.  Works well, is easy to use.
 works great and is very compact
 I like it. It is smaller then I. Thought it would be. It gets the job done for now. Will need to upgrade though
 Worked as Advertise.  Good scale.
 Doesn't even work and too late to return it
 I mean it does what it says
 Compact and accurate.
 good quality for the price
 Compact digital scale great in kitchen. it is really true. it doesn't take a space. works great. it is very good that you can put something like cap on it then start to use from zero.<br/>i love it.
 Works great. Just what I needed for a very inexpensive way to measure accurately
 it works pretty awesome and super lightweight and stylishl! Great customer service as well sent me a new one with no problem when it stopped working!
 Doesn't weigh small amounts.
 This scale is very sleek, easy to use and does not take up a lot of room. Very happy with it.
 Exactly what I wanted and needed.
 Perfect for the kitchen.
 Enough said.
 Pratical
 This is the most perfect kitchen scale.  It is thin, light weight, and easy to read.  Very easy to operate and I really like the zero/tare function.  I will highly recommend this to anyone.
 Love it!
 Does what it was suppose to do. Easy to use
 Bought this to help me on my weight loss journey, and it's been working great so far! Love that I can zero out the weight of my dishes!
 The scale is sleek but that’s pretty much the only thing I like about it. I use this to throughout my coffee-making process and several times now it has randomly reset itself right as I’m in the middle of weighing my pour.
 Yup, would buy it again.
 A great little scale
 Extremely poor quality
 I have problems understanding the tare mode for this scale and sometimes it's not quite precise when the weight added is "too light" (let's say some veggies for example). It is good in an overall but if you're into a detailed and controlled diet and you need to weight with precision you might want to get a fancier scale.
 Works perfect
 It works great. Fits well in a drawer while not in use.
 The product was exactly as described and arrived on time. Worked perfectly for measuring herbs &amp; recipe ingredients.
 It works as advertised and I use it every day to weigh my food. Good product - not much more to say
 I purchased this product in August 2016 and it continues to have intermittent periods where it malfunctions. Giving me error and frantically skipping around. I switched batteries, turned on and off and it continues. Disappointed
 Works great!
 This is the perfect scale for the home cook! I originally bought this scale to help with my bread baking, but quickly learned it is great for most of my recipes. I like that I can use the scale to help me with my recipes in grams. I just purchased another scale to give away as a gift!
 Great scale! Very accurate and it's helpful to switch between measurements. Includes batteries so that you can use it right out of the box. Also neat is the "zero" button, which resets the scale. Meaning you can measure only what you add to your plate or mixing bowl.
 Easy to use, works as promised, great value!
 It works great, takes very little space and it looks very nice.  Highly recommend.
 Really love this scale! It's small, so it doesn't take up much space, yet can weigh large amount of food accurately.<br/><br/>The only con is that it somehow got switched to grams and milliliters and I can't figure out how to get it back to oz.
 I love it!!! best food scale by far With grams or ounces, ypu can put a container on top and weight ypur food from 0<br/>I was looking for the perfect food scale for a while and finally found the right one... So happy :)
 Does what it is described to do.<br/>Easy to use., intuitive.
 Design and performance are excellent.
 Great product with no issue
 great for measuring food to keep portion sizes down
 This thing is great! Lightweight and easy to store, but also stylish so it fits my other kitchen appliances.
 It is a. weighs in both lbs as well as ounces.Clean up is a breeze and is flat so stores easily.weight read our is very easy to see
 Very good digital scale for the price.
 Sometimes I'm not really sure the weight is being accurate. Sometimes when I'm measuring it will be at one weight and jump up .50.
 Great prduct to to count your daily onces. I love it !!
 I had it for two months at first and it was great, except for the led units wouldn’t work, but now I can’t get a right measurement because the scale keeps changing the weight of the food, it increases and decreases a lot
 Stopped working after two months.<br/><br/>Update: the company reached out and was very helpful with the issue I was having with the scale. I troubleshooted the problem and the company shipped me a new one once the problem continued.
 Reasonable price and very easy to use.
 I Use it all the time, it's great
 No complaints
 Works great!
 LIKE
 This scale is so off yes when dealing with food people will say what's a few more crumbs? I don't care I expect when I pay money for something for it to work correctly! Trying to fig out how to return this.
 Works great, but a little small.  You can use a regular bowl, but not a plate or large bowl to still see the display.  It turns off after a few seconds, but I like that when you add more ingredients, the light turns back on with the new weight.  I do not like that the lbs setting is in lbs and oz.  So you still have to calculate how many oz in a pound. That's too much calculating.  I want to see 2.5 lbs, not 2 lbs 8 oz.  But that's just me.
 Works great so far and is precise which is surprising considering it's only $8.  Even comes with batteries.
 batteries drain when it is not in use. You have to take the batteries out after each use if you want to save money on the batteries.
 Works well, easy to use.
 Excellent. I use this scale everyday &amp; it sits on my counter at all times.
 This was a great product! It was simple to use and it aesthetically pleasing. It was accurate for the things I measure: sugar, meats, flour, etc. The price was the reason I got this and I will buy it again since I have to replace it because someone else like it as much as I did and decided to steal it from me.
 My husband does a lot of specialty cooking.  Works really well.
 Sleek Design, simple to use, and easy to keep clean!  Item Shipped fast and was well packed. I am Delighted with the item and would recommend it to others. Great Price Too!
 This scale is smaller than I had imagine however it work great therefore I have no problem with it.
 I bought it for use of food tracking fresh ingredients like produce, but it turns out to be great for knowing how much postage you need for mail!
 It's exactly what I was hoping for and makes weighing things very easy.  I am dieting and need to know just how much I can have, and this meets my needs very nicely.
 I ordered this scale after reading the reviews. However after receiving the scale I could not get it to measure by 1 gram. I have never been able to get it to measure 1 gram. The scale was used 2 times. I put fresh batteries in to see if this would fix the problem. It did not. I would have returned it, however I was 1 day past the cutoff.
 Works but it stop showing what unit it is set at.
 This scale is compact and so easy to use.  Get accurate measurements for baking and cooking.
 Have used it 3 x's and it is no longer working.
 Quality product at reasonable price
 It's a good scale and comes with batteries so you don't have to get those, my only complaint is that it doesn't do two decimal places for grams.
 Works well...
 Great little scale for the price! Seems to be extremely accurate!
 Great scale.  Nice size, and is spot on.
 Nice scale. Easy to read. Looks good. No way to test accuracy. Would be better if it had a hold function so you could measure larger items.
 Small footprint, clean design.....does everything I need in the kitchen....and postage under 12lbs! Recommend it....
 Cheap and accurate. If you're cutting or dieting you need this in your kitchen.
 Brilliant scale, very easy to use and clean. The stainless finish matches a lot of my other appliances. Now, I'm gravitating toward my cookbooks that require measuring by weight instead of volume. Paramount for baking!
 The price and the quality are very good. The battery is a regular easy to buy/price.
 I bought this for meal prep and it is fairly accurate, and does the job for the price
 After couple of weeks the scale did no longer work. Changed the batteries but problem was not solved. Disappointed
 Works great!
 First, my first-world, 21st Century kinda complaints:<br/><br/>Unless I'm missing a setting to turn them on, this scale seems to display to the gram, but not to the 10th of a gram. That might be a silly complaint -- it might not be accurate enough to matter, after all -- but the scale it's replacing, about the same price (one of the folding / closing ones from AWS) did have that extra digit, and I liked that when weighing out coffee.<br/><br/>Another small grip: the backlighting is nice, but turns off too quickly.<br/><br/>On the other hand, things I like definitely make me glad to have this one:<br/>- monolithic; I don't like the hinged one, convenient as it would be for travel, as much as having this nice (and larger) flat surface<br/>- It uses AAA batteries. I wish it was AA instead, but Hey -- at least it's not stupid coin cells.<br/>- Looks very nice<br/><br/>Looks much nicer than the price would make you think.
 it was okay, but not what I expected.l
 I ordered this as a low cost replacement for an older pricey scale that stopped working. As promised, this product is easy to use, compact, and stores perfectly in counter drawer for easy access. I have had it for a few weeks and plan to order two more. Can't beat the price.
 Love it! Perfect for weighing out my food portions.
 It broke about a month after buying it
 cute and works well
 Sleek looking, bright display, tare weight function and automatic shutdown which saves the batteries.  We use ours to make equally sized hamburgers and meatballs. Works great.
 Really nice
 small and portable, out of the way when i need it.
 Great scale, works perfect! I was nervous about how well it would work, because it was such a great deal, I'm really happy that I took the chance.
 Bought in April, died this month. Prior to that loved the scale. Hubby and I doing lifestyle change and used quite a bit.
 Love it! Helps with portion control.
 Delivered in time and works good.
 10 second auto-off is much too quick, as is the 60 second shut off.
 Not very accurate, easy to clean
 Love it. My phone actually ordered this by mistake but I actually love it. Very easy to use and understand. I didn't even need to read the directions.
 Works great.Just what I needed.
 Very good, recommend !
 Awesome and attractive we use them in our lab.  Does not fall asleep too fast as others do.
 Really nice!
 Very pleased with this scale and it's very accurate. Priced right. Easy to use.
 easy to use. Much small than I expected.
 When I got the scale it didn't work so I replaced the batteries and it came on but the numbers don't work. After 29g it goes to 10g. Then when it's on 20g it's only have of the 2. I was so mad went to Walmart and bought one same price works great
 Not as good as the one i previously own. Kinda hard to read the number from the screen. But i think you get what you pay for.
 Works great
 Ordered what was described.
 Small, flat and like all the options (tare function and units conversion).
 It doesn't register small increments. ie 1 gram of dry yeast (1/4 tsp) I put a measuring cup on the scale, hit tare...the scale went zero as expected, but when I added 1/4 tsp of dry yeast, the scale still registered zero ??
 Works good
 Not as accurate as I thought it should be.
 I love this scale! Super easy to use, large enough surface for measuring things in containers, etc. Works great!
 Love it however unable to measure food on a plate.  Must use a bowl and then transfer the food to your plate.
 Perfect for my needs. Small, tidy and great for weighing various foods.
 love this scale
 A great, high-tech scale.  A little small but in the end works outstandingly and is very precise with weight.
 Perfect!
 The scale I saw in the picture had a silver colored bowl on top, and the reviews talked about how great the bowl was for measuring flour etc.<br/>Well, there was no bowl in my package...but the scale is great, and the price was good so I will give it 4 stars.
 I really like this scale, it's lightweight and compact, so its easy to store and to use everyday for stuff like coffee. The zeroing function is easy and overall I'm really glad I bought it, well worth the money.
 I recently tried a recipe that was written in ounces instead of cups.  I thought that I knew what I was doing, but, just in case, I bought this scale.  I was way off when it came to the flour.  What a difference this made.  Also, it is so small, that it is very easy to store.
 I love this scale perfect to take with me
 Perfect
 Very nice little scale, great value!
 This works nicely. Very accurate.
 Works great.  I use it to weigh out paint for my paintings. It wipes clean really easy and even if the paint dries it wipes off easily. Love it.
 Scale works well, only issue is size of plate on scale.<br/>Its hard to read the weight. I usually use a smaller plate<br/>to measure first, then I transfer the food to a regular size<br/>plate.
 Can't be happier with the purchase. Works as expected and high quality.
 As expected. Easy to use.
 Does the job and no frills, so it is easy to use. Lightweight which is also good for traveling.
 Perfect...I love this scale. It does just exactly what I wanted it to. Very accurate and sleek looking.. I am dieting and needed a scale in order to get accurate weights on food items. After receiving this scale I realized how inaccurate my old kitchen scale was. Definitely a five star rating from me!!!
 I use this scale to weigh my hamster for his health checks, works well!
 Nice scale with a very slim profile. I hardly notice it tucked away in my cabinet when I don't need it. I like that the display lights up, but if you have anything except a small bowl on it, it can be very difficult to read the display since it gets covered so easily.<br/><br/>Overall, the scale seems accurate to roughly a gram, but isn't great at measuring things under ~5 grams, which is a common problem with scales like this. The construction is solid and the buttons are easy enough to press. I like the multiple options for units, but I'm not quite sure why they included a mL option since it only works with water. Any oils or liquids with a different density (like alcohol or fatty milk) will be slightly off. If I were making this purchase again, I would probably go with something that has either a pull-out display or a raised measuring surface so that its easy to read when pouring into a large bowl for baking. Other than that, it works exactly as advertised.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Accurate and repeatable weight measurements<br/>- Display is super easy to read<br/>- Slim profile<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- Can't weight on a plate or large bowl<br/>- mL option is misleading
 Works as expected - and looks nice too.
 This scale is so light but so accurate. It is so easy to store away. I highly recommend it
 The scale seems fairly accurate. The design is great and the LCD screen clear. I love the power saving features.
 works as advertised
 Good product...you won't be sorry with your purchase.
 Very accurate.
 Broke after less than a week of regular kitchen use. It looks like they did a good job sealing the top, but in actuality a little moisture did it in immediately.
 I couldn't believe what a wonderful deal this was! I bought it in the hopes that it was gonna be just for baking, measuring spices, that kind of thing . And then I checked it out and man on man! It is so fantastic it has all the bells and whistles you can do all the measuring just exactly precise! It's beautiful! It looks like it's an expensive piece of equipment when it's sitting on your counter ! It's just, it's a fantastic tool for baking, cooking, ANY KIND OF MEASURING! I love it, it's just wonderful! There's just not enough to be said about it, it's really wonderful! I really am going to find a lot of uses for it I'm so happy I bought it and the price is just unbelievable for this indispensable tool! There's nothing comparable on the market for this price, and this well made I don't think . I would definitely recommend this to anybody and I would buy it for a gift in a second for anybody that I know that cooks! Just a fantastic deal! Buy it buy it buy it !
 I really like that it shows ounces and not decimal parts of a pound.  Have used it a couple of times and it has done everything that I could want in a kitchen scale.
 Works good!
 I like design and material.
 We are perfectly happy with this purchase. Just what we expected!
 nice and easy to use.
 Just opened the scale. I weighed the same product over and over and it had a different weight each time.
 So easy to use. I use plastic wrap to cover to weigh "messy" foods. Great quality for the price
 not very consistent. Put a nickel on the scale and it weighs 5 grams. Put the same nickel on the scale again and it weighs 6 grams. Do it again and it weighs 4 grams. Wouldn't mind if it was inaccurate, but it should at least be consistent
 This scale broke less than 2 months after I bought it; I can't get rid of the error message.
 good product. small, so it is east to tuck away. seems accurate. great price. no complaints
 This product is great for the price. As described, it is not very large so we just use a bowl on top to weigh out larger items. Works perfectly!
 perfect
 Did everything is better with you nothing spectacular but nothing bad either just a scale
 Sleek, well made, and easy to use.
 batteries were dead upon arrival.
 Nice and compact,matte function works perfectly, option of US or metric
 Takes a little time to figure it out, but good for the money and very sleek !
 we use this everyday in the kitchen and love it!
 Have had this for about a year and it's still working great.  No complaints
 I just received the unit and it is awesome. I hope it will last.
 I really like the design of this scale. It's really easy to wipe off and it looks good on the counter. I recommend this for your meal prep
 My fiancee and I have recently begun a ketogenic diet in preparation for our wedding, so in order to make the most of it we have had to be quite meticulous with calories,  macros,  etc.  Once you get used to measuring all of your food out it makes a HUGE difference in your results.  I have lost at least ten pounds in one month on the diet, some due to the fact I wouldnt have random snacks just because I didn't want to have to measure and log them ;)  this companied with the my fitness pal app, and we can't help but stick to the plan!<br/>This digital scale is way easier to use and read than a true scale and is pretty accurate,  give or take a few grams. And the flat design is very convenient,  we did have to buy some reusable plastic dishes to measure, but we also just lay down wax paper to keep from having to clean it up repeatedly.<br/>Only draw black is it could be a little bigger and hold a little more weight, but I'll still give it a 5 star!
 love it
 great buy
 Wish it was somewhat bigger to fit plates and such on.
 It's a compact scale. Works great.
 didn't take long and it lost calibration
 So far very happy with it. I like the light up display and that it keeps the tear between weighing the same containers.
 I would have loved this scale, and I've used it on and off now for a little over a year, but the backlight has never worked. Almost perfect, but I find i have to use my phone's flashlight to see the mode it's on.
 Great item easy to use, highly recommend
 It even looks good
 works great would buy another
 Very easy to use and accurate
 Works great and looks great. Matches high end kitchen finishes. Seems very accurate.
 Nice price for a well-performing scale!  I use it in my kitchen frequently.
 Works great! Overall no issues with it
 Nice looking.  Doesn't take up much space on counter.  Accurate.
 Very great product. A little smaller than I had imagined, but fits things on there. I use it for food and for yarn. Great packaging and great price!
 Simply Is perfect
 Great scale. Very accurate. Small enough to keep on the counter or hide in a cabinet. This scale is super user friendly.
 I put a piece of broccoli on the scale and it weighed 70 grams. I tried to weigh a green bean and it said the same thing. I was looking foward to this too smh.
 Works for me.
 Handy, easy to use &amp; durable
 Small and correct all the time
 Easy to use, works great.  Came in a timely manner as advertised.
 Cheap, but works well. Easy enough to zero out with a bowl on it, does negative count too. Worth the money and small enough to tuck away when not in use.
 Excellent scale and accurate for every day use
 Love how light and compact the scale is, I use to measure my food portions. easy to store away also.
 I didn't check the size, but small than expected.
 I started the keto lifestyle and needed a food scale to begin measuring my food. This one is PERFECT! It's small, easy to use, easy to clean. I have not been disappointed with this food scale at all!
 Works well
 Small scale but works great.
 The scale worked fine for a few months, but now the weight reading on the display fluctuates wildly and will not tare.
 This scale was everything that was promised. Appears well made and compact.
 A good scale
 Came defective, off by one gram every time you measure.
 Works Great and was a great price!
 I love this scale. It has a backlight, a tare button, and in measures in grams ounces and lbs. Great scale especially for the price!!! My favorite thing  has to be that when you press the buttons you do have to click. Other scales I had where touch buttons and I just hated it. Great find
 works well
 Fiance loves it, consistent measurements and easy to clean.
 Excelente pesa. Muy útil y estéticamente muy bonita.
 Very cute. Love it!
 Opened my package and there was a note waiting for me. Will have to order a new one... lol what on earth??
 Holy no. This thing eats batteries like nobody’s business. We use rechargeables and have to recharge every week. I use the scale 2 times a day to weigh dog food.
 It doesn't measure anything. The light turns on and the numbers show 0. Not sure if the product is broken but it has never worked since I've had it
 Love this scale! I use it for weighing packages and it is very handy because of its different measurements such as pounds or ounces.
 I have been impressed with how functional this scale has been for me. I mainly use this for measuring my hop measurements for my boil, and it has performed and exceeded my expectations of what I expected from this scale. I can re-tare with almost any vessel and still get the exact measurement I need for my homebrew recipe.
 Arrived on time and solid packaging. Simple to use and easy peasy to switch to ounces, millileters, pounds, or grams. I like it!
 Worked great for about a month and a half, then it broke suddenly. It still turns on, but won't register any weight.
 Nice product.
 very good
 Light weight and good looking.
 Good quality, but it is not very accurate with less than 2g.
 Very small and cute, I needed it to be used for mailing and figuring out the weight of items. As for the battery usage, I'm not sure of yet, but I also bought another pack of triple A batteries just in case.
 Have to be weighing it multiple times, and every time I get different weight
 right price and easy to use<br/>Helps with carb and calorie counting
 Perfect!
 Very easy to use and perfect for what I needed!
 When I purchased your scale I didn't know anything about the brand. I find it functions well it's easy to clean and not a chore to read. Accuracy is a must and I find the scale to be accurate for its size. I needed something small enough take with me when I travel.
 Works great, but dont care for the digital screen.  It can be more difficult to read than its competition.
 Nice little scale. Easy to use and store
 Fair price and fast delivery by Etekcity.
 Love this scale. Easy to use and great price!!
 Great scale.  Saves us a ton of money by avoiding over portioning too! Thanks!
 This was terrible.  I sat food on the scale, it wouldn’t pick up the weight.  Kept having to take off and out back on.  Who knows if it was finally accurate!
 Great, lightweight scale that is easy to travel with. Very simple functions to use. Scale is accurate when re-measuring weight. The only downfall is, the scale reading is influenced if pressure is applied on the countertop around it (i.e. if I am leaning on the counter top), and will give me a different reading.
 Works<br/> perfectly nice size easy to use beautiful price.
 The first scale I got broke, but it was replaced quickly! Since then it has been pretty good, slow as times.
 Good quality and reliable
 Simple no nonsense scale. works well for making additions to soap making.
 Great product. Small enough to convienetly store. Seems to be accurate.
 It's so easy to operate! Slim stainless steel design looks good laying out on the kitchen counter. Definitely a good purchase!
 POOR QUALITY
 This scale is very small and it is completely incapable of measuring units under about 3 grams. I'm honestly not even sure I trust its measuring capabilities at all.
 I like this scale due to the fact it is light weight and small. It is also very accurate and easy to use.
 Easy to use, I’m love it so much 👍🏻
 I am very happy with the scale.. I thought it would be too small, but it is working nice .  My large mixing bowl sits on the scale fine for me to weight each ingredient
 Nice little scale. The reading fluctuates a little on the tenths side of the decimal.
 so far so good
 good items, I like it.
 I need returning item I like where I can send it back
 Works great!
 Small, thin, and compact but does the job. Like that it measures in grams, ounces, and pounds.
 Works as advertised
 Never worked properly and we unfortunately did not have the time to return it before our return window closed. Now we are stuck with a useless piece of junk
 Easy to use easy to clean. Appears accurate. Price was excellent. Highly recommend
 Small and light. It arrived in great condition and functional.
 It's very accurate and has helped me immensely  with portion  control.
 So easy to use and seems totally accurate. My first kitchen/food scale but another tool in my arsenal in this weight loss battle. Highly recommend.
 Man, I love this thing. Only wish it wouldn't shut off by itself to save batteries. I have to keep switching it on again and again.
 good
 works great
 Does not take a lot of room up on my counter. Perfect size, works well.
 Beautiful design!
 Simple, and accurate enough to have helped me lose 15 pounds.
 I had the thing for one night, wiped it off with a paper towel and it stopped working.  Disappointing!
 Used once. Worked fine. Next day wouldn’t turn on. Tried multiple sets of batteries. Nothing. Thrown away. Product sucks
 I use it to track my macronutrients and it works very well
 Perfect!
 Great scale so far. Clean up has been easy.  Crevices don't seem to be an issue, trapping small bits of food.
 Great scale at a great price. Easy to use and very accurate
 Not very good.  Tried to weigh 1-2 grams and it read 0 on the scale.
 my son uses it a lot and so far it has been working perfectly :)
 NICE COMPACT SCALE
 Very good
 EDIT: Etekcity took great care of me, they reached out and sent me another scale as a replacement. It works great, and is slim enough to fit pretty much anywhere in the kitchen. Thanks!
 After a month star to jaming all the time
 Works great, so far no issues.
 Doesn't work.
 Very simple to use.  I love the tare weight function.  It was very useful when I needed to reset the container weight as each ingredient was added.
 OK
 Very easy to use.
 It basically stopped working within a month or two of purchase. Save you money for something higher quality than this.
 It won't weigh less then  5 grams
 Worked great to count my calories for the bulking season!
 I bought this to weigh my guinea pigs and it's great so far. It's been easy to ise
 This scale has good days and bad days. My experience with it:<br/>- Extremely sensitive. For example, if there is something touching the side of it (like a water bottle, fork, etc.) it will produce an incorrect reading. This detail can often be more problematic than it seems.<br/>- Does not detect weights under 3 grams.<br/>- The weight shown on the screen will turn off very quickly if you don't fiddle with it.<br/><br/>It's useable but unfortunately can't rely on this for very exact measurements. It does seem to be one of the more travel-friendly scales and if you're not into measurements that are too exact I think it's fine!
 delivered immediately,
 Very good all as expected
 Love the light weight and trim size.  Accurate measurement is a must feature.  Quick shipping, email from their customer service department to make sure I was pleased.
 Good
 very good
 Perfect!
 Great scale. I recommend it.
 Love this thing!
 Absolutely love this scale! It's compact, easy to use, and has 4 different units of measurement. If you're looking for a sleek, inexpensive, simple food scale, do not pass this up.
 This does exactly what I need. Great product for the price.
 I love this scale.  Works well!!
 It works very well. Different units and tare are specially useful in the kitchen.
 Worst scale ever. Auto shut off, short time on so you better hurry up and weigh your item. Poor customer service, they could care less if you like their scale. DO NOT BUY
 Seems to weigh accurately, doesn't take up much space and the tare function is easy to use.
 Works just as described
 It was a little smaller than I thought it would be (my fault for not reading the measurements), but it works perfectly for my needs.  I'd definitely recommend it.
 Keep shopping for something else.
 Easy to use and accurate
 I've been using a manual scale for years, but I will never use it again for weighing my foods for portion control. This is so easy to use and changes quickly from ounces to grams. Small and compact. I highly recommend.
 Scale was garbage. Save your money. Display stopped working after a couple weeks of use. The back light lit up but displayed nothing.
 This scale is great. Easy to change between ounces and grams.
 Buena calidad
 Total game changer in my kitchen and in my life. Down 50 pounds with the help of this bad boy. One complaint is that it pretty obvious if you've got something spilt on it, but you should be cleaning it anyways.
 This scale worked great.... FOR ONLY 2 DAYS. I weighed some fresh cut meat on it, cleaned it off, turned it off and went to use it on day 3 and it wouldn't turn on. I replaced the batteries and get some sort of error on the screen and it no longer works.
 Works great. Thank you.
 Love it! If you need a scale, this is the one to get!!!
 Very sensitive, functions well so far. Construction is a little suspect, battery door doesn't really fit the unit, but otherwise pretty good and has a cool form to it.
 Small and easy to store.
 This is the best kitchen scale. Huge plus that it’s stainless steel.
 Space saver and great measuring tool
 Stopped working properly after just over 4 weeks of use. The screen turns on then goes blank after about 10 seconds.
 Perfect scale for what I needed. Use it to cut and measure out soap and ingredients for laundry detergent. Turns off automatically if you forget to. Quality of material for face is super easy to clean
 Perfect
 Good over all ,only thing is that it dose not work under 5 grams
 Nice double digit accuracy (100ths).
 I really like the scale. I use it everyday!!!
 I put a nickel on and it measured 5 grams every time. Made some awesome brioches with this scale!
 Works great!!
 Works great!!
 Love the modern design.  Sleek and ultra-thin.  Accurate, so how could you not like it.
 This works so well.  I just wish it was a little smaller.  It is convenient and measures to the hundredth %.  It also works with grams etc too.
 I purchased this scale specifically because I bake everything we eat and we own an Etekcity bath scale that we love. The reviews were great and I wanted a scale that was extremely accurate for weighing flour and dough. Up until today I had been pleased with the scale's performance but when used repeatedly to weigh dough (making rolls and buns) for a second rise the scale wouldn't maintain it's tare zero calibration. Multiple times today the scale was off. I had to stop and recalibrate to zero and then zero tare to resume my dough weighing. This was frustrating. From the reviews I expected far more than this scale was able to deliver. I don't know if I have a lemon or if this is a flaw in the manufacturing of this scale. I haven't seen this problem when simply weighing flour for baking so I'm assuming the process of adding and removing dough somehow unbalances the calibration. Sad I really wanted to like this scale.<br/><br/>3/11/2019 The seller sent a replacement. An upgraded replacement. My new scale does everything I wanted it to do. What is most surprising is the customer service of this seller. You don't see it very often any more. They went above and beyond to ensure my satisfaction. I upgraded my rating to five stars. Love the new scale and this seller.
 Excellent, light, compact, and measures to the nearest gram. Helps with portion control.
 Only had it less than 6months before the screen stopped working. Very disappointing
 Works fine and nice quality!
 My wife loves it and it sure beats measuring the old way. So accurate for consistent baking.
 Perfect little kitchen scale does it's job and then some. Very User Friendly!!
 I was looking for a scale with multiple measures for a while and finally I found it ..It great you can change the unit really easy and the plus it's that's really small so you can storage any were ..why I only put 4 stars it's because if you have light just on top of you it a bit hard to read the numbers.
 Not as good as my old one.
 Good
 I was sceptical due to such good price, but it's on point!
 This scale has helped me control my portions and helps with making recipes more accurately than I was able to before.  Thanks for a great product!
 Great scale works well, small in size and clair in features, easy to store anywhere .. Good experience with the seller .. Thank you
 Looks very good on my table
 Nice looking, easy to use.
 works great and came fast! no problems here
 Nice , simple.
 Clicky buttons, takes too long to start. Annoying to zero. Works though
 Great
 Excellent
 Good product does exactly what it is supposed to.
 It arrived in perfect condition.  I read the instructions and it works great.  I like how simple it is.  I use the tare function all the time.
 works well
 Great value for $8. Helped us win third place in pinewood derby for speed.
 What a deal!!! It is perfect for kitchen/meal prep purposes.
 works well and it's everything that I wanted.
 Awesome! Works as intended and easy to use.
 Awesome
 I love it!!!! The one I had before finally quit and I would recommend this one to anyone!!!
 LOVE IT! Works extremely well.
 Very thin, very portable. My wife uses this everyday and haven't had any problems whatsoever.
 Good
 Great scale! Very easy to use. It is very slim and easy to store.
 it works great and it’s easy to clean. Very satisfied purchase
 Stopped working with little use, new batteries didn't help!
 Great scale for $13 dollars. Seems to weigh items correctly. The quality of the finish is so-so. Mine arrived with minor imperfections. If you look closely at the picture it has minor rust/scratches by where it says UNIT and towards the top center. For my needs, it works perfectly.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/>It's been about 3 weeks since I got it.  THE SMALLEST AMOUNT THIS SCALE CAN WEIGHT IS 3g. It's completely useless for my purposes.  The vendor is aware of this issue and the scales have this issue.
 Works great--simple. Gives me the info I  need. Eas to store and keep handy.
 This thing is tiny, but it does work for it's intended purpose
 Just as described. Perfect.
 Super easy to use, accurate and easy to travel with:) meal prep made easy
 Overall, good scale: works as intended. Unfortunately, display lit died after a year.
 Worked great for 11 months and crashed today.
 Bought to use with Chemex, this scale is really user friendly. It's sleek; able to be tucked away in a drawer/cupboard or just as is on the counter.<br/>Would def recommend.
 Sleek design, so easy to clean (important for me because I'm weighing meat and fish mainly).
 works great
 Really like the scale but the only gripe I have is that when I have a lot to weigh and I get caught up in doing other things, it shuts off and I lose the weight
 Its fast, efficient and wonderful.  I used it for postage weight and for food.  It's so easy to read and the numbers are large enough to see!!
 Good
 Easy to use - works great. Works Consistently.
 Been using a week so far, pretty good quality for the price. The fact that you can "zero" out the scale with an empty dish on it is great.
 Great scale! Works great for measuring my beef jerky, very easy to use!
 Cheap looking item that arrived looking used, scratched and smudged.
 Great Price! Small. Works fine.
 very good
 Works great! Love the tare function and multiple weighing options.
 Works perfectly. Would like to see a dedicated ON/OFF switch for times when you need a little more time to gather ingredients between weighing items since the scale will auto-shutoff after some time of inactivity (to save battery).
 SLEEK, LIGHT WEIGHT SMALL AND ACCURATE MEASURING!<br/><br/>WHAT MORE CAN I ASK FOR!
 Very nice product and a great price.
 I've had this scale for several months and don't use it very often, only every couple of weeks, each time I go to use it the batteries are drained and have to be replaced, not very convenient or cost effective.
 Feels quality and like it will last a long time. Sometimes it tips with heavy items on it that are not centered.
 Awesome scale at a great price! I love mine and it's so light and easy to store.
 UPDATE: The scale I got was damaged but Etekcity made it right the very next day. The replacement scale looks great, works flawlessly, and is a real pleasure to use in the kitchen. Customer service was the best I've ever encountered.
 Works great. Great price
 perfect to measure your portions
 Great scale for a great price....
 Really easy to use, clear display and weighs accurately!
 it weighs things well
 We like it.
 good
 Not impressed. This scale doesn't register super tiny (under 5 grams or so) of food as well as i'd like. I feel it's pretty inaccurate which defeated the purpose of weighing out your portions.
 Perfect, great product, as advertised.
 I am very impressed with the scale. It is precisely what I wanted and does the job 100%. Thanks.
 This is one of the best kitchen utility purchases I've made in a long time.  The product is perfect for its purposes.  It's beautifully designed and so reasonably priced.  I'm definitely a fan.
 Very clear and bright display! Looks great in the kitchen as well
 It must work well, because I haven't heard my wife compliant. And complaint she will
 Purchased as a gift for my daughter.  She loves the scale.  Compact so doesn't take up too much counter space.  Uses easy to find batteries and does a great job.
 worked great for a few weeks and not it starts randomly adding weight to itself, bought it to replace my old one that lasted me a few years and now i'm replacing this one after only a months use unfortunately.
 Great for counting calories
 Works just like it should! Good find! Highly recommend!
 Use daily. Have had it for several months and have not had to replace battery. Very instrumental in helping to lose thirty pounds over last six months.
 Great little scale, easy to store and easy to calibrate. The display is short-lived -about 20 seconds- but if you have everything ready it isn't a problem at all.
 🤩🤩🤩🤩
 Excellent scale! Clear display and easily switched between pounds/ounces and grams. Nice ability to weigh fluid ounces of water and milk.
 Great scale and easy to use!
 This scale does not work. I've tried using it a couple times and it does not weigh properly. You place something on it and it still says 0.
 Awesome fast
 Works and looks good
 Look nice, useful, recommended!
 works great and not bulky at all
 Love this scale;  compact, accurate and looks pretty cool, too!
 Love it , so nice so easy to use :-)
 This is a good food scale overall. I liked that it was kinda small not too big, its silverness, its accurate(so far).. I compared it with my old one( weight watcher brand) and i got the same numbers. What i dont like that its just too sensitive and light, i feel if it falls down it'd get broken
 I love this scale, I use it all the time. Mainly I use it to weigh yarn and knitted items to calculate yardage, but I have also used it to calculate postage and occasionally for cooking/baking. The controls are easy and simple to operate, and the batteries seem to be lasting a long time.<br/><br/>The only issue I've had is that it doesn't seem to be able to measure things under 2oz.
 Great product and excellent service
 I use this all the time when weighing envelopes for mailing.  Haven't had a problem with it being inaccurate yet.
 What I expected...
 Actcurate and stylish.
 Looks nice and worked well while it lasted. Bought it on May 5th and on June 5th it was completely dead. I tried replacing the batteries with known good ones but made no difference.
 Works great
 Works like a charm. Perfect compact size for the kitchen.
 Bought this scale for my golf club building hobby. Not the most usual use, but it is fantastic! Easy to use and accurate as can be! Definitely recommended.
 power is delaying in on and off, appreciate any help
 Dont take up too much room! Works great
 I really like this scale. It is real easy to read and registers quickly and accurately.
 Great product.
 This scale is inaccurate. Sometimes it's off measurement by three grams. I should have returned it.
 Good kitchen scale
 Excellent product
 good
 works great
 This is a very handy little food scale!
 Very light weight. Very touchy.
 Works perfect!
 This is such a wonderful scale. Im trying to start a diet and this is such a perfect one for me. It is small but perfect size in my opinion. Looks like it costs 80 dollars!!
 This is exactly the scale that I wanted: compact, light weight, and easy to use and switch between units and set to zero. I would recommend this item for any kitchen, especially the one as compact as mine ;)
 works well no problem<br/>good for the price!<br/>nice and small easy to use!
 Saves me lots of time and nerves :) love it
 Not quite as accurate as I hoped.
 The unit i got stopped working the minute I put batteries in.<br/>I gave two stars because the customer service was unbeleivable and I got refunded on the spot no questions asked.
 Nice, easy to clean, both my wife and I are using there scales at home and at work
 Great!
 I use this allday everyday. Gooooood stuff
 This thing is great! I've been wanting one for years, and just never wanted to drop the money. We ceased the sale price, and I'm so glad we did. I'd buy it again even if it wasn't on sale. Easy to use, accurate, and it looks great!!
 Perfect  for measuring ingredients for baking
 Nice design.<br/>No 1/10 grm increments.
 Works well!  Great for Pinewood Derby
 Very nice. Easy to use. Numbers are easy to read, even with Old Eyes. I really like the minimalist design.<br/>This review is not influenced by their offer to pay me (with product) for a review, which I did not sign up for
 Lightweight, takes up almost no room on the counter.  Looks great with my stainless steel appliances.  Very happy with this purchase.  A great product for the price!
 Broke after 40 days screen just displays all 8s<br/>Made of cheap plastic and poor quality, buy a different kitchen scale.
 durable precise scales
 This is a great scale. Very accurate for measuring food. The only thing is when measuring nuts and seeds it doesn't register small changes in weight immediately.
 This scale works great plus it looks good sitting out on my counter. It's exactly what I needed to keep track of my food consumption. Thanks
 Love it so much I bought 2--one for home and one for work
 Good scale at a decent  price.  This is easy to use.
 Love it. Works very well. Love how small and thin it is. Very easy to store.
 Easy to use scale easy to clean. Low profile great value
 Not accurate at all. You get one number the first time you weigh the item/food and another the second time. DO NOT BUY.
 This is a great scale for the price.  I especially like the Tare function, which allows you to exclude the weight of the container when weighing.
 thanks
 Item arrived quickly and works great.
 too good so far
 very good, I think it's perfect
 clean looking and easy to use......
 Doesn’t work<br/>Have to replace batteries every few weeks
 Been using it in the kitchen and for ebay!  It has been invaluable and easy to use.
 Works as promised. Tare feature is worth the extra dollars. It's small and takes little space in the kitchen. Nice.
 Wonderful scale.  Accurate.  Just what we needed.
 Nice scale for the money! I use it for my weekly food prep. It’s very accurate!!! Good buy!
 Great scale for the price! Although, the scale did stop working on me out of nowhere, Etekcity immediately replaced it with a new one.
 La báscula es sencilla de usar, llegó en el tiempo acordado y en perfectas condiciones
 I like it for functionality and price. Previously I owned much more expensive Kenwood Kitchen Scales, these scales a little worse because of little lesser screen and surface, but they are 7 times cheaper. Precision and functionality are the same.
 I didn't need this scale, but I do love it
 Love everything about this scale, perfect
 Weight is not accurate. Weighed several times from this scale to a nondigital scale and is not at all the same. 50 pound difference
 This is an awesome product. Great price and quality. Very easy to use and very accurate.  I will definitely purchase more from this company.
 I find when I weigh something if I cut a piece off of it the individual weight of each piece doesn't add up to the original weight
 Great value.  Was scepticel for the price, would recommend
 I fell in love with this the second I opened the package. It is so cute and small, but modern and sleek. It does it's job
 Perfect thing for my snakes, just wish it wasn't so tiny.
 Great value. Easy to use. My one argument would be that it's really small and s plate covers p the display.
 I really like this scale. The size is convienent to keep in my utensil drawer.
 Works well in the kitchen and quite accurate. I like that it is so easy to clean.
 awesome product. i can weight my food in perfect portions
 Display is a little hard to read due to the color, otherwise awesome!
 Works great! I got it for my small reptiles and works perfect.
 Great product and works flawlessly. Finish is classy and display is easy to read. Highly recommend.
 Lightweight &amp; sturdy, good product to add to the kitchen. Would recommend to others looking for a affordable kitchen scale for cooking.
 No special battery needed.
 It doesn’t deserve 1 star !! It is not accurate and can’t measure small quantities .. if you put nuts piece by piece, the scale will show 0g always.
 precise and compact
 It's light weight, fits in small space, easy to use and wipe clean, is accurate and I love it!
 Very cute little scale.<br/>Glad it has 2 ways of measurement - pounds and kg! It's very useful.
 I bought this scale for mailing packages out of my home. I needed to figure out the postage. It was a good price and was exactly what I needed.
 It’s working really well. Looks nice, very thin, and sleek.
 It's so awesome!<br/>Changes units of weight with the touch of a button and is very accurate!!
 Absolutely adore this little gadget. Comes in handy while measuring my food! Clean up is trouble free!
 Haven’t had any problems.  Works great
 Perfect and portable!
 THis is the best kitchen scale I've bought so far! Seems very accurate and easy to use!
 Very cool design and very good built quality
 Very easy to operate!
 Love the light up screen and the switching unit feature. Makes it easy to read.
 Not very accurate
 Adequate
 I’ve replaced the batteries ten times and each time they die within a day even tho the machine was never turned out. Haven’t been able to use
 Very simple to use. Good product.
 This is a top notch food scale that has helped me accurately weigh my food in order to better track my calories. It is modern, small and most important accurate in a number of different units of measure. I can highly recommend this product.
 Easy to operate. Have not had any issues.
 Not accurate and is cheaply made.
 good
 Great scale, was just what I wanted
 Excellent scale, nice big numbers make it easy to see,
 good deal
 Works exactly as described. The scale is small so fits anywhere. However it is small so larger plates, bowls, etc cover the display.
 Really worth its money. Cheap and effective.
 thank you so much love it!
 I use this to measure my coffee in the morning. It's the best. My coffee is no longer discusting. And my GF is a long baby.
 Works great and as described. The grams function are not super precise to the individual grams but still works great.
 It didn’t weigh grams of leafy greens.. only worked on heavier items.
 I'm a first time user and buyer of a food scale and this product made it simple to start measuring my food portions.
 Works like a charm! Easy to store
 This scale seemed too good to be true but it lives to my expectations without costing much or taking up much space.  It is super simple to use without complicated instructions, it is accurate to fractions of ounces, has a tare function, and even comes with the batteries.  Perfect.
 This broke one day after return window closed so I dont know what to do with my broken scale now(
 Very nice basic and easy to operate scale. No frills, but it has all the desirable basic features including a tare button and the ability to switch untis of measurement. Works great.
 Easy to use and tare, fast, small &amp; compact for storage.
 I love this scale! It's simple to use; you can easily change from oz to ml to g. Its slim, lightweight, with a light up digital screen.
 I was a little nervous that it wouldn't work well because it was so reasonably priced. What a huge surprise!  It is awesome!  I love that it is so sensitive that it calculates to what seems to be the .0000000001 ounce😄  It looks great on my counter too. Very chic.
 small，smart
 LOVE how easy this scale is to use and all of the different measurements... the fact I can tare it to 0.00 with one button push is awesome.
 Nice, compact, well-priced​ scale.  Haven't used it enough to give it 5 stars, but I'm sure it will so rate when I do.
 I have been using this scale for almost a week now, it is simple to use with any size container to hold the food items, quickly re calibrates to ZERO prior to weighing your food items.  Love it!!!
 Works perfect and is easy to change what you want to weigh
 Very cheap. I only used this a handful of times. It is now dead. very cheap and not easy to use.
 Very accurate and easy to use. Great design!! Affordable!!
 Small &amp; accurate.
 easy to use
 So so because it will not measure light items well
 works great
 I love the compactness and versatility of this scale.
 Very happy with this purchase.
 Great product.
 Compact, light and very useful!
 The Etekcity kitchen scale is very well made.  I have used it in a couple of recipes and it performed better than expected.  I am going to buy more for Christmas presents.
 Love it and it's so easy to use! I was happy it came with batteries
 I have been pursuing fitness goals for about 5 years, whether those have been to get stronger, add more mass, or cut down on body fat to lean out.  I never really tracked my food I just would eat more when trying to get bigger and less when cutting.  This plan had me spinning my wheels most of the time not making progress.  Along with smarter dieting and cardio, the Etekicity scale has allowed me to drop 10 lbs in about a month and dip into the 10% body fat range.<br/><br/>This product honestly makes eating healthy extremely simple and let's you know without a doubt how many calories and macros you are eating when preparing your meals.  All of its functions work great and the whole surface area of the scale is sensitive when weighing.  If you are in the market to take your fitness goals to the next level I think this product is a must, no more guessing or "just eating less". With the Etekicity scale you know exactly how many calories you are eating simply by weighing out a serving size as shown on the nutrition facts of all foods.
 Very compact and thin. I appreciate that you can set the scale to measure in 4 different ways ▬ pounds and ounces, all in ounces, grams or in milliletres.
 Measures accurately. Due note that it doesnt seem to measure to 25. It goes to 24 or 28.
 Started erroring out within two weeks, completely broke within three weeks.
 I have been using this scale to measure meats, works great. I have never had any problems.
 Easy to use scale.
 great
 I purchased this scale six months ago, but didn't want to review it until I had a chance to really test it. I have, and I love it. It's everything that was<br/>advertised. Sturdy, accurate and easy to use.
 I bought this product and used it.  It meets expectations.  It does exactly what I want it to do -- converts my ingredients into grams, liters, ounces and pounds, automatically subtracting the weight of the container.  It is small and nicely designed. Price is right.
 Great scale but I would next time I would buy on a little larger.
 I enjoy using this scale very much!
 Great scale. I love the fluid ounces feature great for baking.
 Works as it should. Very portable.
 10$ Worth the price.
 Great kitchen scale. Easy to use and very accurate. Love it that you can put a plate/bowl/container on the scale and reset the weight to zero and then add food getting an accurate measure of weight.
 works as advertised
 Weighs food.
 I like that it's easy to use and easy to store
 This scale lasted less than 2 years. It will no longer turn on.
 Scale is very light weight, compact and I'm very happy with the way it looks. I would give this 5 stars, but the batteries that it came with were dead.
 Purchased this scale about 10 months ago and now the numbers jump around when weighing things. I guess for $11 you get what you pay for. Will be buying a different scale.
 Works well to add exact amounts of water while making pour-over coffee
 I am used to using laboratory scales such as Mettler etc.  This is certainly not in that class but Its close enough for Jazz.
 It is very inaccurate one part of the scale measured differently then the other was such a shame because it's a really cute scale
 Small, light, and accurately weighs foods.  I'd recommend this product.
 Very happy with this product! It's accurate enough, the design is really nice, and the display is very bright and clear which makes it really easy to read. And it comes with batteries included which is nice! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone
 Arrived with broken gripper on bottom, so sent back, but looks like it would be nice otherwise.
 I love using this digital scale. Very light and I use it almost on a daily basis since I have begum my diet.
 Well priced
 great addition to my kitchen
 good price and size
 I am so happy I choose this model!!  It is easy to set up and use, and I use it every day!!!
 Smaller than I thought, but loved it!
 great product
 I like the looks, the compactness and ease of functionality. It replaces a two # spring scale I was using so I like it alot.
 Works great when meal prep is concern.
 The higher precision readout is my favorite feature.
 Works well.
 Please note that this is not for weights over a pound or so. But great for smaller weights one measures in the kitchen.
 Great!  Small and compact.
 The product is perfect for the money and is just what I needed. It is small in size, light weight, easy to clean and the battery life is fantastic. I have used it every meal prep day (twice a week) and is the best value for the price. I would definitely recommend this scale to others.
 It does what it's supposed to
 very practical, easy to use and takes no room
 Was great while it lasted, but here we are four months later and the backlight has already broken. Makes it very difficult to read. Maybe spend a little more for one that will hold up.
 it came with some scratches .
 ok
 Great product. Using it in my ceramic studio to measure dry ingredients for ceramic glazes. Easy to keep clean and extremely accurate.
 Works well, fast shipping. What more could you want?
 Great product! Works just as promised and very easy to use! Slim, low profile design looks good on the counter too! I bought this when I began carb-cycling- to measure out exactly how many ounces of food.
 Worked great. Slim and perfect size for storage. Used it to measure my portion for meal prep.
 We sent it back because one of the LED lights (fl.oz) did not light up when we scrolled through the unit options.
 Love this scale!
 Works great!
 Simple and easy to use. Perfect for what I need it for.
 I am not sure if it is just mine but I have had to change the batteries in my kitchen scale several times within the last month. Even though I make sure the scale is "off," it still seems to pull power from the batteries. Now, I just take the batteries out until I need to use it again...annoying but I do like how easy this scale is to operate.<br/><br/>UPDATE 08/22/2017 - The seller reached out to me to solve my issue with this scale. I have not had any additional problems with the replacement scale and cannot wait to continue using such a compact, easy to read, digital food scale for my food prepping. Kudos to this seller for taking the time to reach out to me to rectify the issue at hand! If you have any reservations to buying this scale, just know the Customer Service ROCKS!!!
 Doesn’t work... work 1 time when I first opened it. Very disappointed
 Great small scale for the kitchen.  It stopped working for some reason 6 months later, but company shipped a replacement free of charge since it was under warranty.  Have had no issues since.
 Works perfectly and cheap. Exactly what I needed.
 small and easy to read and use
 Works as described
 The scale is accurate and easy to use, however mine will not read from 0-3 grams. Anything above 3 grams is spot on.  Not sure how common an issue this is but it could be a potential problem depending on what you need to weigh.
 Beautiful scale but too small. You won't be able to use the scale with a big bowl onto because the screen display will be hidden.
 Works great, I use it weekly for meal prepping.
 Super easy to use with nice design. I love the "tare" design
 very nice, works great and stylish
 It is very suitable for small objects, easy to carry, and no harm.
 If you add small enough amounts the scale will not register any weight, no matter how much weight you add. I was able to add 20 grams of coffee beans to the scale, a few beans at a time and the display never changed from 0 (zero). Very cheap product. Do not buy.
 Nice looking and works good
 Worth the price. Very nice.
 Great scale! It so little and lightweight I can stick it in my purse and take it with me. Love the feature that i can put a bowl on it then zero it and then weigh.
 Love this scale
 Love it!  Exactly what I was looking for and small enough to fit in a drawer!  Arrived quickly.
 It’s starting out amazingly accurate but it suddenly stoped working.
 very pleased with quality of the product and ease of use. Highly recommend this great little scale to future buyers concerned about the value of the food they eat and want a quantitative weight value without having to guess.
 easy to use and compact
 Perfect for my 60 day challenge!  I love being able to quickly weigh whatever I need to for my calorie counts!  It's small, fits easily in the cupboard, and perfect for me!  Thanks!
 Excellent, Small, lightweight and versatile scale. Highly recommended for kitchen, office and many other tasks.<br/><br/>It has "Tare" feature, very nice.
 As advertised Great
 The scale can't even read a gram. When I put more the reading would fluctuate. Terrible buy idk why amazon has it so well rated.
 I love this scale.  I've used a postal scale before, but this is so much better.  It's not only grams and ounces, it's ML too.  It helps a lot.
 Works well in my kitchen. Right size and easy to clean it.
 Works great, no problems. Perfect for weighing out food portions before freezing.
 Sarrived on time, works great !!
 nice quality scale with the functions i need.
 arrived and functions as expected.
 As Expected
 Really nice little scale and also very accurate.
 Worked great until it stopped working 9 months after purchase.
 Easy to use scale with a tare function that makes it easy to exclude the weight of whatever container you're using to hold your measured goods. Works well, every time.
 exactly what i wanted works great
 This scale is so disappointing. Randomly goes up and down and weight is not consistent. I had to buy a new scale and toss this out.
 Great little scale for the kitchen. Changes measurements quick and easily. Love it!!
 The Shape And The Material 🔥🔥🔥 Perfect 👌🏼
 Item as promised. On time and no complaints. A+++++++++
 I've bought a few things  "Etekcity" has made and have been very satisfied.  This however isn't one of them.  It arrived looking dirty. Food material was on it.  The device itself while slall, compact and accurate is just to small to be a good kitchen scale.  Its to small for the plates/dishes I have.  Returning it Amazon was going to charge about 1/2 the cost so I kept it and ill give it to someone that can use it.  I'm about done buying from f'n Amazon
 Perfect
 I recently purchased this kitchen scale and found it to meet my needs.  It is lighweight,easily stored, wipes clean, gives a clear, large reading, and much more.  Great product!
 simple and accurate
 Very satified with the product and the quickness of the order
 Excellent scale, exactly what I needed for meal prep!  Love the tare function, which makes weighing easy!
 Very good tool to weigh the amount of food I consume.
 this is a great product I would recommend this to everyone
 Scale is very easy to use.  The instructions were clear and helpful.  It is everything I needed.
 Great kitchen scale, it's so easy to use.
 It's a little smaller than I expected but it's a great little scale.
 The first one did not work out the box. Etekcity  customer service contacted me almost immediately and shipped me a new one.  Works great!  Very pleased.
 The new scale is performing great. And the speed in which I received this product after ordering was great
 It works but, I thought is was a little bigger than it is.
 Easy to use and compact
 very nice!
 Very happy with my purchase. I bought it to weigh my mailings (the postal scale is $50.00 and have zero complaints
 Works great. Perfect for what I need. Not too big, either. Even though it's pretty simple to figure out, I like the information and instruction packet that came with the scale. I also like all the weight options.
 Small enough that it doesn't take up much space in my kitchen and so easy to use
 Excellent. It fits perfectly in a drawer for safe keeping. It is easy to use and quick to clean! what else do you need?
 Excellent little scale. It's very compact which is nice for storage and has a modern look and feel. I bought the scale for my girlfriend who weighs pretty much everything in the kitchen and she is very happy with it. That's a good review in itself!
 A little slow to power on and to transition between units of measurement, but otherwise works great. Convenient and affordable.
 Compact and accurate
 Sencilla y práctica!
 Need for sausage making
 Good , but small.
 I use this regularly and it is always right
 Perfect for small business.  Accurate and repeats perfectly.
 All you need in one small and ligth digitla balance
 This thing worked—not that well, but it worked—for about two months. After that, it's dead, despite trying several pairs of fresh batteries.
 The scale looks and works great! It has helped with portioning for my meal prep. I also received warranty for 15 months which was unexpected!
 me encantó el tamaño es ideal, muy cumplidos en sus envios.
 Loved its size. Never realized how small an oz. portion is when you are considering a new diet plan.
 Great product
 Easy to use and does not take up much space on my counter.
 This scale is very accurate and has already helped me on my diet. I weight everything.
 Worked like a charm.
 Simple to operate and weighs food accurately! You won't regret this one
 Broke after 1 week
 Used for pinewood derby racer. It proved accurate.
 Display doesn't work
 Looks pretty, arrived on time (as usual), love the light up screen and the flat service! Plus the Tare function! So easy! Worth it!
 I bought this to assist with my fitness by being able to weigh out my portions and better track my calories. The lit screen and accuracy to a gram is what I needed for my purposes. It's good looking, works well, and definitely worth the price.
 Perfectly compact and works just fine.
 Maybe its our fault, but we thought the scale was going to be larger in person. It still works great, so I leave it as 5 stars, but sometimes, its hard to put a large plate on it and see the numbers.
 Love the screen, works great.
 Simple to use, works great.
 Worked for one week then quit. Save your money for a better quality scale.
 Works great.  Small and simple to use.
 works great..nice and sleek for kitcheb
 Excellent
 This is a wonderfully little scale, it weighs in lots of different units of measurement and it zeros out which is very important.  It’s also is incredibly light. Love it!
 Works great. Just what we were looking for and the price was right.
 Cheap. Its a cheap scale. You get what you pay for. If you care about actually measuring your food get something more upscale that will last.
 the size is smaller than it appeared andwill only weight food items not anything as suggested ,not suitable for small packages as staterd
 Exactly what I needed.
 Works great! And I love how it's thin enough to stow away.
 This scale is beautiful, sleek and so practical. I purchased it as a yarn scale AND it also serves as a food scale--two for one!
 Not close to being accurate!
 Awesome little guy and stylish too with the rest of the stainless steel appliances.
 Great Product
 Very happy with this scale. Quality is also great.
 Used it several times after a few months and just broke too soon.
 Worked for about a week then the scale stopped being accurate. I changed the batteries but no. Unfortunate, because the size was nice for traveling.
 The scale is quite simply sleek, elegant, and efficient.  And of course has different conversion units which comes in handy.  And to top it all off and use this simple AAA batteries,  which are easy to replace.  Great product! I would highly recommend it.
 Good quality for the price. Occasionally has an error when turning on but can easily be reset by turning on and off. Ideal for food prepping.
 Back light is too bright. Buttons are too loud. Stopped working after few months.
 Awesome scale for the price...very happy
 I have only used a couple times and works well.
 Soooo nice to have!
 Simple and versatile scale has met all needs I have had so far
 The scale is small and seems fairly accurate. I found the display easy to read, however my one negative comment is the 60 second auto shut-off. It would be nice if this was a feature that could be switched on and off. Other than that, it does the job and is very attractively designed and priced.
 Received on time as promised.  Simple to use and works great.  Just what I needed.
 On time and just what I was looking for
 I absolutely love this scale!!!  So easy to use, looks great, takes up little space (can stick in a drawer if necessary).  I now actually look forward to weighing my food with this! :)  Not to mention the great price!!
 Simple, elegant and accurate! Add in the inexpensive price and it's a great product all the way around.
 Nice.
 Love it. Easy to use and doesn't take up much space. Switching between grams and ounces is really simple, just push a button. Best of all it works perfectly.
 Great scale and easy to use. If you put the plate or bowl on the scale before you turn it on, the scale will read zero and it's easier to weigh the food. Figured this out after some messy counters lol!
 Good value, works great
 Light weight. Perfect for easily storing away and using when needed
 Makes meal prepping so much easier.
 Excellent product, fast delivery!  Would recommend!
 Very small and compact, but it does the job.  Very accurate and cannot beat the price!  Love it!
 Love the scale works great!
 My wife likes it it's easy to use.Has a backlight for easy reading. My wife uses it for her prep meals. Highly recommend
 Great compact scale.
 Perfect small scale! Easy to use and compact size makes it convenient for travel.
 This scale is EVERYTHING !!!!! I love it. I love that I can put a plate on it and set the scale to zero, which helps me keep my portion control in check.
 I love that you can set the scale to subtract the weight of your container.  Very easy to use and clean.
 Description stated it had a bowl included.  It does not. The contents list is correct.  Should update description to remove bowl that is not included.
 This is an amazing scale, looks great works great!
 awesome!
 I like it
 I needed a scale for weighing my fish fillets before putting them into a freezer bag with water.  This fits the bill.  It is accurate and easy to store between uses.
 Originally bought this scale to weigh hiking and camping equipment; have since used it quite a bit in the kitchen.  Love it.
 Small scale that works perfectly.I have a small kitchen with limited counter space and this works well for m.e
 love it, so easy to use
 i used this about 6 times over 6 months and it just died. Replaced batteries. Piece of junk. Or maybe got old product
 Stopped functioning properly within 3 months of purchasing it.
 It's perfect for what I need it for. Easy to use and understand. Slim and looks nice on the counter even. Very satisfied, especially for the price!
 I used this approximately 3 times and then it stopped working.
 This little scale works great &amp; seems to do it all, oz's , grams ,&amp; zero's for tare weight. For under $10 one of the best buys<br/>out there.
 Works great! Fits well with the rest of the kitchen appliances.<br/>The order came with 2 scales and I didn't know until I got it...
 LOOKS SLEEK AND ELEGANT. A LITTLE EXTRA SENSITIVE BUT THATS A GOOD THING WHEN TRYING TO WEIGH FOOD FOR WEIGHT LOSS!
 Easy to use.  Works great.
 I love this and it helps me weigh my food before I consume it. The scale is very accurate and gives me an idea on what I eat as I diet, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to lose weight or if you just need to weigh stuff.
 Fantastic Value
 Great scale.. Uses alkaline cheap AAA not the expensive "watch" batteries.. Exactly as advertised.. Great for weighing herbs..
 Love this scale! They did a replacement for a defective one that was sent. This one works perfectly. Thank you!
 Love it.
 inexpensive and works as expected. great buy!
 small and compact and well made
 Works great
 cheap, works, takes AA batteries which i like
 The no-skid feet on bottom of scale are adhesive and the keep coming off of scale. Will notify seller. Otherwise it is a good scale.
 Works great and the "tare""feature is very convenient
 great product
 Can’t beat the price; great little scale; small enough to be portable.
 Gift to a family member who bakes. She loves it!!
 Easy to use
 Nice compact scale, easy to use
 Great scale - slim and perfect- does not take up a lot of space !!  Good value!!
 works great
 I received this a few days ago, and upon initial check, it uses the footpads as the weighing sensor - which gives me a little hesitation to the accuracy.  Basically, if all four footpads are not on a secure surface, the weight reading will be off.  I would think that a scale with its own weighing platform would provide a more secure base for increased accuracy.  I don't know, that's what I gave it the middle of the road rating of 3 stars.<br/><br/>I'll continue to use it, if it's better than expected, I'll update the rating.  On the flip, if it's worse, I'll reduce the rating.
 Easy to use. Love that it is thin and easy to store vertically in a cupboard so it is out of the way and off the counter.
 Weighing my food is so easy with this scale.
 Love it! Works really  Great for any food!!
 Good product. Works good for us.
 Great. It's measures inngrams which is awesome
 What I like: Sleek look, backlight. What I dislike: I can't read the scale when I'm measuring directly onto a plate or into a bowl. I often weigh flour and sugar for baking. This scale isn't working for me.
 I have been using this occasionally seems to be working well. There is light bleed from the edge of the display; however, it is still readable.
 Scale is working well, none trouble to date. Was going to rate this a 4 until customer service reached out to me to see how it was going and added frequently asked questions. This was extremely helpful. Thank you
 Great functional scale, with great price. Nice design
 The batteries die after each use... lame
 Easy to use, clean and light weight!
 This is a great kitchen scale if you want to measure out ingredients for baking et cetera, but be aware it's small. You can barely read the display under some of my larger mixing bowls. Otherwise this scale is accurate, easy to use, and the form factor can't be beat.
 Excellent
 I bought this scale to measure ingredients for macarons and it's awesome! Extremely quick and very accurate.
 Is digital scale is exactly what I wanted!  Small, slim, and sweet. And extremely accurate!
 Perfect little kitchen scale. Small enough to easily tuck in a drawer but handles anything you could want to put on it. I'm a fan.
 Stainless steel-large readout.
 Precise measurements. I like the tare function. I am able to measure different types of foods thanks to the different units.
 Looks great for the price. Sleek and it works well!
 Bigger than I thought
 EXCELLENT
 Super product for the price.
 Amazing product for price
 I chose this one because metric system was available on it.
 Super light easy to storage great product
 It's fine.  I don't know how to format it for better accuracy but so far it was accurate enough for my purposes.
 I must have received a dud. It would not turn on even when I put in fresh batteries. I returned it.
 That is exactly what I needed.
 This scale lasted a couple months - it wasn't always accurate (I weighed pre-weighed items to check it) and ended up in the trash. Very disappointed.
 Use it all the time for weighing my packages for shipping as well as for cooking.
 The scale works fine, it's just a little hard to make out the display.
 Used quite a bit during holiday cooking and baking.
 Works just fine!
 love it
 Very nice! Bright display!
 would have liked more precision. like more decimals
 Love it. I wasn’t sure if I would like it. But it’s good for 12 bucks can’t beat it
 It was a bit smaller than I thought - and some of my my bowls are too big for it.
 Great scale! Fantastic customer service!
 Works great and is nice and compact. Prefer over the circular one we have by far!
 Very disappointed! I used the scale for a week and then today it doesn't work! I changed the batteries and read all the directions! So sad! 😞
 GREAT PRODUCT
 LOVE this scale, I use it constantly to measure for baking
 This scale is perfect! Sleek, easy to use, accurate! Great buy! Very informative customer service.
 The product initially worked great, but after after a few weeks it stopped working completely.  I changed the batteries and everything and the product still wouldn't work.
 Excellent product! Super simple to use. The display is very clear. I love it! The size is perfect, easy to move around and store anywhere.
 Liviana y prefecta para trabajos en la cocina.
 Very very light objects it doesn't register
 good product
 Love this! It's so light and easy to use. Plus, you can easily toggle b/w various units making it easy to portion out serving sizes of various food items. Great product!
 perfect for cooking and cocktails
 Excellent scale.  Very easy to use.  Quick delivery.  I not only use it to weigh food for proper amounts but for weighing thick envelopes for proper postage.
 Works great for my cold brew coffee and weighing out my meals
 nice little scale. works well
 For the price, I am very pleased how well this scale works. I didn't have to pay a fortune and it works fantastic.
 This scale worked great.  I used it when building pinewood derby cars and it was very accurate and allowed us to complete the build at home and not worry about modifying the car on race day.
 This scale absolutely DOES NOT have the accuracy they claim.  +/- 0.01 oz?  Not even close.  This scale isn't even accurate at +/- 0.1oz.
 Awesome kitchen scale. Sleek and great display.
 Love the backlit display, looks very sleek, happy with my purchase!
 Awesome scale for the price!!
 Nice, affordable kitchen scale! Love it!
 Just as advertised and reviewed by others. This was a good purchase.
 Just as described
 Works for me. About the same size as my 20 year old scale that just gave out. Received an e-mail from the manufacturer highlighting some of the features. Appreciated that.
 Product does not work. Unless everything weights 0. In which case it’s amazingly accurate.
 Works well! And it looks nice! Love the brushed stainless steel. Complements my kitchen space! Highly recommended.
 easy to use and store
 Doesn’t work. Nowhere near accurate
 It weighs stuff accurately..
 Works great and is very  accurate
 Great item and customer service!
 Works great. Easy to use.
 Works great.
 No problems and does its job.
 Good stuff for the money. Works as advertised.
 Very easy to use.
 works great
 Looks great. Works great. Good price. Love it so far.
 Terrific product. Very accurate, my wife loves it!
 Have been working around this scale since I purchased last December.  First, a nickle weight 5 grams but on this scale it weight 4 grams.  The reason I bought this scale was because my other scale, after may years of use, lost it balance.  Second, it's too small.  You can't put a 9" sandwich plate on it, evenly, and see the numbers on the scale.  If you try to bend down to see under the 9" sandwich plate, the numbers are not readable.  I should have kept the old scale.  So now I have to shop for a new scale.
 Great little scale and very cheap!
 I've been using this scale a few weeks and it works great. Looks great, it's so slim and compact it takes up no room in the cupboard at all. Wipes clean easily.
 Perfect for the price.
 Easy to use out of the box.
 Amazing product
 Works great and even comes with batteries!
 Completely inaccurate.  Disappointed.
 I like the sleek look and how little room it takes. Have not used it much so I might have to update my review in a few days.
 super sleek and small so it fits anywhere in the kitchen. love how super light weight it easy. super easy to navigate.
 Easy to use.  Accurate, allows for use of any container. Very stylish, we leave ours setting out on the counter.  Highly recommend.
 Just what we wanted. Fast delivery also.
 I like the scale, It is has all the feature I want but it is a bit small
 Nice size.
 Works great for the price!
 A good reliable scale without BS u dont need. Grst buy for the price.
 Arrived before the expected delivery! It's exactly what I was looking for and is easy to use
 Easy to use.  Takes up little space on counter or in cupboard.
 Good scale, low price.
 Love it, love it, love it !!!
 Works great and cleans easy too.<br/>Don't know what more to write, very reliable and battery lasts a long while too
 It's a kitchen item that is used to weigh food. I wiped it down with a wet sponge and the water damaged it... Are you kidding me?
 Works well. Extremely accurate.
 I paid full price for this scale; and I really like it.<br/>Pros:<br/>- accurate (checked this using butter sticks and other pre-measured groceries)<br/>- "tare" function<br/>- easy to read display<br/>- auto shut-off function<br/>- uses regular batteries that I always have in the house, as opposed to my old kitchen scale - that required a round "pill" battery<br/>- looks good on the counter and does not take much space<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- can be a bit off at times, but by only 1-3 grams<br/>- auto shut-off kicks in about a minute, so I have to turn the scale back on. Not too much of a problem, I did not bother to find whether it can be reprogrammed.
 Purchased 11/6/16 and it lasted until 3/6/17. Regret referring several people.
 Accurate and consistent !!! Great product.
 Great small scale!
 Product does not read weight very good at all! Inconsistent and usually doesn't even read
 Good scale. Works great and is sleek and looks sexy. Was expecting a little larger to fit larger containers to measure food, but I never read the specs, so my fault! Excellent product, works as advertised.
 This is an excellent tool for any cook! I am primary using it for portion control and I attribute at least a part of success in my dieting to this scale. My two favorite features are: a) calibration that simplifies measuring of weight of foods that need to be put into a container, and b) auto shut-off that saves battery without having to bother to turn the scale off. I also love how compact it is. I am tempted to take it with me when eating out.
 Great
 Perfect little scale. Lightweight, small enough to store easily, and the readings are always spot-on
 Very accurate. Easy to read. This scale is very helpful for meal prepping or cooking. It looks nice so I don't mind leaving it out on the counter. It is also very easy to clean!
 The scale works great and I like all of the features, but we have had to replace the batteries every few days, using it only a few minutes each day. Definitely a waste.
 Light and easy ho store and use
 Good scale
 Good value, easy to use, looks good. Been using it for baking and making manual brew coffee.
 This scale works perfectly for my dieting and helped me to my goal. Very easy to use, small, and convenient. Would recommend for someone wanting to buy a cheap yet reliable scale.
 Just what I was looking for. Works perfectly for all my needs.
 Nice scale for the money.
 accurate and small footprint ... great for food or mixing stains and dyes
 This scale is very easy to use, accurate, and lightweight, and takes up very little drawer space in my small kitchen.
 I actually use this more to measure hair color than i do weigh my food but it works great!
 I received it on time. I'm very pleased with the size and functions! i recommend this to anyone. I was skeptical if it would work because it is so small. But it works great!!
 The units indicator light did not work.  I suspect a wiring issue.  This scale feels cheaper than the price. Returned
 No problems through one week of having this product. I've been using it to measure and determine serving sizes. Down 10 lbs in two weeks and hopefully more to come!
 Couldn't be easier to use. Simple, straightforward UI and not bad to look at either.
 It seems to be ok but I should have spent the extra money to get a better quality scale
 easy to use
 Works as advertised. Great for the price
 Easy and accurate.
 Better than most scales out there (I have tried a few)
 Small size for convienient storage
 It is very easy to use.  It is slim so can easily be stored on counter without taking up a lot of space.
 Small, sleek and accurate
 Great Product for me.
 Works great! Use everyday to help me with calculating my calories using oz or grams of food.
 Easy to use and for a great price.  Just what I needed for my kitchen.
 Works awesome,have had it for a few years now and still using same batteries even!
 Works as expected, good value for the price
 Item arrived with a huge dent in the scale.
 Super easy to use and read!
 good, accurate kitchen scale
 I've only had this for about a week, bought it for baking bread, although I'd been meaning to get a kitchen scale for a long time. It's great so far! Small, easy to use, and very accurate. Excellent buy.
 great!
 Love it - works great and doesn't take up much room
 Works very easy with a large readout screen
 Works just as described!
 works well
 Perfect food scale.
 I love my new digital scale. Thank you very mych for reaching out to mecto check whetherI had any questions operating the scale- greatcustomer service!
 I have been using my scale for a week and have been very pleased with the results.  So far it is doing exactly what I wanted it to do.
 just received my etekcity today and weighed a few articles  to check for accuracy and found it to be spot on. Also, the sleek looks are very attractive and will be very easy to clean.
 Nice sleek design, but hard to measure items on a large plate.  The plate covers the display so you can't see the measurements.  Great for small plates and bowls.  I also like the negative feature, as I tend to do this a lot with peanut butter, jellies, etc.
 Was just radling around in the box an had to put large amount of weight to get it to even work.
 Great little scale. Super value!
 As promised. Nice product, great price. Super easy to use. Should've bought one of these years ago!
 Good material
 Attractive, compact, very reasonably priced, not overly complicated and pretty straightforward. It does what it's supposed to do with a minimum of fuss and bother. I like it a lot.
 I am giving this scale a one star review because I ordered it "new" but when I received it the package was open. The scale itself was dirty, grimy, and it was missing a rubber foot so it wasn't even level. Hopefully you won't have the same issues.
 Not happy with the quality. I don't expect it to last more than 6 months
 Great for measuring out your food.
 I bought this in Feb. 2017, and less than a year later it already doesn't work. Do not recommend.
 Excellent product!
 great product I am very impressed with the quality and ease of use for the cost of the scale. The scale has been a great addition to my food prepping for more accurate nutrition calculations.
 just love it
 AWESOME scale it was is so easy to use and large digital screen is great. I just bought one for my niece.
 Work really good
 I was surprised as to how light it was. I actually needed this to weigh shipping stuff along with some meal prep that I do. It does the job just fine.
 Stopped functioning within 2 months of use
 Easy to use.Perfect size to carry everywhere.I loved it.
 Accurate and easy to use.
 Works just as advertised. Came just as expected, two AA batteries and all. Would recommend.
 Great device. Handy to have around
 good
 Best scale I ever had.
 As expected
 Perfect
 Great product! Have had it for a couple weeks now and I am absolutely loving it. Works really well.
 This is the first kitchen scale I have ever bought.  I'm really impressed by this product.  A large readable LCD screen and batteries are included plus two extra.
 Had it for about a month before it broke.  Keeps giving an error reading and the fix it solution doesn't work as it won't even turn off in the first place.  Waste of $$
 Muy linda, perfecta. Tal como la vi por la página. Gracias.
 I gave it as gift
 Very nice! What I was looking for. Helping me hit my body fat goals.  Measuring is the way to go.
 I have this item for few days and I really enjoy using it. It's easy to clean and I really like the fact that you can change the measuring units easily.
 Don't know how accurate the scale is. It is questionable
 We later purchased a set of scale test weights. This scale seems to weigh 2grams short!
 the scale does a very nice job.  it is just smaller than i had expected.  My daughter has one by the same company that is about 30 to 50% larger than the one i ordered.
 This thing sucks, it gives different readings everytime I set the same thing On it and it won't  register small amounts of weight.
 Flat surface allows for use of different sized and shaped containers.  Slim size allows for easy storage.
 used for candle making and was great price, easy to use
 Simple, sleek design.  Easy to use.
 This unit will weigh pounds not just like others before
 Easy to use and read.  Awesome product would buy again!
 absolutely every thing about this compact scale is wonderful.  its size, its appearance and of course, its functionality.  i could not be happier with it.
 Arrived on time, worked right out of the box. Does exactly what it should. Great product.
 Helps when dividing hamburger meat out evenly before freezing.
 Works great and can easily adjust settings.
 I love this digital scale. It's easy to use and set up and very accurate, attractive and well-built. The only drawback that I can see is that it's quite small. But I knew that from the description. I would recommend this to a friend.
 I love using this scale to weigh my servings.
 Really great, accurate scale for the price.
 Very simple to use and the sleek design allows me to keep it on the counter all the time.  Very Nice!
 excellent product and really good customer service.
 This is a nice sleek food scale. Does everything I need. Nice led lights. Stainless steel is nice. I would recommend this products. Other stores had a bulky scales. Looking for something slim and can do the job.
 For general use in kitchen, no problem so far
 Unboxing to start up took only 2 minutes! Great scale
 Works perfectly, it's consistent &amp; very light weight.
 I use this scale for soap making as it can go to the hundredths place in ounces and I need that precision with ingredients. Also it's very small and sleek and it really does not get fingerprints on it.
 Easy to use
 Is sleek, looks nice, good size and works as intended.
 Fairly inexpensive, gets the job done!
 This scale is just ok. I don't think it's very accurate and it seems cheaply made, but it gets the job done.
 Easy to use &amp; conveniently packaged with batteries included.  I think it was a great deal for the price and compact/sleek designs let you store away easily in a drawer or cabinet when not in use.
 Nice , and does what I needed it to do !
 Good Product Great Price - What I was hoping for
 Very nice love it.Very satisfied 😌
 Is very easy to use and it was really cheap.
 It arrived on time and works perfectly.
 Bought this after gastric bypass surgery.  Works beautifully, wipes clean easily, and very well priced.
 Absolute rubbish. Doesnt give a proper reading. Inaccurate.
 Works perfectly and is easy to clean...
 Perfect!
 Works Great, small enough to keep on your counter, and looks very nice.
 Amazing!
 The scale was fairly accurate and the best thing was it is really light and small so it's convenient to carry around. I think it's the best you can find with this price.
 This scale is cheap. Do not buy. Weight keep jumping with nothing on it.
 product stop switching between grams and oz after three months
 Does it’s job
 Really great product. It came as described and works great. I love the feature that saves battery by having a timed sleep.
 So easy to use!
 Received item in mail. Did not work when tab was removed from batteries. Tried to change out batteries, and the it still would not turn on.
 Works great for my purposes, but I should probably bought a bigger model to weigh some of the larger items.
 It does exactly what it's supposed to do. Looks very nice and the price is 👍
 Great price and nice size. Works perfect for weighing pine wood derby cars. Excellent price and value
 Arrived on time, packaged safely in a larger box with bubble bags, (Amazon style).<br/>The package is new and unopened.<br/>The scale auto Zeros at power on, can be easily Zeroed with a plate or bowl before filling at a single touch of the power button.<br/>This scale reads in lbs, oz, and grams that we needed.<br/>It is a bit smaller than I expected, but will work out fine, as it will store easier.
 Perfect!!!!
 I like how it gives the choice of grams, ounces etc. Also, it takes in consideration the container being used. Awesome
 Good product, I use it a lot.
 Product is great and is a very good price!
 Buena calidad y terminaciones
 Like the weight conversion option.<br/>Very accurate.
 A great product. Works properly and as described. My only complaint, and the reason why i've dropped it a couple of stars, is because the idle time-off is sooo short and there is no way to adjust the time or just turn off that functionality. I use this to make pour-over coffee and sometimes it takes longer than 10 seconds between pourings. So then the scale shuts off and i've now lost count of how much water i've added.<br/><br/>If there were some way to adjust how long the auto-off feature takes or even just shut that off it would then be a perfect scale. If anyone knows how to adjust it, give a shout!
 It is not accurate for measuring in grams. This makes it useless for me. Every time I put the substance up, it gives a different reading.. Disappointing.
 Great scale!
 Its really cheap n broke
 Excellent scale to measure foods. Comes in extremely handy for those on the Ideal Protein diet. Highly recommend.
 lit
 Great scale. Pre-calibrated
 This is my second scale from this company. The first lasted for 2 years, till we dropped it on the tile and it shattered. Would buy it again for sure.
 So far so good. Easy to use and fast delivery.
 Great food scale for the price. Works perfectly.
 This is a great little product.  It works just fine.
 Nice product
 This was a gift for my mom, and she loved it! Completely recommended! It is really accurate and not heavy at all. We use the scale for everything, it works perfectly!
 Perfect size and user friendly
 I used every day! Very satisfied!!
 It won't measure in grams.
 Love it, works great! It's helped me be more aware of how much food I am eating and be healthier.
 Perfect little scale. It's very sleek and takes up almost no room and
 Straightforward, nothing complicated about it. Easy to clean, easy to read, easy to use. Great price
 Very compact and easy to use
 works great . does what I expected it to do.
 stopped working after minimal use
 Works like a charm, and accurate too.
 Intuitive design - works great, easily switches measurements (g, oz, etc), and looks good. Only gripe is that the display is hard to read if you aren't looking directly downward at it.
 I don’t know if something is wrong with my scale but I’ve had to change two sets of batteries in 2 weeks!!! How is that possible?
 Fine if you do not need very accurate measurements but over time I have noticed it is not accurate below about 5g and does not do fractions of grams.
 Great product. Wonderful for dieting and calculating postage. Easy to use. Looks nice in my kitchen.
 What a complete piece of crap. Can’t belive you sell this on here. I want a full refund.
 Perfect for what I need. Also love the size as I do not have to deal with one more bulky kitchen item.
 this scale looks nice and worked for about 1 month. Again duped by plastic garbage from China
 Had an issue with my first scale. They QUICKLY resolved the issue. Highly recommend!
 Easy to use, compact food scale. Great product.
 Works well so far!
 So far, no major problem
 Works great. Had a bulky old plastic scale that this replaced. I weighed things I knew the weight of and it was accurate and easy to use.
 Great product, very easy to use and hides away perfectly in your kitchen!
 Perfect for making burgers all the same size.
 Doesn't weigh correctly.
 It is what it is
 Great product and great customer service.  I find I use this 4-5 times a day.
 This was a huge upgrade from a manual scale I used in the past. It looks so good I even leave it out on the counter. It does everything I need it to and more. The quality seem to be top notch.
 accurate!
 Works great and seems to be very accurate. It also doesn't take up much room.
 Quick delivery, ready to use , worked well easy to operate. So far so good!
 Inaccurate and imprecise. I tried weighing the same item several times and it gave readings between 70s to 90s in grams. Please spend the extra money and get a quality scale.
 A little used. Neat features and works just fine!
 So far this is exactly who I was looking for. Started a new weight loss program and would be lost without this.
 Good price point but it stopped working after using for only a month.
 Works exactly as it is supposed to and someone to use!
 Works just like I need it to and I am very satisfied with this purchase.
 Great product! Thank you!
 Perfect
 Lasted about a month before it stopped working completely. Replaced the batteries and everything! Not worth it -- use your money on another scale that works!
 Great product! Fits everywhere in my kitchen and the best part is that takes out the weight of the container leaving just the weight of the food!
 This is really tiny, but works fine.
 Absolutely love this scale! The small size makes it easy to store. The tare function is fantastic!
 This does not work well at all. If you move the scale even slightly, the weight changes. If I stirred the contense of the bowl I was weighing, the weight would change. Returning immediately.
 Nice scale.
 It was very good. Did everything it was suppose to
 Horrible bearly used and it doesn’t work anymore
 Works as expected
 Very pleased with my purchase.  It works perfectly for baking!
 so far so good.
 Works well and looks sleek for low price point. Not sensitive enough to weight anything lower than 2 grams but I use it for baking and recipes so it's not an issue for me. Would suggest to friends to buy!
 This is accurate and so easy to  use. Love it.
 Very simple! The product estimates to the nearest gram, but for tracking calories and recipes it works just fine. Product was very inexpensive and the LED is very bright.
 Great scale, easy to use, the options are great and the quality is on point.
 Horrible scale...does not record weight properly. Waste of money
 Very easy to use and clean, has all the major units available, sleek and modern display.
 I really like the look of the product and it is perfectly accurate.
 Love this. Very easy to use. Exactly what I wanted.
 Love this food scale...takes all the guesswork out of portion control. Easy to read...
 Excellent slim design and accurate measurements
 Very nice digital kitchen scale.  I would recommend it to anyone checking their food intake.
 A+++
 I like the ease of using this scale. It is the perfect size. Fits perfect in my drawer.
 Small, light, and easy to use.  Great to have one in the kitchen.
 works great as advertised
 Easy to use and light enough to take with me in my lunch box.
 This product is just the right size for my work space.  The digital read out is clear.  I give it 5 stars.
 Probably one of the worst purchases ive made in my life. The buttons barely function, the inaccuarcy is insane. Learn from my mistakes.
 Works great. Sent a follow up email with tips on the product too. Great price too.
 Super easy to use.instructions were easy to follow for ounces/grams etc
 Could not be happier with this scale! Our previous scale was so clunky and large compared to this! It's sleek, simple, easy to store, and easy to use. And for this price! An amazing deal for an amazing product! 🙌
 This is an excellent, accurate, and visibly attractive scale! Love it!
 Simple, easy to use.. it does exactly what I need
 Works perfectly for me. It helps measuring servings for portion control and for freezing food for use later.
 Exactly as described and a great price as well.  I received a follow up email after receiving the item just making sure all was good.  A+ customer service
 This scale is super easy to use and makes measuring out portions very simple. I like that it's small and easy to read.
 it was working ok but a month of use , one of the four bottom corner pieces broke .<br/>I believe its what helps weigh and balance the scale
 Was awesome for 3 months. Now not working anymore. Batteries are good but still, the device is dead :(
 Compact and slim, I use it a lot in the kitchen. Love it!
 it is perfect for me.<br/>it is cheap and light as well as correct for measuring.<br/>but, i prefer a bigger size than now.
 I like the flat weighing surface, but if using a large bowl to weigh flour in it can be difficult to read the display. Good price, and love how slim it is for storage.
 price is good and meets my needs for weighing portions thin and compact for easy storage very happy with purchase
 Works like a scale should not much to say.
 scale stopped working one month after buying it. waste of money
 Fast shipment, well made and accurate!
 Works as expected. Display is clear and readable due to background light. Overall, great product for the price.
 Scale came in a package that was very well made ,it just looked like class.When I first used the scale it also worked great.Very happy with the whole purchase.
 Great value
 Easy to operate. Accurate. Large screen. What's not to like??!! Good product at a fair price!
 Just bought one.  Much sleeker than my previous scale and I also like the rectangular, flat surface of the scale.  Easier to keep a pile of items from rolling off.  Plus, the price was right and it got delivered very promptly.
 Excellent product.
 Works great so far!
 Great convenient way to measure out portions. Small, lightweight, works great and easy to store.
 Very easy to use. :) I love my new cooking toy.
 Perfect for my kitchen. Perfect delivery
 I love this scale! It's so easy to use and so light! I can store it easily in a drawer without having to worry about taking up space! I also love the LED  display!
 Well performing digital food scale with a nice small size.
 Small, lightweight, accurate weights, good price
 This is a great product.  Much better than what i expected AND it's less expensive than the models I was looking at.
 Good
 Works great and gets every gram I need for my meals.
 Works well, is simple and easy to use! I love this product, it's an easy way to measure food and more accurate than measuring cups (plus less dishes!) Best way to measure meat especially.
 Awesome little scale for the price. Easy to use, perfect for measuring my ingredients.
 It worked well in the beginning, but It doesn't work after one month use
 broke after a year!
 The etekcity digital scale is one of the best and most simple products ive ever had. It work to perfection. All of the functions work as it should. It is a must to have in your kitchen.
 Nice and sleek design.
 The scale is too small to hold 11lbs.I thought the scale would of been bigger...
 A great little scale that works like a charm!  Highly recommended!!
 We use this a lot and it doesn't disappoint. It is so nice and small that it stores right where you need it without being in the way. Amen
 Purchased this on Jan 29th 2017. On February 20, I started getting an error "un53" or "unSE" while using it, and it never worked again. I tried replacing the batteries, resetting it (by removing and replacing the batteries), turning it on on flat surfaces, everything. A true disappointment. A true disappointment.
 Slick design looks very nice and works great.
 I wish I can give you 10 stars for this item.I ordered one more so I can use it at work. Great product. Easy to use and accurate.
 This scale is great! I recently began dieting and this has been a huge help. Trying to figure out ounces without a scale is impossible. So glad I bought this one. So easy to use too!
 So easy too work, all with one button.  Easy to wipe off to clean.  I love this!  Also no special batteries!
 I love my scale. I highly recommend this scale. very good quality.
 easy to use, handy, very useful around the house.
 Great scale.  Larger than I expected but works great for my need and a great value.
 Love my new scale!  Easy to use.
 scale was not correctly calibrated.
 It was smaller than it looked on the computer, but ok for my needs.
 Sleek, clean and simple. I love the unit conversion and tare feature. It has made my carrot juice making process very exact to the decimal!
 Not calibrated right, it is off with grams
 The scale is easy to operate and read, but shuts off too soon.  When you turn it back on, it re-tares to 0, so you have to start over.
 works well, light to transport, good value.
 Works nice, but is way too small.  Not returning it as it will cost almost as much to return as it did to purchase.
 Easy to use and clean,clear display.<br/><br/>No complaints.
 very beautiful design, small and useful. good  battery life.
 Works really well. Small. Looks good.
 Nice product.  Easy to use.
 Check the size before ordering. This scale is very small. If you plan to weight your dishes in plates you will not able to see numbers.
 Great scale, works as expected.
 Arrived quickly and in great condition. Very easy to use and has a clear display.
 works as described, thanks!
 I like it has an off button seems to work well
 Looks great wish it had desimal reading (10.2G) not just rounding off to nearest 10ths
 Simply great.
 It's Great!!! I love it.
 Great scale for the money.  So far I can tell it is accurate, only used for a week.
 Excellent product. Easy to operate and comes with four batteries.
 It doesn't measure less than a gram hopefully I don't need to use it for less than that
 love it
 This was delivered to me on Jan 8. It quit working on Feb 24.  I won't buy it again.
 Simple. Accurate. Looks decent on counter. Never knew how bad my guesstimations were until I got this bad boy.
 Very easy to read and accurate.
 Not accurate
 Handy gadget to have.
 It's easy to read and it's fast and accurate !  Just Love !
 There are lots of other detailed reviews on here that do a great job of explaining how great a value this scale is, especially for the price, so I won't go into detail, but we love the scale and think it works great.<br/><br/>What I do want to say, is how great this company is. Our scale arrived with some very minor scratches on the surface. Entirely cosmetic, and didn't impair the scale's ability at all, but we were surprised to see it out of a sealed box. I sent an email to Etekcity's customer service to let them know, and very explicitly stated we did not need a replacement or any sort of refund, but they insisted on sending a brand new one to us free of charge. That's what I call exceptional customer service.
 Does the job.
 Screen on mine did not work.  Had to return it and pay a buck more to send it back!
 Love this scale! Easy to use and clean.
 Works just like it should! I use it for weighing packages that I am sending through the mail. Great product!
 Works great, easy to clean!
 Does exactly what I need it to do
 Great scale for the price 😊 I have used it every day since being delievered. Quickly switches between pounds.. grams..and ounces with the touch of a button.
 Sometimes it is slow to pick up the weight.
 works fine
 Opened the box, scale didn't work. Batteries were fine, it was the product that was defective.
 Enjoy it
 The Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale is compact enough to store away wherever you like and very accurate on reading the weight of the foods I need to weigh.
 Excellent product.  Well worth the money.
 This is a great scale for my baking needs I don't know what took me so long to order one!
 Works great, looks great, right size. Lightweight, responds as needed. Be aware that like all other small battery operated scales, it times out after one minute.
 Sleek and smart kitchen scale!
 Worked only a few times for me.
 I’ve lost 10 pounds due to tracking my macros and weighing out my food with this.
 Extreme inaccuracy at low weights renders it worthless. The 2 stars are for its great looks.
 Nice design, small/ compact, and light weight and work just as expected. I like the option to change from grams to ounces.
 its nice
 works fine just weighs stuff
 So far it works great! I like that it is battery operated, so I do not have to fumble with a cord.
 Very simple to use. Easy to view and seems vey accurate.
 Very happy with our scale. Especially like that you can easily weigh a plate or container, then add the food you want to weigh. Very convenient.
 Love, love, love this product.
 It's not very precise but it's ok for what I need.
 Less than a month and you can't read the numbers even after changing the batteries several times😒
 bad quality is ok, i know it's cheap. but, not working, it's cheating.
 It's a good product. I didn't give 5 stars because something when I am weighing the same object shows different weight. Could be better.
 Good
 I received and it wasn’t calibrated accurately. Can’t find directions and how to fix. Should I return it?
 Excellent for the price, quality and overall!
 works as promised - I also like if I set my container on it prior to turning it on, it automatically zero's to include the weight of the container when powered on. Entire surface is flat which makes it easy to clean.
 not very accurate,  for example:  if you weigh a US quarter  (5.67 grams)  the scale will say 5 or 6.  thats it.  regret buying this.
 Works great.
 I love this scale. It is accurate and gets the job done for all my needs. Whether it be in the kitchen or weighing small packages, this scale gets the job done. In my opinion, one of the best things about this is that it uses regular AAA batteries. Many of the scales use watch batteries that are expensive and sometimes hard to find. This has been a great scale for me over the last few months I would definitely recommend this.
 Nice small scale . Great price
 good
 Very pleased with your scale.
 Simple, sleek, and small. Works great!
 Quit working after 8 weeks!!!<br/>:-(
 Did not work I had to return and I bought different brand
 good
 Simple to use this clean design.  There were a few scuff marks on the top of the scale when it arrived, but nothing serious from my point of view.
 Easy to use and a must for my soap and lotion making.
 Very happy with this scale. Love that it is small and doesn't take up room in my little kitchen.
 Works as advertised. It is hard or impossible to read if you put a bowl or plate on it.
 Love it.
 Love this scale! It really does what it needs to at an affordable price!
 DOA right out of the box.  Called etekcity, they implied this happens all the time.  Hopefully the replacement will arrive soon.<br/>You get what you pay for.
 I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and here is her review:<br/>I've been using this scale for making pour over coffee in a Chemex, and it doesn't quite work as well as I hoped. 1) For measuring the beans, the resolution isn't very high, and it would be better to have a 0.1 gram resolution, but really that isn't a big deal.<br/>2) This scale is VERY sensitive to temperature. The grams of coffee changed after I put the Chemex with hot water on the scale and I wouldn't know the correct weight of my pour over. It still works if I insulate the Chemex by putting something thick and thermally insulating in between the scale and the Chemex, but It's annoying that the numbers keep changing. I think for normal kitchen purposes, this scale is fine, but this is NOT the scale to buy if you are looking to use it for every day coffee making.
 Simple, easy to use… Small enough  and attractive enough to leave on the counter,
 it works great, love it!!!
 Great for tracking macros. Just started using it 2 weeks ago and so far so good. I recommend it, it's also very small and convenient to place anywhere in your home.
 I've tried other scales and donated them. This is accurate, easy to use &amp; compact. I use it every day to control my portions
 It works well.
 Nice clean look small enough to fit in drawer  works great
 Product broke after less than two weeks.
 Poor quality.
 I ordered this to monitor my pets' weights. I have had no issues with it and everyone is at their ideal weight! I would buy this again if I had another purpose for it! :)
 Great little scale.
 great scale- works perfectly
 Works great for what I need it for. Happy with it.
 Tare feature is great. Love the small size as my apartment and counter space are limited. Would recommend this product.
 Few things are as advertised, this is every bit and more: a good, basic scale that is both accurate and easy to use, offered at a fair price.
 Works fine , but ergonomically , I wish it was easier to press the buttons and see the display when a plate it on top it
 This scale broke in less than one month. It's to lat to return.
 I bought this scale during the "building" of a Pinewood Derby car (they can't be more than 5 ounces). Now that the race has been run, it will come in very handy in the kitchen. I like that it has a high upper end weight measurement (11 lbs.). You can also change the setting to measure in grams . Another handy feature is the tare function, which allows you to "zero out" the weight of the container before weighing the ingredients. It is well made, and is small enough that it doesn't take up much storage space. A real winner!
 Good
 The scale is smaller than I expected. And the numbers tend to be jumpy, doesn't seem as reliable. Thick I'm going to stick with my old one.
 Great scale.  Replaces Ozeri scale with round plate and raised edges.  This scale's flat top is far superior for my use!  Luv it!
 It does the job!
 Great... looks sturdy and reliable<br/>Daniel
 its pretty good but it wont weight anything below a gram accrate and thats important.
 What a great lie scale! It is very easy to operate and nicely sized.  Never had one before so far it's worked great.
 I love this scale!!!
 Excellent right out of the box.  Easy to use and understand.
 Product accomplishes what I sought it out for.
 This scale is perfect!  It doesn't take up a lot of space and is accurate.  My husband even uses it!
 This is a great scale, especially for the price, and is small enough to place in a drawer or other small space.  Highly recommend.
 Cost effective and works great, came with batteries
 it stopped working properly after 3 weeks.
 I got this to measure color in my salon. Super easy to use and made very well. I would buy this again! :)
 This scale arrived as advertised and has worked consistently.
 This scale is great. Does exactly what I need it to do and looks great on my counter.
 Great little scale that is easy to store and is just what every kitchen needs.
 Love it!!!
 perfect
 it does not work now. I just bought it for one month.
 Does what it says.
 Works great.  Small, accurate, easy.
 Very easy to turn on and off and to tare. Attractive if you want it to fit in your kitchen without being bulky and unsightly. However, I had a few issues:<br/>1. Turns off too quickly. This does not allow you to keep adding items.<br/>2. Hard to read scale if a larger item is on it as it does not retain weight to show.<br/>3. It changes weight of the item. You could weight the exact item 3 times, ensuring th scale registers 0.00 each time between weigh and you will probably get 3 different weights. For example, the same jar weighed 6.12, 6.17 each time I weighed.
 Quite accurate and works great!
 Very nice. Sleek and small design. Numbers are easy to read. Not the most precise scale I have ever owned, but I like it very much.
 nothing to complain about
 Nice scale, great price.
 This looks like a premium product for the price.
 Bad
 Works perfectly!
 sometimes it's not as associate as expected.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>6/8/2018. increase to 4 star for customer service. received an updated model free of charge. will post updates later.
 Very easy to use.
 works great
 The scale is great and small to handle
 Good! It is really helpful for my cooking!
 Make life a lot easier. No more guess work!!
 Scale works well. It would be better if the readout was at 45 degrees, allowing you to see it more clearly when using the tare to zero out a container.
 I love that it goes up to 11 pounds and is still slim and sleek.  Very happy with this choice.
 One star because I can't give zero stars. I received the undamaged package. The scales would turn on and off but nothing else worked. I've returned it for refund.
 Great Scale, the manual on/off feature is fantastic for anyone who has had an AUTO on/off food scale which wastes battery life or turns off while you're prepping food to add to the scale. Looks awesome too!
 Stopped working after two months.
 Very nice and easy to storage.
 It works as intended. No qualms months later from use
 Very accurate and easy to use
 Worked perfect...easy to change in between measurements
 Great product I like how you can move from lbs to oz
 Got new one and it did not work like the first one. Is no directions for calibration like othe scales. Overall poor product. Do not buy if you was accuracy.
 Doesn't work. Product arrived broken. Simply won't function or turn on.
 So glad I purchased this product.  This is exactly what I am looking for: light weight, sleek design and accurate.  I have been using this for the past 2 weeks and I am very happy with this.
 Great product. Works everytime and no glitches.
 It does what it needs to do I measure everything I eat in Grams
 works great for measuring single serving portions of nuts, cheese and other healthy snacks. that's all i need it for.
 nice scale. User friendly
 My beloved food scale broke several weeks ago, this works great and travels well.
 Easy to use.
 I use it to weigh suitcases when I travel
 This digital food scale is so compact and easy to use that I sometimes carry it with me when I travel.  I also prefer to use it over my more expensive food scale because of it ease of use.
 This scale is perfect and really easy to use! I definitely recommend it!
 Stopped working right within six weeks.  Had to pull out and replace the battery every time to get it to reset and work right. Threw it away and bought another
 I use this all the time. Great.
 Does not measure tenths of a gram. Reads a nickel as 3 grams instead of 5.
 Amazing scale!
 Excellent!
 Don't waste your money. When you try to push the tare it shuts off sometimes. Low quality, there is nothing less than one star.
 I've had this scale for over four months and it is great. Easy to use, seems to be very accurate and the size and sleek look of it are perfect in my counter.
 just received this so time will tell. seems to be accurate. compact and stylish.
 Doesn’t work
 Its accuracy is horrible
 Great scale, easy to use...
 Is not working is always show me 0 or 5 is just look nice
 This product shipped very fast and I am super pleased with it! Very light weight and accurate. I use it several times a day for my cooking and portion control needs.
 The scale broke down after first use. Plus the numbers went away way too quickly.
 I love my scale. Very Sleek looking and so simple to use I didn't even have to read the direction. I would recommend this product to anyone. I am just getting in the groove of weight my food and its just perfect all around.
 AMAZING SCALE!!!
 Very Good product! Delivered on time!
 works great! love how i can place stuff on it before i turn it on, and it'll balance it out to 0
 Great for keeping track of how many ounces of cheese and other foods I eat.
 Very adequate and easy to use
 Poor desing...
 Very modern, sleek looking scale. I purchased it mainly for weighing my young ball python snake, and it does so very accurately.
 Very accurate and great looking weights!
 The scale was scratched when I get it. It looked like it had been used.
 Great quality, great packaging, very sharp looking.<br/>Only thing is when you are weighing something and tare it out the scale tries to read the push of your finger on the reading. It would have been better if the buttons on the aluminum top were all the way cut out. Other than that the display is awesome! Will definately buy these products again<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/>have had it for a week now and it is starting to suck bad. It turns off and on by itself and the worst is it doesnt weigh anything accurately. For the life of me i cannot weigh one or two grams no matter what i do. Its crap and will only notice something if it weighs over 6.. Returning it and will not buy again.<br/><br/>Etkcity also denied me membership to review their products on their site.... Very bad company also.
 This scale works great. It is small and easy to store.
 Smaller than I expected but quality product and fast shipping
 Looks nice and works properly. I don't use it that much, but I never had any trouble.
 Works as expected
 Just right for my needs.
 Works as advertised but this is incredibly smaller than I expected.
 size is perfect and operation is very easy.
 Sadly it doesn't work. Place produce on scale and it just stays on zero.
 Light weight works great looks sleek!!
 Best scales out there! Best price and nice quality!
 Great scale! Absolutely love it!
 I needed to scale to start weighing out food portions. I thought for the money, if it doesn't work I'd picture and get something else. This scale is perfect. I read the frequently asked questions and it helped me with  A problem I was experiencing. My plate was so big it would cover the readout. It said just put a little bowl on top and then put your plate on top of that. The other thing that's nice is you can set that all on the scale, turn it on, and it says zero. Then you just add your food to get your total weight. I like it and I'm sure you will too.
 Great scale does the job... if you're looking for a scale to count macros looks no further!
 I am glad I pick this product. I just starting do make my own soap. This scale is very useful. It good to use for a person just starting make there own products. Just the right size.
 what a great product' it does what is should do, also can measure liquids
 Beautiful design. Good quality.
 Great little scale. Battery operated makes it extra convenient in portability.Easy to operate and doesn't take up much space on the counter or storing it.
 Excellent product for yhe price<br/><br/>I bought 2.  One for me andanother for a friend
 I like it because, it fits our needs.
 Compact and easy to use.  Very pleased!  Great price.
 Smaller than I thought
 This scale only lasted a couple months and the accuracy did not seem real reliable.
 love it - small portable.  works on everything from peaches to grams of teas.
 This was just what I was looking for. It's very easy to use and looks pretty slick. Perfect for baking.
 Works perfectly
 Super easy to use, and quick shipping.
 I love this scale, super easy to use and easily portable! I highly recommend!
 On/Off button does not work.
 Works like a charm!
 I love the compact size of this scale! It looks and functions very well.
 Works great and it's slim and small sonit doesn't take up a ton of room
 Light weight and perfect for the kitchen.
 This scale is described as being able to weigh anywhere from 1 gram to 11 pounds. However, it is extremely inaccurate. One gram doesn't even register on this scale. I bought four different kitchen scales varying in prices and placed a nickel on each one. All, except this scale, weighed the nickel as 5 grams, which is correct. This scale weighed the nickel at 4 grams no matter where I placed it on the scale. The lowest weight I could actually get the scale to provide a reading on was the nickel at 4 grams. Anything less didn't register. Funny thing is the cheapest scale I bought turned out to be the most accurate. There are MUCH BETTER scales available than this one. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SCALE!
 Exactly what I wanted an expected.  Will be a valuable edition to my kitchen.  Operationally it works accurately and effectively.
 Delivered quickly. Batteries included. Lightweight and sleek look and feel. Very easy and accurate to use.
 good
 Works great, clean design
 I like everything about it except it is smaller than I expected. For weighing larger items, a bigger scale would be better.
 Nice design and good quality!
 I loved the material. Excellent!!!
 Very quality kitchen scale, attractive stainless steel surface, and set up and ready to use...
 Easy to use. Sturdy and flat shape makes it less cumbersome to have around. Really good quality.
 Doesn’t pick up certain surface textures. Very inaccurate at low weights as well.
 Certainly not for large measuring bowls - or anything bigger than a breakfast bowl.<br/>Batteries included!
 Reliable and sturdy. Do recommend. Bright, easily legible display.
 Its a good food scale.  Easy to use and easy to clean!
 Received and item was defective. Would turn on but not register anything on the screen.
 Very handy for the kitchen and other stuff too.
 I like the sleek look of it and it isnt bulky at all. I like that it is easy to figure out  as well. I would definitely refer someone to buy this. The price is also good for it.
 It drains the batteries so quickly if you leave them in ( even if scale is off) which is so unfortunate.
 Love this scale. Very well light and visible, firm clicking buttons, and measures in grams &amp; ounces. Absolutely recommend.
 It was exactly as described and the video provided before purchase was great...thanks!
 Weighing food
 I love it.  It's lightweight I can see clearly .
 Loved it! It does everything is says in the description.
 Great product. Compact and very precise.
 Didn't work very well
 Love this scale. I need one to control portions for my diabetic Mother and the tare feature is a big help. It weighs grams, ounces and, pounds. Very handy.
 It does not weigh all the time. I will need to purchase another brand.
 Bien
 Great little scale for the price
 Great digital scale to measure food, sleek look makes it a nice item to leave on your counter top.
 Excellent product
 Just receive the digital scale. I love the size. Works great. Would recommend this to others. Great product
 Does everything i need
 Excellent
 Good
 Superb! Good price, does things as advertised, lightweight and compact. Customer satisfaction achieved
 It's very affordable and reliable. I've had these brand for years.
 i am a hairstylist and use it for weighing hair color. The numbers are so nice and bright and clear to see.
 Great product...Thank You!
 excellent scale.  low profile, easy to use
 Great product! For the price, this is a truly great product. Any items I've seen of this caliber have been at least double or triple the price.
 Unfortunately, after one week of using this scale and 2 battery changes... the scale did not work at all.
 Smaller than I expected, so easy to tuck away when not in use. The flat surface and wide range makes it easy to use for all my kitchen needs.
 Nice product, simple control and nice LED screen. I like it!
 Works fine but it is just a little too small for my purposes
 Love this scale for weighing out food portions for meal preps for the week.
 Works perfectly every time. Consistent high quality measurement readings.
 Worked great for the price
 Display is hard to read from an angle.
 Faulty scale.4 ounces off
 pretty good
 It says in description that it can be used for postage but there is pretty much no way to do that unless your package is the size of like a ring box. This scale is pretty terrible. Just wasted $13. Might be ok for food purposes. wish it did not list "great for postage" in the description...totally not accurate! This scale is so tiny that you can not see what the weight of the package is on the screen when even a small box is placed on it.
 Works as expected.
 I use this multiple times a day to measure dog food, stock, treats. My dogs maintain a nice slender weight because there is no overfeeding. They are large 13-year-old dogs. We are at the vet every week or two for one thing or another and the one thing their doctor always compliments me on is their weight. My Kelpie gets 1.7 ounces dry food and my Shepherd mix gets 2.5 ounces (both three times daily), each 8 ounces of stock twice daily, and each 4 ounces of fresh veggies daily. They both have slim waists and rib cage definition. I can't stand seeing overweight dogs and cats, especially older ones. It's only a matter of time before they will slip a disc or sprain a joint.
 Works great!
 Works great
 I can't bet the scale to work.  I've tried several times over the past year.
 It stopped working 2 months into use.
 I bought two. They work well and are easy to clean and maintain.  Sleek looking, too.
 This fine piece of junk can't tell the difference between 10 grams and 2. Do not buy this.
 I use it daily! Great scale!
 Bought thus YEARS ago and it’s still going strong
 Awesome. Thanks
 Good scale.  Slightly small platform.  Easy to use for tare weight and change units of measurement.
 This broke after about a week of use.
 I like it's low profile. No surfaces or crevices where bits could be caught.  It is small and thin enough that it stores easily. Responds quickly to touch and then turns itself off to save the battery life.
 Good product for the price.
 Good size and functionality.
 Works perfectly &amp; is easy to clean. Easy to store.
 It is smaller than I thought ( I didn't look carefully at the dimensions, but it works well!
 Awesome scale, awesome price.  Accurate enough for my needs, easy to use.  5 stars!
 Wanted to see how accurate this was. Knowing that a nickel weighted only 5 grams. I put the scale to the test. It was right on. I also bought the Laser Grip infrared thermometer. Both were exceptional buys.
 Couldn’t turn it off
 works grate
 Perfect for my Paparazzi Business and weighing my jewelry!  Doesn't clutter my desk and is compact and was super reasonable! Would recommend to anyone!
 It was just what I was looking for
 Not very accurate
 Bought scale to weigh out herbs, but doesn't have mgs so I won't probably ever use it. Nice scale though.
 Love it! Thank you!
 love
 Light weight, small, precise, converts from grams to ounces, zero tare for bowls and containers, stores in a drawer,  Great buy!
 The use of very smooth, sensitive buttons, it is worth recommending。I like it.
 suiper simple, just works
 Can't ask for anything more. Accurate and easy to use, perfect for my weekly meal prep.
 Lightweights d easy to use
 Works great. Small enough to put away
 So easy to use! Small and convenient
 It doesn’t weigh grams in points. Example: 4g VS. 4.7g
 Works as advertised
 As described
 Great little scale to near your needs.
 just what I needed
 Very small and useful!
 Perfect for what we needed
 Good
 Excellent product and Great price!!
 Didn't weigh grams right at all. Went in the trash
 The scale is very accurate, easy to wipe clean and easy to read. It looks great on the counter. I am very happy with this purchase.
 works great!
 Very nice product ... exactly what I was looking for.
 Just got my scale today with my portion control containers and I can't wait to start using them!
 Great buy!
 Arrived on time.  Just as expected... awesome product!
 Useful ,
 i would give it a 4.5.  it does everything i need it to do, but as mentioned in other reviews, it does shut off quickly.
 Good , nice, clean look
 Excellent!  Doesn't take up a lot of room on the counter and looks good, too. Easy to use. Highly recommend.
 This scale works perfectly. I really like that it weighs to the nearest gram, making my measurements very precise.
 Efficient and cheap. Works great and is compact enough to tuck away in a drawer or cabinet.
 Love it.  Digital accuracy and doesn't take up very much room.
 Just as described
 Perfect and great price
 Very nice product a reasonable price
 Scale arrived damaged and broken
 Changed how I look at measuring food for my recipes. Accurate and great quality, plus it fits just about anywhere.
 Well worth the money. Easy to use, nice extra features.
 This scale is not sensitive.  I put ingredients on the scale and it registered a weight.  But when I would take off or add small amounts (as much as half the original amount) it didn't change.  It did this when I tried both ounces and grams.  Also the light and numbers timed out so quickly (maybe after 10 seconds or so) that trying to add ingredients and get a new weight is practically impossible because you have to start over every time it turns off. I kept the scale for a few days and tried it several times, always with the same frustrating results. I returned the item and the company Etekcit (not Amazon) sent me a new scale for free, but asked for a positive review.  I can't give one.  The scale doesn't work well.  Beware of incentivised reviews with this scale.
 This scale is very slim, easy to use and easy to clean which is a big factor for me. I would recommend this item to anyone.
 This is a great scale. Very small and does everything you need to do.  I would highly recommend this product.
 does what we need it to do
 I bought this for my wife and it is exactly what she wanted.  Well made and easy to use.
 Easy to use, Great Product!!
 Quick delivery and perfect product
 Great and reliable product. Love the fact I can zero it out before weighing to guarantee accurate weight.
 It was not acurate like it’s said on the description.
 very good quality using for portion control of food
 Stopped working after 1 week.  POS
 Nice kitchen scale! Easy to use and clean. I liked the fact that it uses AAA batteries instead of a coin battery, more convenient and easier to replace.
 Very easy to use! Small and compact. Great product at a great price!
 THis food scale is perfect for what I needed. Has the TARE option and is easy to clean and small to store.
 Lightweight, sleek, and user friendly. I like that it offers weight modes for OZ., ml., lb., and grams.
 It works.
 When reading the display as pounds/ounces, its a little confusing.  I always have to read it a second time to make sure I got it.
 I am using this scale as a postage scale as well as a food scale. It works great for both!!!
 Got this as a gift and my friend loves it! Says it works perfectly.
 Easy to use and an excellent product for a reasonable price!
 Great little kitchen scale!  I use it almost daily and I've never encountered a problem.
 Love it! Learning how to count my Marcos and this digital scale is perfect! Easy to use!
 Great looking and easy to use right out of the box.
 Great product, works perfectly for making drip coffee.
 Dont exactly weigth
 solid. simple. easy to use. batteries included was a nice touch. would buy again
 Great kitchen scale, we use it to weigh out our portions. Would be nice if you could weigh things below a gram though.
 Works good
 small but powerful...
 Great scale love the LCD which is very bright!
 works well
 Awesome scale, gets the job done.
 Too small and they gonna charge me $7 for return
 Weighs food. Good scale.
 like the sleek design and numbers are easy to read.
 Bought this product because it looked promising and durable. It stopped working within 2 weeks of buying it. Very disappointed.
 Easy to use!! I use it for portion control and it has been great right from the get go. Would recommend for anyone.
 Great scale and great customer service. Awesome price point and definitely worth the money
 Beautiful scale that works great.  Excellent customer service and quick shipping.
 Enjoying the use of this scale. It is sleek and compact making it perfect for storage.
 a little small but you get what you pay for
 This is a very nice scale.  It measures 5.5" x 7" so it's small enough to take with if traveling or away from home.  I'd purchase it again.
 Nice,lightweight product and great price
 I loved the scale initially, but it worked for only a few weeks.
 Very reliable product,i had one from Walmart which I bought for $15 and it's already broken.This product is worth the money.Thank you etekcity for an amazing product.
 I love how lightweight and small this scale is. Very convenient and does its job.
 Bought it to weigh some silver items. Works perfect so far! Shipped on time and purchase was easy!
 Liked how small and convenient this food scale was
 Lasted less than 1 week, stopped working. Won't buy again...
 Just like I expected it except super light and easy to use without the expensive price.
 Simple and straight forward. This item does what I need it to do.
 Would not recommend using it for herbs and spices. Scale is not sensitive to grams at all!
 It's easy to use &amp; has a small footprint!
 Stop working after just two weeks,
 Perfect
 I use this everyday. It is great for tracking portions and macros!
 Item only works sometimes.  I had this for less than three months.
 Easy to use straight out of the box. accurate and inexpensive! A very good deal.
 The scale is light weight and works great. It was packaged well and shipped as I was told when I ordered.
 Excellent product 👌🏻
 Extremely accurate and consistent. Durable and easy to keep clean.
 Good product!
 VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT
 Broke after 2 weeks. Do not recommend
 Best food scale ever. Small and convinient. The most important is the stainless steel surface is so easy to clean.
 It works just like advertised. These days that's asking a lot. Light weight. Accurate. Inexpensive. What more can I say.
 Originally worked great, but suddenly stopped working after less than a month of sporadic use.
 I love my scale.  It is so easy to read and lightweight.
 Indispensable for baking and portion control. The scale works as advertised, but it's the minor quibbles that makes it an ok product. Resolution is there for measuring grams, but poorly designed. LCD screen is very difficult to read unless you touch the scale to get it to light up. A normal LCD screen without back lighting that can be read easily would have been a better choice. The buttons are integrated onto the scale, so if you want to tare (or change the units), when you press the button, it reads your finger pressure, and doesn't tare until after a few seconds for the weight to stabilize again. Lastly, the auto-off is too short of a duration, so work quickly.
 Love
 Awesome product, perfect if you are trying to be very precise and in an easy way to get my macros as accurate as possible
 Works for me! Nice slim design.
 Great quality and very easy to use!!  I would definitely recommend this scale to family and friends!!
 Really great scale and the nice thing is you don't need that unusual battery that all the food scales have and you never have.
 I use it everyday and it is extremely easy to use. I have only had it for 2 or 3 weeks hopefully it holds up well.
 A very convenient scale for a broad use.
 Even though the scale is wrapped in plastic, it has scratches and smudges on the "stainless steel" that won't come off and should not be there for being new.
 Does what you need it to do.
 Nice little scale !!
 Works great!
 I used it everyday, works perfect!
 Works as directed. Simple to use. Clean look. Veryou accurate.
 I wanted an easy-to-use kitchen scale with tare. Its a good unit; works well. No complaints whatever.
 Received what I expected. Great.
 Very good product!
 Easy to use and easy to store!
 Just recently started getting into meal prepping and we needed a scale. This was one that I kept coming back to because of functionality and the price was great. We have been using it everyday since it was delivered and it's just perfect! It's so easy to use. so glad that I decided to buy this because it's made planning out our meals so much quicker and easier.
 Started out working pretty good but began to read inaccurately. I wouldn't recommend it
 Works very well! We love the display!
 Nice packaging and looks sleek on the counter. Easy to use with a great warranty. Great gift for nutritionist.
 Fantastic piece of equipment! Light, portable, durable, easy to use. I would buy another if need be.
 Thanks!!!
 Great for meal prep
 Perfect size.
 Does exactly what I want it do! Appreciate the good job on the nice looking product.
 Awesome scale! I use it daily :)
 Works great and doesn't take up a lot of space.
 Exactly what I wanted. Came in 2 days. It's all good.
 I could not read the display and tried everything. Return it.
 Works like a charm
 Stopped working after 6 months of use
 Love it! That simple.
 Does everything it claims to, works great. So happy with this product.
 Great product!
 1
 Small , simple and accurate. Great customer service as well!
 This scale doesn't weigh correctly won't even weigh less than a Gram or even over below 3 👎🏻
 Works great. Slides in a drawer nicely.
 Easy to use and seems accurate
 This scale stopped working almost immediately after I got it =(
 User friendly. Love the different weight settings. Works perfectly.
 Easy to use!
 Exactly what I wanted. My daughter ordered one too and she loves it. Lightweight and easy to read.
 very small and easy to use . easy to clean and portable . very happy with product
 Great scale at at a great price.  I like that it is light and thin making it easy to store. Light up display makes it easy to read.
 Not very accurate on small grams. Use teaspoon instead.
 Do NOT buy.  Does not read accurate measurements and does not read grams in decimals.
 Zero complaints.  Compact, accurate, stylish, reliable, and cheap.  Covers everything I could possibly want for a food scale.
 Numbers fluctuate when you leave it on.
 This is the second one of these I have purchased. The other one still works fine after six months, but, I needed two to weigh separate portions. Unless the quality goes down, I can't see me purchasing any other scales this one works so well for my needs.
 Advertised as having a backlight, backlight doesn't work at all. Cannot recommend. Will be returning.
 this thing is junk. it can be 10 gr off from one minute to the next. it just throws out random numbers.what a piece of
 Very dissatisfied with product and that I can't seem to contact anyone about it.
 Very nice little scale
 Good product at a good price. I've been using it for a couple weeks now. Simple and works as desired.
 Doesn't weigh small amounts well. Not satisfied at all
 Good for price.
 good
 Great scale.  Easy to read and works great.
 Cheap and accurate! What more could you ask for?
 The batteries that came with it were dead. I had to buy replacement batteries, but I almost returned the item. Overall it works great.
 The scale works just as needed. I would recommend this product.
 So far, this has been an excellent product.  It has great features and operates as described.
 Great scale for the price. Very accurate and i love that you can subtract whatever your plate measures.
 Great product.  Compact and easy to use.
 This scale isn't accurate at all! I can measure the same thing moments apart and get a totally different read. Very frustrating!
 Great small kitchen gadget. It is so small that I was laughing at its cuteness first time. It does its job just fine. Accuracy of Any balances is questionable. if you are not doing quantitative science with this balance, it should work fine.<br/><br/> I use this for baking desserts. I always have ingredients to weight nearby the balance so timed turn off was not a big deal for me. The balance turned off once bc I was searching one of my missing ingredient for some seconds (20-30??). I can see that this could be annoying;but its probably saving battery. The backlight goes off if I take few seconds to scoop the ingredient, but touch around the balance immediately brings the light back. It also comes back when the weight changes. You can see the number if its just backlight that went off. You dont see a number if machine is turned off. I like it so far.
 nice look, not yet in use but first check its ok, good for the money .
 When I got to use it it doesn't tell me the weight. The item has to be over 5grams for it to show a weight
 Scale is unstable
 Too small and works poorly
 This is a great little scale. It does everything as advertised.
 Excellent
 Accurate and very easy to use
 Works very well with a sleek design. Great bang for your buck!
 Every move around, it confuses and changes numbers
 Works great!
 Great product! Compact and user friendly.
 Scale is accurate for the price. The only down side is it's just a little to small. It does however work great for what I use it for.
 Love this scale. Super easy to use and very accurate.
 Stopped working, not too long after I bought it
 This was a father's day gift I don't know if the scale has been used
 Thus far a really good scale! It's my first one, so it's user friendly and haven't had any issues with it yet.
 Working just great - already more then a half year without changing a battery
 Great product
 The finish is sleek and the profile is very low, which is nice. The overall feel is a bit on the cheap side and there's a slightly creaky vibe, but that's unsurprising in such a cheap scale. The accuracy is passable, but it can't detect items less than a few grams and the measurements are only accurate to a few grams. Placement of the item being weighed also has a huge impact on the measured weight; moving the item an inch can cause the measurement to swing by 10%. The behavior of the idle timeout is quite annoying: after a few seconds the backlight turns off, making the scale very difficult to read. Then after a minute the whole scale turns off, losing your measurement.<br/><br/>Overall, the performance is passable for the price. It's a big step up over no scale, but isn't accurate enough for a receipt demanding high precision and it won't save you from having to use a measuring spoon for smaller quantities.
 The scale is exactly what I needed.  Very bright display and lovely finish.  I use it almost every day.
 Best scale I've used!
 As advertised
 Very nice. Works perfect. Nice design
 Makes preparing recipes by weight very simple
 Great scale, love the neat look - I even leave it out  looks so nice.  Best scale I have bought so far!
 I used it not more than 3 times and didn't turn on after that.
 Scale stopped working after 5 months of minimal uses. Don't waste your money!
 Does not take up much space and accurate.
 Excellent scale.  Slim and attractive.  Accurate with easy to read display.  Recommended!
 Works great! I use it all the time, it's very simple and user friendly.
 Just buy this thing. Your search for a kitchen scale is over. This is a amazingly accurate for one thing. And just look at it. It is a gorgeous scale and very eye pleasing if you want to leave it out on the counter. I got this for myself so I could keep more accurate records of what is going in my recipes and ultimately in my body. It has really been the center point of my diet since receiving. My boyfriend males fun of me for using it so much, but I'm losing weight and reaching my goals, so it doesn't matter. I would absolutely buy this again as absolutely highly recommend to everyone!
 Great Product!
 I am really happy with the performance and the thin shape of this scale, that also doesn't take a lot of space in my busy kitchen.
 I am very happy with this kitchen scale.  It is small, lightweight, accurate and can fit in the kitchen drawer.
 works perfectly, zeros with no problems, arrived on time.
 Works great &amp; easy to use
 Great scale.
 Broke on the first use<br/>VvvvvvvV
 Great quality, love the different options for measurement. Sleek.
 Had this less than 2 months and it's already broke and no longer works. Very dissatisfied.
 Great for my diet
 Works great. Extremely useful.
 Great product. Does what it says and has helped me keep an accurate account of how much I am eating.
 Nice product fast shipping
 Excellent!
 I bought this several months ago to keep track of my pet rat and pet rabbit weights. Having a small scale that I can weigh in grams for the rats and ounces for the rabbits is exactly what I needed! I've also been able to check the accuracy by weighing my rats on this and then weighing them at the vets office. The measurements have been exact to a small 2g difference, this can likely be related to how much rats move around, so I'd say it's very accurate!
 Works as intended and looks good
 Not very sensative.
 great!
 It broke in one month.
 Very fickle and scale is not precise at all.
 I use it for a month. It works well! It is easy to use and accurate. So I like it.
 Worked as described. Was able to bake with less mess and measuring cups. Easy to use.
 Just what I needed
 does not work piece of garb
 Works great!
 Love it
 The screen takes a bit long to load to zero. On the whole however a very good product. The metal finish really makes is stand out.
 Very easy to use, good quality, doesn't take up a lot of space and looks good. Great purchase!
 Works Well!! Light! Bright! I Love It!
 Great product! Love it!
 Came with scratches on it.
 Excellent scale
 Received product and liked the design and construction.  However, I could not get it to work.  With the batteries in the scale will turn on but will not weigh anything.  It constantly reads 0.  It will error out if you push on it and the function button will change the unit of measure between grams, ounces and ml, but it will not weigh anything.<br/><br/>I tried to contact the mfr through the website (live chat) and customer service number provided but the chat was always offline (even during the periods the documentation said it was open) and the customer service number went to an answering machine the 3 times I called.<br/><br/>I am returning it today.
 Very easy to use
 broke after 1 month.  On off button worked intermittently then died.  I was not paid to review this product......
 This scale is amazing and easy to use right out of the box!
 Works fine for me, nice product.
 Scale worked great when received.  Next day, didn't work at all.
 Just fantastic. Easy to use. Perfect for the kitchen and for your small shipping packages.
 Surprised at small size, appeared bigger in picture.  My mistake, but it works just fine and the smaller size is actually a benefit.
 So far it is a good buy for the $
 Easy to use, elegant appearance. Perfect!
 good
 Product works great and was shipped and delivered within 5 days. Definitely would recommend!
 too small
 I just received it but it looks and works great so far.
 Very useful for weighing jewelry.
 Good compact scale easy to see and use.
 Does the job very well. Really lightweight and easy to store, clear display.
 I haven't had any issues with this scale.  I bought it to weigh chickens after I butcher them.  I find this product to be a nice value.
 Easy to use. The company has awesome customer service should you have any issues/concerns!
 LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. I use it everyday and can't imagine a day without it!
 Works perfectly for what I need. Stylish design and great quality
 Works well and wroth the money.
 Awesome! I use this everyday. The shipment came very quickly and I immediately started using it! Favorite purchase, works really well.
 I am using the scale to weigh Yarn and it is wonderful.
 great for small jobs easy to clean easy to read
 Could be a little larger
 The people who have it think it's wonderful.
 Great Deal. Very Happy.  Works great.  Does exactly what I need it to do.  Slim and rectangular.  It barely takes up any space.  Buy it.
 Great scale
 Amazing!
 Exactly what I was looking for in a general kitchen scale.  Easy to use, good price.
 Easy to use and great that it comes with batteries in the package!
 Super user friendly!!
 does not work properly at all,...<br/>BOO !!!
 I was looking for a kitchen scale and I am so happy I deceided to buy this one-it is everything I expected and more.<br/>I love it. It cleans up so easy and very compact. I would recommend this scale to all my friends and family.
 Easy to use!
 Accurate!!!!
 not so sure its accurate
 Works great.
 Easy to use, sleek appearance. Love the product!
 Does what it promises. And is fairly accurate
 Works perfectly~!
 Compact size! I like it.
 Nice!
 It did what it was supposed to do.
 Came damaged on one side. one of the legs also broke off after one day of use.<br/><br/>Very disappointed.
 Looks nice, easy to use.
 Very useful and precise.
 Doesn't read correctly is off by .1-.4
 So far good
 Not happy at all this scale is not accurate messed up dinner due to this bad boy
 It’s great
 Works well
 Works as described<br/>Great price<br/>Recommend!
 I've never had a kitchen scale. This one is perfect. It's simple, and so slim it takes up almost no space in my little kitchen.
 Works great, love it! I like that it has normal  batteries too and not the watch type.
 Amazing scale for food prep. It meets my needs.
 Great tool! Easy to use!
 This scale is light and easy to move. Streamlined easy use and keep clean.
 It's really good!
 I really like the size and simplicity of the scale.  And I like that how the parts fit together so tightly (almost as one piece) such that food/liquid/etc. can't build up in any gaps/cracks.  I can also clean this whole thing with a damp cloth without worrying about any moisture ingress through the joints.  My only small issue is that the display gets covered up by any normal size dinner plate, so you have to really squat down and perform some head &amp; neck craning to get the reading.
 only lasted a year
 Quit working in less than 4 months.
 Fantastic scale! Very sensitive, sleek and works exactly as expected!
 Great scale. Very inexpensive.
 works absolutely great. i get perfect measurements on my ingredients.
 Does what it says it does. Pretty happy with it so far.
 Well made, happy with this.
 Perfect scale to have on hand at home or to take with you out to eat. I love the compact size of it.
 Works great
 Great little thing...converts to grams too!
 Insanely fast delivery! Great product too!
 Scale is great, effective and can be put away anywhere. Bright screen to help see better, love it!
 Really Good!!!!!
 For the price and the commensurate use, great product for the price.  Perfect gift.
 My is off by about an oz
 Seems pretty accurate for everything. I mainly use it for weighing my package that I'm going to ship out.
 Great scale. Easy to use. Very happy with this purchase.
 Clean design, simple to use. Scale consistently reports my test object's weight after turning off/on, moving the scale, etc.
 It's nice and compact and does not take up a lot of room.
 Exactly as promised.  Small and unobtrusive on counter.  Easily deducts weight of plate or bowl.
 Absolutely love this scale. Exactly as describe, and received it sooner than expected!
 Well-designed and well-proportioned, quality look and feel. Readout is clear and bright. Function so far is flawless. I spent a lot of time comparing various brands and prices — in truth, way too much time. Given the features and precision of measurement, the Etekcity is an outstanding value.
 The scale is very compact making it easy to store. Has done a good job until now (3 days).
 The battery door was broken upon arrival. (I had to use tape to keep it closed.) I couldn’t turn it off after holding down the button for 2 seconds (as instructed). The auto turn off was quick and turned it off within a minute.Other than that the scale works great.
 Works great however I did not see an option to switch to grams.
 Great scale
 Not accurate to 1 gram.
 works
 This scale worked fine for the first few months. Then it began to be "off", even after I switched the batteries out. I wasn't expecting it to last forever, but I was hoping for at least a solid year.<br/><br/>Updated review: The makers of this scale worked efficiently and quickly to resolve my issue. Upon learning of the failings of the first scale, they very graciously sent me a new one (with no hassle). It is working fine, and I am impressed with the professionalism.
 I needed it to support my keto diet, which has worked phenomenally well. Try not to get water or liquid under the glass. I was recommended by Joseph Joey Burzynski @marketkarma submitted by Miami financial advisor Charles J. Zimmerer. Steel to and plastic bottom, don't drop. would recommend.
 Very light and take up small space in the kitchen. the scale is very accuarte.
 Scale is way off<br/>No customer service
 Product wouldn’t work at all!!!!
 love the mL feature
 Dead on arrival. Now, I have to go out of my way to return the item for a refund.
 Fantastic product!  Works extremely well!
 Good
 great little food scale.<br/>works great and accurate.
 so far so good
 Love this food scale!  Perfect size and super simple!!!
 nice compact and light. worked as it should.
 Work good so far.
 Recieved on time and the scale is accurate.
 It's very handy and light weight. I like it alot and it gets very good service
 Display broke within one week of owning it.
 Easy to use. Works great. Easy to clean.
 This is a nice scale.  It's reliable and accurate.  I tested it out with known weights and placed them in various places around the scale.  It has the same correct reading no matter where I put the weight.  It also seems to be accurate with both heavy weights and extremely light ones.  It's a good product and priced very well.  On top of that, it actually looks nice.  My wife doesn't make me put it away when I leave it out.
 It works!
 Not size. Doesn't take lots of counter space. Easy to use
 Great scale
 not sensitive enough for weighing of the weight that was 3g or below. The turn button is very hard to make it work.
 Awesome food scale!
 works wonderful. enjoy baking
 Satisfies every expectation we had for a digital scale.
 Great product, like the compact size, great value.
 I really love this scale, probably one the best buys for the price!
 👌🏻

 I bought this scale on May 22nd. I really liked it until today when it stopped working. It lasted just over a month:(
 Portable and accurate.
 Great  product ,very  pleased  with  it !
 The scale seems accurate. Great for measuring out exact quantities for weekly meal prep.
 TRUE RESULTS!<br/>I started using it and it's very simple!
 Exactly what I wanted. Very easy to use.
 It was great for the 3 months that it actually worked.
 its the best.
 Terrible measurement! Waste me a dozen of eggs, sugar and flour!
 Have an year warranty period .
 perfect scale for meal prep!
 small but easy to use and large digital display.
 Came on time, works well, really like the sleek design.
 Simple and easy to use. Looks nice and doesn't feel super cheap materials like others.
 It works. It's small, the LED is a little hard to read, the battery cover has come loose a couple of times and throws the weight off, but most importantly the display turns off after a few seconds which is super annoying. Went with another scale.
 Great kitchen scale
 Great Great Great!!!
 My cooks love it!
 It's not accurate!!
 Packaged very well.  Item is sleek and I love the back lit function.
 Easy to use. Lightweight.
 I really like this food scale, it's very convenient. Thanks

 Just arrived, and no problems so far.  Good price.

 Takes some getting use to.
 I like it a lot, it has everything I needed in one place..
 So easy to use. Very happy with it.
 very good
 Does the job, thanks
 It's not working properly...disappointed
 its not accurate......especially when it comes to single digit. when I only need few grams of sugar. I couldn't rely on it. I will see the number form 5 just jump to 10. I think maybe bc it read slow, so when I keeping pouring small amount flour or sugar, I can't get the instant number.<br/><br/>After the review, the company reached out, and offered full refund, they are really listening customer's question.
 loved it! easy to use.
 Arrived broken. On/Off Tare button doesn't work.
 terrific!!!
 Works great and has lots of measurement options.
 Works great
 Pretty accurate measuring good for diet

 Great product, great price, all around satisfied with the product!
 Great scale
 It works like a charm and is compact, too.
 Perfect for weighing our food.
 poor design
 Easy to use, easy to store, and attractive.
 I've had this scale now for almost a year and been working fine. I use it mainly to measure out ingredients when I'm baking (breads, pastries etc) and none of the baked goods so far have turned out badly so I'm assuming the measurements are accurate. There are two issues that I have with the scale: One thing that I don't really like is the 10 second auto-turn off at the scale seems to have. I'll tare the scale, turn around to grab whatever I need to measure out and it'll be off. Another thing is that recently I've had negative mass (how does that happen?) after putting something onto the scale after taring. After taring repeatedly, it seems to clear itself and be functioning normally again and I'm hoping that this issue won't continue to get worse in the future.
 As advertised
 Great product, easy to use
 Exceeded my expectations.
 great scale super technological and accurate! totally recomend it
 It works great, it looks great and the price was right!
 timely delivery and as described
 Didn't measur grams well
 It doesn't work. Very disappointed
 Perfect! Exactly what I needed!
 Works great! Simple scale that works like a charm.
 Quite flimsy.
 Received item quickly very please easy to set up and use
 Awesome thank you
 Great food scale. Very easy to use.
 simple sleek multiple measure options
 I wish I had noticed that it does not have pounds. That's all!
 Great little scale. I've used it for weighing all sorts or backpacking gear and food packages. It's convenient that it came with the battery included saving a trip to the store to buy a watch battery. You can weigh in either grams or ounces and you can zero out the tare weight if you are weighing something in a container. I recommend it!
 perfect for jewelry weight
 Great product. Highly recommend.
 great prouct and Fast Ship
 For $10 this product was an absolute steal! And it even came with batteries which I wasn't expecting. I tested it out with weights and it's extremely accurate. The nonslip pads on the bottom are okay. I don't know if it's just my counter top but it did seem to slide a bit too easily in my opinion. Overall this is a wonderful product especially for the price I purchased it at. I would definitely recommend this to all my friends. So happy I finally got a kitchen scale in my life :)
 Great product
 Perfect for baking use
 Works great love it!
 Works great, easy to use and fits anywhere
 Everything that you can expect from a good food scale!
 Great product !!!
 So cute and convenient!
 Not accurate at all!
 I like the weight scale It's just what I wanted it to be.
 Great little scale that performs exceptionally well.
 I should have known something was wrong when  I had to turn the scale on and off a few times to get the scale to function the first time I used it (weighed a few potatoes). The second time O went to use it the screen was just blank. I tried waiting. I tried turning it off and on again. Nothing. Then I replaced the batteries. It wouldn't  even turn on. Piece of junk if you ask me.
 Purchased this scale in Spring 2016 for our Garden Manager to weigh produce we harvested as part of a trial in our company garden. She loved it and took very good care of it, storing it in the original box when it wasn't being used. This year she took it out to use it again, and noticed the spring in the battery compartment came out. She gave it to our Maintenance Manager to fix, which he did--but it quickly caught on fire once he put the batteries back in. Needless to say, it was disposed of and now we have to purchase another one. Luckily this item is inexpensive, but if we have to replace it every year after minimal seasonal use, then we may look at purchasing a different one. Keeping our fingers crossed this one doesn't break.
 Great scall for the price. Very sharp and does take much space.
 great product as described
 Excellent product --easy to use
 It came broken.
 Great product
 Just got mine today and it doesn't work
 Very stylish and accurate.
 Just what I expected I use it daily
 Had my last kitchen scale for 15 years; and it finally quit doing the job.  This is working great.  I like that it is light weight and that you can change between pounds, grams, ounces, etc so easily.  I use my scale quite a lot as a do a lot of baking, canning, cooking; so my hope is that this will get me through another 15 years.
 Easy to use
 Does what it's supposed to do. Weighs things. Seems accurate.
 Best scale I've ever owned
 Works well and is light weight/portable.
 Very lightweight and easy to use.
 Scale did not work when it arrived.
 Accurate.
 Was damaged
 Too Small
 Very happy with this purchase. . Easy to use.
 Returned  dead on arrival.
 Great little scale.  Replaced a Salton that we'd bought many years ago and finally died; this one is better - easier to read, and a few more options in the programming.  Have enjoyed it so far (one month).
 Works well.
 Verry poor quallity
 great for daily kitchen use
 I like it!!!!!
 Accurate
 Great scale
 I like the ease of use with this to measure my food.
 Small just what I needed
 It is as said
 Good scale for food.
 Works. Handy. Fits in cook book shelf out of the way.
 It works well.  I like how you can change the units from grams to oz, etc.; turns itself off.  Sometimes you have to get creative with what you use to place the items on such as a plate, because it can get tricky to see the numbers with a big plate covering them up.  So I try to weigh most items with something that is more cylindrical than plate-shaped. Easy to zero out whatever you use to the place the food on to weigh if you can use the scale itself due to volume or size.  Hardly takes up any counter-space. Expectations met.
 great
 Easy to clean and reliable.
 
 Excellent item. Excellent Service.
 Nice little scale, worth every penny.
 This is a great scale. Easy to read, use and clean.
 The scale is exactly what I wanted to help with my diet.  I like being able to weight either in ounces or grams because of different recipes.  The scale is accurate, easy to read and very easy to clean.  I'm very glad that I purchased this particular scale after comparing it with several others.
 Works great
 Simple. Cheap. Just what I needed.
 Small, accurate, and easy to use!
 I love the slim size and shape of the scale… I needed one for a very strict I was getting ready to embark on.  Fulfilled my needs perfectly. And with the small footprint of it I was able to pack it in my tiny cooler and we needed to go out of town to use it on the road as well. Great scale.
 Works very well and fast!
 good stuff
 Works great, easy to adjust
 Very nice scale. it's accurate than my old one.
 The product I received did not work as advertised. It may have been a defective unit, but when a scale that is supposed to be precise weighs the same item differently each and every time you put the same item on it, there is a problem.  I like the design and size - but a scale is only as good as how it measures.  I am returning this item and will search for a more reliable product.
 Honestly don't know the hype behind this, other than the price point. I bought this scale two weeks ago and have used it maybe 3 times, for very small weight food items. When not in use, I keep the scale in its original packaging. Turn it on today and screen turns on and is completely blank, does not show any measurements, or show any numbers to tare to 0.00. I have tried turning on and off multiple times, even changed the batteries. Will be returning even though the price point is so low, didn't think 4000+ reviews would let me down. Ironically says it was quality checked on the back of the scale.
 Works great.
 Love it! It was bigger then expected
 Great food scale. Nice and small.
 Works well
 very handy, space saver
 Works great.
 i love it
 Is very help to have it
 This kitchen scale pretty awesome :)
 I received an unheard of and unexpected email from their customer service to see how the product was working.  I explained it had soms issues.<br/>The rep said some get damaged in shipping and offered a free replacement with no return necessary.  The new one works great - just like advertised.  Great product and outstanding customer service.  I'd buy it and from them again.
 Decently priced and works great! :)
 I bought this scale to weight my food. Works well, no problems and I've had it for over a month. If you dropped it though it would probably break. Uses two AA batteries.
 Great item
 Work great! Mos def recommend
 Simple and precise
 Very nice and inexpensive
 This is small and hard to read if you need to place a plate on it.  I thought it would be OK for that, but the position of the screen makes it very hard to tell what the readout is when a plate is on it.  Does seem to be accurate, but is hard to measure at times
 Small and thin
 Horrible. I purchased this one because my old looking scale was getting taken everywhere and I need two. Now, I still take the old scale everywhere! This is NOT accurate. Three grams is three grams, and it will not show on the display. I put three grams on my crappy scale, and perfect. If you count macros and are serious about results, please refrain from purchasing this scale.
 It's alright.
 It never worked out of the box. Change the batteries twice, spent an entire day fooling with it, never did anything but scatter numbers up and down and never would 0. Waste of money sending back. I would give it to 0 Stars if I could
 Excellent scale for the price.
 It seems like everyone else is happy with their scale. I've discovered that mine isn't always accurate. I've tested it with a 50g weight and it registers anywhere from 48 grams to 52 grams. I'm bummed, everything else about the scale is great: the size, the display, the stainless steel look. I can't use a scale that isn't accurate though.
 It does what I need it to do
 I purchased this for pour over coffee. Scale looks nice and when checking weight it is accurate. However, when attempting to weigh coffee beans, it did not register weight increases when I was slowing adding beans to hit a certain amount of grams. When it finally registered a weight increase, I was well over the amount I was trying to weigh which I noticed after checking on two other scales. I would say it's a great scale if you are weighing heavier objects.
 This works perfectly! Big enough for even meat (I use a bowl then zero the scale) and I love that it tells me grams too because sometimes a recipe calls for grams and it saves me time having to convert! Small enough to fit in my kitchen drawer!
 Terrible scale IMO. I've tried weighing a few grams of spices several times but it just shows 0g until I get about 5 grams on there, then it jumps up to 5g. Glad I only paid $10 for it as it's going straight into the garbage.
 I so love this mini scale  help a lots in my kitchen
 Great for the money. Gets the job done
 Great scale 👍👍👍

I weighed same thing a few times and the weight was different each time. Also this scale can weigh the air...? There was nothing on it and it was showing 36 gr, then 37gr, 38, 39 etc., then it turned off and turned back on itself.  Idk maybe I just got a defective one.
 nice
 great product.
 did not like this scale found it not very useful at all.<br/>it shuts off too fast very slow in reading weight.<br/><br/>maybe it was me but you don't need to be a rocket scientist to work a scale.
 An egg according to the nutrition label is 70 calories. A gram of fat contains 9 calories and a gram of protein contains 4 calories. I put the egg on the scale and it's telling me it weighs 62 grams. So let's so on average an egg contains 6.5 calories per gram. Thats 62*6.5 = 403 calories. Your scale is telling me an egg has roughly 400 calories.
 I hate this scale. It is NOT accurate at all. Every time I place an item on it, the grams keep going up one by one. What the heck. I am very disappointed as the quality of this scale is poor. It looks so cheap and has scratches on it.<br/><br/>Absolutely horrible.
 Was the perfect kitchen scale for someone like myself just getting into food prep that wanted a more accurate way to measure portion! At such an affordable price, it really is hard to go wrong. I have purchased Etekcity products in the past that have held up for years so I am more than confident in the quality the company produces. Will be ordering another to put at the lake house and maybe one for my parents!
 For the price, it's a really good scale. Comes in handy not only when I weigh my food but also when I make DIY body products and need to measure out my ingredients.
 I, too, was looking for a not too big - but accurate- scale for my kitchen.<br/>When the scale arrived, I checked the accuracy by using water. I started with<br/>a cup of water and then, selecting the tare, added 1/2 cup more. I then poured<br/>the water into my glass measuring cup. Perfect! I have not used the item for more complicated<br/>measurements, yet. I hope it will continue to be true.
 Reasonable priced !! very satisfied!!  item arrived as described, fast shipped and well packed!
 We were looking for a scale to help us measure out food portions at home, and this has been a great tool in the kitchen. Some home kitchen scales are not accurate. This kitchen scale works wonderfully and it is a fraction of the cost of the big name brand scale that has the same features.
 Excellent product with good custom4er service, price, quality, shipping , packaging etc. Would recommend to anyone weighing one gram or higher.
 It does exactly what was described, and is easy to use.  The only problem is the size. It is a little smaller than I had expected.  When trying to weigh food on a larger size snack plate (about 9x9), you can't see the weight display.  The plate has to be moved back, and then the food has to be placed to the front of the plate.  This increases the chance of the plate tipping off the scale and causing a mess to have to be cleaned up.
 Great deal for the price. It has been super useful in keeping track of the growth of my breaded dragon and ball python. :)
 Amazing scale for the price! Not only does it look great but it has a 2 YEAR warranty if you register it within 7 days of it arriving at your home. Very happy with the product so far.
 I've had this for about a year and a half and I am in love with it. I use it every single day and it works perfectly. Great value!
 Such a great investment and works great!
 worked ok for a while then broke after 5 months
 This scale stinks. The weight changes every second, and when I try to reset it to get a more accurate reading, I get a completely different weight the next time. Save your money and buy something different.
 I got a new one. It is working well. Nothing problem to use it.  I love it. Thank u !!!
 I have enjoyed using this scale.  It is VERY easy to us for measure out my herbs.
 Love the look. It's accurate, quick, and easy to use. Use it every morning to measure my coffee
 Fit and finish on the product could be better, otherwise it is decent for the price point.
 I actually bought this to weigh kittens. It was much smaller than I expected. After 2 weeks the kittens outgrew it.
 Read the dimensions. Really small item and looks like a toy scale. Not large enough to prepare meals.
 I received this scale today. Right out of the box, it looks cheaply made. The deal breaker for me is the bright purple backlight on the display that makes the digits hard to read. I am returning this scale.
 good
 Recommended at Johns Hopkins Hospital by a nutritional specialist for it's accuracy and value. Seems to be reliable and well performing.
 Easy to read and small enough to fit on my limited counterspace :)
 Our bread-making saw an instant improvement when moving from volume measurement to mass measurement. It stores easily, it's user friendly, and it's durable
 Purchased in March 2017. We have used a handyman of times when we buy bulk burger or cheese. It will not work anymore. Just stopped working. You get what you pay for. I would not recommend this product.
 It is exactly what I needed. Easy to read and user friendly.
 It works great.  Now that I have tried weight as a way to measure amounts I will never be without a scale again.
 This thing does not do well with any moister. I had too much cleaner on my rag when I wiped it down and it wasn't working right after that.
 Too small for my kitchen use. Didn’t weigh in pounds.
 either it doesn't work or I'm too dumb to understand it ???
 Smaller than i thought it would be, but works greats
 Had for less than two months and stopped working :(
 Zero stars. Piece of junk quit working after less than 3 weeks. If you buy one don't lose the tiny pamphlet that comes with it, because user manuals are not available online. I had to call the company for assistance (what is this, 1952?). Product has a warranty so I get my money back, but I will never get a product from Etekcity again
 The item never worked. Wish I could return it
 Great little scale. Accurate, easy to clean, small in size. Seller was fast and efficient.
 Love this product! Quality as described~
 Not accurate enough for any real use.
 Don't waste your money.  This thing is complete garbage.
 Really good quality product
 works great,but is to small.
 It's crap. Looks nice. Paper weight with batteries.
 cheap quality, works though.
 Great looking and functions!
 great machine
 It sucks at first I used it to weigh my food but it was really off. I later on used it  to weigh my weed and it was still off. I recommend you save your money and buy a scale that's a little better.
 Works good
 Are you kidding me? This scale absolutely sucks. The power/tare button doesn't even work! I have to take out the batteries just to turn this thing on or off, and I have to pray that it actually settles at 0g. Its terrible at measuring small amounts. Terrible purchase, I want a refund.
 It's OK
 Need to change better every day
 Game changer for us to complete the RP diet. Very straightforward and easy to use.
 Item does not turn on with provided AAA batteries. I switched them out for new AAA batteries and it still does not work! The product never even had a plastic strip to pull. Will be returning this item!
 Simple, sleek, functional, cheap.
 Unit works good
 compact, very easy to use, good accuracy
 Highly upset with this product. The LED screen does not work, it lights up but it doesn't show any digital numbers. I tried to change the batteries and multiple things but still no luck. I can't weigh my food and this was a waste of money.
 A+
 Worked initially and then simply stopped giving accurate readings. Compared to another scale and this one was way off. Waste of money. Would not purchase again
 Great product, good quality!!
 Can handle a lot of weight, but is rather inaccurate and somewhat janky, sometimes not even registering after placing large amounts on it.
 I have a VERY small food business and I use scales for measuring a bunch of different food-related things.  This lasted me about a month, probably 10 working days worth.  I don't know if it got slightly wet and shorted something out or what, but I can definitely not recommend something that doesn't last.  And I don't think that was just mine, I think that probably any of them would've stopped working.  They're crappy cheap scales, what can I say.  Also, the scale always resets &amp; turns itself off in like 2 minutes or something, which is horrible for me because I need something that lasts at least 10 minutes, and preferably never turns off/forgets.
 Works great.
 It's pretty cool light weight. No complaints so far feels cheaply made tho
 Display is significantly different in color and readability than advertised. Disappointed.
 Sleek and looks good on my counter.  Much less bulky than the last scale I had so it takes up less space in the kitchen or drawer.  Would definitely order this again!
 Small
 Dry stuff only not water resistant at all. It looks super nice, performs well.  Customer service is top notch!
 Small &amp; sleek!  Perfect for measuring food portions.
 very accurate and my wife loves the design. She is thrilled! ;-)
 Is not sensitive enough to recognize any weight under about a quarter to half ounce. For example if I put 2 bunches parsley it gives me the weight but if I only put one then fugget about it
 Just received my scale. Curious as to the milk/water labels on the front. I did not see<br/>anything in the instructions about milk/water weights. How do you use those functions?
 It's ok -
 Worked fine first few weeks and now inaccurate and doesn't measure below 3 grams. Would return it if I could.
 If I could leave a zero I would. Completely inaccurate, you could weigh something RE tare and it would give me 0.00 take off the thing your weighing and still says 0.00! I don't trust it one bit.
 It came in the mail broken............
 It's just ok. A little buggy sometimes.
 Waste of monet. Not durable.. it fell off the counter and won't work. Changed batteries and just says "overload"
 A very nice scale.  Easy to operate and does exactly what I need.  I especially like the size.  Fits anywhere, even a drawer.
 This scale is just the right size for weighing my food for meal prepping.
 Works as expected and at a great price.
 Broke in two weeks. Junk!
 Great price, works well!
 Easy to use.  Easy to clean.  It's got a permanent place in our kitchen.
 A little small.
 This product is very easy to use and looks nice sitting on the counter. Love the color of it also.
 Sort of faulty and works when it wants but you get what you pay for
 It's the most horrible scale I have ever had<br/>It's buttons are hard and wouldn't tarr or zero as needed<br/>And the calibration is Aweful<br/>They are charging me extra to return hence m stuck with it
 Love this!!
 Excellent Value for the money! and extremely accurate. I compared it to a scale that was 5x the cost of this one and they were exactly the same. Also find this unit very stylish and very reasonably priced I particularly like he large display. Only thing to change the unit of measurement there's a small button on the bottom of the scale that you have to press to convert to other units of measurements, I had to practically read the whole manual before I found it so it you want to go from lbs to ounces just look for a small button on the bottom of the scale and press the small button and it will activate the conversion. Only other thing is I just wish the backlight was blue but that's minor and i've already grown used to the white backlight. Great little stylist unit I think you will enjoy it.<br/><br/> Tom j
 All good
 Stainless is high class.
 This thing is a peice of crap. Reads all over the place and is not a match for the competition
 It turns off while weighing so it wont work if one continuously add ingredients in a container.
 Nice size and accuracy
 good
 Buttons are hard to push
 Love the sleek, space-saving design.  Easy transaction and great price...fast delivery.
 STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE ITEM FOR YOUR CUSTOMER, DIDN'T EVEN WORK
 I just returned from cooking school in Italy and these are perfect for converting &amp; measuring ingredients using Italian recipes.
 It is too small like hand !!
 Delicious. Tastes great and works well with my diet. I'm definitely buying more.
 Works great!
 Love this scale. Easy to use and very accurate. Best scale for the price hands down.
 If I buy an ounce of weed I can weigh it before I pay it.
 Great product,great service,  Thanks, Roger
 Nice little scale!
 this thing is consistently accurate. I do not think it is worth the money
 Simple to use and very accurate. Love it.
 Very bad quality and inaccurate. Feels like it's coming apart!
 This has met my expectations. It is easy to us, clean, and store.
 This scale is accurate and  easy to use.
 Bought October 7, already stopped working!
 It dose work.
 I could not get it to calibrate so sent it back.  It would have been perfect otherwise.  I was disappointed.
 Perfect size, easy to use. Love it!
 Useful and sleek, as described.
 Did work want a refund
 excelentes
 Awesome product! Good Job!
 It's to small
 Do not show half mark
 Works great!
 Bought because I thought it looked nice, but even buying it new when it arrived it came all scratched and scuffed up. Works fine though accuracy seems shoddy, e.g. weighing the same thing twice and sometimes getting slightly different results. Overall would not recommend.
 Poor build quality. Display is very dim and very hard to read. Also anytime you press any of the buttons the weight sensor triggers and it tries to re-calibrate the item which it is weighing. Overall not pleased. Looks nice but that's all. Does not function well enough to suit use. Returning the item.
 The scale seems to work well, and my only disappointment is that the batteries had leaked all over everything and I could not use them. A pair of my own AAA's worked fine.
 Don't buy these if you accurate measurements.  I purchased four of the scales for my salon. They intermittently stop adding weight so your measurements are off.  We will start to add color and the scale remains at 0 g. After numerous times of trying to figure out the inconsistency like uneven surfaces, bowl being centered on scale.  We could not duplicate issue consistently so it must just be a cheap product.  We even did a test of We also did a experiment of taking the bowl off and putting it back on and got different readings each time. I just clicked onto return and found I missed the return date by two days. I just threw about $50 down the drain so at least I can hopefully help someone else not make the wrong choice.
 This scale is terribly imprecise.  It often will not register small amounts of material.  It definitely does not have a resolution of 0.01 oz.  The resolution should be listed as 0.04 oz as that is the smallest change I have ever seen it make.
 Worked great for 30 days and then died. Would not recommend
 Works ok for small items, but when needing to weight out big items or anything worth weighting, not that accurate wish i paid the extra money for a bigger scale. guess it would be good if not needing it to weight food.
 The thing is not 100% accurate. It is a few ounces off so I am not very pleased with that. The instructions say it can be calibrated using the correct tools which I don't have and am not going to spend more money to buy. I guess you get what you pay for. It is ok to get an idea on kitchen measurements but should not be used for exact weights unless you can calibrate it.
 I was so excited to own this scale to help me in my fitness journey. I do weekly meal prep, so I would only use the scale once a week to measure out my portions. The first 2 weeks the scale worked fine, but on the third week things started to go downhill. The scale would malfunction when I would try to change the unit if measurement and would shut off. I thought it might be the batteries (a bit disappointing as it was only used two times before). I changed the batteries to see if that would help. It seemed to fix the problem, but only momentarily. The next week I ran into the same issue and started getting strange readings. Feeling dejected, i changed the batteries again. Now the scale won't even turn on! (Yes they are in correctly) Either the scale is draining batteries of their juices very quickly or something is inherently off.<br/><br/>The measurements aren't even that precise. I recognize that I shouldn't expect scientific precision, but I expected it to at least work so that I could know in what ballpark my portions are in. Of course all of this fussing with the scale put me outside of the return period, so now I'm stuck with a worthless piece of junk in my kitchen.
 This was great when I first opened it. I weighed my lunch and counted my calories. Then I came back from work to see that this was giving me a "Lo" battery warning. I figured maybe the batteries included were cheap, so I swapped in a fresh pair. The next day I come home to see my batteries had been drained again. I feel ripped off and now I need to go through the hassle of finding a UPS to ship this back. Spring the extra few bucks for a better model.
 it's not good
 Not good at all, it doesn't work!
 Innacurate and inconsistent.
 Functions well, but I was pretty irritated that I was led to believe the LCD display was purple. Thats literally the only reason I purchased this particular one. The LCD display is just as plain as can be. Not happy with the purchase at all.
 ☺
 was not accurate
 Right after I received this in the mail, my house sold, and it got packed before I took it out of the box.
 I just bought this couple weeks ago for $14.00 from same seller and now its for $8.90 :P
 This scale arrived defective.  It was very important for me that it worked the day I received it and it was worthless. It was weighing things all over the place.  I contacted support by email but there was no reply for over a day.  I then contacted Amazon who immediately sent me a label to return it to them.  I ordered a different brand and it came today and works perfectly!
 The scale is small, lightweight, attractive and easy to store. But, for practical use, this scale does not meet my needs.  Two important items I want in a scale are missing.  First the scale does not weigh in fractions of a gram.  It weighs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. grams.  Sometimes I want to weigh 1.5 grams of something, but the scale won't do it.  Second, the auto-off causes the scale to turn itself off too quickly.  For example, when I want to weigh 50 grams of flour, I might have started out by putting only 40 grams of flour on the scale.  By the time I put my scoop back into the flour bag to get more flour, the scale has turned itself off and I have to start completely over.
 I almost wonder if all these reviews on here are bogus (none are "verified purchases").  I can't comment on this scale's accuracy (because I didn't use it). I sent it back right after I took it out of the box. The scale is very light. The back is made of a low quality plastic, and the legs are very flimsy. The front was covered in a scratched up plastic foil. Very cheap looking. Not what I was expecting after reading all the previous reviews.
 i bought this to weigh myself but it is way too small and i ended up breaking it.  i do not suggest this
 Moving into a new place found me outfitting it with new stuff I found I needed, in addition to a few other things I felt would be nice. A scale was something I felt would always be nice to have but never really got around to getting. Took a quick peek on Amazon and found this.<br/><br/>Saw it was fairly cheap compared to other digital scales, decided to give it a try.<br/><br/>Arrived in a rather plain-looking box, tightly packed in styrofoam and wrapped in plastic casing. Off the bat I noticed a few blemishes on the flat of the scale but they are not detracting from the actual product's appearance, which is quite elegant and modernistic, while at the same time being quaint and modest.<br/><br/>Decided to test it out, threw a few pre-measured food items on it. First thing I noticed was how sensitive the scale itself is, it registers just the slightest bit of anything on the scale down to a 100th of a unit. I would say it's fairly impressive for a device that can register up to 5 Kilograms/10 pounds, as well as measuring several different units: Grams, Ounces, Imperial LBS:Ounces, and Milliliter's.<br/><br/>Satisfied it seemed to be registering the correct weights, or at least what the packages themselves also said, I tried out the tare function. To do this you simply put the empty container you wish to utilize on the scale, wait for it to settle down, and then hit the Z-T button on the left of the display. Then put your items in the container and it will subtract the container's weight from that. Useful for keeping foodstuff from messing up the scale with residue, or vice-versa.<br/><br/>Being that this is a flat scale it has more than a few advantages: you can weight large, awkward things much easier than scales with built-in containers and holders, and with the tare function mentioned earlier it becomes infinitely more handy and provides immense ease of use. Being a flat scale also makes it much easier to clean, and the decently durable metal top gives it a degree of durability comparatively. And after use it quietly shuts itself off after a minute or so until you put something on it again. Which will not be able to scoot it around as the little rubber feet will prevent it from going anywhere!<br/><br/>Have to admit I am decently excited with that 10 bucks well spent. Most food scales I see aren't half as fancy as this and cost quite a bit more. Granted this thing was on sale, but still . . . will update the review in a little while to see how it holds up to the rigors of time.
 I bought this scale to replace another because this one seemed like it would be easier to clean since it doesn't have as many gaps that could collect stuff. I used it for about a week or so occasionally suspecting it was not reading accurately. Then I weighed a small portion of food and the scale showed 0 as in weighing nothing which couldn't possibly be right. I remove the food, zeroed the scale, put the food back on and it still showed 0. I got out my old scale and weighed the same portion and it was 37g, much more than nothing! I haven't used it since. I've already gotten rid of the packaging so I doubt I could return it.<br/>I have bought other Etekcity branded products and have had good luck with them but this one fails...
 Chintzier than expected for the price. Also expected two pair, as there are two in the picture and comparable prices offers included two... my bad for not reading more closely I guess. So bottom line I'm still on the hunt for a pair of readers that actually feel substantial like prescription glasses.
 I thought this broke a while back because one night the numbers kept drifting, turns out fresh batteries and a few days of rest were all it needed to get back to working. The main issue with this scale is size and display placement. I make sourdough bread 4 loaves at a time, so I have a large bowl that I use when measuring ingredients. The bowl overhangs the display, though, forcing me to go at an awkward angle to view it. Also, the view angle on the display isn’t the best and if you look at the display from the wrong angle you see all 8’s. Finally, the autoshutoff is frustratingly short since if I get interrupted I’m the middle of measuring an ingredient or need to open a new bag of flour the scale will sometimes turn itself off and lose my measurement by the time I get back. Overall, these are fairly minor quibbles given the price and compactness. 4 stars
 While I don't bake much, my fiancee does!  And I mean A LOT!  I think I've gained about 15lbs since we've been together.  With that being said, she likes baking all sorts of European goodies and most of the recipes she tries are in grams and other metrics.  Etekcity has provided me with the new Stainless Steel Kitchen Food Scale and, of course, I gave it to her to put it through its paces.  We have a much more expensive food scale here at the home that she uses, so, we've got something great to compare it to.  First off, you'll notice that while the price is low, the look of the Etekcity food scale is upscale.  The stainless steel is of nice quality and the display and buttons are quite streamlined.  The display itself is large and easy to read in a variety of lighting conditions (both incandescent, fluorescent and LED).  This scale also has an auto-tare function which allows the scale to do the math, allowing you to focus on the baking at hand.  The scale allows you to measure in grams, milliliters, pounds and ounces!  The scale is also easy to clean with a damp rag.  As anal as I am with stainless steel and keeping it clean, a bit of polish renews it without any issue.<br/><br/>As I'm frequently told by my fiancee, baking is a science, whereas cooking is not (don't be offended, Chefs.  It doesn't mean we don't love you!). This means that if you have your ratios off, sometimes even a little bit, it can throw your recipe out of whack.  And when you're a perfectionist, out of whack just doesn't cut it!  With an almond tart recipe in hand, she used this little scale and got going.  The scale zeros itself out when you first turn it on, that way it's as accurate as possible.  There's no need for calibration or anything.  When testing it alongside our more expensive scale, it was nearly dead-on the same!  After nailing all of the measurements down using the Etekcity food scale, she went into mixing mode and got that tart into the oven.  She knows this recipe by heart and what its supposed to taste like with the proper measurements.  I just know it tastes good!  :)  After the baking is complete, the consistency, texture and all other things that matter in a tart, are there.  The little scale did it!  Not only did it help create a fantastic tart, it also looked good in the process!<br/><br/>Other notable features is that it will automatically shut off to save the batteries and it has a convenient low-battery indicator.
 I'm an avid baker and cook who values proper weights over volume measurements. (I guess I'm just a bit British in that sense!) That said, it's hard to find a scale that's under 20 dollars that will accurately measure weight in small enough gradations. In that sense, this is a fantastic scale. It has a number of great features:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1.) Looks: The scale is very attractive, and would look good in any kitchen.<br/>2.) Size: It's very compact! I love that about it.<br/>3.) Backlit display: Most scales do not have this. So it's nice that it's automatically back lit when you start to use it.<br/>4.) 0.01oz/1g gradation. That's SO difficult to find! My scale I currently use has 0.05oz/1g gradations, which can get very annoying<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1.) Very sensitive: This is a pro and a con. It's great, but slightly annoying that the entire scale detects weight changes.<br/>2.) Size of screen: The size is a bit too small for some, but I don't mind it given the compact size and the size of the back portion where you put food.<br/><br/>In all, this is an unbeatable scale for the money. Give it a try. You won't regret it!
 So, Im one of those people that meal preps!<br/><br/>I am a busy person throughout the week and have zero time trying to cook. Therefore, I cook all at once on Sundays. I use this for the purpose of weighing my proteins, vegetables, and carbs (such as sweet potatoes). I have always 'eyeballed' it or used some measuring cups in the past, but truly there is no way to absolutely be certain that your are getting the correct amount. When it comes to food, there are so many different proportions whether it be chicken or carrots (random picks I know, but you get my point). This has tremendously helped me with my portions. I used it in baking as well (carrot cake)!<br/><br/>Features:<br/>Oz<br/>mL<br/>Lbs/Oz<br/>g<br/><br/>The packaging is pretty good, theres styrofoam to protect it during shipping. I absolutely love the sleek stainless look since my kitchen is everything stainless! It gives that modern look. The capacity is up to 11 lbs! Im glad that it came with batteries (I just received an automatic pet feeder for my dog and I had to go out and buy batteries for it).<br/><br/>*I have received this item at a free or discounted price, but it does not reflect on my opinion about the product itself. Either way, I would have bought it full price, its $12.99 for an accurate modern scale! that has helped me with my meal prep :)
 Okay so for the price, I suppose I shouldn't complain too much.<br/><br/>My mother bought this as a gift for me. I love to cook and have recently decided to convert all of my recipes to grams for more even keeled baking.<br/>I have been using it since November of 2016. It is not as accurate as it claims. Maybe within 2-3 grams. It also likes to flicker and shut off sometimes. It's also hard to start occasionally. Also pressing the buttons sometimes causes it to spasm and die. Does any of this sound terrible to you? Oh that's right it was only 13$...<br/><br/>It works most of the time, and when its not working a little patience and it will start working again. If you want something more reliable and more accurate, spend 40-50$ on something actually worth that price. I'll probably get there eventually, but for now, this is a solid stopgap.
 This scale is just what I was looking for!  Actually, I wanted it more for postage-related use than in the kitchen and it works great for that.  I'm often wondering whether I need an extra stamp for a thick envelope.  Or, I want to print postage but not sure how much.  This scale works great!  It has resolution to 1/100 of an ounce and can weigh up to 11 pounds which is plenty for what I need.  The unit was very well packed and included two AA batteries so it was ready to go out of the box.  I was a little worried that the zero function wouldn't work since pressing it also presses on the scale's platform, but there is a delay built-in so that wasn't a problem.  I tried the tare function (although I doubt I'll use it much) and it works fine.  The scale remembers the last units used which is great.  There is a unit of "mL" which I don't understand since that's a volume, but maybe they are trying to map the weight of (say) water to volume?  That definitely won't be accurate, but I didn't get it to measure "mL"!  The manual is, refreshingly, well written and in native English.  My ONLY complaint (and it is minor) is that the styrofoam is the type that "sheds" easily.  I prefer to store it in that inside the box and its getting messy.  A very small price to pay for an excellent product!
 Because the screen is so close to the weighing area, in many cases the bowl hides the display.<br/>For things that require 1 gr accuracy like gelatin, or baking soda this doesnt work well, after pouring a 7 gr bag of gelatin, the weight actually increased by only 4 gr
 I have something called CIPN and healthcare pros should know what suffering it involves. After spending a few years bedridden I took control of my treatment by doing my own research online, which eventually got me outta bed. Long story short I'm buying many supplements in bulk for my nervous system, chronic pain and such and jumped on the chance of getting this kitchen scale for free in appreciation for my business. Shipping was fast and I put it to good use minutes after unpacking. Up until now I had been measuring my supplements with spoons and not by weight and turns out I was off in all seven I take regularly. In some I was under the right amount and in others I was over doing it. Now I even found information online saying that everybody knows bulk supplements have to be weighted and not measured like I was doing.<br/>I'm very happy with this company and the scale, it's well built, accurate and gorgeous. Buy with confidence. Even the batteries are included.
 The scale works like it should.  I have had no issues with incorrect measurements as I tested this scale against my old kitchen scale and both came up with same weight for everything.  Like every other scale just make sure the scale is on a hard flat and dry surface for proper measurement.<br/><br/>This measures grams, ml, oz and lbs, but not to exceed 11 lbs, which is perfect for me as I weigh my food as well as bake a lot.  I like the zero out function so if you place a empty bowl on the scale you can zero it out prior to measuring.  Very easy to use and easy to clean with a damp cloth.<br/><br/>It is a bit smaller than I am used to but that does make for easier storage.  I do wish the auto power off was not so fast as well.  But other than those two personal issues this is a great little scale.<br/><br/>I did receive this product for free to test and review.  All opinions are my own and my honest feedback on my personal use of this product.
 Arrived on time and described. Very light in weight which makes it very easy to be moved around in the kitchen even though I recommend you find a safe clean spot for it and keep it there, preferably away from water. It has 2 buttons. The one to the left turns it on and off, the one to the right changes the measurement (oz, grams, etc...).<br/><br/>To start using simply hit the button on the left which turns it on, then place whatever object you are weighing on it and voila!<br/>Now to measure something without the container that holds it simply place the empty container on the scale, then hit the left button to zero it, then fill it up with whatever you are actually trying to measure (fluid, powder, etc...). After you are done simply hit the left button to turn it off.<br/><br/>Very simple to use, very accurate, love this item, will be my best friend in the kitchen for more accurate recipes.
 I'm very pleased with this little scale. The build quality is excellent and its low profile means that I can leave it out on the counter ensuring that it gets plenty of use. Last night I weighed the remaining chocolate chip cookies to make sure mine was the biggest :) Its gram resolution is very nice, and while as others noted it may not weigh a single (1.0) gram I have no problem with sensitivity when there is just a bit more on the scale. If you're weighing single grams you may want a scientific scale (and a good lawyer?).<br/><br/>The scale also measures in multiple units which you can switch easily between with a single button. Overall I'm very pleased with this scale and would recommend it to anybody looking for a high-quality but inexpensive kitchen scale.<br/><br/>Please note that this unit was sent to me for review purposes. This does not bias my review in any way as my integrity is worth a bit more than $12.99.
 Prior to owning this scale, I never had a digital scale for my kitchen, I can say I don't intend to ever not have one again. This is a great product that makes measuring ingredients easier when compared to using measuring cups (measurements are more exact).<br/><br/>This scale is both elegant looking enough to be left on the counter, yet small enough to be put into a drawer without being cumbersome.<br/><br/>Use of the scale is also very easy and straight forward. Buttons are easy to press, and they are the same material as the rest of the scale, so cleaning is a breeze.<br/><br/>I never had any issues with zeroing out the scale when placing a cup on the scale, and the scale is sensitive enough to measure the lightest of ingredients.<br/><br/>In all honesty, this is a great product. And when you factor in how inexpensive it is to purchase, I highly recommend it.
 I'm the kind of guy who uses a scale daily, for measuring ingredients - most notably, coffee!  And until I got this scale, I'd been very happy with the previous Etekcity one I'd been using.  But the new one works better for me, as it's smaller, sleeker, way easier to clean, and has an 'ounces only' mode in addition to 'pounds and ounces'.  So I'm giving my old scale to a friend, and keeping this one for everyday use.<br/><br/>The nicest thing about it is that it's all sleek smooth stainless steel, so it's easy to clean, with no nooks and crannies for flour or coffee to get into.  It also takes up very little counter space, which is a big win in my tiny kitchen.<br/><br/>The only slight issue with it is that it takes a couple tenths of a second to correctly register a new weight, so when using to measure when pouring, I've needed to be careful once I get close to the target amount.<br/><br/>I also had a problem with one of the rechargeable batteries I initially put into it (which were not the ones that came with it).  One battery kept popping slightly up out of the holder, making the cover plate not lay flat.  I've never had this problem with anything before, and was going to ding it a star for that.  However, when I replaced the problematic battery with a better one (an Eneloop), the problem went away.  Apparently one of the + contacts was half a millimeter too deep, such that it lay slightly under the battery's contact, and the cheap battery was like 1 mm wider than a standard alkaline cell, so the two of them just didn't quite work together.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I'm very happy with my new scale, and look forward to seeing how well it holds up to daily abuse.<br/><br/>Truth in advertising:  I got this scale free from Etekcity, for reviewing purposes.  And the reason I joined that program was that I found that I've been using a lot of Etekcity stuff in my home, and have been delighted with the high quality and low cost of *all* of it.  I'm delighted to say that this yet another product of theirs that I love because it does what it's supposed to do, does it well, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg.
 Received this item today and I immediately set out to see how accurate and consistent it is. I began by grabbing my "analog" scale.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed about the scale was the nice BRIGHT screen! It was definitely easy to understand the numbers. There are two buttons. One on either side of the screen. The left button is on/off and tare (set zero) and the right button selects between four options for measuring. Grams, Ounces, ML and Pounds and Ounces.<br/><br/>I found this scale to be extremely consistent in its measures. I cycled through several very different weighted objects and each time I came back to an item, it measured the exact same weight. This was much better than my old analog scale that would sometimes stick or produce inconsistent results.<br/><br/>The screen turns itself off after a few seconds of non use and it seems that the batteries should last for a while. I'll check back in a month or so and let you know my thoughts on durability.
 So technically this is a food scale. But I actually use it to weight packages that I mail out for my home business. I am extremely pleased with it's accuracy and ability to quickly respond to button presses. It is super light weight, so if I need to move it and be mobile whenever I weight anything, I can just take it with me. It operates via 2 AAA batteries. I've been using the scale for a while and haven't had it go out yet. The finish is a chrome silver and it is very slim and doesn't take up much space at all. The only con that I can say is that the included batteries were not great, so use a set of good duracell or energizer batteries to make the scale last longer. Or, even better, use a nice set of rechargeable batteries, which you can find on Amazon. Overall, very pleased with this scale, and should I ever need to weigh food, I'm sure it will do great!
 Use for mostly postage, and occasional kitchen weighing. Loved my previous etekcity scale (EK6211-s), and thought this one would just as good.  The scale appears accurate (compared with 2 other brand scales), but the display is hard to read unless you stand directly over the LCD. So if you're sitting, you have to stand and look at it from above/ almost behind. Can't speak to battery life or durability yet.
 The scale stopped working - the LCD readout when blank - after about 15 months.  Put in fresh batteries, nothing... tested the batteries (highly recommend have a simple battery tester around for times like this),they were fine, but the scale kaput.  Warranty is only a year!  I noticed several other identical scales for sale from other companies, including some with a 2 year warranty - likely the same company that makes the units, so go with the longer warranty if you are looking at this model.
 This little scale looks very futuristic and sleek. Very nice on the countertop. It's pretty easy to use as there is just a on/off button and another button to change the units. Handy. The on/off also doubles as the tare button to zero out a container. Since it's stainless steel, it should hold up very well. (It definitely seems like stainless steel, btw)<br/><br/>My only gripe with it is that there is no raised section to separate the weighing portion to the buttons/screen. When you are wiping the top clean, be sure not to wipe any particles down onto the bottom button section as they might get stuck in the gap around the buttons. On the other hand, adding a raised section of something would mess up the sleek look of the device. Anyways, it's just something to be aware of.
 I've been looking for food scale since I make my own quest type bars. This scale was offered to me by Etekcity after I purchased silicone gloves. It was perfect timing to receive the scale and now I can measure ingredients precisely. Everything I measure is in smaller portions so I have no problem with not seeing numbers. I made bars and I really like how easy it is to get reading. Weight shows quickly. I like that scale is square so I drawers stay organized when I put away. Scale has low profile so can be put away in smallest drawer I have. It's easy to switch between metrics and standard. Picture is of 2.12oz protein bar so number is a little off. I imagine for a bodybuilder is a big deal but good enough for me.
 **RECIEVED FREE FOR HONEST REVIEW**<br/>First of all I love that the screen is back lit. The small sleek design should fit well in most kitchens.<br/>I wish that the weighing area was separate from the entire unit. (see second picture of mu original scale - the weighing platform is raised off of the scale.) I sometimes use a 8-10" paper plate to pour things onto and with this design it is utterly impossible to read the scale with the plate on.<br/>Second, the light for the display area should stay on longer, it is hard to get everything going and weighed before the light goes out. I have small children underfoot and sometimes helping. The light just doesn't last long enough.<br/>All in all it is a decent scale for the price.
 I've had this scale a few weeks and LOVE it. It's user-friendly, looks beautiful and modern, and it is accurate.<br/><br/>I mainly bought it for use with recipes, but we've also used it to weight my neighbor's foster kittens, weigh wet diapers, and for science experiments with my children. I haven't tested the 1gm reliability, but it works well enough for tiny kittens and portions for recipes!<br/><br/>My kids (age 3 and 5) like to weigh their toys. They've also dropped it onto the tile floor, it's held up remarkably well. Part of why they like it is because of how easy it is to use and the purple backlit display. I don't mind, it was a good buy and we love STEM projects around our house.<br/><br/>I'm very impressed with the quality of Etekcity.
 The product came in a timely manner, well packaged and batteries included.... buuuuut when I put it together and tested it the digital light showing the product weight was so dim I had to go into a room, turn all the lights off and hold the scale at an angle to see the numbers.
 Great Scale!  Crazy inexpensive price tag.  Works perfectly.  Instantly adjusts for tare weights of various bowls or measuring cups, etc... The user interface is the most intuitive I have used.  Don't spend more money for one because you think it will be better because it cost more.  This is the one!
 Works fine for weighing things up to 11#. Is pretty accurate but of course not for trade. For general household use it works and has some nice features like switching to different scales like ounces,  Pounds and ouces, metric and can be zeroed out to subtract part of the item being weighed that you don't want in the readout (such as a container).  Readout is same no matter where you place the object on the platform which is good. Only thing keeping it from being a 5 star is a way to input minor corrections to scale. Mine was off a tiny bit but I noted what that difference was for future use.
 I bought this digital scale because I needed a way to measure out exactly the dry ingredients for my "baklava" recipe.<br/>Also, a lot of the recipes included more than measurements of cups and teaspoons. I needed a way to measure out oz and lbs.<br/>This scale is very accurate and easy to use for these purposes.<br/>I've only used it a few times, but so far it works just great. It's so convenient because it's small and easy to carry.<br/>I love this scale and use it for baking and portion control.<br/>The scale is easy to use and makes cooking by weight a breeze.<br/>This scale is as described. It works great. Compact size, great for storing between uses.
 This little scale does everything I was hoping it would!<br/><br/>I was super excited when my new scale arrived. It's sleek, stainless steel design looks great with kitchen appliances (though I actually got the scale to use for weighting packages that I will be shipping). I love how small and lightweight it is as well!<br/><br/>The unit comes ready to use, batteries included and already installed. It's easy to use and very intuitive. For me - it's very handy to be able to switch between different units of measure. Though it's smaller, I haven't had any difficulties weighing large boxes (20 x 24 x 6") on the scale. And, as most of my packages are under 10 lbs... this little scale is the perfect combination of small and effective! Would definitely recommend for kitchen or shipping use.
 This scale is nice looking piece of equipment, though the unit feels somewhat light. Weight is not always indicative of a quality product, but it doesn't feel like a heavy duty product. This isn't necessarily a flaw, as most scales in this price range aren't going to be heavy duty products. I will say, in comparison to it's peers, this scale is pretty attractive, especially with the metallic finish on the top<br/><br/>One big bonus of this is that it's very slim. I can easily slip it vertically in a cabinet, and it takes up very little real estate. This makes it very easy to keep it in a handy location so I can quickly measure out portions of food while I'm making a meal.<br/><br/>This scale is also backlit, which is nice for those of you who like keeping the light off for those of you who enjoy a little cooking or weighing in the dark. Not sure who would enjoy that, but hey, who am I to judge your illumination preferences while cooking.<br/><br/>I do not have calibration weights, so I was not able to determine it's accuracy, but qualitatively it seems pretty close.<br/><br/>Overall I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a inexpensive food scale.
 This scale is fine if you are measure larger quantity of materials, like 100+g, 50g or even 20g. but if you are trying to do more accurate work, ie. measure things that are in the single digit gram, then you are screwed. the scale doesn't even register until it hits 3g and even that is very hit or miss if it register any weight at all. So if you are just doing big flour measurements that it's probably okay. but if you want to do more gastronomy type experimental cooking at home then definitely do NOT get this.
 Great scale, had it for over two years and it's still going semi-strong.  Recently in the past month, sometimes it just won't start reflecting measurements. I give the scale a quick tap on it's measuring surface and that fixes it, but it's very annoying! Other than that, it still works perfectly. Still giving it 5 stars because over two years of perfect use from a less than $10 scale, I definitely got my money's worth.
 Just started using this today.  I love the sleek design and it is very easy to use. I love the fact that it is small enough to put somewhere I can get to it without it taking up to much room.  I appreciated that it came ready to use, no need to buy batteries, which is such a hassle sometimes.  I just did a recipe using the scale to measure my ingredients and it worked perfectly.  I would deffinately recommend this to my friends and family.  The product seems to be constructed very well and the digital display is easy to use and large enough so that it does not put a strain on the eyes.
 I bought 2 different digital scales recently and I cannot recall exactly each one but I know each of them was 5 stars for me.  They are easy to use, fairly accurate, and cheap.  I know they are fairly accurate because I have weighed things like a pile of coins (each of a known weight) and got an answer very close.  I do not have calibration weights to know their accuracy exactly.  Very happy with it.
 If you're using it for pour-over coffee you'll find that it doesn't stay on long enough.  It shuts off after about 10 seconds.  You can still use it for pour overs but you'll need to turn the scale back on (which will re-tare and reset the scale) each time you pour, which is fine but you'll need to change how you think about your pour routine a little bit.  i.e. 200g pours x 3 rather than looking for a total of 600g water, etc.  other than that it's fine.
 I needed to replace an old Salton scale that simply couldn't weigh accurately anymore. This little guy definitely does the job correcting to a single gram. I checked the calibration on arrival and it was perfect. I am a baker and I weigh ingredients often. The only thing I don't like about the scale is that the display can be a little hard to read with a wide bowl.However, at this price I am more than happy to accept accuracy over convenience. I can still read it, it just gets blocked by the bowl sometimes. Good product.
 This is one great scale!  I use it mostly in the office for weighing heavy legal letters when buying online postage and my wife takes it and uses it in the kitchen to weigh her food.  I also use it to weigh packages that i sell on eBay and other online sites.  It's dead on accurate!  We have another bigger digital scale and it is no where near as accurate as the Etekcity scale.  I've had several Etekcity products and they are all high quality and very cutting edge...and maybe the best part...they are priced very competitively.
 I was pleasantly surprised how nice this looks. The pictures really don't show it. Looks wonderful on my counter.<br/><br/>The back-lit display makes reading the results a snap, even without my glasses. The two-button operation is rather intuitive. I was able to immediately figure it out without reading the instructions.<br/><br/>As a frequent bread baker, I look forward to using this to weigh my ingredients, which will provide more consistent results.
 This scale does not work in 1 gram increments. At best 5-10 grams. I have some ingredients I wanted to weight from 2-6 grams. The scale shows zero the entire time. I have returned the scale for a refund. I would suggest to amazon that they tell the seller to correct the description of this product.
 UPDATE. After 2 days of test weighing i have concluded it is uncalibrated. Even when tared/zeroed multiple different ways with a plate, no plate, bowl, and each time it was off by almost 50%.... Its okay. Looks nice, but the draw back is that it will not zero out. It keeps reading between -1 and -2. Idk if i trust it
 This is a great quality scale at an affordable price! It looks nice and sleek on my counter top as well! I have recently started cooking A LOT since starting weight watchers and have desperately needed a kitchen scale! I am glad I found this one! It is so easy to use. The display is large and bright. I have already used it several times and I have only had it 1 week!
 I got this scale to measure ingredients for soap making, body butters, dish washing liquid, salves and several other homemade recipes. I like the size of it because it is small and light weight which makes it easy to store. I compared the accuracy to another scale I have and it is pretty accurate. It weighed some small ingredients that was less than 1/2 an oz perfectly. I also love that it takes regular batteries which it also came with. I love the bright display with the large numbers. I used the tare function and it works great. I love that it weighs lbs, oz, grams and ml. I definitely recommend this scale.
 This is a great scale for the money. Batteries are included and it starts without any issues out of the box. I would have given this a 5-star review; however, I did not know that the scale only reads in full integers. It does not provide measurements to the tenth decimal which could be helpful for some. I may have simply missed that information in the description but still a great product. You can easily zero the scale if you need to use a bowl to hold your ingredients.<br/><br/>One other note is this is a smaller kitchen scale. If you use a small plate to measure ingredients, you won't be able to read the scale too easily.
 This scale is sleek and has an easy to read digital display. It cleans up with just a quick wipe and has a nice small footprint. I took a star away because it seems to have trouble keeping the tare weight. I had to reset several times and a couple of times it did not want to get a tare. Could just be me however nothing in the kitchen should be that fussy. All in all I was able to accomplish the task at hand.
 It's junk. It blows through batteries, is difficult to turn off and on, flashes off while you are adding stuff to get the weight you want. I tossed it in the trash. This was an "amazon choice", yea right. How much did they pay Amazon for that con.
 Biggest waste of money. Not at all accurate and the weight is constantly fluctuating. Nor can you get an accurate tare reading because any pressure put on that button will set off the scale. You get what you pay for, and I am 100% returning this garbage.
 Not the greatest. I bought this to use for making pour over coffee. Worked fine for a while, but one day I spilled some coffee on it and it stopped working. Waited several days for it to dry and it was still dead. I guess if you're careful with liquids, this works alright, but I feel like a kitchen scale should be able to withstand a little water. Another con was that you have to push the "tare" button super fast. If you don't, it tares the pressure you put on the scale as you push the button since they're all mounted on the top. I found this a little annoying even when the scale worked.
 I am in a cutting phase as bodybuilding is my hobby. I am currently weighing all meals to make sure I can hit specific macro nutrient and caloric goals. This thing looks great and works just fine right out of the box with the included batteries. If you are interested in determining the exact weight of your food for cooking and nutrition purposes this will do the trick for you. Not much else to say!
 Like the backlighting, and it appears accurate, so why not five stars? The button to switch from imperial to metric is UNDER the scale. Why? If you're going to use it for one or the other, maybe think of it as a five-star rating. And one other thing--if the thing on the platform is too big (for example, a full size plate), you cannot read the scale.
 This product shipped very quickly and has worked like a charm.  I can't believe this only cost $10.00.  Can't believe they sell this at such a low cost.  Very pleased.
 This affordable kitchen scale has worked well for me so far. It's accurate, lightweight, and even comes with batteries (a seemingly rare occurrence nowadays). It has a responsive and useful zero function that allows you to place a container on the scale, zero out the weight quickly, and then measure whatever contents you place in the container. The dedicated button makes this a fast and easy process.<br/><br/>Recommended.
 I have been searching for a food scale for a while now and I came across this one.  I've tested it with multiple types of settings and weights and it's pretty accurate.  I love the fact that it's thin and modern so it fits with my kitchen theme.  It's light and can be stored away easily.  I love the functions on it as well.  Now I can cook with recipes down to the grams!
 This is a good little scale over all that does the job without fuss. It has all the standard functions that a kitchen style should have suh as units in pounds/ounces, grams, ml, and a tare function. The scale is accurate as well.<br/>To be honest one of my favorite things was that it came with batteries, two double A's already installed. Most brands don't do that and it is really helpful for those that don't have boxes of batteries lying around.<br/>The only thing I have a problem with so far is the display. It is cool and simple, but at any angle other than directly above the scale, the display is a bit hard to read. The numbers kind of jumble of together. You can actually see this problem in one of the pictures shown.
 Just opened the scale for use. Didn’t measure well. Slightly Off on ounces.  Moved to grams the same. Used to measure for bread/starter making. Stopped working. Put in new batteries. Started and stopped immediately.
 I've compared this scale to the one I have that maxes out at about half the weight and so far this scale seems as accurate at low weights as my Oxo scale, which would seem to make my other scale borderline useless (and was twice as expensive as this scale on Amazon). This also looks a lot nicer and is easier to keep clean. The only improvement would be is that most of what I way is too big for the scale so having the pull out display feature on the other scale is great. That wouldn't really work with the design of this scale though.<br/><br/>All in all I'm very happy with what I've seen and can't beat the price.
 LCD display can be hard to read at certain angles, especially if you are taring a plate or bowl for meal prep and have to look at a screen at sharp angle. Also seems very sensitive when using tare function. Seems like it lacks stability on the sensors for the scale but, seems to measure accurately nonetheless.
 This scale works well for measuring that does not require exact amounts however I am a soapmaker and the numbers have to be very accurate. When I put things on the scale the numbers fluctuate.  I leveled the scale and tried again. Same thing. Tried new batteries. Same thing. I will use it for approximate measure recipes.
 Bought on prime day. Thought buying a scale for my kitchen would help me lose weight, but I ended up shattering both the scale and my self esteem after I tried to weigh myself in the kitchen whilst measuring out chocolate chips for my cookie dough
 Works perfectly and accurately. Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I’d prefer the display stuck out further. An average soup bowl covers up 5e display so you have to look down under the bowl to see the display.
 This scale arrived in less than a week. It was easy to set up I started to weigh food items immediately. This scale will help with potion control my dietician has suggested. The small size and light weight makes it easy to store in drawer or cabinet !<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Etekcity-11lb-5kg-Digital-Multifunction-Stainless-Kitchen-Food-Scale/dp/B0113UZJE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Etekcity 11lb/5kg Digital Multifunction Stainless Kitchen Food Scale</a>
 Excellent kitchen scale. I like that the buttons are on top, unlike other scales which have buttons on the side or worse, on the bottom. I also like that it has a disk to prevent flour from spilling everywhere. Very easy to clean. Very easy to operate.
 Died (no turn on, even with new batteries, no response) after less than 5 months of daily use. Waiting for it to tare took a while, then took longer and longer before it stopped working entirely.<br/>Purchased in May, dead by the end of September.<br/>Replaced with a different brand.
 I used a 50g calibrated weight, came up 49, took the weight off, put it back on, comes up 47. Otherwise a good scale. Just not accurate.
 Inaccurate scale! My batch for cookies has a discrepancy of 15g! A spoon has a discrepancy of 4g!<br/><br/>I will upload a video you can see the whole time it showed 0g while I was adding onto the scale but it shows negative when I lifted it off
 Great little scale. And it's crazy affordable!<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>Tare function. Nice!<br/>Oz-ml-lboz-g measures.<br/>Battery powered.<br/>Lightweight.<br/>Bright display.<br/>Auto-off.<br/>Low-battery warning.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>Small size could be troublesome for larger measurements (it's fine for me, though).
 Scale worked very well when I first bought it. Stopped using it for a month and now the scale measurements are wrong. Changed the batteries thinking maybe the batteries were dying, not no the scale is still measuring off by allot.
 This scale is great! Small, sleek, simple to use, and very accurate! And it comes with batteries installed, which is nice.
 Nice little scale.  It's small, lightweight, easy to keep clean and seems to be very accurate.  Here's a little tip.  If you want to use a container ( I use a coffee cup.)  Set the container on the scale BEFORE you turn it on.  The display will show 0.00.  Then you can add your ingredients and get their weight and not have to worry about doing any math.  Works like a charm every time.<br/><br/>When want to use your new scale for the first time, don't forget to remover the little plastic tab from the battery compartment.  That tab keeps your batteries (included) from going stale.
 We've had it now for a couple of months and it works great! We have a tile floor in the bathroom, so we make sure to put the scale on just one tile for weighing.
 Works perfect. Really like that I can do ounces alone or pounds and ounces together.  That makes a difference when baking.
 This does everything the fancier models do.<br/> - It weighs in pounds, ounces or grams.<br/> - It supports up to 11 pounds<br/> - The tare works<br/> - Tested with items of known weight and it was accurate to within 6 thousands of a pound (.006) in five tests<br/><br/>Unless you need more than that, why pay 2x, 3x or 4x the price?
 When you purchase a new scale it's reasonable to expect an unscratched case. It looks to me like this is a refurb being passed off as 'new'. I could see the scales top surface was scratched before I ever opened the interior packaging
 This scale works perfectly for measuring ingredients and different foods. It has all of the functions I was looking for, including showing the weight in both ounces and grams. The backlit LCD was a nice touch, and certainly makes the digits very legible. The stainless steel finish matches all of my kitchen appliances and fits right in, almost unnoticeable. I was pleased that it is accurate to the gram, while still being able to weigh up to 5kg, which should be more than enough for whatever you are weighing.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this product, if you're in need of a nice looking, accurate food scale.
 Solid scale. When on sale for a fire deal at 10 dollars it's a steal. The backlight goes off after 20 seconds which is actually a nice feature to conserve battery. All you have to do to get it to light up is add more weight to the scale or tap it. Not quite precise enough to measure your smaller ingredients for baking ( baking powder salt etc) but good enough and it does say it's only accurate to a gram so this is to be expected.
 This scale is wonderful. The compact design will fit in the smallest of counter spaces. It is sturdy and very well built, as well as attractive. If you're working(cooking) in low light situations, the back light feature is a definite PLUS!! Being single and often cooking for one, the accuracy really saves money by eliminating wasted food. I highly recommend this unit.
 This scale worked great for two years before it got flaky.  The downfall started with it taking an extra press to get it to turn occasionally.  After a  week or two, the tare function stopped working, and finally, this afternoon, it became a challenge to get it to turn on.  If I had to guess, I'd say the on/off microswitch failed.  $12 for 24 months... It's up to whether its worth $0.50/month.
 Maybe if the battery compartment would stay closed it would be OK. The batteries keep popping out so I am going to pop this one in the trash can and chalk it up as a loss.
 What an eye pleasing scale! Excellent price, superb quality, and compact enough to store almost anywhere. The buttons work great, never had to push twice, batteries included. I use it to weigh my food servings (lbs.oz) it works great! I would definitely buy it again.
 I just used my new scale for sweet corn. I love it . Easy to use and accurate.
 This scale isn't super precise, but it works fine for normal kitchen stuff. And really, what do you expect for $12? I like that it uses AAA batteries which are easily replaced with rechargeable batteries.<br/><br/>The description makes it sound like there's more stainless steel involved in the construction of the device than there really is. It's just a thin layer of metal over the plastic, but you can kind of tell that from the picture.<br/><br/>One really minor complaint: it takes a while to tare. If you're taring, make sure you wait until the display reads 0 before adding what you need to weigh. While taring, it will show just dashes.
 Haven't had a chance to use it, but the item had noticeable smudge marks. Not sure if it was a returned item and then resold.:/<br/><br/>From what I can share, the item is lightweight, comes with batteries.
 I bought 2 of these for commercial use, and I was very isappointed, since it does not help me to weigh a few grams, it is very imprecise and somewhat difficult to use and slower, compared to this one, of the same brand, which I had already bought first (www.amazon.com/dp/B00UIVIXVO/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3).
 Works fine for measuring up to 5000 grams. The display is bright, and it's easy to switch between metric and imperial units. I like to compact size, and brushed metal styling. It's also a plus that it uses standard alkaline batteries (which were included with mine!)
 Works well!! Size is a little small, though .. ..<br/>It'll do to start with.. 4.5 Stars!!
 If you leave this one and don't manual turn it off...the batteries will wear out quick.  It does a GREAT job at ounces...love this thing! I also have a Etekcity digital bathroom scale and LOVE IT.
 This scale is absolutely beautiful!! I has a modern look that gives it class and makes it appear way more expensive that it is!<br/>It's price is amazing as well.<br/>It also come with batteries included, which is a big plus. I will definitely be using this scale a lot
 I like the fact that its stainless steel which makes it easy to clean and it will last longer in my opinion. I used it measure food portions and postal mail and it works great.  I placed a 10lb weight plate and it read exactly that 10lbs.
 A friend of mine ordered this scale for me as a gift. It was OK. It's hard to clean and I happened to get a tiny bit of water in it by accident and it quit working. I suggest paying $2 more for something else.
 This is a fantastic little scale. It is perfect for meal prepping  and measuring serving sizes. It is accurate and I enjoy that it measures in both grams and ounces. Great product the low price and I would definitely recommend.
 Great little scale for measuring lbs. - oz. - grams. I use mine to measure , in grams , the amount of coffee grinds to use for 2 mugs of coffee (30 oz. of water).<br/>I bought mine at WA****T for $7.99 which included free shipping to my house and no TAX.
 This is a really nice little scale. I ordered it to replace one that I've had for over 20 years and it's a great improvement. I buy large packages if ground beef from Costco and huge cases of chicken from Zaycon so I need a scale to portion and package for freezing. This scale is attractive and functional for what I need. Who could ask for more? Solid product at a reasonable price.
 The scale was a good size, easy to use. However, it didn't always work. Even within the first few weeks of using taring/zeroing the scale did not work consistently. Then it finally just stop zeroing all together. Now after only 8 months of use I need to find a new scale. I don't recommend this product.
 The scale works great.  Its small enough for me to leave out in easy reach.  The display text size and backlight make it easy to read.  I like that the display stays light for a reasonable time and then dims prior to turning off.
 It's a great little scale. I love the function that lets you zero the scale with a bowl or whatever on it so you can easily weigh out loose stuff like cereal or something without making a mess. Personally I'm learning a lot about portion size.
 I've had this for a few months now and have been very happy with it. Measures multiple units.
 I love this scale.  Simple, easy to use.  It's lightweight but is solid.  I appreciate having the ability to change from grams to ounces, as well as weigh dry and liquid measures.  I had another fancy scale for which I paid $45 and I gave that away.  This is so much better.
 This scale is just what I was looking for!  I am trying to eat healthier foods and this helps me keep track of the weight and calories of food.  The scale is small and looks very nice in my kitchen.  I love the tare feature which allows you to separate the weight of the food from the container it's in.  I received this scale free to evaluate it and I am very happy with it.
 I was very excited when I received this as a Christmas present. Unfortunately it is not consistent at all. It won't register any additions or subtractions from the scale. Even when we weigh everything at once, the read is different for multiple attempts. I'm bummed that my family member spent money on this. Yes, I am a frequent Amazon customer and my family member is a Prime member.
 Scale does everything it's supposed to do. Item came nicely packaged and intact. There's an auto-shutoff feature which comes in handy when your hands are full. I primarily use this when brewing coffee and measuring the amount of coffee beans. You also have the option to switch between measuring units. Buttons are audible and tactile, which is a welcomed surprise.
 the stainless steel finish looks nice. seems like it's just an all plastic build though.<br/><br/>the display is very nice and bright, easy to read.<br/><br/>works perfectly, I'm getting very accurate measurements.
 Great scale very precise
 Great product at a great price. I use this for cooking and portioning food nearly every day, and it has held up well.
 Sleek and clean design, this scale looks awesome on my counter. Works great, and seems to be very accurate. My only two qualms are that the screen can be difficult to read because of the color/contrast of the display, and I wish it stayed on longer so I could use this for making coffee with my Chemex. Other than that, this is a great little scale and works great for weighing meat and other ingredients in the kitchen.
 great
 So far this scale has been an excellent addition to my kitchen. I've been needing one for a while to get a better measurement of how much food I need/eat. It's super easy to clean and looks relatively nice, especially for the price.
 now I know what my hamburger weighs
 Cheaply constructed.  Thankfully the cat hasn't knocked it off the counter or sat on it, for that matter.
 Great scale. Very accurate. Helped me a lot to manage my food portions.
 I got this as a gift and when it arrived, it was not working. I tried everything and it wouldn't come on... Can someone advise me on how to return it ?
 I purchased this item about 9 months ago. I've loved it so far until today when it stopped working. I replaced the batteries and it still will not tare to zero and sometimes won't turn off
 Awesome! Easy and accurate!
 awesome scale
 Great addition to my kitchen. Have never measured food before but this makes it really easy to do. Quality looks and feels much better than I expected. Working great so far no problems.
 This kitchen scale is very easy to use. I didn't even need the instructions to set it up. The stainless steel look and the size is ideal for not taking up too much space.<br/>It is also very accurate sets of kitchen scales I've owned. Switching between units is easy and works really well.
 Very sleek looking food scale. Looks good in my kitchen
 I like it. Looks good with all my stainless steel kitchen accessories.
 Good while it lasted. Broke after 5 months. I used it constantly for 3 months and then sporadically. I started using it again, and it got crazy. On/off buttom stopped working and that’s it. It doesn’t calibrate anymore to 0.
 great value!
 This is everything!!!!!! I love it. I use it constantly. Works perfectly fine! I recommended everyone to buy it! It’s a great item for a great price!
 This product is very reliable. It is the first food scale I have owned, but it seems to work just fine. You have to make sure nothing is on the scale when you turn it on, because it seems to calibrate what is "zero" when you turn it on. This is probably useful if you want to put an empty bowl or cup on the scale, turn it on, then add your food item.
 Doesn’t work you lift it up and it shows random numbers. Not accurate .
 So great and easy to use in a variety of circumstances. I have weighed onions, raw chicken in plastic bags and bowls. Very intuitive to use. I confess I haven't even read the instructions yet but figured out how to get it to do exactly what I want. It's GREAT! can easily change to different units of measurements.
 Very pleased with this purchase. Love multiple measurement options and standard AAA batteries for power. Easy to use. Selected this scale over another highly recommended brand that was not well rated for battery longevity.
 Mine quit working after a week. A really liked it prior to that. :(
 very good food scale.  compact and easy to storage.  I love the look of it as well.
 I love this scale! It's small, it's clean, it's easy to use, and it's set up to work the minute you get it out of the box. Multiple settings and measurements mean that I can switch from grams to cups to ounces with ease, and the TARE function is very easy to use. Great scale for a low price!
 I’ve had 3 different scales. Use this one the most because all the bottoms are on top which is convenient. Small issue is weight can get covered with larger items/plates
 Great basic scale. It does all you need and has a great price. I use it every day for 2 years now and just bought a second one for a friend.
 Love the accuracy of this measuring tool. I use it for all of my daily allowances....even for. Y pets feedings.
 The scale works as expected and the tare/unit functions work properly. Sadly, the buttons are a bit difficult to register a press and the LCD has to be viewed directly on to be readable.
 Great product!  Had no idea it changed unit of measure with just a touch.  This is a sleek, stylish scale.  Great design!
 This lasted all of a month and a half before it started giving me problems. Half the time when I try and use it it gives me an error message, and it takes about 4 or 5 more tries to get it to work right. I clearly need to buy a new one, and will not be buying this again.
 Great item at great price point. Even comes with batteries!
 This scale works great and is very reliable.  I used it on all of the modes and received accurate measurements in each.  The scale is a little sensitive when you push the buttons to change value or on/off/zero.  Otherwise it has worked out well for all uses.
 For some reason the scale has a hard time turning off and on and freezes up a lot of the times on me. Not convenient at all. It worked fine for the first few weeks then went to total crap.
 It's a great scale. It does what it is meant to do very well. It's easy to read and consistent! I like the options of grams, ounces, lbs:oz, and ml. I have enjoyed using it and like the design and how light weight it is. I have another product by this brand and have been impressed by them so far.
 Terrible product, it is not accurate at all. Would not recommend to anyone. Waste of money.
 Scale works well and has a sleek design, but the area is a little small. Other than that, no complants
 Perfect kitchen mate, it's light, stylish and very easy to use with the different weight measures.
 I got this couples years ago. But now it is like a trash. I can not turn it on unless I take out batteries  and put back on. I can not zero it when I add more ingredients unless I take out batteries then put it back. Can you imagine when I make cakes how may times I have to take out batteries in order to zero out or turn back on. Now I am searching Amazon to find a new kitchen scale.
 This works quite well in all respects. It is amazing how accurate it is, as well as being light, and simple to operate.
 Slim and slick design that’s both lightweight and easy to use. The only downside is that I thought it would be bigger, but overall it’s great for cooking and baking!
 The best kitchen/postage scale I've had so far. Best value, too!
 Excellent buy; Simple to setup and use. The stainless steel surface is really easy to clean
 Well worth the money.
 This is a good scale, and will serve well in the kitchen.  It would be nice if a chart coordinating it to postage weights were included.
 A little smaller than i anticipated but it seems to work okay
 Very easy to use. Automatically zeroes out so you can weigh anything.
 Scale is good with weight, the only BIG problem is hiw fast it drains the batteries!!! They don't even last 5 days!! Im returning it.
 I loved this scale until it started reading " unSE" I know that means the scale isn't level. No matter what it won't clear. I have replaced the batteries, too.
 Great value and looks and works great!
 responds slowly to changes.
 Like it.
 This is perfect for my kitchen where it gets used for postage scale/weighing envelopes as often as it gets used for weighing food.  Postage goes by ounce and this is easily accurate to weigh below 1/10 ounce increments.  A measuring cup fits perfectly and there is a tare function.  It's small enough to leave on the counter all the time, looks good &amp; doesn't need to be plugged in.  What more could you ask for for $13?
 Accurate weights, easy controls.
 My wife loves it. Uses it everyday. Has helped her stay consistent on her eating plan.
 This is garbage. It eats through triple-A batteries like its nothing. I'm putting Duracell batteries in this thing, not some cheap batteries. My girlfriend has a similar scale that uses those tiny flat batteries and it lasts her months.
 This scale is small and can fits nicely in my kitchen and in my office at work.  The scale is very easy to use and it even comes with batteries so you can start using it right away.  I have only been using this for a few days, but I'm looking forward to seeing how durable the scale is and how well it continues to work.
 Scale works great!
 Easy to use. Good looking.
 Absolutely love this scale! It is sleek, accurate, and has the settings one would expect for easy use. Takes two batteries and is lightweight. Also, they send you a follow-up email with FAQs and are very helpful if you need help or have questions. Highly recommend
 Excellent scale that looks sleek and has a very clear and precise digital display!
 Anything under 4 grams can't be weighed
 Does not work well at all.
 Great product.  We are using it for our Christmas baking.
 Worked Great
 Piece of crap
 Have not used it much yet, but it is small and very quiet.
 This one was a gift. I am ordering one for myself now
 Worked very well for almost two years (warranty is one year). Only issue I had was sometimes, when there was nothing on the scale, it would claim to have a couple ounces.
 Compact and easy to use scale
 Very aesthetically pleasing in my kitchen! Can't stress that enough, the other kitchen scales sold simply do not look as good and sleek as this one. The backup display is extremely helpful, and for only 2 AAA batteries, this scale lasts quite a while. Best kitchen scale on the market right now. Does its job well, and looks great.
 We love this scale and use it daily.
 Works exactly like we need it too.
 I  use this product weigh my products for my shop and it’s worth it!
 works great and easy to use!
 Nice scale and easy to use
 i'm a big fan of the slim design and the easy-to-read display. very easy operations from the two buttons as well. i've been using it to measure out coffee for brewing and it's perfect.
 I loved the product haven't had a problem so far but it does feel a little easy to break to me.
 I use it many times a week. Has been very dependable.
 So tiny so little so useful
 Looks nice. Great price. But not accurate. It doesnt even register when I place a dime on it. I intended to use it for weighing hops and minerals for water adjustments. I need it to be very precise.
 Bad quaility, it’s already starting to malfunction after about 20 times of use and the rubber at the bottom keeps going off.
 Great so far.
 I got for about $8 on a cyber monday sale. Small but works great.
 Super nice, easy to use and to change measurements.
 Accurate an d so very attractive.A good addition to my counter.
 Exactly as I expected.
 Given as gift
 I bought several kitchen scales during the past 10 years and finally I found the one with excellent quality and a great price.<br/>I have also used with small packages and letters for my Internet Business.
 Works Great and looks great!
 Love this scale! Perfect size and I love that it has different measurements.
 Very good product, does not register weight under 3 grams which makes smaller cooking measurements difficult.  I use mine for baking and general food tracking and have been pleased with the scale's performance.  Sleek design and easy to wipe down and maintain clean.
 Great scale for the price. Works great, no issues. Measurements are exact. Happy with the purchase. Would purchase this brand again.
 Had this scale for two months.. it did its job and weighed good accurately, however suddenly broke down. Never dropped it, never drenched it. It just suddenly stopped working. The screen just shows "unSE".
 So easy to use and perfect size for my kitchen
 This was great...until it wasn't. Had it a little less than a year when it stopped working.
 Works great!
 The button to turn and reset the scale stopped working only after a month of buying this product.
 Love how compact this scale is and how I can weigh in ounces, grams, etc.  Perfect for all types of recipes from around the world 😍
 love it. takes the guess work out of measuring. great for weighing postage needs. looks great too.
 Works great!
 Very pleased with this product and the price was outstanding!
 It does what it is supposed to do. It looks great in the kitchen too. I'm happy with it.
 Great value for the price! Having a thousandths place for ounces was a nice touch. The only downside is since the entire unit is flat viewing the screen at certain angles makes the readout illegible.
 Great product that rivals leading manufactures in store. Sanitary and accurate. I love being able to control my portions and measure before I freeze my food.
 very inaccurate.
 Easy to use
 Received as a gift, and was loving this scale until half the numbers stopped displaying after less than a year. Will you replace?
 Works well.  Built well for the price.
 Not as big as expected.
 It does the job well and has nice design.
 still works
 Fast delivery.. works great!
 The 10 sec auto off function is driving me nuts!!! Well, it did help me cut and chop faster so I give it a 1 star.
 Perfect size scale for my kitchen  it's not huge so it doesn't take a lot of space.  Very accurate and easy to read.  Love how you can switch from oz to grams to lbs.
 I heard some negative reviews about how it turns off too quickly but I didnt have a problem with it. I mean I`m just weighing food here, how long can that take?
 Not accurate.
 On time delivery. Easy to use.
 Very happy with this scale.  Easy to read and seems accurate.
 Super easy to use!  Love it!
 So far it is just what I wanted--very compact, accurate, easy to use.  It's a real bargain; the ones I saw in stores were $39 and $59.  If it lasts reasonably well. I'll be tickled pink.
 Would not buy again. Have used less than 10 times and scale no longer works. Changed batteries, doesn't help. i<br/>I guess u get what you pay for.
 Useless. Its never accurate. Don't waist your money.
 I used this twice but from my usages it worked great a little small.
 Good for amounts over 5g. Doesn't pick up reading until around 5 grams, once you reach that threshold it is accurate.
 It does not tare properly and it does not update the weight as you weigh out grams of powders.  It also doesn't register the items sometimes and just shuts off after a few seconds, which means you lose your tare!  Very frustrating.
 Great kitchen scale. Nice and trendy. Perfect for a modern kitchen.
 It works great but you can see the outline of all the numbers behind your numbers, which bugged me a lot at first. You'll get used to it and it does the job though
 Perfect size, easy to read, exactly what I wanted.
 Works very well.  It's a little on the small side but has worked well for all my needs.
 Bought item early December 2016 and only used for baking during the holidays. Now item is completely broken and will not work. DO NOT BUY!
 Very good
 Great Scale for the price.
 the slot where the numbers are registered was flawed. It had a large black space in a diamond shape covering part of the numbers. It was unreadable. very cheap lightweight. Can't believe it got any good reviews......
 good product
 Works great, sleek beautiful design, and simple to use. Can't complain especially for the price.
 I love this scale! It's attractive, works well, and is small enough that it doesn't take a lot of room on my countertop.
 This scales is good but turns off too quickly.
 Works great, easy to use and easy to read.
 Accurate and simple
 This scale worked like a charm! Within minutes of taking it out of the package, had my item measured and added to the recipe.  Love the ease of use.
 See the numbers well. Easy to use. Self explanatory.
 Perfect scale, easy to work.
 Sleek and easy to use.  Small enough to leave on the counter.  Very pleased.  And all at a great price.
 Very nice and accurate scale. Good for calories count diet. No more cheating..
 Love the scale. So easy to set tare and change units of measure. Very accurate.
 This scale does not properly weigh smaller quantities.
 It is exactly what I want: little, simple, light, useful, cheap, batteries included, free delivery...great value! Got it about one month and it works as expected.
 This is a high quality scale for an exceptional price! Arrived quickly and packaged well. I give it an eleven on a scale of ten.
 no more guesswork with this
 Light weight easy to use. 100% accurate
 Sleek, easy to use,accurate, and stores easily. No complaints. This is a very nice scale at a good price.
 Excellent digital scale! This is what I was lookiing for a great cooking.
 looks and works great!
 It's super easy to use and works great.
 Broken after 10 days!! Unbelievable!
 everything it's ok. Product as described
 Find looking scale and works perfectly. I had it for a month and everything is working fine.
 real junk - back does not even fit and is inaccurate
 Easy to use &amp; accurate! Now my girlfriend bakes everyday...
 I wrote a poor review. Bad on my part!
 I like this scale! It works great!
 Keeps on turning off while I'm using it.  It won't stay on longer than 2 minutes, total piece of crap!!
 Best scale I've ever owned, highly recommend this company.
 Works great!
 Exactly what I needed!
 It's great. Easy to use and accurate!
 gets handed at times
 Great Product, use it a lot
 I've had this probably for about 6 or so months now and it just stopped working. It is 'freaking' out and cant keep the numbers straight. Was great until then!
 This scale broke after a month of light use
 Great scale. Works perfect!
 Easy to use, accurate, slim, good quality materials. If you need a kitchen scale look no further.
 Easy to use.  Slim for storage.
 Easy for use. I love it.
 It is very accurate and it is a great size to transport around my kitchen. I highly recommend it!
 This digital scale works great!
 works well
 Nice product to have it in Kitchen!
 Great scale, easy operation for both grams &amp; ounces
 Very satisfied!
 gooooood!!!!!!!
 Love it
 Works well
 Very friendly and easy to use!
 Larger scale
 great little diverse item. love it
 It eats through batteries. I need to replace batteries every two days. Too expensive to continue  to use.
 light, convient
 Piece of s***! Don't buy! My scale read almost 2 grams over on everything. DO NOT BUY! WASTE OF MONEY. Don't care how good the other reviews are. DO NOT BUY
 On time, works great.
 Not consistent enough to use as an espresso scale.
 Works really well at beauty salon. Saves from waste of color products!
 This is an attractive and accurate scale, and good deal for $12.  I wanted a scale with a lighted display that I feel is easier to read than the unlit displays.  Mine is accurate within 1-2%, more than adequate for most home cooks, we're not measuring gold here.  Note that Etekcity offers free products to those willing to rate them on Amazon.  While this may not be illegal, immoral, or fattening, those of us who read these reviews should be aware of this practice (I paid for mine).
 I've had this for about a year now, and it's still working on the batteries that came with it.<br/><br/>For starters, I'll just say that I have no way of knowing how truly accurate this is, but I'm using it for cooking needs, so it doesn't have to perfect-- just consistent.<br/><br/>I use this to make my coffee in the morning so it's consistent every time.  In the past, I would always be guessing (did I use 4 really heaping scoops last time, or just 4 sort of full scoops?), and the coffee turned out differently every morning.  My wife and I experimented on a coffee strength we could both agree upon.  I like mine a little stronger; she likes it a bit weaker, but we found a way to meet in the middle.  42 grams of coffee every day!  No surprises.<br/><br/>I also use this to get my tortillas consistent.  I weigh the dough ball to get them all within a few grams (roughly; I'm not that particular).  That way, I know how they're all going to turn out in the press.  Again, no surprises!<br/><br/>Have you ever made hamburgers for your cookout, and they were all different sizes?  Yeah, me too. So, with this, I weigh the meat, and divide it by how ever many burgers I think I'll need.  I get them all the same weight within an ounce.  No surprises!<br/><br/>So, as you can see is that this scale has taken my culinary skills to the next level because... no surprises!
 Super lightweight and attractive design. Only wished it was easy to read. I have a hard time figuring out what unit it's on when I go back and forth from oz to lbs. I still don't know if I'm getting the right measurements, which defeats the purpose of having one of these. Also, the numbers are not easy to read.<br/><br/>***********EDIT*****************************<br/><br/>Etekcity reached out to me and stated that they believed my machine was defective and sent me a replacement. So nice of them, because the new one works sooooo much better than the first one I got. I can actually see the measurements, and it's super clear. It works great. Thank you so much. I'm changing the rating to 5 stars!
 Love it. I used it for measuring supplement powders. Though it won't measure less than 2 grams, I simply measured ten times what I wanted to use, and divided the volume by ten to come up with a single serving. Example - 10 teaspoons of creatine monohydrate measured 22 grams, therefore each teaspoon is 2.2 grams. Simple.<br/><br/>I also used it for measuring food of all kind. I use it to very accurately weight water, too. Note: when I'm weighing a messy, wet, dusty item, I place the scale into a 1 quart zip-top bag, to protect it. I also store it in the same bag, to prevent debris of any kind from settling into the mechanism.<br/><br/>The tare function is very useful.<br/><br/>You may want to order a clear glass or acrylic bowl for large items, so you can see the scale through the bowl.<br/><br/>It does weigh in ounces grams, lb/oz, and mL.<br/><br/>Overall, the flat design improves the user-friendliness of the scale, as well as ease of cleanup.
 I use this weekly for meal prep. I'm sure it's not the best/accurate product available but I am happy with it learning how to portion out meals/snacks. You can easily turn it on, tare to zero out the weight of your container, and switch from oz ml lboz g. It's flat which does not take up much additional space in my drawer. I don't like that the back light goes off after 10 seconds of nonuse but for the price I can deal with it. The only minor issue I've had is that the cover for the battery on the bottom side falls off regularly. The batteries stay in so I usually don't notice until I'm putting it back in the drawer.
 First the scale looks good and the backlit screen is nice. It is very small, so it can fit in a small drawer. If you need a normal sized one, look for its bigger sister (ser sizes side by side in the attached pictures). Also it comes with batteries, but as other reviewers mentioned the batteries are already at end of life.<br/>If you find this review/picture useful, please don’t hesitate to vote!
 The words on the buttons are nearly impossible to read (silver words on a silver background! Who comes up with this stuff??) without bending down so you're about 1 inch away.  (Note: I have 20/20 vision.)  Also, it takes about 5-10 seconds to tare - which doesn't sound like a lot, but is rather annoying when you're standing there waiting.  (Other scales do this in ~1 second.)  Also, the display turns off (well, becomes so dim as to be essentially invisible) to save battery power after about 5 seconds, which is super annoying when you're trying to measure out ingredients. Other scales I've owned have lasted years on one battery without this annoying "feature."
 In My Opinion:<br/><br/>Subject line says it all...<br/><br/>Review posted 9/02/2017, and will be updated as experience warrants.<br/><br/>***<br/>Update 9/05/2017: Decided to scrutinize these reviews to see if anyone might have a workaround/s for poor repeatability issues; as expected none were found.<br/><br/>However, short battery life was noted as a common complaint. Out of curiosity, I measured the scales current draw. Sitting idle in the 'off' position, it was found it to be drawing (a whopping) 14.61mA! (mA is correct, not µA!)<br/><br/>An unceremonious rating demotion and scale disposal were deemed appropriate.<br/><br/>Again, everything above is just my opinion.
 This product is okay as a kitchen scale. It is precise. Easy to use. Taring function is accurate and easy to switch back and fourth. On off function automatic. Easily change between modes. I got it because i wanted to try it for my pour over coffee .. But for this purpose in particular it didnt prove well. Because in about 30 seconds the lights will dim and soon after the scale will automatically turn off. This obviously will prevent you from properly measuring your water. you can kind of press any button to change the scale unit just to keep it on while you continue to pour , but yeah thats really not very practical.
 I bought this scale after my <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Vont-Scale/dp/B01DHBHRAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Vont Scale</a> (which I absolutely loved) was accidentally damaged. I primarily use the scale for measuring out ingredients when baking. I am giving this scale 2 stars because it's simply inaccurate when weighing very light objects such as coins. See attached photos. My scale won't recognize dimes or pennies unless there is a heavier coin on the scale as well.<br/><br/>Another huge complaint of mine is that this scale is slow to update. If I'm measuring out 200g of flour, I'll do a rough weigh out and gradually add or subtract to reach my target. The only problem is that this scale takes 1 second or more to figure out whether I added or subtracted the flour, a problem that my Vont scale never had. This delay is a huge issue for when you are quickly trying to reach precise measurements.<br/><br/>Those issues aside, I guess it still does its job and I can still technically weigh heavier things -- it'll just take a little bit longer and more work.<br/><br/> UPDATE]<br/>Etekcity promptly contacted me after writing this review and offered to send me a replacement scale at no charge since my original scale may have had a faulty sensor. Turns out that the replacement scale they sent had the same issue, if not worse, but I'm adding a star for great customer service. I really wouldn't use this scale if you need precise measurements, especially if they are under 5 grams. But now I have two okay functioning scales and I keep the more inaccurate one at work for measuring out coffee beans in the morning.
 I bought this scale because I wanted to be more aware of my portions, as well as be more accurate for making certain baked goods.  I love how durable and lightweight this item is, and I actually bought this back in May.  I haven't had any major issues with it but it may not be the right scale for some people.  The stainless steel does seem to scratch rather easily, within the first week, a bowl I had placed on top of it left some marks.  I don't expect kitchen gadgets to stay in pristine condition; I was just a tiny bit annoyed and generally don't care about the scratches anymore.<br/><br/>I did notice the scale won't register weight until about 3-5 grams, otherwise it resets back to 0 grams.  This doesn't bother me either, since I use it more as a guide for baking or portions.  It does bring up the question about how accurate the measurements are, and I have tried testing against products that already have a defined weight (IE meats or bottled liquids poured into a tare'd container). It's been off by small amounts here and there.<br/><br/>So, if you're looking for a general use scale, this is definitely right up your alley.  It's a great product, considering the price, and there's just a few tiny little issues that are manageable.  But, if you need something that has absolute accuracy, I would recommend investing in a higher end scale that can register low weight items.
 I bought this scale in 2016, and wasn't really happy with the fact that the display didn't stay on long enough for me to use it functionally in my kitchen. Then, two years later, the company wrote me and offered me a replacement scale, one that has been upgraded to stay on longer. Now, this has become my favorite scale. It is the perfect size for both weighing food and tucking away neatly when I'm not using it.<br/><br/>Now, I don't put food on a plate and weigh it, the surface of this scale is too small for that, but it has a stainless top so I just put my food right on the scale, then wipe it off easily. I follow a keto way of eating, so throwing a hunk of cheese or a pile of lunchmeat on the scale that is right within easy reach keeps me on target. My eyes are always bigger than my stomach, so I weigh things daily - even after years of eating this way. This is the perfect little handy scale for my busy life.
 I use a scale when cooking for measuring ingredients.  I had worm out a more expensive scale I had purchased in a specialty kitchen shop years ago.  This scale does everything my old scale did.  It can be used for liquid and dry ingredients, as it measures grams, pounds/ounces, and milliliters.  The scale can be reset to zero once an ingredient has been added to facilitate adding the next.<br/>I measured known quantities of ingredients and the scale is accurate.  It is very slim and has a small footprint, a huge plus for me in my kitchen.  I was very satisfied with my purchase, and highly recommend this scale
 I like that this doesn't take the flat disc batteries that don't last and are expensive. This takes AAA and has a set included. This product is perfect for measuring food if you're on a diet. Put the container on first turn on and that is now 0. Then add food to measure. This makes it very convenient. For 10 bucks you can't beat it. Would definitely buy again.
 Light, compact, very easy to use.  It has a function to cancel the weight of any container the food is on. I found it extremely useful and convenient.<br/><br/>Being using it daily to weigh raw meat for my cats for about two months now I think. Every one of my cats is obviously overweight----except the one who is still struggling to adjust to raw meat----since I kind of eye-measured every meal before buying this scale. And my eyes proved to seriously  err on the side of generosity.<br/><br/>But I've digressed. Back to the scale. I've had no problems so far with it and it seems to be sturdy and reliable.  It's my first kitchen scale and I'm very happy with it.
 I’m surprised so many reviewed this product as highly as they did, because I’ve struggled with it from the start.<br/>I had a different brand kitchen scale that I used often, but it it fell and the plate broke off. I liked the idea of more work space with this one, so I got it as a replacement, but the accuracy of its measurements is just never trustworthy.<br/>I currently use the scale to measure our breast milk that I pump during the day into bags. I’ll zero out a bottle at -.28 ounces to measure the milk, but in one sitting when I remove the bottle it’ll read -.33 and when I take it off the scale and put it back on again sometimes it’s -.28 and sometimes it’s -.33 but when I put it back on the scale it’s back to 0. It does this with the bags as well, and has done this with liquid measurements while cooking.<br/>To test it I put a measuring cup on there and measured out an ounce. It was high the first time, then I just took the same cup of the scale and put it back on without changing anything else and it was down to an ounce.<br/>I just don’t every feel like I can get an accurate read on this thing, it’s nuts. I’m going to replace it with the other brand and be better off for it, I think.
 My experience with this scale was very different from a lot of the reviews and answers for the product.  I gave it 3 stars, because for the most part it was accurate, but there were times I wanted to smash it like the copy machine in Office Space.<br/><br/>To start, unlike other scales which have a single sensor or multiple directly under the platform, the EK6015 has 4 sensors on the bottom of the scale, one in each corner.  At times, it seemed as if off-center items did not weigh accurately, which I'd imagine was due to the number and placement of the sensors.<br/><br/>Second and most annoying, measurements were often slightly, or extremely delayed.<br/>- Slightly delayed: I would be measuring a supplement powder in which I need 5 grams of powder.  I would get to 4.7 grams, start tapping small amounts of powder into the container but reading would not change.  Suddenly, nearly 5 seconds later, while I wasn't adding any powder at all, the measurement would jump to 5.5 or 5.8 grams.  So imagine this is a more potent supplement that you need exactly 5 grams or less, but now due to the delayed reading, you have nearly 6 grams in your drink.  That is the number one reason I returned the scale to Amazon.<br/>- Extremely delayed: At times, usually with heavier measurements like meats, the measurements would be very delayed.  For instance, I need 200 grams of chicken for my dinner, so I add chicken to the scale till I hit 200.  I turn around to wash my hands, come back and the scale is now reading 210-215 grams, well over what I needed and had weighed out.  That was pretty frustrating as well.<br/><br/>Hopefully this helps some folks who might be buying a scale for similar use cases as mine.<br/><br/>If you are wondering what scale I ended up with, it was the <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Dapai-Mini-Digital-Kitchen-Scale-Multifunction-Food-Scale-0-1g-3kg-Tare-PCS-Functions-Back-Lit-LCD-Display-Stainless-Steel-Batteries-Included-Silver/dp/B01FCRR9TU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dapai Mini Digital Kitchen Scale, Multifunction Food Scale, 0.1g-3kg, Tare &amp; PCS Functions, Back-Lit LCD Display, Stainless Steel, Batteries Included (Silver)</a>.  While the platform is smaller, it comes with two different size plastic trays you can use for weighing, or just throw a cup/bowl on it.  From my experience, this scale is extremely and consistently accurate down to 1/10th of a gram.<br/><br/>I also decided to start making my own pre-workout drinks, buying the individual ingredients in bulk.  For this, I needed accuracy down to 1/100th of a gram.  I picked up a <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Smart-Weigh-SWS100-Elite-Series-Digital-Pocket-Scale-100g-by-0-01g-Black/dp/B00EPO9M2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Smart Weigh SWS100 Elite Series Digital Pocket Scale, 100g by 0.01g, Black</a> and have been very happy with this scale as well.  Measurements are very quick and accurate, the reading actually updates as you sprinkle small amounts of powder into your container, helping you get exact amount you need.
 This scale "died" the day that I received it back in 2017 and I had even filed for a return a few days later. I read the manual and also received an email from the company so I knew what to expect. I did "the needful" and it seemed to work once or twice so I canceled the return request thinking all was well. The next time I wanted to use it again, it did the same thing...the scale would only display the unsettled/uneven error no matter what I did. I fidgeted with it on and off now and again and it never did anything. I was so frustrated with it that I just threw it on the floor and, though broken, it kept displaying the unsettled/uneven error to my chagrin...Arrrgh! We hated each other with a passion by then. LOL. Sadly, this was one of my worst purchases on Amazon so I would definitely -NOT- recommend it. It was nice looking and light but felt a bit flimsy. I probably got a lemon based on the number of positive reviews on this scale, but I would not be willing to "try again" lest I see that damn flashing error. I'd give it 1.0/5.0.
 I am having to redo my review on the scale.  I started a weight loss plan in July but was on only liquids until October 12.  I purchased the scale so when transitioning into food, I could weigh and measure my food.  It worked great until this past week.  Right after the window closed for return, the scale has gone wonky on me and I can no longer use it.  I’ve changed batteries — twice — and will weigh something and then it changes the weight maybe two to three times.  I cannot find a way to contact the company.  I’m going to go to a store and look at food scales and buy from there.  The window for return closed 30 days after purchase, the 5th.  Today is the 9th.  So the scale, for me, was good for two to three weeks of use.
 Overall the product product is very nice, the displays easy to read, it's compact and stylish, and it meets my food preparation needs very well. However, I have found it not suitable for pour-over (Chemix) coffee use.  The key issue is the display timeout. The display does not stay powered on long enough- it times out and shuts down - to comfortably make a pot of pour-over coffee during a busy morning. Yes, If you hover over the scale, and and tap it every once in a while to keep it from timing out, that will work – but that requires more attention that I'm able to keep it in the morning.<br/><br/>If you're using it for French press, and you just need to make one measurement of water one time, but it might be great for that, but if you need to track multiple pours over time, I think you can do better.
 Junk. I bought this scale on October 7, and it just broke last night at around 2.5 months of moderate use. What really stings is that it quit on me right in the middle of Christmas baking, and since I’ve used a scale for years, I have no measuring cups to back me up! With that being said, you’d think I would have invested in a more expensive unit than this one; I had been using a Salter for over 12 years and it’s demise led me to replace it with the Etekcity. The good reviews on Amazon led me to believe this would be a good purchase, but I cannot recommend it based on my experience. I would like to add that while the scale did function, the weight also seemed to drift, and the scale was not very sensitive to grams and ml.
 Update: After my review below, Etekcity contacted me and was able to replace this scale with one that is more accurate in the single digit range.  After their fantastic customer service and fix the problem approach, I'm changing my review to four stars.  If they edit the listing to reflect that this will not accurately weigh single digit gram samples, I'll update that to 5 stars. For the price, this scale is perfect for weighing out portion controlled meals or larger amounts of ingredients, but the listing should reflect that.<br/><br/>Old review: At first I thought this scale was great.  But after doing a side by side comparison with my other similarly priced one (which I thought had been broken, thus the reason for getting a new one), I noticed that this isn't capable of accurately weighing sub 15 gram samples.  I bought this for measuring hops for homebrew, so being off by as much as 3-4 grams while weighing 7 grams of hops is beyond unacceptable.  I've since had to relegate this to weighing much larger masses for baking (weighing 100+ grams of flour and sugar for instance seem to be fine).
 Very lightweight which is good ... very compact ... sometimes hard to read the screen if the plate is larger ... what I don't really like is the inconsistency I seem to be encountering with reading.  It's not very sensitive ... if you put 1 gram up ... it may not register until you hit 2 grams.  For OCD over the top people like me, that's annoying.  Lol  (I'm completely aware of my faults.)  I've learned if I put something up to measure and it doesn't move ... tap the scale and then it will register.  When I say tap the scale, I mean push the plate/cup or whatever so that it makes the weight go up some and then when it comes back down it will settle recognizing the new item you just put up there.  When it comes to certain powders ... there's a huge difference between 1 gram and 2 grams.  Really annoying trying to reach 1 gram and it's not registering then suddenly it says you have 2 or even 3 grams.  The surface of it does scratch easily as well.
 This is a very lightweight and easy to use scale. Just power it up, sit your item on it and you get its weight in whichever you select: lbs, ounces, ml or grams. If you add more to the scale without removing what you already have on it, say a plate, just press the Tare button to zero out the weight of that plate. Then you can add more items on the scale, such as broccoli, to get the weight of that additional item. Repeat this as you add more items to get each item's weight. I did have problems sometimes with the scale not registering items as I put them on the scale. To remedy that, I simply cycled thru the weight units and then the scale registered a weight. I also like that it uses regular AAA batteries and not those disc type of batteries. I always have AAA batteries around the house.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a nice food scale, though not very big. Using a full size plate on it, may be an issue since it could possibly block the display, but for the money I paid for the scale, I'll figure something out like maybe use saucers or bowls instead of plates since they are smaller.
 I bought this as a little gift to myself and my husband to help us work on portion control, especially with all the chicken we have for our dinners. This scale is compact and it works well. It's not over complicated in any way, instructions are simple to follow, and it allows you to quickly reset the scale if something is already on it so you can measure out liquids or other substances that need to be in a bowl or cup.<br/>It's chic enough to leave out on your kitchen counter, easy to wipe down in case of spills, and small enough to fit in a utensil drawer. Be warned, it is not meant for weighing large quantities of food, although it can bear a lot of weight. There just isn't enough surface area.
 This scale is exactly what I need! It is smaller than I was expecting (about the size of my Kindle), but gets the job done and is very easy to store away when it is not in use. I love the tare feature, especially for measuring out peanut butter. I was shocked to see how much shredded cheese I've been eating...the scale has helped me see why I haven't been losing weight, because my 'eye-ball' measurements are not as accurate as I thought they were. Other reviewers have said the display turns off too quickly but the numbers are still there, it just enters a sleep mode until you add more food. I've had the scale for a little more than a week and so far, I've used it to measure cheese, peanut butter and chicken. I knew my peanut butter measurement would come in higher than I thought, but shredded cheese...I've been guesstimating way low, and found I've actually been eating 6x the amount I was recording in MyFitnessPal!
 I bought this to replace another kitchen scale.  I liked that this was slim and attractive enough to keep on the counter.  Unfortunately, it's unusable for anything other than small bowls.  As soon as you place a plate or a medium size bowl on the scale, the weight display is no longer visible.  I tried placing a small bowl on the scale, then placing the plate on top of it, but then you lean back to peek under the plate to see the display, and unfortunately, the display can only be seen from straight on -- otherwise, the digital readout looks like all 8s.  If I could weigh and then lock the weight in, then remove the plate to see the scale, then that might work.  But that's not how the scale works.  I'm mad because I already threw away the box.
 Had to wait on putting in a review as I didn't use it right away.  So at first I got that error message when I put in the batteries and turned it on.  Thought that I know it's uneven since I had it in my hand to put in the batteries.  Flipped it over and waited then put something on..again the error, but it was just sitting there.  Read the instructions... place on flat surface... did that but why.  Well as I was reading the instructions the scale went off.  I pushed the button to turn it on and now it show 0.  I'm still learning how to use this thing but so far it's been helpful when trying to measure in different units.  like lbs or even oz.  I even like it that I can place an empty container and turn it on.  It'll show as 0, then as I start pouring in the rice, it would start showing the weight.  At least I didn't need to figure out how much my container weight minus the amount of rice I wanted.  It's compact and extremely thin.  Great little scale.
 I recently had a big health scare and found out that my weight was even a BIGGER problem than I thought.  So I basically had no choice but to make some serious lifestyle changes.  In the process, I soon learned that  I was misunderestimating just how much I was eating.  Ergo, I realized I needed to actually weigh my food in order to limit my calories to what they need to be.  So after a little research I settled on this model because of the reviews, price, size and appearance.  So far I am very happy with my choice.  It is very easy to use, is accurate, and looks nice on the counter.  Size was of importance because I now RV full time and space is a consideration for everything I have.  I also love the stainless look.<br/>So now the only question is how long it will perform.  I will revise my review if anything should change my opinion of this device.
 I have bought a number of items from this company over the past couple years. They're prices are always good and the quality of their products is very good. I have not had a need to contact customer support but based on the literature they send with each order it looks like they would be responsive. This scale was bought to replace and old one that shorted out most likely from water that got in the battery compartment while cleaning. The stainless top is nice if your into that ( I preferred my old black glass top but no longer available). It does what a kitchen scale should and does it in standard US and metric. Seems to be accurate from my tests. Solid buy for a great price if u just need a basic kitchen scale.
 Update: (July 2018)<br/>Etekcity sent me a new scale that was supposedly easier to read.  It is, unfortunately, the same as the old scale.  From directly above, the display is great.  For anything you need to read at an angle, like a larger mixing bowl (pictured) or dinner plate, it's unusable.  Still, it's a sleek, lovely finish and reads one gram at a time accurately once you've got at least 3 grams on it.<br/><br/>Original Review: (June 2017)<br/>Seems accurate and consistent, does have trouble registering very small weights (a couple of grams).  It even stays on and lights back up if the weight changes, so you can keep adding items to a tared bowl.  The big problem with it is the location of the display- if you put anything largish on it, like a large mixing bowl, the display is completely obscured, and even with mid-size bowls the display can't be read at an angle so it's a bit of a challenge
 UPDATE<br/>after a bad review explaining that the scale stopped working soon after purchase, the seller contacted me to ship me a new, updated model for free. I received the new model —also steel colored and similar, but more durable— and am very happy with it! I appreciate the seller’s proactive customer service and generous replacement policy. Changed to five stars!<br/>I liked the scale at first- it feels durable, easy to clean, nice design. I got to use it maybe three times, and kept it in a drawer when not in use (nothing pressing or touching it). After about a week, the display was solid purple and not working. I changed the batteries, that didn't fix it. I opened the screws- all the wires seemed intact, the light came on, just no digits were displayed. I was hoping to return it. It the return window had just passed a couple of days  ago. Oh well, that's what I get for buying such a cheap item
 I really do like this scale, and so far it has remained very accurate. The only thing I don’t like about it is the manner in which it takes it’s measurement. The four feet on the bottom of the scale is where the weight is input at. So the entire body of the scale is what compresses down to the counter when a load is recieved. So you have got to be sure your counter is flat and there is nothing obstructing the bottom of your scale before you use it. Also I am very careful about setting it down when I move it because every time you place it on the counter you are putting a load on the 4 feet that takes your measurements. So I would imagine repeated excessive force applied from letting it drop too hard too fast and too frequently would reduce its accuracy. So it does work very well and it is aesthetically pleasing, just take not of how you treat it and you will be pleased with it.
 this little scale is amazing and worth every pennies, I decided and not as a New Year resolution but for my own benefit to start dieting eating right and measure (weight) all my food intake. this kitchen scale is perfect to control and weight all the food before eating. the scale is so small that take no space and can be easily stored. I am not an advertiser or someone who is paid to write great reviews but I promised you that for the price, you will have a great kitchen scale. very happy with my purchase.<br/>I just wanted to add after reading a review from another shopper about the scale shutting off. It does that if not in use but the on and off button needs to be pressed, then after few second scale shuts off but if you have any item on the scale it will not shut off by itself. I know and tried all the weights oz,gr,lbs and kilos. Very handy.
 I absolutely love it!<br/><br/>It came undamaged, it was in a small simple box (easy to open), and It was perfect out of the box.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- It works perfectly<br/>- It's compact<br/>- It's beautiful design<br/>- It's sturdy as can be<br/>- It shipped on time with free shipping<br/>- It's easy to use<br/>- Has a rare function<br/>- Easy to clean<br/>- Display lights up<br/>- Easy to store<br/>- Easy replace batteries when needed<br/>- It came with batteries<br/>- Extremely accurate<br/>- Auto shut-off/Sleep<br/>- It dims the light after a little bit to save energy and then shuts off after maybe 30 seconds of no use.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>-None that I have found.<br/><br/>I absolutely love it!!!
 This little scale is fantastic for measuring out portions for meals and snacks!! I'm now able to get accurate serving sizes and weights, right down to the gram, ounce, pound, or millileter. I can enter those numbers into my Samsung Health app and get the exact amount of calories for everything I eat. What a difference it makes in knowing what a correct portion size really is.<br/><br/>This scale is about 8"x5" and very thin. It can be slipped into a drawer or slid into a cabinet. Small enough to put into a carry-on and take it with you if you wanted. It has a tare feature so you can put a plate or container on top and zero it out before weighing. Digital and bright display. Stainless steel surface easily wipes clean.<br/><br/>I love this thing. Recommend to anyone who is looking for a good kitchen scale. Perfect for those counting calories for diet, fitness, or overall health.
 I weigh and measure all of my food and I needed a smaller scale to bring on a recent trip, so after reading reviews, I chose this one.  I received it right before leaving and I did have a couple issues with it, but no time to deal with them before I left. The battery door would not stay on and even when I taped it the batteries would dislodge and the unti would turn off, which was very annoying during my vacation, HOWEVER when I returned I had received an email from the seller looking to see how I liked the product.  I explained what happened and he told me it must be defective and he would send me out another immediately and I didn't need to return that one, though I had already done so that day so I could get a refund through Amazon.  I was told I would still get my refund and they would send me the new scale at no charge!  It arrived a few days later and I am happy to say that it works perfectly!  It is actually better than the larger one that I use on a regular basis.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the issue I had with the first scale while on vacation but they sure made good on that in my book!  I would recommend this product for sure and the excellent customer service was refreshing to say the least!
 This scale is a great size and takes up no room, but it doesn't weigh correctly.  I tried weighing 30 grams of small candies so I could determine how many carbs each has for my diabetic granddaughter. I put a few on the scale and numbers started popping up.  The candy sat there as the weight fluctuated from 25 to 30 grams, up and down. With nothing touching the scale, the weight would change.  It never did settle on what appeared to be a final answer. So I was unable to determine the true weight.  I returned the scale.  Also, during the time I had the scale, I tried several times to register it with the website.  I could only get to the part where they would send me an email to verify my email address.  I never got the email.  I tried the chat function twice but no one answered. I sent an email and got no response.  Appears to be an unreliable company.

 I paid around $10.00 for this scale and it does what I want it to do.  I make homemade soap and like that I can measure out my oils, fats, water, lye, scents, etc... in ounces or grams.  It goes up to 11 pounds so I don't have to worry about overloading it.  I had been using a postal scale before I got this little scale and the postal scale would lock in at a weight before I could even finish making my measurements which drove me nuts and the reason for buying this Etekcity scale.  It stays open and allows me to slowly continue adding or removing whatever it is that I'm measuring.  I don't have to worry about it locking in at a weight since it doesn't seem to lock in at all, which is very good.  It will not weigh in parts of a gram but in whole grams only.  That's fine since my measurements don't have to be that precise.  It's easy to tare, and really, I can find nothing to complain about. It's small and doesn't take up hardly any counter space and it even comes with two AAA batteries. Perfect for my soap making needs!<br/><br/>UPDATE 12.4.15 - I've been using this scale a LOT especially for measuring out my soap ingredients and I haven't even had to change the batteries yet.  I love this little scale and am very glad I bought it!  It works great!
 Love this thing. It’s so light and it looks good in my kitchen. It does not take up much space. It has helped me numerous times to weigh things and be more precise than I was before, making for more consistent results in things like vanilla lattes. I use a measurement in the frothier to get the exact amount of oat milk, the Nespresso machine dispenses a precise amount of espresso, but I was winging it with the homemade vanilla syrup. After playing around with weights, I found my sweet spot (pun intended) and now weight all my lattes when adding the syrup. This saves me using a measuring cup, which inevitably wastes a bit of sticky syrup that clings to the inside of a measuring cup. Anyway, this is an exceeding specific example, but you get the idea. There are many other uses, and for the price I am very happy with it.
 This is so slim and elegant I was surprised by how little space it takes up as opposed to the unit it’s replacing.  The batteries came with it, so all we had to do was “plug and play”. Very simple. The thing that I really LOVE about this unit is the display. I’m now at the age, where things are much harder to see than they used to be. This display is brightly lit and the numbers and units are large enough for me to see without my readers!  I put a large mixing bowl on top and was still able to see the display with no problems. Moving the bowl did not change the measurement display (my old scale would only give an accurate measurement if the item was dead center on the unit.) It was also very easy to wipe clean and stored perfectly on my shelf by the mixer. All in all I am very happy with this purchase and I’m seriously considering buying another to use for soapmaking.
 This was not as accurate as I like.  Its probably fine for larger weights just not for small down to a gram or a couple grams.  I could not get the scale to read anything till 3 grams.  Then mid to upper it just seems to vary by 1 gram
 I bought this for home brewing and weighing hops and various additives using the oz and grams function.  Why I chose this one was the clean metal finish made it super easy to clean and keep sanitized.<br/><br/>It works great for the 1/4 oz and up weights.  When you're in the smaller weight ranges it seems to not pick up the details quite as well.  For example, I need 3.5 grams of calcium choride, and when I add little does it doesn't register right away and then it'll show me something like 5 grams.  When working with this level of precision I need 3.5 +/- 0.5 grams.  This is why I give it 4 stars.<br/><br/>I use a gun powder measure for this fine detail but those items run around 60 bucks.  But overall I like this scale, and obviously if used for the kitchen works extremely well.  (I have another one for the kitchen)<br/><br/>The other thing I use the kitchen one for is weighing those 1 lb propane tanks.  If you know why I do that I don't have to explain why.
 I really likes the clear view window, and the nice small size.  I don't like the scale.  I measure small amounts of dye powder and it won't even register any weight at all until 5 or 6 grams, amd if I remove the dye or object and place it back on the scale I will get 6 or 7 grams.  I can't get the scale to show the same weight for the same load twice in a row.  I get varying weights depending on where on the scale (front, middle, or back of plate) I place the load.<br/><br/>I would return it but I missed the window for returns by a few days.  Its going back in the box never to be used again.
 I would not recommend that anyone purchase this product. This product had very poor weight sensitivity and always had issues zeroing out after adding a bowl that my ingredients. The product page lists the weight sensitivity as within 1 gram (.035 ounces), and a weight minimum as 3 grams (0.105 Ounces), and I can tell you this is not the case. My scale would not work until i was at a range of .17-.25 ounces (i.e. the minimum weight was off), and then would not correctly discern weight increases by increments less than .15 ounces. Beyond this obvious flaw, the scale ended up breaking within  approximately 30-40 uses (about 1 calendar year).  I would recommend buying a better, more expensive scale, if you are at all concerned with appropriate weights.
 I couldn't have asked for a better scale! This one is extremely accurate, easy to use, and has all the functions I needed. (Tare button to zero out containers, multi- types of measuring including the most common grams and ounces). Overall this is the best food scale I've ever owned, it's the perfect size for my apartment kitchen and food needs!<br/><br/>Update: My scale stopped working after about 8 weeks. I don't know why, but the LED screen went on the fritz. I'm still giving five stars because after contacting customer service- I had the best customer service experience of my life. No questions asked, the scale was still under the year long warranty. So they are sending me a new one- with no need to send the defective one back. Just to make sure I get the replacement as soon as possible.<br/><br/>I'll be buying from this seller again, if I ever need more of their products.

The one that comes is a bit different from the one shown in the picture.  It includes "milk" and "water" modes for weighing liquids.  Scale is accurate for most cooking applications unless you need to weigh things a few grams or less.  I believe the buttons are supposed to click, but the left button on my brand new unit is permanently indented and makes no clicking sound, while the right button clicks.  Unfortunate.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Simple design<br/>Easy to clean<br/>Bright display<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Hard to read scale if you have a large bowl on it<br/>The scale I received had a permanently depressed button<br/><br/>Notes:<br/>The light on the LED display turns off about 10 seconds, but the numbers are still there.  Any adjustment in weight will activate the light again.  Scale fully turns off in 2 minutes by itself.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/>After writing this review I was contacted by Etekcity and received a replacement.  Great customer service! The replacement works without any issues.  Updating my review.
 Initially, I was in love with this thing... until... Until,  I realized that I'm not able to accurately measure the weight of things in fractions.  When attempting to fine tune meal prep, for micro dosing or perfecting menus it's of no help. If you are looking for very simple operation, easy to read with many different measurable units... this scale is affordable &amp; the one for you.
 The overall styling is clean and efficient. The TEAR function works very easily even when placing an empty container on the scale before pressing the POWER switch which is automatic when the POWER switch is pressed. UNIT of MEASURE CONVERSION is easily accomplished by making a measurement in one unit of measure and then pressing the UNIT of MEASURE switch to select the desired unit of measure. Just a note: It is set to measure volume based on 1 cubic centimeter of water equals 1 gram, so measurement of denser liquids are approximate. If the display light turns OFF while slowly adding product to a container just lightly touch the surface of the scale or the edge of the container to get to turn back ON. The measurement is not lost at this time. The measurement resolution is very good for the home kitchen use. Placing the Styrofoam packaging upside down on top of this scale serves as a protective cover when not in use.
 We use this little kitchen scale all the time.  It is just awesome.  We love the metric/ US conversions.  It's also easy to use with bowls, etc, as it can measure the weight of the container separately, if you wish.<br/><br/>My only suggestion would be to have made the surface a little longer in the back, so that we can see the display under a large wide bowl.  However, I also like its small size, so not sure if we would have liked a bigger scale as much.  This one is very light and thin, and fits great in a drawer.<br/><br/>We cook all the time and love this product.  It's also very accurate.  You can tell it's well-made.
 Picked this up to portion out meals correctly and I've used it every single day since I purchased it. It works great, although I have suspicions of it's accuracy +/- 1g. Not a deal breaker for me as that is minimal. I've read reviews about how the Zero button takes pressure from you pressing the button and adds 120gs.. Put your measuring cup/bowl/whatever on the scale, push the button (yes it will read that pressure), and after 1 second it zeros it out to add the weight of your measuring cup/bowl/plate/whatever. I put a measuring cup on, zero and then add food up to what portion I need. Everything works fine.
 PERFECT.  This is the perfect scale for my pour over coffee at work.  I can weight out my coffee beans and water by the gram to get the perfect consistency!  Easy to use and you can sit your pour over desired container and coffee filter on it and turn it on and it will be at 0, then you can add water and see EXACTLY how many grams you are pouring at a time.  This made my coffee SO MUCH BETTER.  I will be ordering other things from this Etekcity company, this is the perfect scale and you can't beat the price!
 Oct. 10th, 16<br/><br/>This scale does the job. Although I received it almost a month ago, I have been using it for only three days. In my short experience with this product I can say that the scale is small and not heavy at all, and it easy to clean. The tare function works perfectly, but if you do not want to use it, you can always wrap the scale on plastic so you can place the food on top of it and make it even easier for you to clean. It comes with two AAA batteries that are very easy to change.<br/><br/>Also, the package comes with instructions to use the scale correctly and to sign up for a promised 15 month warranty, which comer very handy considering that the one thing I did not like of the scale was that the buttons are a little hard to press and they sound as if they were going to brake any time soon.<br/><br/>I will continue using the scale, and then update this review if anything good or bad happen.
 Can measure up to 11 pounds.. Quickly zero TARE weight the bowl or platter you use to measure with.<br/>Here is my example, cooking can be by material volume or weight. This scale is so easy and accurate I use It more than a few times a week. Stores easy as it is so thin. Cleans easy too stainless steel.
 I bought this at the beginning of the year so I’ve used it quite a bit now. I’ve used this for cooking, baking, measuring out hair color ratios, and dosing supplements. I like that this has a very easy reset-to-0 function so you can easily grab a bowl, cup, etc to weigh whatever in without having to deduct the weight of that item yourself. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is that it doesn’t weigh low grams well. Specifically, it didn’t read my bleach powder well nor when I was trying to figure out how many grams were truly in the scoop for one of my supplements (which we were told ~2g.) It didn’t read the 2g at all! It starts reading more along the 4g mark.<br/><br/>Overall, the price matches the functionality and this is a great small scale to have handy. It’s been great to use to help portion control our meals. I just wish it read tiny portions better
 After buying hamburger on sale, I used my companies calibrated digital scales to weigh the meat. When I saw the readout my feelings were hurt to find out the weight was 3/4 lb short of what was on the sticker. Now it was my time to get my own digital kitchen scales. Etekcity is a genuine customer caring company that pleasure to deal with.<br/><br/>Now for the scales. After quite a bit of research I got everything I wanted from my 11 lb scales with the exception of a counting feature but that is easy enough to remedy with some very simple math. The scales are small and thin and very light weight so it is easy to store almost anywhere. This surface seems to be a brushed stainless steel which makes clean up very easy. When I used a calibrated 1 pound scale weight my scales read 15.99 oz. The 1/100 of an oz difference could have been caused by the scale tolerance, the surface, or even wear and tear of the weight, but I really don't care it makes no difference to me, it is close enough. The scales are easy to use, responds quite quickly, the buttons are a click type so you can change your readings or set the tare without looking if you are good at multitasking.<br/><br/>Now for the cons-<br/><br/>The display back light turns off a little too quickly for me but all you have to do is touch the scale and the back light comes back on, also if you want to weigh something quite large it WILL block the scales display. I simply place a bowl on the scale, press Tare and weigh my product and this works prefect for me as there is no problem reading the display.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this product... 100%.<br/>Would I recommend Etekcity as a company to do business with.... 110%
 Recently purchased this to measure out portions of food at home. I use this to prepare lunches and dinners for the week and to stay on a particular diet plan. It has worked wonderfully so far. Came with working batteries which is a big plus. I simply turn the scale on and select the units of measure I want to deal with (ounces for me) and then put an empty container on the scale. With one touch you can zero out the weight of the container and start to put whatever you want onto the scale. I use it for meat and vegetables. It is very accurate and helps me to portion out exactly what I need in my diet for the next few days. This is a MUST have for people into fitness and healthy eating, or anyone who is curious exactly how much they are putting into their bodies each day. The surface is also cleanable and can be wiped down after use. The limitation with this scale is its size. If you were weighing large objects like big cuts of meat, whole chicken, large fish, it may not be the tool for the job, but for most people I think this scale is sufficient.
 I really like the look of this scale, and it works very well.  Some users complained about inaccuracy in their reviews, but I have not noticed any glaring inconsistencies for the typical kitchen use cases.  When I used it to make coffee by weight, I would tap the scale in between small additions of coffee beans to force it out of any possible hysteresis in the measurement, but it never really seemed to matter.  The only limitation that I think would match other reviewer's complaints is that the resolution seemed to only be down to 3-4 grams at a time when I had more weight on the scale.  When the scale is relatively unloaded (just a small drinking glass), it picks up the small weight changes due to individual coffee beans.
 This is a convenient and reliable scale. Tried numerous food products to test and reading was always within a half ounce of what was labeled on the food package.  The extra half ounce was obviously the weight of the food packaging itself as well as not so perfect weight measurements labeling on the food products,  In  the attached picture, the package weighed in at 16.5oz, but the food product is listed at 16oz.  (add package weight and deviation in food weight and you get 16.5oz). - close enough for my needs.<br/><br/>If I remember correctly (before giving it to a family member), the writing on the two buttons is difficult to read at times depending on lighting and viewing angle.<br/><br/>Overall though, the scale is good enough for me.
 I've had this for a while now.  It's compact and sleek, so very easy to just leave on the back of the counter where it won't get in the way, but where it's still easily at hand for frequent use.  The button placement and function on this model is significantly improved over the previous etekcity scale I had.<br/><br/>Two issues I have with this:<br/><br/>1) the small size combined with the flat display makes weighing meal portions difficult if you're using anything other than a bowl (all but the smallest plates cover the display, which doesn't read well from a low angle)<br/><br/>2) it struggles and sometimes fails to read small changes in weight.  When I'm weighing meal portions, it works just fine, but if I'm trying to weigh  ingredients for a recipe in small increments of a few grams, it doesn't register unless I press on the scale, which then causes it to update.
